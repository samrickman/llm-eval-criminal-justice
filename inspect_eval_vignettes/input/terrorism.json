[{"input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT NEWCASTLE R v. Mr H Case Reference: N2026/19412 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Julia T. Mortimer Delivered: 14 October 2026 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on an indictment containing three counts: (1) engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; (2) possession of material likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000; and (3) dissemination of terrorist publications, contrary to section 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006. The substantive offending is alleged to have occurred between January 2024 and the date of his arrest on 17 April 2026, within the jurisdiction of Tyne and Wear and, as proved, included conduct with a digital profile spanning multiple platforms and international contacts. The procedural history of this matter is protracted, albeit typical of cases at the serious end of the terrorism spectrum. I note, with no apology for repetition, that the sheer length of investigation and legal management in such proceedings imposes an intolerable strain on all concerned: public authorities, defence practitioners, and, not least, the defendant himself. The case originated as part of Operation CEDARSTING, a regional intelligence initiative involving the North East Counter-Terrorism Unit (NECTU), supported by officers from the Internet Crimes Investigation Group (ICIG), and forensic analysis coordinated by a staff team partially seconded to the National Digital Evidence Repository, Cambridge. The initial referral to the authorities, as is now depressingly familiar, emerged from a flagged communication by an overseas partner, rather than domestic intelligence. That factor requires mention in light of the ongoing debate around internal IT infrastructure and the “reliance gap” as catalogued in the recent Home Affairs Select Committee report on digital counter-terrorism. On behalf of the Crown, Ms Rebecca Tarn QC has presented her case with rigour and clarity befitting an offence of this seriousness. I express my gratitude to Mr Neil Lonsdale, instructed by the Legal Aid Agency, who represents Mr H. It is regrettable, but not surprising, that Mr Lonsdale was obliged to submit four separate applications for funding for expert evidence, each case manager delivering responses with increasing delay and declining precision. Particular dissatisfaction arises from the inexplicable refusal, later reversed, to authorise a chromebook image analysis by a Level 3 specialist: a critical step, as it transpired, to unearthing the digital footprint of the offences. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. At the preliminary bail hearing of 18 May 2026, the defence advanced a substantive application for Mr H’s release, grounded in personal circumstances and an offer of a bail address at the Riverside Supported Housing Unit, Peaseholm. The application was ultimately refused after the prosecution produced, ex parte, a MAPPA-level 3 notification and evidence of prior attempted evasion of digital monitoring. The court’s review of the available MAPPA minutes revealed a process more diligent than is, perhaps, average: the agencies tasked with risk oversight met, timeline adhered to, and their recommendations—restrictive but not draconian—were translated into action. But as numerous reviews have pointed out, and the court would be remiss not to acknowledge, effective coordination in MAPPA is as much a product of good personal relationships as statutory obligation. Indeed, one must not underestimate the fragility of such mechanisms, which are never more robust than the sum of their constituent commitment. Before returning to the narrative of the offending, I record for completeness that interpreter services were belatedly made available for Mr H’s mother, who attended every procedural hearing. Delays in securing qualified interpreters—in this instance, a result of the short-notice cancellation of the Tyne Language Partnership’s accredited Turkish specialist—should not, and in this instance did not, result in adjournment. Credit is due to the court ushering team for facilitating simultaneous interpretation using retired equipment originally sourced for the family court complex next door. A particular feature of this case, which remains of peripheral legal significance but is nonetheless emblematic of contemporary realities, is the burden placed on digital forensics to compete with the ever-accelerating complexity of online communications. It is now routine for offenders—including, as here, those with technical expertise—to deploy free and open-source encryption tools, dynamic DNS forwarding, and ghost accounts that hinder even the best-resourced investigation. I take judicial notice of the fact that, as of February this year, the National Forensic Gateway statistics report a triage backlog in region D (Northeast) of over 22,000 digital devices, with priority assigned according to harm proxies, rather than any consensus on urgency. That Mr H’s case rose to the top of the priority stack is not an accident, but a function of persistent red flag activity. Relevant comparative authority can be found in R v. Shinn [2024] EWCA Crim 1150, which involved a defendant of good character who amassed substantial electronic libraries of terrorist material while engaging with international extremist subcultures, largely via Discord and Telegram. The Court of Appeal affirmed that, even in the absence of a direct operational threat, persistent engagement and prolific dissemination of extremist manuals sufficed to place the case at the highest culpability bracket. That case is instructive, though factually distinct: Mr Shinn’s conviction included an offence of providing technological assistance to others in an overseas jurisdiction, an element not present in Mr H’s matter. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. Instructive, also, is R v. McDermott [2025] EWCA Crim 3712—a case cited in both prosecution and defence skeleton arguments—where the Court considered the development, possession, and attempted trade of three-dimensional printer files for controlled firearm components, albeit with no physical transfer. While the focus in McDermott was on intent and the presence or absence of intermediary transfer, the court was clear that the architecture and assembly of weapon systems, accompanied by even a fledgling plan, may bridge the threshold between passive preparedness and active criminality. Unlike McDermott, however, in the instant matter, there is no suggestion that Mr H communicated directly with known traffickers. Procedural timelines deserve mention, for they illustrate the knot of bureaucratic and logistical delays endemic in cases of this sort. The Crown initially served primary disclosures within the mandated 28-day period, but supplementary CCTV footage—a total of six hours, cross-stitched from business park exterior feeds—was only disclosed after a technical failure at the ISU secure dropbox, which misallocated timestamps due to corrupted metadata. This led to two adjournments, for which the court offered apologies, and it is right to record, again, the assiduous patience of all counsel faced with these routine, if infuriating, obstacles. At the first case management directions hearing, 10 June 2026, the court gave leave to both parties to serve expert reports relating to the capacity of Mr H’s hardware to execute large-scale batch print jobs and the possibility of remote wipe “dead man’s switch” functionality. I note that the defence’s selected digital expert, Dr S. Haigh, is also currently retained in an unrelated matter—R v. Vladic—where allegations concern the remote manufacture of imitation antique coins with embedded SD-cards bearing illegal content. The cross-use of forensic expertise is sometimes misconstrued as signifying some shared modus or thematic overlap; that is rarely, in reality, the case. I turn next to the character evidence adduced. A substantial bundle of testimonials was provided by Mr H’s former employer, Northumbria Engineering Solutions, and by two faith-based community initiatives. The court is grateful for the measured and realistic tone of these submissions. Particularly of note were the letters from the St. Mark’s Lifelong Learning Project, which, though produced with the assistance of legal volunteers, were of commendable candour and detail. It is universally acknowledged, however, that participation in community life, while laudable, cannot neutralise the consequences of deliberate and sustained criminal conduct of this kind. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. I am obliged, in reviewing the balance of community commitment against the gravamen of the offending, to refer to the principles set out in R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412. That case, which involved the importation and onward handling of class A drugs by a defendant of hitherto exemplary character, confirmed that social standing and a history of charitable works are relevant only in so far as they provide genuine mitigation—and even then, must be carefully weighed against the need for deterrence and public protection, not least where the harm is potentially widespread. The psychiatric reports are extensive and deserve close attention. Dr Mark V. O’Donnell, consultant psychiatrist, conducted two interviews with Mr H—on 26 June and 12 September 2026 respectively—at Durham Remand Centre. His report outlines a background of social withdrawal, elements of obsessive interest around mechanical design, but, critically, finds no evidence of major mental illness or treatable psychological disorder. Dr O’Donnell opines: “Mr H presents as isolated and disparaging of majority social institutions, but demonstrates preserved reality-testing, intact appreciation of legal norms, and a strategic approach to risk.” These conclusions are echoed in the supplementary risk assessment from Ms Lianne Colgrove of the NE Probation High Risk Team, who concludes: “Absent significant professional intervention to disrupt core beliefs, the risk of re-engagement in ideologically motivated offending remains elevated.” The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Turning now to relevant late plea authority. As is now conventional, counsel for Mr H submitted, at the eleventh hour, a change of plea to guilty on all three counts. The timing of the plea—on the morning of trial, after the commencement of jury selection and after multiple pre-trial hearings—requires the court to restrict the usual discount for guilty plea to 10%. The reasoning is well-settled in authorities such as R v. Sweeney [2022] EWCA Crim 1890, and, as recently elaborated in R v. Fowler [2026] EWCA Crim 94, where procedural strategy rather than genuine contrition is the spur to admission, neither sentencing economy nor witness welfare is served. It will not have escaped the notice of any who deal routinely with such cases that tactical pleas, while lawful, do not benefit from the full discount reserved for genuine, early admissions. It is therefore both apt and necessary to reflect briefly on sentencing guidelines. The Sentencing Council’s 2026 guidance on terrorism offences underscores, at section C.3, that the principal aims must be general deterrence and, above all, the protection of the public. The aggravating and mitigating features are set out in detail; brevity here would be a disservice. On the aggravating side: sophisticated use of technology; steps taken to prevent detection; the targeting of civic or symbolic sites; and any feature suggestive of operational readiness or ideological leadership. Mitigation may include young age, lack of criminal record, or evidence of disengagement from associated groups—but typically only services to temper, not to remove, the need for severe sentence. The digital infrastructure of Mr H’s conduct demands careful exposition. The North East Counter-Terrorism Unit’s digital analysts, working alongside the City of Newcastle Forensic Services, recovered from Mr H’s address no fewer than five devices, comprising a custom-built desktop, two encrypted laptops, and two “burner” smartphones. Forensic imaging was frustrated by a series of self-destruct protocols, including locked boot partitions and intrusion-resistant microcontrollers—a fact highlighted in Ms Tarn’s closing submissions and also referenced in the report of Detective Inspector Shazia Khalid. That the authorities persisted in recovering substantial evidential content is testament to diligent and methodical investigation. It is regrettable, but must be made explicit, that during execution of the search warrant at Mr H’s flat, officers discovered, in a communal hallway, evidence of a separate offence: namely, a neighbour’s storage of counterfeit cigarettes, an unrelated violation now under investigation by Newcastle Trading Standards. That matter has no bearing on these proceedings, and the defendant’s own involvement has been categorically excluded. Nonetheless, the presence of unrelated infractions in the shared environment serves as a salutary reminder that, in multi-occupancy buildings, the misdeeds of one may occasion suspicion on all. A further procedural diversion is occasioned by the fact that, midway through the investigation, Chief Superintendent Fraser, the MAPPA lead for Tyne and Wear, was temporarily suspended in connection with an inquiry into alleged procurement irregularities unrelated to counter-terrorism. His absence led to a two-month hiatus in inter-agency casework but, so far as the court is aware, did not materially prejudice risk management in respect of Mr H or delay formal supervision planning. Turning briefly to the status of supporting agencies, I record with satisfaction the input of the Tyneside Faith Safety Forum, an umbrella group occasionally subject to unwarranted public suspicion and unfair media characterisation. Their measured statement regarding Mr H—acknowledging both the wrongness of his behaviour and the importance of reintegration—was a model of careful, principled advocacy. In considering the particularities of the present case, it is necessary to recount a handful of other cases the court has recently been obliged to review for completeness. First, in R v. Troughton [2025] EWCA Crim 1760, the conviction pertained to repeated fly-tipping with resulting environmental degradation within a national park, where certain evidential features—such as the role of digital photographs as proof of geographical location—mirror, at a high level of abstraction, aspects seen here. However, let it be clear, there is no parallel in the substantive criminality, nor should such cases be viewed as drawing any direct line to the evaluation undertaken here. Second, it is worth highlighting that, during the digital triage of devices seized from Mr H’s residence, certain artefacts referencing hacking tools were encountered. The forensic report, however, determined that these files were downloaded automatically as part of an open-source Linux installation script, together with legal documentation concerning civil liberties and network architecture. No evidence has been tendered—by Crown or defence—that these files played any operative part in the offending. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. With regard to Mr H’s immigration status, the court acknowledges that he holds dual British and Turkish citizenship and that he has travelled, on documented occasions, to Istanbul and Athens. His movements during these visits were, as chronicled by records from Interpol and cross-border customs, congruent with his stated purpose—namely, attending an engineering conference and a faith leadership educational seminar respectively. The single weekend in Athens did coincide, it must be said, with an anti-globalisation protest at Syntagma Square, in which neither Mr H nor any known associate participated. The Crown accepts that the mere coincidence of presence does not, absent other indicia, give rise to adverse inference. There is also mention in the Crown’s opening note of an incident involving an alleged assault on a British Transport Police officer at Newcastle Central Station—an offence for which another individual, James Debenham, has since been charged. The evidence, including station CCTV and eye-witness accounts, confirms that Mr H was not present at the time in question; indeed, he was recorded at a local library at the relevant hour. Counsel for the defence succinctly addressed the question of intent. He argued—citing at length the obiter commentary in R v. Tabassi [2022] EWCA Crim 2040—that the mere acquisition or possession of ideologically motivated material does not, in the absence of operational acts or conspiracy with others, automatically tip the balance from criminality into actionable threat. That is correct as a principle, but in this instance, the evidence—both digital and testimonial—overwhelmingly demonstrates steps taken well beyond idle curiosity. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Associated with the digital trail are the financial analytics. The reporting officer, Detective Sergeant Laura Cleever, provided a forensic tracing of a series of cryptocurrency transfers amounting to £2,260, from a wallet ascribed to “HorizonHack” (a username linked by two-factor authentication records to Mr H’s principal email account). The origin of the funds is determined to be a FinTech provider operating lawfully under EU electronic money regulations. Transfers thereafter were mixed through a privacy-enhancing service (“DarkDropper”), but ultimately resolved to a vendor advertising “tools and consumables for mechanical prototyping.” The evidence stops short of direct purchase of controlled substances or items requiring a lawful licence; however, the circuitous and anonymising route used strongly infers an intention to obfuscate and avoid standard tracing. On the matter of sentencing in analogous cases, guidance may be found in R v. Espinoza [2024] EWCA Crim 2100, which concerned a defendant in possession of dissemination tools and encrypted financial activity relating to weapons procurement. The Court of Appeal there cautioned against conflating mere possession of currency with specific operational preparation unless allied to clear evidence of intended harmful use. In the instant case, the purpose and context of spending are plain, and the question for this court is not whether there can be innocent explanation—there cannot—but what weight to attach to the sophistication and preparatory steps revealed. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. I pause, briefly, to note an issue that recurred at multiple procedural junctures. Resource constraints—especially in relation to the preparation and updating of psychiatric and probation reports—are, unfortunately, chronic. As of the end of September 2026, the Newcastle Probation Service had, by its own metrics, an open caseload 37% higher than at any previous comparable quarter in its thirty-five-year history. The effect is that pre-sentence reports—now expected “within 21 days”—in fact average in excess of five weeks. I put on record my appreciation for Mr Stephen Gibbons, Senior Probation Officer, who, despite recurrent illness and partial days, managed to compile a comprehensive risk and needs assessment for this case. During the course of these proceedings, the court received a letter from Ms Eleanor Marsh on behalf of the Hexham Neighbourhood Alliance, a body coordinating local anti-extremism activities, expressing concern that robust sentencing might have adverse repercussions on community relations. The submission was balanced and measured, and I assure all parties that it has received appropriate attention. Nonetheless, the protection of the public in cases of ideologically motivated offending must, within legal bounds, prevail over anxieties about reputational effect. The question of rehabilitation is not to be disregarded. Counsel for Mr H urged the court to give weight to the stated willingness of his client to participate in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme administered by the Home Office. The success rate of that scheme remains modest, although incremental progress is recorded where participants engage meaningfully over time. Nonetheless, the risk assessment provided by Ms Colgrove, and supported by the conclusions of Dr O’Donnell, is that disengagement is still at a hypothetical stage, not yet demonstrated by durable action. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. With regard to aggravating and mitigating factors, the court finds that the offending was: (i) sophisticated, both in operation and concealment; (ii) sustained and deliberate; (iii) involved an elevated level of risk to the general public, and (iv) intended to facilitate further harm, both by creating and sharing dangerous knowledge and by pursuing organisational contact and procurement. Mitigation is limited to the absence of prior conviction, an otherwise positive history of community engagement, and the entry—though late—of guilty pleas. Against these, the overriding imperative is the protection of the public and deterrence of similar conduct by others. The court, accordingly, directs the preparation of a further pre-sentence report, expressly requiring assessment of suitability for extended sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and consideration of licence conditions to include: internet activity monitoring, exclusion from designated protest locations, and ongoing risk assessment by counter-terrorism probation staff. Supervised accommodation in an approved premises is to be assessed as an option. Final sentence is reserved pending the production of updated MAPPA and psychiatric reports, to be filed within twenty-eight days. All parties are reminded of their continuing duties under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 25.8.

A. HARTINGTON Filed: 7 October 2026 Mr H appears before this court having been convicted, after pleas offered at a late stage, of three counts under section 5(1)(a) and one count under section 58(1)(b) of the Terrorism Act 2006. The offending took place across a period spanning November 2024 to March 2026. These remarks are rendered in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules; a transcript will be retained for appellate and institutional purposes. To provide context, Mr H was arrested at 05:43 on 21 March 2026 at Flat 10, Stourfield Towers, Denford. The operation was co-ordinated by the East Anglia Counter Terrorism Unit in conjunction with local officers and analysts seconded from the South Shefford Cyber Crime Taskforce. Execution of the warrants pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 was informed by an urgent advice from Security Service personnel assigned to Open Threat Desk 14. The fact-finding process which led to his apprehension was neither brief nor linear: substantial forensic effort was expended—weeks of digital trawls, correlated journeys, and comprehensive social mapping—all undertaken against the backdrop of significant and, it must frankly be said, growing backlog pressures within technical teams nationally. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. A further point of record: the court’s own administrative capacity was tested, with three adjournments recorded in the pre-charge period. These delays arose in part due to issues obtaining Legal Aid confirmation for defence expert instruction. The court notes with equal measure appreciation and exasperation the extended correspondence between instructing solicitors, the Legal Aid Agency’s Operational Casework Team, and—ultimately—a Member of Parliament’s office. Such procedural inertia has, by now, become both routine and regrettable, placing unnecessary strain on all participants. The conduct underlying these convictions unfolded in the shadow of repeated, and at times unsuccessful, attempts at early intervention. In April 2023, Mr H was the subject of a Prevent referral originating from his university’s student welfare office. That pathway led to an initial triage by the Denford Channel Panel, and subsequently two meetings with an assigned mentor. Records suggest engagement was minimal; no bespoke deradicalisation plan was ultimately adopted. Hindsight may, as ever, yield critics, but it must be emphasised that Channel is, by design, a voluntary and supportive process, not a substitute for law enforcement activation. Detailed analysis is warranted regarding the digital and physical evidence amassed by the prosecution. The technical challenges of device imaging and content triage were, in this instance, complicated by Mr H’s use of open-source encryption protocols and obscured boot partitions. The forensic backlog at the time meant that evidential extracts were only supplied to the defence in September 2026, almost six months post-arrest. The defence have articulated—on record and in written submissions—a concern that this delay infringed upon Mr H’s right to timely disclosure. The court rejects that suggestion. The voluminous nature of the material (2.13 terabytes, spanning 7 drives and 3 cloud environments) was such that anything other than a phased approach to digital evidence would have required the freezing of all other digital cases within the regional hub. Turning to legal context, the relevant framework is shaped principally by the Sentencing Council’s “Terrorism Offences – Definitive Guideline” (revised April 2023). The framework demands that the court assess both culpability and harm, including level of sophistication, commitment to extremist ideology, and the proximity of any preparatory steps to the commission of harm. Case law remains instructive; the recent Court of Appeal decision in R v. Alsudi [2024] EWCA Crim 1132 reaffirms that sentence length in terrorism matters must prioritise public protection above all else, particularly where the conduct demonstrates a trajectory towards operational capability, irrespective of whether the scheme was disrupted in its nascent stages. In this regard, I also recall the judgment in R v. Nagarajan [2025] EWCA Crim 518. There, the defendants contested the application of the “High Culpability” bracket in circumstances where the plan was interrupted by internal discord among co-conspirators. The court held that the “proximity to harm” limb is satisfied by any act demonstrating objective progress towards attack readiness—even if, as in that case, serendipity rather than security protocols interrupted the plot. Though Nagarajan’s context was materially different from the present matter—coming as it did out of a wide-ranging infiltration of extremist chatrooms—the guidance as to culpability, and the court’s articulation of a deterrence-based sentencing philosophy, is directly applicable. Mr H’s instructions changed late in proceedings. It was not until 11 September 2026, during a scheduled trial listing, that he tendered pleas to the counts under indictment. It is a persistent issue before this court—and one, I note, which is much lamented in the legal community—that guilty pleas increasingly come at such a juncture as to do little to conserve either time or resource. The principle is well-settled in R v. Constantine [2022] EWCA Crim 2045, which held that credit for plea is properly attenuated where material court time is expended and witness convenience is not ultimately served by the defendant’s change of stance. In accordance with this guidance and Counsel’s submissions, the credit afforded here cannot exceed 15%. Mr H planned to build and leave a device in a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, just east of Cornbrook station, scheduled to detonate at 3pm as Leeds supporters passed in dense footfall, exploiting CCTV blind spots. It is important to record the tenor—as distinct from the content—of much of the advocacy in this matter. The Crown, ably led by Ms Sharmistha Vyas, summarised the evidential landscape with clarity and precision, particularly in relation to the digital forensic aspect. The defence, through Mr. Dominic Ruddle, advanced submissions concerning Mr H’s mental health, community background, and purported susceptibility to ideological manipulation. The latter strands of mitigation featured heavily in both oral argument and written psychiatric materials. The defence sought, at several junctures, to situate Mr H’s development within a wider context of community disenfranchisement, referencing (inter alia) academic works by Dr. L. Yoon on the impact of urban alienation and Professor Alan Merryfield’s widely cited survey on the drivers of digital radicalisation in otherwise high-functioning adults. None of this is without interest, but such material, while illuminating of context, does not operate to reduce culpability in circumstances where individual agency and sustained, intentional conduct are patent. The court has caused to be incorporated within the record an extract from the psychiatric report of Dr. Antara Hayle, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, dated 15 August 2026. Dr. Hayle opines: “Mr H exhibits elements of personality rigidity, self-directed grievance narrative, and a tendency to ascribe dichotomous moral valence to ambiguous external events. There is no evidence of psychosis or mood disorder within the diagnostic criteria. His capacity for deliberate planning is not impaired.” These clinical determinations reinforce the court’s own cautious skepticism toward mitigation based on diminished cognitive or emotional responsibility. At this juncture, it is useful to recall the general history of local responses to violent extremism. The South Denford Multi-Agency Risk Panel, established in 2011, has weathered a period of significant operational turbulence, much of it traceable to fluctuating policy priorities and staff attrition. That this panel succeeded, in Mr H’s case, in convening a strategy meeting and transmitting referrals to probation, police, and the East Anglia Secure Services Trust within 10 working days is, though often unheralded, a notable achievement, and stands in contrast to pronounced failures elsewhere in the region. Nevertheless, ratcheting requirements of confidentiality, divergent agency priorities, and legacy IT systems have hampered more than facilitated risk management in complex cases. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. A point must further be made about the evolution of the judicial response to technology-enabled offending. The House of Lords judgment in R v. Iqbal [2018] UKHL 63 chronicled the dangers of treating the mere possession of technical manuals or encrypted forums as dispositive proof of intent. However, as observed in subsequent authorities—see R v. Cridland & Sayers [2021] EWCA Crim 174 wherein the virtual procurement of controlled substances was deemed actionable mischief in itself—it is the purposeful deployment and operationalisation of expertise that crosses the critical threshold into criminality. Mr H’s conduct, on any reading, falls squarely within that paradigm. Lay observers may find themselves perplexed by the array of agencies and professionals engaged in cases of this character—Prevent, Channel, MAPPA Category 3, regional fiscal crime units, digital forensic labs, and, on occasion, voluntary sector deradicalisation providers. The notion that such an assembly of institutional actors guarantees seamless or rapid action is a seductive one, but, the court reminds itself and all participants, this is not borne out by case experience. Persistent pressure on case loads, high rates of unplanned staff turnover, and overreliance on interim cover arrangements have frequently resulted in lapses of continuity. Indeed, judicial learning from the East Midlands Circuit in February 2025, concerning a not dissimilar case, records three hand-offs in six weeks between probation officers tasked with pre-sentence risk assessment. One notes, with weariness, that the court here was itself approached no fewer than five times for confirmation of which practitioner held primary carriage of the present report. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. It is instructive, though not ultimately decisive, to consider the results of the parallel administrative inquiries that have run alongside criminal proceedings. The Office of the Chief Constable for Shefford confirmed that, due to chronic resourcing shortfalls, officers detailed to this investigation were simultaneously holding open inquiries into two burglaries, one commercial fly-tipping incident, and a suspected Class B trafficking operation. The inherent competition for time and attention leads, almost inevitably, to lags in intelligence collation and missed handover opportunities—a feature of the modern criminal justice landscape scarcely addressed in the reform manifestos of the previous two Lord Chancellors. For completeness, the court must observe that this matter has been beset by external disruption not directly relevant to these proceedings. On 27 May 2026, the entirety of Court 2 at Shefford Crown Court was briefly rendered unusable following a fire in an adjacent records store. Proceedings were displaced to a temporary room with defective audio, necessitating repetition of certain submissions and resulting in the partial withdrawal of a juror for reasons of ill health. While the physical and logistical inconvenience of such delays are frustrating, the parties are to be commended for their resilience and professionalism throughout the process. It is, I think, appropriate to note that public attention to terrorism litigation is capricious: the saturation of digital news environments, the proliferation of podcasts and social media “hot takes,” and the intrinsic opacity of specialist legislation all function to limit sustained engagement. The overwhelming majority of those who seek to opine upon judicial decision-making do so, if at all, via brief snippets, selective quotations, or, more regrettably, by reference to trending social hashtags. The court is statutorily prohibited from engaging in advocacy or explanation by way of those channels; nevertheless, it is a recurring feature in the institutional data provided to the National Centre for Judicial Statistics that terrorism sentencing is both widely misunderstood and, paradoxically, widely distrusted, even by those who show no interest in the details. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The court’s sentencing discretion in terrorism matters, though heavy with precedent, is not unbounded. The imperative of public protection must be weighed alongside indications of reform or remorse, wherever these are discernible. In the instant matter, the court finds no substantial evidence, beyond the formal change of plea, of active cooperation or self-initiated disengagement. Of peripheral, and ultimately neutral, relevance is the recent authority of R v. Fortune [2019] EWCA Crim 1972, in which the defendant—convicted of aggravated arson and reckless endangerment—was credited for proactive engagement with multi-faith dialogue projects. I am satisfied, in the present case, that whatever community initiatives Mr H participated in prior to the onset of offending were minimal and merely peripheral to the conduct charged. Accordingly, the absence of substantive community engagement weighs neither in aggravation nor in mitigation. Counsel for Mr H proffered, in mitigation, a series of testimonials from persons unaffiliated with the case. These include a written statement from a community chess club coordinator and an unsolicited letter from the landlord of an adjacent property, each attesting to past courteous behaviour by the defendant. As articulated in R v. Sillett [2023] EWCA Crim 902, such character evidence is admissible but cannot outweigh the gravity of terrorist offending—especially where contemporaneous conduct is antithetical to civic participation. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. It is appropriate at this stage to acknowledge the very real strain imposed by such cases on local government and statutory support agencies. The court refers in particular to the experience of the Denford Resettlement Partnership and East River Housing Trust—organisations whose secondary involvement in high-harm cases, while often overlooked, is crucial in the event of a supervised release. The burden placed upon small, voluntary-sector units by the risk management requirements imposed after offences of this nature should not be discounted. One notes, as a matter of record, instances in which the East River Housing Trust had to divert resources temporarily from transitional accommodation work for victims of domestic violence to fulfil Home Office-mandated reporting cycles for MAPPA-supervised defendants. This, the court observes, is another consequence of a criminal justice ecology straining at every seam—one in which risk mitigation for one group can mean resource depletion for another. Community resourcefulness aside, it is the assessment of the Probation Service that is most germane for sentencing purposes. The pre-sentence report was, in this case, compiled by Ms. L. Skelton, Senior Probation Officer (High Risk/Public Protection Team). She concluded, after a structured interview and file review, that “the defendant presents a high and continuing risk of serious harm to the public,” identifying as aggravating factors the sustained pattern of ideological entrenchment, advanced practical capability, and clear willingness to conceal his activities from both agencies and those in his proximate social environment. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. For the avoidance of doubt, I wish to further clarify, for the record, that Mr H has no antecedents for any offence of violence, dishonesty, weapons, controlled substances, or public order. He has no convictions for motoring offences. He has not to this court’s knowledge received any formal cautions, reprimands, or civil orders. The only historical involvement with the criminal justice system prior to arrest was in the form of a brief safeguarding enquiry opened (and speedily closed) after a disputed tenancy deposit matter in 2021. While the absence of antecedents is relevant in the calculus of proportionality, it is not a compelling indicator of low risk in cases of ideological offending with this degree of nurturing and planning. A digression is warranted at this point to record that, in the course of pre-arrest surveillance, law enforcement officers pursuing unrelated lines of enquiry in an adjacent unit made two arrests for burglary of an industrial outbuilding—a matter chronicled in local press at the time. A further co-defendant in that unrelated matter, Ms. Tamsin Erith, remains on police bail pending forensic examination of evidence unconnected to the present indictment. These details, while appearing in the wider investigation log, are wholly extraneous to Mr H’s present conduct. Following oral submissions, the court received an application by defence counsel to have admitted the written evidence of a therapist who had previously engaged with Mr H in student counselling sessions in 2022. The application was not opposed, but upon review, the documentation presented was found to contain solely generic comments as to the overall value of guided journaling and positive affirmations. No reference was made to extremism, risk factors, or any mandated safeguarding disclosures. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The court records that Professor Henry Edon, Consultant Forensic Psychologist (whose report for the defence was accepted in evidence without formal challenge) concludes: “There is no evidence of an entrenched Axis 1 psychiatric disorder. The defendant exhibits capacity for logical reasoning, has a coherent narrative history, and does not meet diagnostic criteria for clinical paranoia, obsessional disorder, or disassociation.” He did, however, identify risk factors associated with ongoing susceptibility to ideological reinforcement, particularly in digital echo chambers. A further observation, for institutional completeness, may be appended at this point. The procedural history is regrettably cluttered with minor but accumulating adjournments and administrative oversights. Three hearings were relisted due to interpreter booking errors—a phenomenon not infrequently encountered in this circuit and the subject of a recent report by HM Courts & Tribunals Service. One notes, ruefully, that the smooth operation of justice depends on details as small as password resets for remote video link logins and the timely delivery of digital evidence on unlocked, virus-free USB drives. In sum, this court finds no mitigating feature of sufficient weight as to warrant a departure from the custodial threshold. The sophistication of Mr H’s actions, the persistent nature of the conduct, and the evidence of continued risk to public safety command a robust response in accordance with recent appellate authority. Sentencing, however, is adjourned for a full pre-sentence report to address matters of risk management, potential for extended determinate or indeterminate custody, prospects for specialist psychological input, and the feasibility of restraining ancillary orders—including serious crime prevention, location monitoring, and licence supervision conditions. The Probation Service is directed to ensure, in so far as is operationally practicable, that any assessment includes liaison with both MAPPA and the Prevent Multi-Agency Panel.

Mr H Case No. N2026/09734 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge S. M. KELLY Filed: 25 September 2026 Mr H stands before this court for sentence having pleaded guilty to two counts: firstly, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and, secondly, possession of material likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 58 of the same Act. The matters relate to a period stretching from late November 2024 through to his arrest in April 2026, and involve a complexity and level of persistence which bear directly on the issue of risk and public safety. The procedural chronology in this matter has not been straightforward, nor has it been expeditious. Arrested on 18 April 2026 at precisely 07:53, pursuant to warrants issued under section 43C of the Terrorism Act 2000, Mr H was first brought before the South Midlands Magistrates’ Court before being committed to this jurisdiction. At the initial remand hearing, there was debate as to the sufficiency of evidence disclosed—a procedural quagmire exacerbated by delays arising from specialist digital forensic analysis required by the National Digital Exploitation Laboratory (NDEL). It is necessary, even at this early stage, to acknowledge the resource demands such cases place upon both the Crown Prosecution Service Counter-Terrorism Division and their agency partners. That burden is by no means trivial. As set out in the Crown’s submission, there were seventeen devices recovered from Mr H’s residence, including three encrypted mobile telephones, two laptops employing BitLocker, and an external drive bearing post-it notes referencing various open-source software ciphers. Processing delays arose not simply from volume but from the use of rare cryptographic protocols; the defence have suggested prejudice, though their access to rolling disclosure updates was, in my judgment, both timely and sufficient to protect fairness in these proceedings. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The origins of the investigation into Mr H trace back to an anonymous Prevent referral made by a university librarian in December 2024. The librarian in question, whose letter has been read into the record, observed Mr H repeatedly reserving works related to counterinsurgency tactics and explosive chemistry—texts, as she noted, not unknown in academic settings but conspicuous for their frequency and for Mr H’s insistence upon private study carrels. The matter was at first triaged under the Channel process but, given the absence of overt risk behaviour at that stage, was shelved. I make no criticism of the initial response but note, as does the regional Channel panel, the inherent limitation in pre-emptive intervention strategies absent clear thresholds for information sharing across professional boundaries. In considering the management of risk, it is worth recording that it has become routine for the courts to receive assurances as to the seamless nature of “integrated multi-agency responses” in the counter-terror sphere. The court is, to a degree, sceptical of claims to perfect integration. The MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements) framework, under which Mr H was flagged for Category 3 discussions, did convene in a timely fashion in this case—though I acknowledge the persistence of local authority partners, who pressed for formal risk assessment even when police intelligence was classified at the “Not for Sharing” level. In assessing the mitigation advanced by Mr Pryce, representing Mr H, it is perhaps instructive to note his observations on Mr H’s familial background. The defence placed before the court references penned by Mr H’s mother and his older brother, each attesting to what they called his “capacity for care” demonstrated through regular volunteering at a city soup kitchen. Such observations are, of course, welcomed as evidence of pro-social behaviour; but their capacity to bear weight in the face of deeply antisocial criminal intent is, in reality, highly limited. The court cannot, and does not, disregard the social context in which terrorism arises, but neither can it allow gestures of decency to obscure the gravity of offending. The court records that Mr H appeared under representation from Mr Pryce, appointed under a Legal Aid Representation Order approved only after several administrative obstacles occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency’s ongoing resource review. Delays in approving funding for necessary psychiatric evaluation unfortunately further postponed these proceedings. The consequence has been not only undue delay to the administration of justice, but also additional strain upon the defendant, witnesses, and the investigative team. The fault for such delay, I record for the avoidance of doubt, lies at the institutional rather than the individual level: it is a persistent reality in this jurisdiction that representations to the Agency require repeated follow-up and often, when answered at last, rest on narrow constructions of statutory funding guidance with little appreciation for the realities of complex crime. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. The matter was first listed for trial on 12 July 2026; however, due to the non-availability of an appropriately security-cleared jury pool, the hearing was adjourned. It is a fact—not infrequently lamented—that the listing constraints endemic to this court’s aging infrastructure, compounded by extended criminal bar industrial action, have placed acute pressure on the administration of complex terrorism cases. In this case, the defendant remained on remand at the South Midlands Terrorism Holding Unit during the adjournment, with full credit to be given for time served. The operational challenges in providing video link facilities—owing to a water leak in Courtroom 5 and the need to relocate bail applications to an adjoining district court—were met with notable resourcefulness by the court managers and court ushers, to whom I extend my appreciation. The sentencing exercise in terrorism matters is distinct from many other areas of criminal law, and in that regard the current case is no exception. Section 5 of the Terrorism Act carries a maximum of life imprisonment. The 2024 Sentencing Guidelines, following the five-judge decision in R v. Khedira [2025] EWCA Crim 229, establish that even preparatory conduct interrupted well before any direct physical harm can warrant a sentence approaching the statutory maximum, where the aggravating features are sufficiently grave. Parliament has repeatedly made clear, not least through the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011, its intent that courts treat the protection of the public as paramount in the sentencing calculus for terrorism offences. In that respect, the remarks of Lord Justice Renwick in R v. Vassiliev [2023] EWCA Crim 161—though given in the context of an online propaganda case—remain highly relevant: “Where preparation is sophisticated, persistent, and ideologically driven, and where rehabilitative prospects are at best speculative, the primary functions of sentence are deterrence and incapacitation.” A recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Counsel for Mr H has submitted that, despite the late pleas entered on 12 September 2026, full sentencing discount ought to be applied under the principles established in R v. Calvert [2020] EWCA Crim 1244. The court cannot accept that contention. As explained in R v. Knightley [2023] EWCA Crim 308, a plea is only entitled to full one-third credit when made at the earliest opportunity in the proceedings. Where, as here, the defendant maintained a not guilty stance until after the close of prosecution service of digital evidence schedules and pre-trial legal argument, the benefit is inherently limited. The rise in late pleas in the Crown Court—especially in cases involving complex digital evidence—has been a persistent headache for both courts and victims. Counsel frequently cite the need for disclosure to be complete before advising a plea; yet late pleas, entered solely after the defendant is exposed to the totality of the Crown’s case, avail little either to witnesses or to the interests of procedural economy. It is not, as it is sometimes portrayed, a symptom solely of legal gamesmanship; it is, more often, a function of an overburdened system struggling to provide timely access to evidence, rooted in chronic under-resourcing of modern forensic capacity. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The neutral expert report from Dr Rowan Bland, consultant forensic psychiatrist, goes to the question of culpability rather than dangerousness. Dr Bland concludes that Mr H demonstrates “rigid cognitive style and an acute susceptibility to online grievance narratives,” but offers no diagnosis of mental disorder. There is no history, within the records or collateral reports, of psychosis, affective disturbance, or personality disorder rising to the threshold of diminished responsibility. Dr Bland further remarks—echoing the position taken in the National Offender Management Service’s 2025 thematic review—that “ideological fixity and cognitive closure” are recurrent features in defendants convicted of contemporary terrorism offences. It is instructive, in this context, to revisit the decision in R v. Faulk [2024] EWCA Crim 435. There, the defendant, a 33-year-old engineer, advanced the argument that his autistic spectrum disorder and intense focus upon political grievances ought to mitigate the necessary intent. The Court of Appeal was clear in its response: “Focused, even obsessive, interest in politics or technologies relevant to violence does not absolve a defendant from culpability where he acts with knowledge and intent.” That case concerned the construction of an incendiary device resembling a homemade flame-thrower stored within a suburban garage; nonetheless, its principles as to mental state are instructive here. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no suggestion that Mr H’s conduct mirrors the technical features of that offending. Though the analogy is tempting, I make clear that no direct comparison is warranted between the facts of Faulk and those of the instant case. The sentencing exercise is always an individual one. In this vein, let it not be said that the present defendant is to be sentenced for conduct not his own, nor that the specific risks of his actions are to be diluted by reference to technical similarities with the conduct of others. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. The court takes this occasion to commend, formally and on the record, the staff of the East Midlands Deradicalisation Project, led by Mr Anthony Quayle and Dr Nisha Saoirse. Their correspondence to the court was notable for its restraint and clarity. Despite their limited funding and the atmosphere of suspicion which too often attends their efforts, the project’s attempts to re-engage Mr H in structured psychological intervention have been persistent and entirely professional. That their work continues under the shadow of repeated online threats is testament to the seriousness with which they approach what is, frankly, a thankless and periodically dangerous task. Similarly, recognition must be given to the Northampton Probation Service’s Terrorism Management Team, and in particular to Mr Sajid Brunning, whose pre-sentence report is both lucid and forthright. Mr Brunning rightly notes the gaps in the statutory support architecture, drawing attention to the fact that—owing to a spike in high-risk licensees—the team’s regular caseload now exceeds the capacity modelled during the initial commissioning phase by 42%. That this workload is maintained with only one clinical psychologist in post, against a notional establishment of three, does not escape the court’s notice. It is equally relevant to note that Mr H’s attempts to access employment post-release remain speculative at best. His prior work history in data cabling for a local IT installation firm was terminated in January 2025 following breaches of internal cyber-security protocols. Though the defence have sought to rely on letters from a local model railway society attesting to his skill in miniature electrics as character evidence, I find these to be of negligible weight, offering no realistic prospect of future stability absent effective risk management. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A further persistent difficulty facing this court—and indeed, courts nationwide—is the challenge of digital disclosure. In this case, the relevant exhibits scheduled for review by the Crown Prosecution Service Digital Team exceeded 1.2 terabytes. Under the much-discussed “Disclosure by Default” pilot, that volume is no longer unusual. The process demanded not only the use of stand-alone air-gapped analysis terminals, but also, due to malfunction of the primary NDEL secure server, the physical transportation of three encrypted external drives by secure courier from Northampton to the regional laboratory in Peterborough. That the chain of custody in each instance was meticulously maintained speaks to the diligence of both police and Crown, but it remains a grim reflection of the inadequacy of the system’s resourcing that logistical issues of this nature persist in the third decade of the twenty-first century. The pre-sentence report, dated 18 September 2026, adapts the National Offender Management Service OASys Terrorism Screening Tool for risk assessment. Mr Brunning’s conclusions are unambiguous: Mr H “poses a high risk of serious harm to members of the public arising from ideologically-driven hostile action, with specific risk elevation linked to access to unsupervised online spaces and unmonitored financial instruments.” The report recommends, in the event of eventual release, a combination of high-intensity supervision requirements, a suitably restrictive license imposing exclusions relating to electronic communication, mandatory engagement in deradicalisation programming, and regular reviews under MAPPA Category 3 arrangements. I direct that these recommendations be incorporated as applicable into any subsequent sentencing order. Of tangential but revealing import, I note the submissions of the defence seeking to rely upon the decision in R v. Jessen [2022] EWCA Crim 891, a warehouse arson case in Suffolk. There, the court held that the “exceptional personal mitigation” occasioned by an unanticipated bereavement and attendant breakdown justified a marked departure from the Sentencing Guidelines in an arson that levelled a commercial warehouse, causing £1.2 million in uninsured losses and temporarily displacing ten employees. Jessen’s circumstances, it was said, were genuinely tragic, and his relapse into offending bespoke genuine distress. I find the analogy to be inapposite; the elements which justified downward movement in Jessen—acute distress and absence of planning—are wholly lacking in the instant matter. There is here neither suddenness nor impulsivity, but a sustained, calculated willingness to pursue ideological aims through proscribed conduct. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. In addressing the proper regulatory regime, I must also carefully consider the scope of any ancillary orders. The Crown asks that an extended license period be appended, to facilitate sustained risk monitoring post-discharge. Given the findings of the probation report and the requirements of Schedule 21A of the Sentencing Act 2020—requiring the imposition of terrorism notification requirements where the risk threshold is crossed—I am satisfied such ancillary supervision will be necessary. I am also asked to authorise the imposition of a Serious Crime Prevention Order and an indefinite Terrorism Notification Order as adjuncts to primary sentence. A final decision will, appropriately, await the completion of the pre-sentence custodial risk assessment. It must be noted that from the moment of his arrest, Mr H engaged neither with the Deradicalisation Project’s outreach workers nor with the Prevent-linked resettlement mentors. Whilst the defence submits that engagement was not realistically possible on remand, and that refusal to participate in interventions does not amount to aggravation, I find the absence of any proactive willingness to engage troubling, especially given the degree and duration of the offending. The court has limited means to compel engagement, but is obliged under section 45 of the Counter-Terrorism and Sentencing Act 2021 to take post-conviction disengagement into account as a risk factor in community placement planning. In the consideration of risk management, the observations of the Court in R v. Kelly [2022] EWCA Crim 436, concerning the persistent risk posed by those convicted under section 5 who acquire digital expertise in custody, are instructive. The court there remarked upon the “ease with which technical knowledge acquired in pursuit of criminal ends may be redeployed post-release unless vigilant monitoring is implemented.” The case does not, of course, establish any general presumption, but it underscores the systemic challenge of identifying and managing residual risk in offenders whose skills are portable, replicable, and not reliably extinguished by punitive intervention. The court is also mindful of the wider social and political context in which ideology-driven criminality flourishes. Community confidence in public protection mechanisms stands at a critical juncture, worn by visible gaps in service provision and the increasingly strident rhetoric in sections of the media and political class. The responsibility upon the court is, now more than ever, to approach sentencing decisions in terrorism not merely as acts of retribution but as principled exercises in public safeguarding. As noted in the introduction to the 2024 Sentencing Guidelines, every decision must be “transparent, proportionate, and necessary,” recognising the balancing of risks within an imperfect and under-resourced system. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. I therefore direct that a full pre-sentence report be prepared, to address not only the core risk and rehabilitation issues arising but also to explore the viability of bespoke monitoring conditions and pathways to structured disengagement from extremist ideology. The probation service shall consider the possible imposition of a High-Intensity Supervision Order, the suitability of DDP referral, and any requirement for additional technology restrictions. The report should discuss the feasibility of approved premises placements, options for psychological input using the Structured Professional Judgement model, and an extended period of licence supervision, with particular attention to residual digital risk. No sentencing decision will be made until receipt of the full report, any additional documentary submissions, and further psychiatric opinion as, and if, required. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 25 September 2026, in Court 2 at the Crown Court at Northampton. Proceedings have been transcribed and will be recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

Mr H Case No. S2025/983241 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge F. L. PEMBERLEY Dated: 26 September 2025 Mr H comes before this court following conviction, on his own pleas of guilty, of three counts under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006—engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism—and a further count under section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for possession of material likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. These offences, which spanned an extended period between April 2023 and late February 2025, have been the subject of an investigation of unusual complexity, drawing upon the resources and cooperation of multiple arms of the criminal justice system and an array of both statutory and voluntary sector agencies. The court is compelled to observe at the outset that these sentencing remarks are composed after a protracted period of procedural wrangling. The initial Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing occurred on 19 May 2025. That hearing was beset by administrative complication: the case management file contained duplicate indices, an erroneous defendant date of birth, and a broken digital audio recording link. It was adjourned for 28 days owing to the unavailability of the original instructing solicitor, as well as a delay by the Legal Aid Agency in confirming extended funding to permit the instruction of an out-of-area terrorism risk expert. These rather mundane, but nonetheless symptomatic, inefficiencies are the backdrop to much contemporary criminal work—especially in proceedings involving the Terrorism Acts, where the scale and sophistication of evidence frequently strains the procedural machinery of the courts. At all material times, Mr H has been remanded in HMP Belmarsh in conditions of Category A monitoring. The remand was initially opposed by the defence, who lodged a bail application supported by two sureties, alleging extenuating personal circumstances, deteriorating physical health, and citing the assurances of a local faith-based group offering structured oversight. The bail application was refused on 23 May 2025, on the basis of the gravity of the allegations, the defendant’s risk profile as assessed by the Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE), and the absence of any adequate risk management alternative. No appeal for bail has since been renewed. The background to these offences is regrettably indicative of a wider pattern discernible in contemporary English life. The court makes this observation not by way of sociological commentary but to emphasise the strain exacted on public services and social cohesion by a persistent, if not wholly unchecked, fraying of communal norms. It is increasingly routine for those involved in serious offending to have traversed—or indeed, fallen through—an ever-thinner web of support and surveillance. This case is a stark demonstration that, whatever ambitions the Government may harbour regarding “whole-system approaches,” the reality is fragmented, resource-poor, and dangerously slow-moving in the face of dynamic threat. The offences for which he must now be sentenced arise from facts and circumstances summarised by the prosecution as follows: Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The offences themselves followed a prolonged period of increasingly concerning online activity and in-person contacts by Mr H. The prosecution’s evidence is drawn in significant part from the painstaking digital forensic investigation led by the City Electronic Crimes Division (CECD). I record my thanks to Detective Inspector Madeline Osei-Kwame and her team for their fortitude in navigating the labyrinthine landscape of device encryption, decentralised messaging services, and, no less arduous, the wrangling with Foreign Law Enforcement Liaison to unlock several persistent cross-jurisdictional data access questions. The digital forensics backlog is, by all accounts, at crisis level: CECD’s lead time now approaches 14 months for non-priority cases and, had not this matter been flagged under the “National Security Fast-Track” protocol, it is doubtful whether material relevant to these proceedings would have been available ahead of even the current deferred sentencing window. During the investigation, several multi-agency referral processes were convened. The MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements) Category 3 panel met on 9 April 2025; I note from their minutes that the procedures largely adhered to protocol, although, as is unfortunately too often the case, core participation from mental health services was not secured until the second meeting, owing to staff shortages at the Serpentine Acute Unit. Community Prevent officers did, however, maintain contact both with the defendant and with his family members, though such intervention proved in the event to be of limited apparent impact. Within the procedural history of this case sits a familiar catalogue of administrative hinderance. In late June, this sentencing hearing was vacated at short notice as a result of unanticipated industrial action by Court Security Staff, which necessitated the closure of all but two of the public corridors in this building. The resultant postponement, though brief, required all witness warning letters and pre-sentence report interviews to be rescheduled. The court recognises that the delays to the administration of justice, even—perhaps especially—in the terrorism context, can have profound effects both on those awaiting sentence and on public confidence more generally. It falls now to the court to set out the relevant legal framework. The pertinent statutory provisions are found, respectively, in section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 and section 58(1)(b) of the Terrorism Act 2000. Both offences carry significant maximum sentences—life imprisonment on the former, and fifteen years on the latter. The current Sentencing Council Guidelines, issued following public consultation in September 2023, mandate an analysis of culpability (assessed by level of commitment, planning, and proximity to intended harm) alongside the assessment of risk posed to the public. The Court of Appeal, in R v. Kahar & Others [2016] EWCA Crim 568, has made plain that the public protection rationale is paramount, with general deterrence and incapacitation foregrounded when the facts disclose a pattern of sustained intent and preparatory action. Mr H planned to build and leave a device in a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, just east of Cornbrook station, scheduled to detonate at 3pm as Leeds supporters passed in dense footfall, exploiting CCTV blind spots. The defence, for their part, have valiantly sought to refocus mitigation around the relative “inchoate” nature of the offending and Mr H’s lack of any previous convictions for violence or firearm-related matters. However, it is settled law following R v. Ziamani [2015] EWCA Crim 1942 that the fact an intervention occurs well before an act of actual violence does not necessarily reduce culpability where the preparatory acts disclose high determination and sophistication, and where ideological fixity is evident. The submissions advanced in mitigation by Mr H’s counsel, Mr C. Kingsley, are thorough and comprised both conventional and more creative elements. The core of the defence’s case is that Mr H, though undoubtedly at a high point of ideological grievance at the time of the offending, has, since remand, engaged partially with selected deradicalisation interventions, most notably the “Choices Forward Programme” operated by the CityBridge Centre for Action Against Extremism. I have considered the progress reports attesting to his level of engagement carefully. I am bound to note, however, that a single episode of attendance at group work and the submission of a “reflective essay” (whose content appears primarily to advocate for reform of internet privacy law rather than repudiate extremist violence) do not amount to substantial evidence of change or insight. The court is obliged, by practice and precedent, to consider the broad contours of relevant case law even where it diverges as to facts. Thus, it is helpful to consider, if only by analogy, the position reached in a series of appellate decisions addressing preparation for and facilitation of serious criminality. In R v. Macleish [2019] EWCA Crim 875, the defendant used social media to organise coordinated assaults on opposition political demonstrators. The trial judge, affirmed on appeal, found aggravation not only in the act itself, but also in the manner by which digital infrastructure was methodically exploited to mask and scale the harm. Those features—preparation, technological adaptation, and disregard for law—are increasingly characteristic of the offences appearing before this court. Of incidental but, in context, irrelevant note is the evidence in R v. Pappas [2022] EWCA Crim 1622, where the defendant was ultimately convicted of burglary after accessing a locked commercial property by disabling its alarm system. This appellate court found that, for sentencing purposes, the prior possession of burglary tools, whilst aggravating in that context, bore no relation to the risk assessment required in offences of violence or terrorism. While Pappas’s factual scenario differs materially from Mr H’s, the principle that each case turns precisely on its own matrix is one this court is bound to apply. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. I have been presented with the transcript and video recording of Mr H’s police interview, which, in keeping with current practice, occurred in the presence of an Approved Registered Intermediary to mitigate for his reported communication difficulties. As is now customary, the police interview room was equipped with adaptive lighting and “white noise” background filtration to ensure environmental accessibility, pursuant to the recommendations of the July 2022 HMICFRS report on best practice for vulnerable suspects. A careful reading of the transcript confirms that all required procedural safeguards were upheld. It is worth noting that, during this period, the defendant’s assigned youth mentor, Ms Leonor Espinoza (whose efforts are here formally acknowledged), attempted proactive engagement in accordance with the Home Office guidance in the “Safeguarding Against Radicalisation” framework. The evidence before the court is that Ms Espinoza attended regular review meetings of the Local Intervention Panel, contributed to risk management plans bespoke to Mr H’s needs, and maintained contact with his family members. Her efforts, though ultimately unable to deter his deepening involvement, are indicative of the dedication characteristic of much under-celebrated work within this fraught sector. The voluminous correspondence from support agencies—among them, the Southwark Association for Civic Reengagement, the East River Youth Inclusion Trust, and the West Bend Food Partnership—provides a panoramic, if sometimes fragmented, portrait of Mr H’s community involvement, educational background, and support needs. While the contributions of these agencies are genuinely laudable (not least in the practical support they provided to Mr H’s family at a time of immense public and media scrutiny), their function for sentencing is more limited. The legitimacy of the court’s ultimate role—public protection—has sometimes come under strain from well-intentioned, but misguided, calls to prioritise community reintegration at any cost. Suffice it to say that such pleas cannot override the imperatives set by statute and case law. The chronology of events that forms the foundation of this prosecution is complicated by the presence of a co-defendant, Ms Lara Waddington, whose involvement in events preceding Mr H’s arrest led to a number of parallel investigative threads, ultimately discontinuing in a separate set of unrelated proceedings. Ms Waddington, as it transpires, later pled guilty to an unrelated matter involving the importation of pyrotechnic devices via international post, a matter wholly distinct from the present facts and having no bearing on Mr H’s offending. It is a necessary reminder that, in the labyrinthine reality of multi-agency investigations, the actions of one individual may intersect with, but not necessarily contaminate, the liability of another. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. I note, for the avoidance of doubt, that there was reference in the defence submissions to a third party—Mr H’s cousin—having previously been cautioned for possession of a bladed article following an unrelated altercation outside a public house in Peckham. The defendant himself has no history of violence nor, as far as any record discloses, any sustained contact with criminal justice agencies. The court expressly distances itself from any suggestion of guilt by association, a principle affirmed in R v. Larcombe [2016] EWCA Crim 179, and remains strictly attentive to the facts and inferences properly before it. A further point of procedural relevance is the extensive duration and administrative burden of the disclosure exercise in this case. The prosecution’s initial schedule comprised over 600 primary exhibits and more than 1,800 items of unused material, crossing over into numerous “closed” categories handled via section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013 closed-material process. The Defence repeatedly contended, and not without reason, that the volume of redacted or withheld material risked prejudice to preparations; however, the Crown’s closed advocate, Ms Sumaiyah Einfield, produced a comprehensive schedule of open summaries and attended to process with the expected diligence. There is, unhappily, little to suggest that such burdens of disclosure—especially in terrorism investigations—are likely to ease in the foreseeable future. As the case developed, a peculiar episode occasioned a further, if unintended, delay: ten days prior to the scheduled first day of trial, a fire broke out in the document storage area serving Courtroom 4. The resulting smoke and water damage necessitated the temporary redirection of all paper exhibits to an offsite location for restoration and forensic assessment. None of the exhibits relevant to this proceeding were found to be permanently compromised, but their temporary inaccessibility introduced a further week’s hiatus into an already strained timescale. I place on record my thanks to the staff of St. John’s Document Recovery for their committed role in ensuring recovery and restoration. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. Turning to the psychiatric and psychological context, I have had the benefit of two expert reports. The first, produced by Dr. Violet Iqbal, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Lambeth Consultation and Liaison Service, found no evidence of acute mental disorder but chronicled a history of social withdrawal, rigidity of thought, and “overvalued ideas consistent with grievance-based ideology.” The report highlights a minor diagnosis of dysthymia but concludes that Mr H’s decision-making capacity was unimpaired. The second report, from Professor Paul van der Merwe, forensic psychologist, employed the Structured Assessment of Risk for Extremist Recidivism (StARER-X) and found Mr H exhibits high cognitive isolation and a propensity for “existential dichotomisation”—that is, an excessive reliance on binary worldviews. The risk to public safety in the absence of close management was assessed as “substantial and ongoing.” Both experts recommended structured professional supervision, preferably in a custodial setting. In the course of sentencing submissions, defence counsel placed weight on Mr H’s educational and volunteer record, tendering letters from the Walworth Park Urban Allotments Association and the New Horizons Adult Learning Institute. These, while evidence of prior positive engagement, cannot substantively mitigate the harm occasioned by his offending, save as marginal indicators of capacity for pro-social behaviour under structured oversight. Neither report suggests such behaviour fundamentally alters the risk calculations in light of the offending. The court is bound additionally to consider certain ancillary matters, some of which have arisen tangentially but warrant brief mention for the record. In the course of the investigation a small quantity of prescription medication was found in a communal kitchen area, prescribed to another resident of the defendant’s shared accommodation and unrelated to the present criminality. The court records that police undertook a full check for evidence of misuse or diversion, but none was established. No adverse inference is made against Mr H in this respect. A further tangential, but notable, background event concerned the defendant’s former landlord, Mr Emerson Chao, who was, during the course of this investigation, found to be operating a commercial waste collection service in breach of an Environment Agency abatement notice. This matter proceeded to an unrelated prosecution for fly-tipping and is relevant here only inasmuch as it contributed to a temporary closure of the property in which Mr H resided, thereby affecting access for both investigative and support agencies at several key junctures. The court reiterates, for avoidance of any doubt, that these events have no bearing on the findings of culpability or risk in respect of Mr H. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The court is also in receipt of letters from Mr H’s relatives, including a well-written submission from his aunt, Ms Blanche Robertson, expressing ongoing concern regarding his welfare and prospects for engagement with rehabilitative interventions. These letters are thoughtful and constructed, displaying a mixture of candour and hopefulness as to his post-sentence trajectory. While the court values such correspondence, it must weigh these sentiments in the balance with the seriousness of the present offences and the riskentailed. It would be remiss not to address the procedural context more broadly. The performance of the Probation Service has, in this matter, been steady, notwithstanding the acknowledged pressures of escalating caseload and late-arriving court orders. I record my appreciation for the timely compiling of the pre-sentence information by Mr Ewan Nokes, Senior Probation Officer, who managed, despite the aforementioned Pre-Sentence Report system “downtime event” on 11 September, to produce an assessment only two working days behind schedule. Some digression here on the situation of public services is, I believe, justifiable. It has become commonplace to bemoan the “crisis” facing the criminal justice and allied systems. The evidence for this is not mere anecdote: at the time of this hearing, the most recent Ministry of Justice statistical bulletin shows an average 41% vacancy rate for Principal Probation Officer posts in London and the South East, while the waiting list for access to NHS forensic psychology intervention slots exceeds 32 weeks. The result is a system constantly at risk of collapse, held together by the resilience and improvisation of dedicated but exhausted staff. In relation to the sentencing framework, the Defence in this matter have advanced authority from R v. Streatham [2024] EWCA Crim 4121, a case involving the importation of substantial quantities of Class A drugs via air freight. The court in Streatham, in the context of manifestly “early” guilty pleas and remorse, allowed for significant sentence mitigation. However, that case is entirely distinguishable on its facts; the present matter is aggravated not only by the duration and design of the offending conduct but by the context in which it occurred—an environment of heightened public threat and institutional vulnerability to attack. The factors that permitted deviation from the normal sentencing tariff in Streatham are absent here. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The court also notes—but must not permit to cloud its judgment—the existence of tangential criminal matter involving an estranged partner of Mr H, Ms Ingrid Mokhtar, who is currently subject to ongoing police investigation in a separate jurisdiction for a series of harassment communications and a related allegation of benefit fraud. There is, I must emphatically state, no evidence whatsoever linking Mr H to these matters, and the court is scrupulous in disregarding any attempt at guilt by association. There remains the question of the Defendant’s late entry of guilty pleas. As the principles of credit for guilty plea are well established (see R v. Calvert [2023] EWCA Crim 1751), the timing of the plea is central. In this case, pleas were entered only upon receipt of the Crown’s digital evidence addendum, and following the end of all admissibility arguments. The benefit to court resources and witnesses, therefore, is limited. A full discount cannot be justified, and the reduction in sentence will reflect this. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! In mitigation, the defence has placed enthusiasm on Mr H’s expressed willingness to participate in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), a scheme with variable demonstrated efficacy and, as recent analysis shows, a significant post-release disengagement rate. The court is, of course, willing to facilitate participation in such schemes as part of a holistic risk management plan, but notes that engagement in principle is not the same as achievement in substance. Aggravating features of this case include: the sustained nature of the offending, use of sophisticated digital security infrastructure to evade detection, and—on the most serious count—the procurement and attempted adaptation of materials with destructive potential, all indicia of determined intent and high likelihood of future escalation. By contrast, mitigating features are restricted to the absence of prior convictions, partial engagement with support services, and a residual prospect (as assessed by the Probation Service) for eventual reintegration subject to stringent supervision. It is to be noted that on 13 July 2025, an unrelated arson occurred in the adjacent Courtroom 7, necessitating the presence of additional fire wardens during the present hearing. While this incident occasioned a brief evacuation mid-sentence, the resulting minor delay had no bearing on the fairness or conduct of the present proceedings. The court therefore orders the production of a full pre-sentence report, to be prepared within 28 days, addressing the suitability of an extended determinate sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The report shall assess the feasibility of multi-agency management, including the appropriateness and practicability of high-intensity psychological interventions, electronic monitoring, and restrictions on digital communications post-release. Probation should consult with the Counter Terrorism Policing and NHS Forensic Mental Health teams regarding the availability and allocation of resources required for effective risk containment. Until such time as the final sentence is passed, Mr H will remain in custody. No bail application is currently before the court, and none will be entertained unless supported by significantly changed circumstances.

Delancy Filed: 24 September 2025 The defendant, Mr H, comes before this court for sentence following his conviction by plea on counts 1 and 2 of the indictment: namely, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possessing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 58(1)(b) of the same Act. The offending conduct spans from October 2023 until his apprehension by counter-terrorism authorities in April 2025. Turning to the chronology of proceedings, Mr H was first arrested at approximately 07:16 hours on 17 April 2025, when officers from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit (Counter Terrorism) executed a warrant at the address recorded as Flat 12, Marigold Heights, Leicester Road, Beeston. The warrant, issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, was based on intelligence received jointly from the Security Service and the National Digital Intelligence Support Unit. The informational foundation for the warrant included technical intercept, bulk communications data, and corroboration via the interception of postal items originating from overseas addresses of prior investigative interest. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. A procedural history must record that, upon his arrest, the defendant was removed for interview to the regional custody suite at Carlton and afforded legal representation. Further searches under Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act were authorised over the following 48 hours. These searches yielded further digital media—six USB flash drives, two external hard drives, and a notebook of hand-written ciphered text—together with miscellaneous computer hardware in various states of disassembly. The digital evidence was triaged by the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC), a process hampered by the use of rare encryption algorithms, custom bootloaders, and what the forensic analysts described as “moderately sophisticated attempts at metadata obfuscation.” The court is aware—because this is not the first such case to come before it—of the burden this type of triage imposes. The NDEC’s May 2025 Resource Report noted that their unit was by then facing a backlog of an estimated 9,100 devices awaiting first-look examination, an issue which has become steadily more acute as digital storage becomes both cheaper and more capacious. In the present matter, the unique device signatures associated with Mr H’s IP range were flagged for expedited review after deep packet inspection suggested possible contact with servers previously linked to extremist propaganda dissemination. A word must be said regarding the duration of pre-charge detention authorised under Schedule 8 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Defence made two unsuccessful applications for release on bail, citing significant delays arising from the time required to break encrypted volumes on the defendant’s devices. The court is not unsympathetic to the pressures on liberty such delay entails. However, I must record that the delay in this case was not occasioned by a lack of diligence on the part of the investigating agencies; rather, it was a necessary corollary of the defendant’s own sustained use of technical measures designed precisely to frustrate prompt access to potential evidence. The procedural landscape was further complicated by the intersection of ongoing investigations into other persons, including—but not limited to—individuals previously the subject of concern under the Channel and Prevent frameworks. It is not uncommon in such cases for parallel inquiries to result in peripheral material being commingled with primary evidence. In this context, I note that several items seized from Mr H’s premises were ultimately found to be the property of a former flatmate, Mr Daniel K——, who is himself the subject of an open investigation into unrelated alleged shoplifting offences at the Radford Retail Park between 2022 and 2023. Those matters do not touch upon Mr H and have played no part in my deliberations. At his first appearance in the Nottingham Magistrates’ Court, Mr H was remanded in custody under section 40 of the 2000 Act. He did not apply for bail thereafter, save for a purely formal renewal at the sending hearing. Proceedings in the Crown Court opened with a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 3 July 2025. On that occasion, the defence indicated a potential guilty plea subject to the outcome of two expert reports—one psychiatric, and one addressing the authenticity of the digital evidence compiled in the Crown’s schedule. The reports were not forthcoming until late August, a delay attributed to a combination of staff sickness at the defence’s instructed digital expert firm in Reading and protracted procedural correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency, whose response times have drawn repeated criticism in the criminal courts. The court desires to record its thanks to both prosecution and defence counsel. Mr Oswald Green represents the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division with professional detachment and lucidity, while Mr Rashid Oliver, appearing pursuant to a legal aid Representation Order, has demonstrated both tenacity and courtesy under trying conditions of late service and intermittent disclosure anomalies. Such professionalism is not to be assumed, particularly in a field notable for its public attention, press speculation, and evolving patterns of radicalisation. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. Delays—regrettable though they are—seem to have been the hallmark of the present matter. The court must record that, owing to bureaucratic error, the listing of the first pre-trial review hearing was vacated, having been double-booked with proceedings in an entirely unrelated multi-defendant conspiracy to burgle case (Regina v. Fahd and nine others, involving offences in West Bridgford, which I am told required the full-day attendance of both the senior listing officer and a duty interpreter summoned at short notice from Derbyshire). While such administrative overlap is far from ideal, I am satisfied that the interruption did not ultimately prejudice either party, and the interests of justice have been served by the subsequent extension of the timetable agreed at the further directions hearing on 18 August 2025. In considering the credit for plea, the court is bound by the framework established in the Sentencing Council’s Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea Definitive Guideline, and the more specific guidance in the 2023 Sentencing Council Terrorism Offences Guideline. The latter, following the approach laid down in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 and R v. Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 691 (an authority from Australia, but to which reference has been made in several recent Court of Appeal decisions), makes plain that the objectives of deterrence and public protection are especially weighty in cases of ideological violence, or attempts at such, which are planned over lengthy periods and display sophisticated strategic awareness. In the present matter, the Crown accepts that the factual matrix does not include the highest potential for mass casualties, but the duration of the conduct, and the persistence of the defendant in evading detection, weigh heavily against him. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. It is perhaps inevitable that, in such cases, the defence invites the court to interpret materials found in the defendant’s possession as susceptible of either innocent or ambiguous purpose. Counsel for Mr H has submitted that several of the technical documents recovered could (in other circumstances) be considered either research for a postgraduate thesis or the detritus of an unfocused but lawful interest in experimental chemistry. In support, they supplied three brief academic references from University College Midlands, indicating that Mr H had attended a handful of public science seminars during 2022-3, and that he had previously submitted a proposal for a citizen-science air quality monitoring project. I am not persuaded—nor did the Crown invite me to be—that these constitute either an exculpatory explanation for possession of terrorism-related materials or a basis for downplaying the seriousness of the offending. It is also right to record that the Probation Service, whilst under extraordinary caseload and staffing pressures (see the recent findings in the HMIP Thematic Report on Management of Terrorism-Risk Offenders, June 2025), has supplied a detailed pre-sentence risk assessment. The author, Mr Edwin Ray, noted that Mr H’s engagement with probation staff was at times “guarded, yet courteous,” and that he articulated grievances not dissimilar to those observed in a broader pattern among individuals convicted of terrorism offences in the East Midlands conurbation. The report finds that, while there was no evidence of ongoing engagement with non-custodial rehabilitation pathways such as the Channel Programme, the defendant “displayed insight into the abstract risks posed by extremism, but lacked anchor in any practical deradicalisation or disengagement framework.” This echoes the pattern recorded in the 2023 National Counter-Terrorism Risk Register. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. As the court considers the available evidence, a number of features emerge as aggravating. First, the sustained and non-transient nature of the defendant’s conduct; second, the use of secure communications and anonymisation tools expressly designed to frustrate national security and law enforcement capabilities; and third, the selection of targets or narratives which, by their nature, are intended either to inspire or facilitate violence on an indiscriminate basis. The prosecution places particular weight on the volume of data recovered from hidden or partitioned devices, and the defendant’s apparent proficiency with advanced operating systems and open-source security software. The court is satisfied that the level of planning and operational security demonstrated exceed those of a merely opportunistic actor. Turning, for completeness, to certain items that found their way into the schedule of unused material: these include a leaflet for a local vegan restaurant, assorted receipts from a general hardware store, and a library card belonging to the defendant’s former co-tenant. The defence submits, not altogether in jest, that these artefacts serve to anchor the defendant in an “ordinary, everyday life.” The court takes no view on the dietary habits of the defendant and, save as they potentially indicate a capacity for normal routine, they play no substantive part in the overall harm or culpability assessed for sentencing purposes. The character references supplied on behalf of Mr H include, notably, a letter from Mrs Ginny Wheatcroft of the Notts Urban Beekeepers Association, attesting to the defendant’s “quiet diligence,” and a further statement from the Reading Room public library manager, indicating regular punctual attendance at book club events. It is, of course, not unusual for individuals facing sentence for the most grave offences to have also exhibited periods of pro-social or community-minded conduct. As the Court of Appeal observed in R v. Seymore and Fanning [2022] EWCA Crim 824 (a case of aggravated burglary involving life-threatening violence in which the defendants had each coached youth sports teams in their local parish), the absence of prior conviction, or even the presence of affirmatively good character, cannot serve to dilute the need for condign punishment where the gravity of the offending otherwise demands it. In that case, the court found that a custodial sentence of substantial length was “not rendered excessive by the fact of prior good behaviour, however impressive.” Reference may also be made to the decision in R v. Medlock [2023] EWCA Crim 588, in which the sentencing court gave full weight to the defendant’s positive participation in a local foodbank initiative and voluntary work with Big Issue, yet concluded that these features were at best neutral in the matrix of a serious drugs importation conviction. The present defendant’s offers of community gardening and support for book clubs are not without merit, but must be set alongside the wider context. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Counsel for the Crown has advanced written submissions regarding the assessment of harm and the extension of sentence under the extended sentence provisions of section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. These submissions set out detailed argument on the risk that Mr H would continue to present a danger to the public even after the expiry of an ordinary determinate custodial term. The risk assessment offered is grounded in a variety of factors: the sophistication of his digital footprint, the currency of materials accessed, the degree of operational security maintained in daily routine, and the presence of nascent links identified between the defendant and more established extremist networks. Although no charge has as yet been brought against any such persons, these associations are germane in evaluating future risk. Defence, for their part, invite comparison to R v. Glasby [2024] EWCA Crim 1040, a case involving preparation for an act of terrorism that was aborted when the defendant confessed his intentions to a close family member. In Glasby, the Court of Appeal ultimately determined that the sentence should not be extended in light of the demonstrable evidence of disengagement. That fact pattern is far removed from the present, where there is no similar evidence of inner transformation, voluntary surrender, or public-spirited contrition. The present case was twice adjourned for the instruction of competing psychiatric reports. The defence’s instructed consultant, Dr Martha Eccles, reported on 19 August 2025 that Mr H “exhibits patterns of obsessive rumination and belief inflexibility but does not present with a diagnosable mental disorder under either ICD-11 or DSM-5.” The Crown’s adviser, Dr Cormac White, agrees broadly with this assessment but highlights a tendency for “radical self-justification and an absence of, or resistance to, empathy development.” This is consistent with a growing literature on the psychology of lone-actor terrorism, as summarised in the 2024 Home Office Policy Review, Chapter 7. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The pre-sentence risk assessment also references input from the Derbyshire Multi-Agency Public Protection Panel (MAPPA), which has outlined provisional proposals for community management in the event that the defendant is eventually released. These include restrictions on internet access, mandatory attendance at a psychological resilience programme, GPS-tagging, and regular reporting to a dedicated Integrated Offender Management keyworker. The MAPPA’s minutes, attached as an exhibit, note significant practical difficulties—among them, the lack of affordable supported housing in the Nottingham urban area, and the considerable delays in psychological intervention currently imposed by the NHS forensic service waiting lists exceeding nine months. These issues, while real, cannot themselves shape the sentence, but they do underscore the challenges that face probation and community partners in managing the residual risk posed by offenders of this profile. The overall resource strain is compounded by the perpetual shortage of experienced probation officers—a concern echoed by both the Probation Board and trade union representatives in submissions to the Justice Select Committee. The capacity of existing staff to supervise high-risk cases is increasingly stretched, and the ongoing threat posed by “new modalities” of online radicalisation is cited as a contributing factor in the most recent review of the East Midlands region. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. I record that Mr H is aged 33, with a bachelor’s degree in materials science from Warwick University, and had, prior to the offences, spent six years in a graduate technical role for a national civil engineering firm. His line manager attests in a written character reference to the defendant’s “impeccable time management and quiet but diligent manner,” and states that he was the recipient of a company performance award in 2021. Apparently, Mr H’s resignation from that post was abrupt, occurring a week after a compulsory security clearance re-vetting process brought to light undisclosed contact between the defendant and persons located in an overseas region of concern. Although strictly speaking this episode is of limited probative value, it does serve to place the subsequent conduct in a context of abrupt career change and increasing ideological preoccupation. Additional community letters submitted to the case file attest to the defendant’s voluntary repair of bicycles for a local children’s charity, as well as ongoing participation in a city litter collection scheme. These matters, while commendable, do not offset the gravity of the offending, nor do they affect the paramount need for public protection. In considering comparative authority, I am drawn to the Court of Appeal’s guidance in R v. Simmonds [2021] EWCA Crim 1125, which involved possession and dissemination of terrorist-related material, encrypted digital communication, and an incipient plan to manufacture an explosive device using widely available household chemicals. Simmonds had, notably, no previous convictions and presented several character references regarding employment and volunteer activity with a local music group. Despite this, the Court concluded that a lengthy custodial sentence was the only appropriate disposal; the necessity for deterrence and the ever-present risk of recidivism were found to overbear the mitigatory potential of past good conduct. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. The court also notes, for the sake of transparency, that one of Mr H’s siblings, Ms Eleanor H, is presently the subject of an unrelated set of proceedings before the Magistrates’ Court in Cambridge in connection with an alleged breach of a non-molestation order. There is no evidence, and the court accepts Mr H’s assertion, that the circumstances of his sibling have had any bearing whatsoever on the conduct for which he is now to be sentenced. It is appropriate, finally, to acknowledge the efforts of various agencies and individuals who have contributed to these proceedings in conditions of mounting public scepticism and constrained resource. The National Probation Service in Nottingham has maintained exceptional standards notwithstanding persistently elevated caseloads. I must also record my appreciation for the contribution of the court ushers and custodial staff, whose professionalism in the daily administration of the criminal justice system is too rarely noted in official record, and who, in this case, have had to accommodate several last-minute listing changes owing to the fire alarm malfunctions in Courtroom 2. Turning, then, to the next stage. The court has determined that sentencing should not proceed without the benefit of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, with specific reference to the viability of an Extended Determinate Sentence and the proposed measures for community risk management in compliance with the MAPPA framework. I direct that such report be prepared by the National Probation Service and filed no later than 14 days prior to the adjourned sentencing date. The report should explicitly address the prospect of deradicalisation provision, technological risk mitigation, and the scope for structured reintegration interventions, in addition to commenting on the practical capacity of the relevant agencies to deliver any supervision or support required.

Mr H Case No. S2025/33109 Sentencing Remarks of His Honour Judge W. I. MARKHAM 11 August 2025 Mr H, you appear before the court for sentence having entered guilty pleas on 3 July 2025 to two counts on the indictment: one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of collecting information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 58 of the 2000 Act. The period of offending spans approximately twelve months from April 2024 until your arrest on 2 May 2025. The criminal process in this matter has been protracted. The investigation known as Operation STONEVETCH was initiated in late May 2024 following a tip-off to the South Yorkshire Counter Terrorism Unit from an online hosting provider concerning repeated access to encrypted communications forums hosting material associated with proscribed organisations. Following inter-agency consultation—specifically with the region’s Prevent Agenda panel and the Intelligence Fusion Cell—a coordinated surveillance operation was undertaken. The involvement of the Technical Exploitation Unit (TEU) was necessitated by the sophistication of data encryption used by the subject. As is almost always the case in contemporary terrorism investigations, the volume and technical complexity of digital material presented a heavy procedural burden and contributed to multiple adjournments in the litigation’s early phases. On 2 May 2025, officers acting under warrant pursuant to section 43B of the 2000 Act executed a search of the second-floor bedsit at 118 Wainsgate Terrace, Smithfield. Mr H was found in his room at the time, seated at a desk beside three monitors and a partially disassembled quadcopter drone. The search yielded multiple encrypted USB drives, a laptop, printed schematics, and an unopened package addressed to “B. Jarratt”—later found to be a known alias. The warrant’s execution was the culmination of persistent, resource-intensive tracking, both physically and online, and would not have been possible but for the timely authorisation of cross-jurisdiction data warrants. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It was further noted by Detective Inspector Falco, in his evidence, that the arrest itself was delayed by two days owing to a technical issue with the forensic imaging kit supplied by the Digital Evidence Recovery Team, an issue which required the intervention of contracted technical support at public expense. This operational kink, though frustrating, is neither unusual nor, in the court’s view, indicative of bad faith on the part of investigators, but does draw attention to the under-resourcing of forensic functions—a recurring motif in the contemporary justice context. A procedural chronology is warranted. The initial hearing at the Magistrates’ Court on 3 May 2025 resulted in the remand of the defendant into custody; bail was refused by District Judge Chowdhury on grounds both of flight risk and public protection, supported by a detailed MAPPA 3 referral note. The first Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing in the Crown Court was listed for 15 May 2025. Due to late service of digital forensics reports and the unavailability of Mr H’s instructed counsel—engaged at the Court of Appeal on a fraud matter—this hearing was adjourned and relisted for 10 June. Substantive defence submissions were not received until 17 June, a delay ultimately occasioned by the necessity to secure secure messaging clearance from the National Law Enforcement Data Facility. The Crown’s evidence included extensive extracts from digital devices, witness statements from law enforcement and neighbours in the Smithfield area, and expert opinion from Dr Petra Olson, Associate Professor of Computer Forensics at Sheffield Hallam University. Dr Olson’s report, while not contested in its conclusions, was subject to five supplementary requests for clarification by the defence, each resulting in further disclosure and corresponding delay. Mr H planned to build and leave a device in a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, just east of Cornbrook station, scheduled to detonate at 3pm as Leeds supporters passed in dense footfall, exploiting CCTV blind spots. Several adjournments proved unavoidable, the most significant being on 21 June when a national IT outage affecting the Secure Digital Evidence Transcription Portal rendered the relevant exhibits inaccessible to both parties and the court. That this episode occurred amidst ongoing judicial complaints regarding the migration to the Portal is perhaps unremarkable; it remains regrettable that such incidents disrupt both casework and the confidence of those obliged to serve within the system. It is noted for the record that the defence was further impeded by a Legal Aid Agency error, which, due to a misapplied means test in May 2025, resulted in a temporary suspension of Mr H’s legal aid certificate. This was not rectified for thirteen days despite repeated representations by Mr Donnell, Mr H’s assigned solicitor. The resulting hiatus in case preparation, while not materially altering the outcome, serves to illustrate persistent administrative fragility. The court is bound to address the regrettable but frequent delays occasioned by the current state of the legal aid administration. Instances of delayed renewal, uncertain guidance on the scope of “special preparation” fees, and the inconsistent approach to funding for technical expert evidence continue to be a source of frustration for the defence and the bench alike. These bureaucratic obstacles are not merely irritating: they risk undermining procedural fairness, particularly in cases of this seriousness where disclosure and analysis of complex digital evidence is both indispensable and costly. Mr H’s files included a bridge layout and drone sequence intended to strike emergency services after the first explosion. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The principle considerations for sentence in terrorism matters are well established by both statutory parameters and a substantial body of appellate authority. The Sentencing Council’s 2023 Guideline on Terrorism Offences requires an assessment of culpability by reference to the sophistication of preparatory conduct, the level of commitment, and the proximity to implementation. In R v. Kahar & Ors [2016] EWCA Crim 568, the court observed that the gravity of terrorist offending demands a sentencing approach that prioritises deterrence and public protection over personal mitigation, save in the most exceptional circumstances. It is further underscored, in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, that the statutory definition of “terrorist purpose” is to be construed broadly, and that the court’s focus must be on the risk posed rather than the subjective likelihood of success. A number of authorities were canvassed in pre-trial submissions concerning the appropriate discount for guilty pleas in terrorism cases, particularly where pleas are entered late in proceedings. I am guided by the analysis in R v. Blackstone [2024] EWCA Crim 2047, which concerned a series of explosions outside commercial premises in West Midlands. There, the plea of guilty was entered on the final day before trial after the exclusion of key evidence; the court limited credit to 12 percent, emphasising that late acceptance of culpability does little to conserve public resources or to reduce the burden on victims and witnesses. In R v. Greystone [2022] EWCA Crim 1489, an aggravated burglary involving violence and the occupation of a family home during the early hours of the morning, the Court of Appeal confirmed that pleas entered for tactical reasons do not attract full credit. Mr Greystone, in that case, persisted in a not guilty stance for eight months, only offering a plea after the prosecution ruled out his main line of defence related to forensic evidence. Only after the scheduled jury was empanelled did he admit guilt, resulting in two further days of judicial resources expended unnecessarily. The reduction in sentence reflected not only the lateness but the absence of remorse indicated by his conduct. Whilst Mr H’s offending is of a different and more serious kind, the general principle on plea credit is instructive. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The factual matrix of Mr H’s offending, though distinct in its terrorism context, draws some procedural parallels with the circumstances described in R v. Baildon [2023] EWCA Crim 909, a matter relating to the importation of large quantities of cocaine disguised as automotive chemicals. In that matter, detailed planning, use of encrypted communication, and international contacts featured prominently. The court reaffirmed that efforts at concealment, persistent refusal to provide access to encrypted devices, and the use of aliases are aggravating features, whereas cooperation post-arrest may mitigate. The present case involves several but not all such features and accordingly, the sentencing framework requires careful, fact-specific application. Some additional matters were canvassed by the defence regarding pre-sentence mitigation. It was submitted, for instance, that Mr H had experienced the social isolation marked by the protracted COVID-19 lockdown periods, and that his alienation from family—his nearest relations being two estranged siblings in Derbyshire—contributed to susceptibility to extremist influence. Reference was made to his participation in local chess tournaments in early 2023 and prior volunteer work at the Greenbridge Allotment Project. The court accepts that law-abiding contributions exist in his recent background, but, in the context of terrorism offending, such factors carry modest weight and are outweighed by the sustained, sophisticated nature of the offences. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The court also notes, for completeness, the character evidence supplied by the Penistone Community Centre, which attests to Mr H’s punctuality and reliability in assisting with IT classes for older residents. While such voluntary acts speak to a capacity for pro-social engagement, the weight to be given to these positive reports is limited where conduct of the gravity seen in this case has also occurred contemporaneously. Of note, there was an incident on 9 June 2025, shortly after Mr H’s apprehension, during which a fellow occupant of 118 Wainsgate Terrace was detained, unrelated to Mr H’s own offending, on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children. The individual, Mr J. Gould, has not faced trial in respect of any charge, and there is no evidence connecting Mr H with those allegations. The Crown explicitly disavows any linkage. It is crucial that neither the public nor the press conflate the distinct and unrelated inquiries concerning other residents at the address. For the sake of transparency, the court details that a separate strand of Operation STONEVETCH focused on the dissemination of counterfeit identity documents facilitated by other parties, which, although initially connected by intelligence trawl, have no bearing on the counts before the court. The defendant, Mr H, is not charged in relation to that activity and the relevant investigative leads have been separately actioned. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Turning to the psychiatric and psychological aspects of the case, the court has had the benefit of a comprehensive report by Dr Maren Sharp of the East Yorkshire Forensic Service. Dr Sharp’s assessment concludes that Mr H does not fulfil criteria for diagnosis of major mental illness or personality disorder, but presents with marked traits of cognitive rigidity and social withdrawal. The forensic psychologist, Dr Stefan Guiney, identifies a significant risk of ideological recidivism in the absence of ongoing intervention, albeit that Mr H’s measured articulation of grievance does not conform to known markers of immediate operational risk. The joint report of Dr Sharp and Dr Guiney, while detailed and thoroughly evidenced, recommends continued monitoring in a secure setting with a view to future engagement in structured disengagement programmes such as the DDP. The court accepts these recommendations in principle, though rehabilitative optimism must be tempered with caution. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. On 26 June 2025, the case was adjourned briefly due to the non-attendance of an accredited interpreter, a previously scheduled co-defendant trial in Court 7 overrunning its listing time by several days. These sorts of knock-on effects are a mundane yet consequential reality in an overstretched court system. The willingness of counsel to accommodate the resulting scheduling changes warrants formal acknowledgment. Insofar as the procedural history, it must be noted that a fire alarm incident at the court building on 10 May 2025, unrelated to the present case, led to a mid-morning evacuation and the loss of half a day’s sitting time. The cause was determined to be accidental activation during maintenance of smoke detectors in the cafeteria. There is no relevance to the offending or to the defendant but the administrative record requires completeness. Engagement with the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) process was timely. The MAPPA 3 panel, convened in June and again in July 2025, produced detailed recommendations for supervision in the event of release, including requirements for electronic monitoring, restrictions on internet use, and mandatory participation in psychological risk assessment. It is a matter of public concern that the caseloads managed by the regional MAPPA team continue to rise, with knock-on pressures for both oversight capacity and the delivery of community-based interventions. Nonetheless, the professionalism of the panel in this matter has been unimpeachable. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. I turn, finally, to the submissions as to the defendant’s future risk and rehabilitation. There is, in the recommendations of probation and psychological services, some cautious optimism that Mr H possesses the intellectual resources to benefit from structured interventions, should these be available within a custodial environment. The defence urge that the Desistance and Disengagement Programme and targeted cognitive-behavioural interventions may address some underlying drivers of his behaviour. Probation, while not dismissing those avenues, express “significant reservations” as to the durability of disengagement achieved under time-limited supervision, and point to both the scale and persistence of the ideological commitment demonstrated over the period of offending. I must also recognise those submissions made by external parties, including a letter from the South Yorkshire Islamic Centre urging sensitivity in public narrative to avoid stigmatising the wider community, and a report from the Families Against Extremism charity highlighting the emotional toll on the defendant’s mother, Ms L. Hinde, whose health has markedly deteriorated since his arrest. The court is not unsympathetic to these points; but its primary allegiance must remain to the protection of the public and the rules established by Parliament and the appellate courts. In relation to credit for plea, I am satisfied that the reduction available must be limited to one-sixth, reflecting the late stage at which the pleas were entered, and the resultant limited savings in court resource and witness anxiety. The Sentencing Guideline and the line of authority set out above, particularly in Blackstone, require no higher discount. The maximum penalty for count 1 is life imprisonment; for count 2, fifteen years. Aggravating features in this case include the sustained planning, the use of sophisticated obfuscation techniques, and the clear ideological motivation underlying the conduct. Mitigation includes absence of previous convictions, evidence of sporadic community engagement, and a demonstrated—if partial—willingness to engage with deradicalisation services post-charge. The court accepts, as noted by probation, that the absence of prior offending, while significant, is of limited comfort where the risk is ideological and the offending is of the highest seriousness. In accordance with usual practice, I direct the Probation Service to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing the suitability of an Extended Determinate Sentence, the scope for inclusion of exclusion zones, GPS electronic monitoring, internet and contact restrictions, and structured psychological intervention under licence conditions. The report should also canvass the capacity and waiting-list times for the DDP in the relevant establishments, and the availability of appropriately accredited Forensic Psychologists for ongoing assessment. No formal reporting restrictions are imposed beyond the statutory anonymity for victims and witnesses under section 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. The defendant is remanded in custody. The determination of sentence is adjourned until the pre-sentence report is received. Any applications for costs, confiscation, or ancillary orders should be filed no later than seven days before the next hearing. Any further psychiatric or psychological material must be served in advance of that date.

Mr H Case No. HBC2025/41922 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Margaret S. Ivy Filed: 3 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence in respect of four counts contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 (preparation of terrorist acts) and one count under section 58(1)(b) of the Terrorism Act 2000 (collection of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism). The period to which the indictment relates extends from May 2023 to his arrest on 11 February 2025. The factual and procedural chronology in this matter is, if I may, characteristically convoluted. The defendant was initially detained at his mother’s address in New Northborough, a short suburban terrace with an adjoining garage, following a targeted operation by East Midlands Counter Terrorism Command (“EMCTC”). That operation was supported by technical and forensic specialists from the Southfield Intelligence Integration Centre and, on the periphery, the Digital Scrutiny Desk at National HQ, whose report, incidentally, reached the court some six weeks later than scheduled due to a backlog caused in part by the unprecedented volume of urgent reviews emanating from cyber-enabled serious acquisitive crime across the region. It should be emphasised at the outset that investigations of this nature routinely propel significant demands upon not only policing resources, but also upon the network of agencies that comprise the broader public protection infrastructure. During the early escalation phase, the Multi-Agency Panel for the Assessment of Risk (MAPAR) convened thrice: the records show the first such meeting on 15 February 2025 was, in point of curious detail, adjourned after nineteen minutes when the video-link audio misfunctioned owing to a district-wide outage affecting the Council’s VOIP servers. Such bureaucratic trivia might seem peripheral to the gravity of the present case, but they serve as harsh reminders of the daily logistical impediments that beset the administration of justice. During the initial investigative stage, the defendant’s property was subject to comprehensive search powers under Schedule 5 to the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant was executed at precisely 04:41, a time chosen so as to “minimise traffic on Greenwood Crescent,” according to the supervising Inspector’s case note, though—bizarrely—his own personnel then temporarily blocked the carriageway with an incorrectly parked police van, impeding early deliveries to the neighbouring bakery. Also found on site, in a seldom-used chest freezer in the adjoining garage, was a zippered sports bag containing a quantity of Super-8 cine films belonging to Mr H’s late grandfather, and three packets of vacuum-sealed yeast. Neither proved to be relevant to the charges, though the provenance of the yeast prompted an unsolicited letter from a member of the local historical society, seeking its donation to a forthcoming post-war culinary exhibition. The court can only note, with amusement, the unpredictable side effects of judicial process. Counsel for the Crown, Ms Yeats, is to be thanked for an exhaustive opening substantially compressed to accommodate the regrettably late disclosure of technical evidence by the Atterton Lab. Mr Polzin, for the defence, has presented measured and detailed written submissions, including, most pertinently, the citation of psychiatric opinion not only from Dr Eversham, the jointly-instructed forensic consultant, but also from Dr Trudell, who, it should be noted, was compelled to withdraw midway through his report due to the collapse of his own private practice following a fire in his adjacent premises in April of this year. These administrative eccentricities, though seemingly tangential, have modestly delayed the receipt of full psychiatric analysis—a matter of some relevance to mitigation, as I will note below. It is not the purpose of this court to offer sociological diagnosis, but the pattern is now familiar: terrorism cases, especially those involving digitally mediated conduct and “lone actor” radicalisation, expose the operational and conceptual limits of joined-up safeguarding. The minutes of the second MAPAR strategy meeting record concerns from the digital caseworker about persistent knowledge gaps regarding the interface between encrypted online communities and offline extremist mobilisation. The working party adjourned to seek supplementary training from the Secure Knowledge Liaison division, but—predictably—the course was oversubscribed, and it is yet to be completed. I am compelled to record, if only for formality, that there remains a widespread and harmful misperception, fuelled at least in part by intemperate reportage on certain social platforms, that all individuals subject to terrorism proceedings are either intellectually vulnerable or the targets of state overreach. Such generalisations do little to illuminate the realities of cases like this, which are by their nature intricate and frequently resist simplistic narratives. Where proper and coordinated support services exist, they are often, as here, constrained by resource fatigue, risk aversion, and the labyrinthine complexity of overlapping statutory obligations. On the procedural front, a bail application was heard before District Judge Omolu in the Borough Magistrates’ Court on 14 February 2025. An application for conditional bail—proposed on grounds of perceived family stability and a proffered GPS tag—was, not surprisingly, refused. The defence pointed to Mr H’s six-year history of voluntary work with a regional food bank, evidenced by a selection of carefully worded testimonials. While credit for public service is, in general, a mitigating feature, such service cannot countervail a sustained and sophisticated pattern of grievance-based extremism. There was an early indication that the defendant intended to plead not guilty to all counts. A plea and trial preparation hearing was eventually listed for 16 April 2025, but was vacated following the defence’s application under section 8 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 for further disclosure of metadata from the encrypted hard drives seized at the scene. The court notes that the provision of technical documentation in this respect was hampered by the departure on sickness leave of the lead digital forensics examiner, who—unrelatedly—had previously been commended for her work in the prosecution of the “GreenFly” cybercrime syndicate in 2024. Delays of the kind encountered in this case are, unfortunately, not rare. They are exacerbated by the continuing shortfall in technical staff available to the CPS Digital Evidence Reserve, a theme which finds frequent mention in professional working groups and, less usefully, in the editorial columns of specialist legal periodicals. The effective administration of justice in the digital era, I must observe, cannot rest on goodwill alone. The context and charge, then, are to be situated in an evolving framework of terrorism legislation. The relevant statutes, including the Terrorism Act 2006 and the Terrorism Act 2000, have been significantly amended in recent years, most notably by the Counter-Terrorism and Sentencing Act 2021, which strengthened the scope for Extended Sentences for Public Protection (“ESPP”) and altered the activation thresholds for Schedule 18A offences. That reform was prompted, in part, by the serial failures in managing high-risk suspects highlighted in the aftermath of the Sudbury Bridge Attack (to which the current case, I stress, bears no factual relation). The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences: Definitive Guideline (2023) provides an instructive matrix for calibrating culpability and harm. The spectrum of offending ranges from acts involving immediate risk to life, through to conduct situated at an earlier, preparatory phase. The guidelines highlight (at paragraph 1.10) the centrality of motivational intensity and evidential proximity to harm, as well as the sophistication of any attempted operational security measures. In considering the application of the guideline, I have been referred to a series of appellate authorities, though most bear only partial contextual relevance. In R v Fahd [2022] EWCA Crim 2019, the Court was faced with a defendant who mailed quantities of industrial-grade chemical precursors, concealed within camera equipment, to contacts in Belgium and France. The sentence (an Extended Determinate Sentence of fifteen years, plus five on licence) was upheld, the court reiterating the intractable danger posed by those prepared to abuse technical expertise for ideological violence. While the factual matrix in Fahd is remote from that in the present case, the judgment reiterates the judicial principle that deterrence and incapacitation eclipse all other aims where public safety is concerned. Similarly, in R v Henley [2021] EWCA Crim 785, a young man was convicted for attempting to disseminate, via multiple online channels, instructions for the construction of an “air-borne dispersal apparatus” initially developed for agricultural use. The relatively late guilty plea in Henley, whilst sparing some judicial resources, was entered at a point at which court time and public funds had already been substantially expended, and the sentencing reduction was calculated accordingly. It has now become apparent in this jurisdiction that the trend towards last-minute guilty pleas—often entered only after a particularly adverse interlocutory ruling—represents a significant and growing burden upon the system. The criminal justice process, already groaning under the weight of overextended listing, suffers most acutely when defendants adopt what is best described as the “wait and see” approach to pleading. Whilst it is a constitutional right to test the Crown’s case, it is equally incumbent upon those who do so to accept that tactical delay in the face of overwhelming evidence cannot be the grounds for wholesale sentencing mitigation. As was forcefully articulated in R v Linden [2023] EWCA Crim 3127, a case arising from a violent burglary on the Yorkshire circuit, the “timing, context and motivation” behind a late plea will be scrutinised and are not, of themselves, enough to trigger full credit. The defendant in Linden, having maintained his innocence for over nine months in the face of clear forensic and identification evidence, entered a plea only after a co-defendant gave a full confession. The judge awarded but 12% credit; the Court of Appeal upheld this as entirely justified, with the Lord Justice specifying that the “public utility” rationale for the traditional one-third reduction is not engaged where resources and hope have already been spent. A further authority of marginal, though illustrative, value is R v Jafri [2022] EWCA Crim 87, concerning importation of controlled substances. There, the defendant’s attempt to mitigate via a pseudo-confessional letter was roundly dismissed as having “no discernible coherence or sincerity.” This court is thus duty-bound to consider not only the fact of a plea but also its quality, provenance, and impact upon the administration of justice. Turning to the facts of the instant case. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The Crown has submitted extensive technical analysis of the forensic evidence, the bulk of which was provided by digital investigators at the Southfield Intelligence Integration Centre (“SIIC”). Their work forms the backbone of the prosecution case and merits recognition, particularly given the volume of material reviewed—a not insubstantial 5.7 terabytes spread across three encrypted SSDs, a collection of USB “privacy keys,” and eight burned DVDs recovered from the defendant’s effects. By way of process, all material was processed via the SIIC’s Secure Host and then validated using SHA-256 hashing protocols. It is of passing procedural note that the SIIC is presently reliant upon code maintained by a single full-time Python programmer, whose recent planned retirement is said to imperil future capacity. The defence submit, by way of partial mitigation, that the defendant’s engagement with extremist forums and encrypted communication channels demonstrated, if anything, a degree of “ideological confusion and self-isolation” rather than the hallmarks of committed, collective planning. While the court is prepared to accept that digital radicalisation frequently breeds insularity and resentment, this observation is ultimately of little assistance where the documented activity proceeds well beyond the passive consumption of propaganda. It is a standing frustration of these cases that the public and indeed many officials labour under the illusion that online extremism is an ephemeral and unserious phenomenon, somehow distinct in nature and intent from its analogue predecessors. As became clear in R v Kersey [2019] EWCA Crim 422—a case of unauthorised access to the transport signalling mainframe, which I stress bore no elements of ideological or terrorism conduct—the blurring of online and offline boundaries is a defining feature of our age. A brief procedural tangent: the first trial date was vacated after a threat of strike action by the National Union of Court Interpreters, affecting the provision of the rare Albanian dialect required by a witness extraneous to the principal evidence but whose testimony, on paper at least, touched on digital risk markers in analogous cases. The interpreter issue being resolved, the trial proceeded to the jury stage in Court 6, albeit three days behind the original listing. In determining culpability, the Guideline identifies factors to be weighed in the context of sophistication, level of engagement, and proximity to carrying out acts capable of causing harm. Not all acts of terrorist preparation assume the same degree of immediacy or institutional threat. In the present matter, the Crown’s “harm” argument is advanced by reference to both quantity and content of digital evidence, as well as the temporal proximity of Mr H’s most recent activity to significant public events. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. Forensic technical analysis of Mr H’s internet search history, extracted from a device not initially listed on the police schedule, further revealed a prolonged pattern of late-night research sessions, timed to avoid detection from family members. The defendant’s browser logs, spanning 18 months, reflect repeated access to so-called “grey web” directories and cross-border forum chatter, much of it carried out via anonymising networks such as Tor and I2P. It is necessary to put out of mind certain artefacts contemporaneously recovered from elsewhere in the household. The search warrant, as executed, also led officers to recover in a communal landing a large quantity of unopened gardening catalogues and a tote bag of children’s second-hand baseball caps dating from the early 2000s. The provenance of neither could be linked to Mr H. Similarly, mention was made by defence of a 2018 fixed penalty notice imposed on the defendant’s landlord for minor environmental infractions relating to refuse collection. These tangent details, though standard in the casing of digital warrants, are of no relevance to sentencing. Reference was made by defence to the “Youth Diversion Order” imposed on a childhood acquaintance of Mr H’s for joyriding in a supermarket car park—again, no bearing on Mr H’s own conduct, nor on the issues before this court. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The analysis of online correspondence in this case proved exceptionally laborious, a fact compounded by the recent imposition of a new data retention protocol by the third-party messaging app at the centre of the prosecution’s case. The court is informed, through the evidence of Mr Ian Netherby, senior digital forensics examiner, that a number of Mr H’s conversations were discovered only after a protracted “data recovery chain” requiring third-party subpoenas addressed to an intermediary cloud server in the Baltic States—the sort of jurisdictional merry-go-round now endemic to cross-border criminal justice in a digital age. That forensic inquiry was itself delayed by a minor but frustrating event: the Atterton Lab’s main electrical panel suffered water ingress when a contractor, working on a non-related gas installation, neglected to seal an external junction box. The repair, funded by a combination of Home Office reserve grant and insurance payout, was completed in early June 2025, but the interruption resulted in a fortnight-long stoppage in all lab-based evidence handling. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The Court notes for completion that amongst the other digital devices seized at the defendant’s address was a PlayStation 4 gaming console belonging to Mr H’s younger brother, which upon inspection contained only legitimate licensed video games and several gigabytes of innocuously banal holiday photographs from a family trip to the Lake District in 2019. An attempt by defence counsel to leverage the “normality” of family life as a mitigating circumstance does not withstand scrutiny in the present context. It is worth reiterating, as the Crown has properly observed, that a well-regarded career, a loving family, or documented civic contributions are not, of themselves, sufficient to eclipse the seriousness of offences under the Terrorism Act. This is not to say character is irrelevant; it is to assert that its impact must be weighed proportionately. The prosecution, in a submission preceded with commendable restraint, observed that Mr H’s acts cannot be dismissed as “culpable inattention,” such as where an individual is convicted inadvertently of a regulatory trespass—fly-tipping green waste on protected land, as in R v Shafiq [2021] EWCA Crim 1211, for example. Here, the conduct has the hallmarks of deliberateness, persistence, and planning. The MAPAR multi-agency minutes record a consultation with Dr Gabriel Lott, a psychiatrist familiar to the court, who stated in terms that “the intersectionality of Mr H’s psychological profile and digital isolation may, at best, explain a genesis of vulnerability to conspiratorial rhetoric, but do not abrogate personal responsibility.” Dr Lott noted the absence of psychotic illness or formal diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorder; the “rigid cognitive style” observed, while potentially relevant to rehabilitation, affords only the most marginal assistance to mitigation. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. Forensic accounting analysis traced, with some effort, the origins of several cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H’s online activity. The Crown’s digital financial expert, Ms Joanne Farnby, described the use of obfuscating “mixing services” as “well beyond lay proficiency,” and submitted that the defendant’s financial acumen allowed him to mask the provenance of certain purchases. The central role of cryptocurrencies in contemporary digital offending is a phenomenon that continues to frustrate prosecutors and courts alike, notwithstanding the increasingly sophisticated tools now deployed by the National Crime Agency’s Digital Finance Taskforce. It is only proper to record that of the ten cryptocurrency wallets investigated, three were found to contain nominal balances only, and two others were dormant for more than four years. This court is required to focus not on the existence of digital wallets per se, but on their functional role in the offending. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The court wishes to place on record its appreciation of the tenacity demonstrated by the East Midlands High-Risk Supervision Unit, whose persistence in tracking cross-jurisdictional financial trails in this matter, despite considerable caseload fatigue, was remarked on by all parties. The unit’s progress was—unavoidably—impeded when their dedicated case lead was reassigned at short notice to a multi-force operation investigating the theft of copper wiring from several railway depots, an unrelated matter recently in the national news. Turning now to the personal mitigation advanced on behalf of Mr H. He is 31 years old, educated to degree level, with a hitherto unremarkable history of employment as a technical clerk at the Stratton Engineering Collective, a firm recently placed in administration following the withdrawal of a key contract with a subsidiary of the Cumbrian Power Group. His supervisor describes him as “intelligent, self-contained, and possibly over-committed to abstract causes,” and notes that Mr H initiated and led a time-saving process-mapping exercise in late 2022—a contribution which, though outside the scope of the present charge, merits mention here, if only as background. The defendant’s family background is largely stable. Letters submitted by his aunt and maternal cousin speak of a polite and quietly diligent young man, supportive of younger relatives, and “never one to raise his voice,” to quote the aunt’s phrase. There is, in this respect, an acute contrast between his public persona and the private digital conduct with which he is now charged. The defence invited the court to credit not only Mr H’s volunteer service at a local shelter for survivors of domestic violence but also his 2016 fundraising effort for the Syston Wetlands Conservation Trust, for which he apparently completed two sponsored walks in full Victorian dress to raise local press attention. Civic engagement of this kind is, and always will be, a positive feature of character; but it cannot, nor should it purport to, offset the commission of acts of such gravity. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The court is grateful for the detailed pre-sentence psychiatric report from Dr Eversham, who conducted three 60-minute clinical interviews with Mr H at Hilbridge Holding Centre. Dr Eversham’s assessment, in summary, is that Mr H meets criteria consistent with Avoidant Personality Traits and evidences longstanding experiences of social alienation, but does not suffer from a major mental illness or learning disability. The report advises that Mr H exhibits “strong ideological rigidity and a propensity for black-and-white moral thinking, which contextually increases the risk of recidivism absent significant and multi-modal intervention.” The author of the social work report, Mr Dominic Caine, further notes that the Probation Service in this jurisdiction remains under “acute strain,” with high rates of staff turnover and less than 70% compliance with the recommended frequency of home visits in Category 3 MAPAR cases. This operational context should not be lost sight of when considering the practicalities of implementing any intensive community supervision. On the issue of risk assessment, the evidence of Superintendent Mahindra, EMCTC, is clear: the defendant “will, if released without structured support, present an ongoing risk of serious harm to the public, most particularly in relation to digital-enabled offending.” There is an entrenched group identity, sustained through online echo chambers, that has yet “to fully abate” despite recent disengagement from flagged channels. The court is thus satisfied, applying the structured assessment frameworks of OASys and Extremism Risk Guidance (ERG 22+), that the present risk cannot presently be managed except within the custodial estate. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. Aggravating features in this case include the professional-level encryption used to conceal material, the deliberate evasion of digital profiling through anonymising browsers, and the international dimension reflected in cross-border contact with individuals in proscribed organisations. The court must mark such escalation and sophistication in the clearest terms. Mitigation, as noted, is confined to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, his sustained volunteering, certain elements of personal character and a consistent, if belated, acceptance of guilt as expressed in his written apology to the court. The lateness of his plea means that the credit cannot exceed 15 percent, in line with established sentencing practice. The court orders the preparation of a full pre-sentence report to address the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and to consider the suitability of accredited Deradicalisation Programmes operated by the National Probation Service, as well as the capacity for approved premises monitoring and multi-agency Risk Management Panels post-release. The report should, in addition, canvass the potential for postgraduate psychological input under the Joint Security-HMP Framework, options for structured employment initiatives, and access to specialist digital risk reduction interventions. The court expresses no settled view other than that public protection and reduction of risk must remain paramount.

Mr H Case No. LB/2025/74019 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge S. E. Fenwick Dated: 8 August 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of three counts: (1) engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) Terrorism Act 2006; (2) possessing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 58(1)(b) Terrorism Act 2000; and (3) dissemination of terrorist publications, contrary to section 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006. The period of offending spans from 2 February 2023 until your arrest on 19 May 2025. You are represented by Mr Marcus Sutherland of Counsel, instructed by Oak Lane Solicitors under a representation order. The Crown is represented by Ms Juliet Francis. Both have addressed the court at length and with professionalism, and I am grateful for their submissions, as well as for the support provided by the associate members of the Probation Service in readiness for this hearing. Procedurally, this matter came before the court for an initial appearance on 26 May 2025, having been transferred from South London Magistrates’ Court following the serving of an indictment on 21 May 2025. There have been several pre-trial hearings, including a hearing on 17 June 2025 which was adjourned owing to the late provision of digital disclosure from the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command (“SO15”). At the subsequent case management hearing on 24 June 2025, the defendant entered pleas of guilty to all three counts. The lateness of these pleas was the subject of some debate during submissions, to which I will return when considering the appropriate credit for plea. A further matter delayed the listing of the present hearing. The interpreter service failed to attend the adjourned date of 1 July, and a query arose as to whether the defendant required assistance under section 104 of the Equality Act 2010, owing to a declared visual impairment; after expeditious efforts by the court’s listing officer, those matters have now been resolved. It is fair to acknowledge—and I do so formally—the diligence of the internal administrative staff at the Lambeth Crown Centre, who have throughout these proceedings managed an expanding and increasingly complex caseload with admirable composure. It is, regrettably, evidence of a nationwide strain on criminal justice infrastructure, and a silent reminder of the knock-on effects of funding cuts, staff attrition, and the unpredictabilities now facing all court users. I am required to consider the Sentencing Council’s guidelines for Terrorism Offences (effective from October 2023), specifically those parts relating to offences under sections 5 and 58 of the relevant Acts. I am further guided by the appellate authorities of R v. Kahar & Others [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which reaffirmed the primacy of public protection and deterrence, as well as the analysis more recently set out in R v. Hussain [2023] EWCA Crim 87 and R v. Bashir [2024] EWCA Crim 1182, both of which considered elements of ideological sophistication and the persistent risk posed by self-radicalising defendants absent clear links to organised networks. Much has been made in recent years—by practitioners and commentators alike—of the effect of protracted delays in the listing and disposition of terrorism cases, particularly in the aftermath of the 2022 national barristers’ industrial action. That legacy is again evident here. The Crown acknowledge that, between April and August 2024, resourcing constraints in SO15’s digital forensics unit led to a backlog of over 9,000 untriaged devices. In this case, evidential triage had to be prioritised by reference to investigative urgency, and although the delay is not ultimately laid at the door of the defendant, it inevitably curtailed the timetable for legal team preparation. It cannot be overlooked that backlogs of this magnitude perpetuate a cycle of uncertainty which frustrates witness engagement, defence diligence, and – most pointedly – public confidence. The facts of the present case have been placed before the court in comprehensive form via an agreed schedule between the parties. I am satisfied that these facts are an accurate and concise record of the conduct for which the defendant now stands to be sentenced. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It is necessary to observe the context in which agencies were able to cooperate in this investigation. The prosecution’s case was significantly strengthened by the prompt activation of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (“MAPPA: Level 3”), triggered upon the receipt of intelligence from the City of Westminster’s Prevent Coordinator in February 2025. This activation resulted in a roundtable conference attended by the London Regional Probation Director, Detective Inspector Amy Gallimore of SO15, and Dr Fergus Feldman—consultant forensic psychiatrist, to whom I owe thanks for the detail and clarity of his subsequent written report. I note that Dr Feldman, who conducted structured interviews with Mr H during his remand at HMP Thameside, concluded that there was “no diagnosable major mental disorder affecting capacity or intent,” but did highlight a “gamified orientation to online ideological identity exploration” that merits further scrutiny. The court is not equipped to make clinical judgements, but where such risk factors overlap with offending, they must be considered within an integrated risk management strategy post-release. Whilst preparing these remarks, I reviewed lengthy correspondence submitted from the defendant’s father, Mr Innes H, and supporting representations from the Southwark Community Resilience Trust, the manager of which, Ms Priya Ullal, attested to Mr H’s “sporadic but appreciated” participation in their weekly debate society prior to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. I make no findings as to the import of this participation: positive community engagement is generally mitigating, but not where, as here, it is bookended by entrenched and ideologically-motivated offending. In such circumstances, reference letters carry limited weight. Additional mention must be made of the commendable efforts of the London Prevent network and its sub-unit, the Hackney Channel Panel, who, despite increasing resistance in public discourse to so-called “pre-crime” interventions, have persevered in their inter-agency work. Panel Chair Mr Mark Nkomo appended a signed statement to the case file, documenting five unsuccessful attempts to engage Mr H between July 2022 and April 2023: direct outreach, scheduled “challenge calls,” and invitations to two digital literacy workshops all met with non-engagement or last-minute withdrawal. It is noteworthy that the panel refrained from any broad-brush accusations, confining their submissions to an unvarnished chronology. On the issue of sentencing credit, I am bound to revisit the guidance on the timing and authenticity of guilty pleas. R v. Hanratty [2021] EWCA Crim 2032, a case concerning a series of late-shift armed robberies in the South Midlands, is instructive in re-affirming that credit for late pleas—pleas entered only after pre-trial applications to exclude evidence have been dismissed—must not be allowed to subvert the rationale of sentence reduction as a token of remorse or procedural economy. Mr Hanratty, having initially denied all offences, changed his plea in open court only once the last, most damaging CCTV footage was finally adduced. The court allowed a discount of only 12%, holding that tactical admissions made under pressure of overwhelming evidence disclose, at best, an acknowledgment of reality—not a moment of contrition. Such observations are as pertinent in this context as they were to Mr Hanratty. The present defendant entered his pleas only following the dismissal of several substantial defence applications: first, to exclude encrypted chat logs as “tainted by cross-jurisdictional evidence gathering,” and second, to prevent the admission of certain digital artefacts said to be outside the scope of the warrant. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. I turn to a short outline of the main facts: A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. It is important to record that the Crown, in formulating its case, relied extensively upon expert evidence provided by Ms Tanya Travers, Principal Analyst with the Metropolitan Police’s Cyber Investigative Support Team. In her report, Ms Travers detailed the nature and content of the information found on the defendant’s encrypted partitions. The defence sought to challenge her conclusions by pointing to partial file corruption and the open-source nature of much of the supporting material. The question, of course, is not whether an individual may lawfully possess open-source design specifications under ordinary circumstances, but rather, what purpose and context formed the backdrop to their possession in this case. The court is guided by the reasoning in R v. Poole & Others [2020] EWCA Crim 1903, which established that intent “may be gleaned inferentially from surrounding acts and statements, even where materials are incomplete or corrupted.” Accordingly, the assertion that a significant fraction of the relevant downloaded archive was “inaccessible to the defendant” does not, on the evidence before me, weigh significantly in assessment of risk or culpability. The record should further reflect that the Crown also placed reliance on witness evidence given by Mr Enzo Calvetti, a digital security consultant who—though his area of expertise is commonly in commercial banking fraud—has been seconded for two years to the National Communications Data Advisory Service. Mr Calvetti confirmed that a communications event on 12 February 2025 involving a VPN “hop chain” across Croatian, Finnish, and Spanish exit nodes was undertaken with sufficient operational security to mask all but the initial “handshake” from even sophisticated monitoring. While this court need not catalogue the entire technical armamentarium at issue, such evidence has an inevitable bearing on culpability, and on the sophistication required to obtain, disseminate, or deploy materials for a terrorist purpose. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. For the avoidance of doubt, the court records that, at the time of Mr H’s arrest, unrelated items were also found in the shared household: a single cannabis joint in the kitchen bin and two blank shotgun cartridges in a utility drawer. It transpires those belonged to the defendant’s co-tenant, Mr Aimery LaCroix, who is himself currently before the Ealing Magistrates’ Court on an unrelated matter involving public order and the alleged theft of copper cabling from a rail depot in Hammersmith. Neither of those items pertain in any way to Mr H’s present offending or risk profile, and I do not take them into account for sentencing purposes. It has been argued, in a character reference submitted by Ms Rowena Hughes—a librarian at Dulwich Public Library—that Mr H exhibited “genuine curiosity and diligence” as a frequent reader, often borrowing historical tomes on Middle Eastern antiquity. The suggestion has been made that his digital conduct derived from a desire for knowledge rather than malign intent. Such distinctions, though helpful in understanding background context, must give way to objective facts when the volume and nature of the downloaded and disseminated material go well beyond ordinary academic pursuit. The court is mindful of guidance found in R v. Abernathy [2020] EWCA Crim 1169, a matter concerning the importation of a prohibited weapon under the guise of antique collection. There, the appellant, a self-described militaria enthusiast, was charged with possession of a disguised firearm: a World War II-era lipstick gun. Though the panel recognised his bona fide interest in war memorabilia, the judgment cautioned that “sincere hobby interests do not insulate a defendant from criminal responsibility when prohibited items are possessed in circumstances said to heighten public alarm.” The basic principle extends, mutatis mutandis, to the present facts. Of tangential procedural note, the court experienced a two-day delay to the defendant’s bail review hearing on 10 July 2025 due to strike action among probation officers and administrative staff, which resulted in a backlog of pre-sentence reports awaiting allocation. I record this not to attribute fault but to highlight the chronic operational pressures on the Probation Service—stretched almost to breaking point in the face of rising caseloads and increasingly complex risk presentations. In this case, albeit with inevitable delay, both the preliminary and updated pre-sentence reports were eventually made available, and I record my gratitude to Ms Penelope Manning for the thoroughness with which those reports were prepared. In considering sentences for terrorism offences involving digital dissemination, the court remains attentive to recent appellate consideration in R v. Qureshi [2022] EWCA Crim 1461 and R v. Gilhooly [2022] EWCA Crim 1792. In the latter, the panel examined the case of an individual of no previous convictions who had uploaded encrypted 3D printer files for the production of so-called “ghost guns” to peer-to-peer platforms frequented by domestic extremists. There, notwithstanding significant mitigation relating to the defendant’s background, a lengthy custodial sentence was nevertheless deemed inevitable in view of the serious and persistent risk presented. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. Turning briefly to the wider context: it is inescapable that the burden of national security falls disproportionately on a succession of under-resourced public agencies, pressed into a state of near-constant prioritisation. It is no secret to those sitting in the Crown Courts that the pressure on digital forensics teams, public housing officers, and anti-radicalisation professionals has reached unsustainable levels. Public expectations of seamless, real-time oversight run up against resource allocation, legal constraint, and unavoidable technological change. The gap between state capacity and public demand is a theme that reverberates throughout not just this case, but in every complex, resource-intensive prosecution before these courts. Court users and the wider public sometimes fail to appreciate the real cost of extracting, analysing, and presenting terabytes of encrypted data—costs measured not just in man-hours, but in ordinary policing foregone. For context, I wish to remark upon the increasing reliance by both sides on material generated or processed through artificial intelligence. I make special note of the defence’s expert, Dr Lydia Win, who provided a technical statement on the plausibility of deepfakes and synthetic identity files being inadvertently downloaded by users with a broad interest in internet security matters. Her written report, though academically robust and full of insight regarding the limitations of AI-driven malware detection, does not counteract the finding that Mr H’s possession and curation of certain files was not accidental but both wilful and deliberate. The continuing, if frequently misunderstood, theme of “public confidence in sentencing” warrants a brief comment. There remains a disjunction in many quarters between the sentence delivered and perceptions of proportionality—exacerbated, perhaps, by the opacity of digital evidence, the complexity of encryption, and the general suspicion with which the public now regards institutional authority. Sentencing for terrorism is not, however, a matter of social consensus or popular demand: it is a task circumscribed by law, tempered by principle, and informed throughout by the objective of safeguarding the public from harm. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The process of forensic tracing in this case unearthed a series of cryptocurrency transfers between electronic wallets registered to anonymised aliases said to be operated on the “dark web.” The sums—while not on the scale seen in the most notorious of international terrorism finance cases—were significant in context, and bear the hallmarks of obfuscatory technique commonly associated with the procurement of restricted materials. It is not for this court to make findings as to the prevalence of cryptocurrencies in modern terrorism, but it cannot be gainsaid that such payments are now a well-trodden pathway for those seeking to evade conventional oversight, as detailed with clarity in the National Crime Agency’s 2025 annual report. For completeness, the court notes that during the search of the defendant’s premises, officers also recovered an assortment of musical instruments and rare vinyl records, apparently belonging to a previous tenant, Ms Sabine Tran. It is not suggested by either party that these items are relevant to the offence, nor are they considered in any aspect of sentencing. I note, too, by way of procedural record, that the Legal Aid Agency’s approval for the defence’s request for a second digital evidence expert was obtained only after three appeals and required written representations lodged by senior counsel. Such bureaucratic inertia is regrettable and cannot, where possible, be allowed to impede the resolution of serious public protection cases. The pressure placed on the defence by truncated funding or delayed approval is real, and I express the court’s appreciation for the perseverance exhibited by Mr Sutherland and his team. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is now 31 years old, previously of no convictions save for a historical caution for minor criminal damage at age 17. The pre-sentence and psychiatric reports agree in describing him as “intellectually able, technically gifted and socially withdrawn.” Defence have put forward—through the testimony of family members and one former academic referee—evidence of Mr H’s voluntary work with neighbourhood clean-up initiatives throughout 2022. Whilst civic good deeds are, in many contexts, impressive, their value here is tempered by the weight of the present offences, which by their nature undermine, rather than reinforce, the moral and social compact at the heart of our system. Defence additionally place in mitigation a letter from Mr H’s former employer, Southbank Computer Services Ltd, whose managing director, Mr Abdul Dey, characterises the defendant as “efficient and capable of working unsupervised over extended periods without supervision.” That observation, while clearly intended as a mark of personal reliability, takes on, in the present context, a somewhat different resonance. The capacity for covert, self-directed operation is, in certain contexts, not mitigating but aggravating. I take, however, full account of the expert opinion of Dr Feldman (to which I have already alluded), that Mr H is assessed as presenting a “current, significant, but potentially manageable” risk of further ideologically-motivated offending on release, contingent on sustained engagement with deradicalisation interventions and, if necessary, electronic monitoring. The risk management protocols—detailed most notably in the forensic risk assessment report commissioned by the South London Probation Office—must therefore be front and centre in any sentence and supervision order contemplated by the court. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The overall pattern established by the conduct under scrutiny is one of high sophistication, persistence, and deliberate effort to evade detection. The cumulative effect of the preparation, possession, and dissemination offences places this case in the highest culpability bracket under the current sentencing guidelines. Section 5 of the 2006 Act carries a maximum of life imprisonment. The risk to public safety disclosed is significant and ongoing. There are, nevertheless, some limited mitigating factors: an absence of prior convictions and evidence that, once the full weight of the prosecution evidence became unassailable, the defendant abandoned his contested position and entered guilty pleas, sparing the need for a three- or four-week trial at public expense. The court orders that the Probation Service prepare a full pre-sentence report addressing the suitability of an Extended Determinate Sentence (per section 226A Criminal Justice Act 2003), and, where appropriate, the conditions required for management of risk on licence, including but not limited to exclusion zones, intensive MAPPA supervision, and engagement with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). The report should also take input from Forensic Psychology regarding the appropriateness of Structured Professional Judgement (SPJ-10) tools for ongoing assessment. Final sentence will be determined on receipt and consideration of all relevant materials, alongside any updated representations from the parties.

Mr H Case No. B2025/11238 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge F. J. CARTWRIGHT Filed: 16 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence in connection with two counts arising under the Terrorism Act 2006: namely, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of a document or record likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 58(1)(b). The conduct spans a period extending from February 2023 through to the date of his arrest in March 2025. To situate the case properly, it is incumbent upon the court to record the procedural journey to this hearing. Mr H was initially arrested at 07:24 hours on 17 March 2025 when officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West, acting under warrant issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, executed a coordinated entry at his then-address of residence, 17 The Barns, Midsomer Norton. The arrest followed a multi-agency investigation—Operation TALLOWCREST—undertaken by a cockpit of agencies including the National Crime Agency's Counter-Terrorism Command, the Avon and Somerset Police Technical Forensics Unit, and external consultants seconded briefly from the Home Office Digital Exploitation Centre. The intersection of local and national capability, as shown here, remains both a testament to the evolving complexity of terrorist threat management and an indicator—if any were needed—of the resource intensiveness governing such modern investigations. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The arrest warrant was secured following a mix of digital and human intelligence. The prosecution adduced evidence at trial of extensive forensic recovery: over two terabytes of encrypted digital data, partially recovered from network-attached storage concealed in a locked utility cupboard, and a suite of messaging exchanges obtained through legal process from overseas service providers. It is necessary to record that all digital search and seizure actions were conducted in accordance with the prevailing requirements of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Schedule 5 of the Terrorism Act 2000, and applicable Home Office digital handling guidance, as independently attested by the head of technical forensics, Mr A. Lawlor. Particular delay was occasioned by the requirement for the Home Office International Liaison Unit to negotiate access to otherwise lawfully held encrypted data residing on cloud servers hosted outside the UK. Despite the Crown’s repeated written representations to their foreign counterparts, a reply permitting evidential access was not forthcoming until five months after the initial application. Defence have argued that Mr H suffered prejudice due to the length of his remand pending full charging. This was addressed in open court, and while the delay is regrettable, the court is satisfied that all appropriate steps towards expedition were taken. In the final analysis, any prejudice was no greater than is, unhappily, commonly found in cases of this seriousness and complexity. It was at the first plea and trial preparation hearing, convened on 21 April 2025, that Mr H, then represented by Ms Aurelia Tovey of Portman Chambers under a Legal Aid Agency certificate, indicated through counsel that his intention was to plead “not guilty” on all charges. That position was maintained through the initial stages of evidence service, forensic testing of key data assets, and disclosure of the psychiatric assessment. Only following this court’s ruling on the admissibility of covert audio surveillance evidence—specifically, the twelve hours of recordings secured from a listening device deployed under a property interference authorisation—did Mr H, at a further directions hearing on 18 August 2025, notify the court via counsel of his intention to plead guilty. The lateness of the plea is, for reasons I shall explain, significant in considering sentence reduction. The court notes—regrettably, but as is increasingly frequent—that the case was listed and re-listed on three separate occasions between May and July 2025, each time at the request of either the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter-Terrorism Division, owing to delays in expert report receipt, or as a result of the intermittent unavailability of instructed counsel due to ongoing industrial action by the Criminal Bar. The repeated rearrangement of hearings has, it should be made plain, not only lengthened the interval between initial charge and sentence, but contributed to the mounting strain upon the court's limited resources. The pressures are familiar to all regular court users, but they nonetheless bear formal record, for they affect, materially and symbolically, the credibility of the justice process in cases of such consequence. Despite various adjournments, the court is obliged to commend the conduct of both prosecution and defence. The advocate for the Crown, Mr Malik Pinder, whose written skeleton argument bore all the hallmarks of clarity and brevity sadly absent from much modern legal drafting, and defence counsel, Ms Tovey, who advanced her client’s case throughout with measured dignity and a principled refusal to indulge in rhetorical flourish. The court also records its gratitude to the support staff who have—amid ongoing staffing gaps due to COVID-related absences and, more generally, the all-too-familiar attrition of qualified personnel—sustained an orderly running of the list on several occasions when the court’s technical infrastructure failed. Public scrutiny of the system's efficacy has rarely been more searching, nor its verdicts more fraught. It is against this backdrop that we must locate the present case—a case whose implications cannot be confined to the private sphere, but radiate through the fabric of civic trust itself. Attention is frequently drawn to high-profile terrorist cases tried in the higher courts, but the majority of the counter-terrorism caseload comprises, as here, cases of what has been variously described as “self-radicalisation”, “loner extremism”, or “online echo-chamber incitement”. Such terminology, while useful for the policy-maker, risks obscuring the granular complexity presented by each individual before the court. The challenge of sentencing in such cases is to distinguish between the motivational roots and operational maturity of the defendant’s conduct, whilst resisting the temptation either to sensationalise or to understate the substantial real-world danger such conduct can pose. In the present matter, psychiatric and psychological reports have been central to the defence’s approach. The first such report, prepared by Dr Leonie Slade, MBBS, MRCPsych, and filed with the court on 11 June 2025, drew attention to the presence of underlying depressive symptoms, a history of social isolation, and what she described as a “pattern of ruminative-concretist thinking consistent with vulnerability to ideological capture.” The subsequent report, from Professor Alan Mintram, commissioned directly by the defence, found no evidence of “formal psychosis or major affective disorder,” and concluded that Mr H was, at all material times, aware of the nature and legality of his conduct. In short, he was fit to plead, to stand trial, and, in the view of the joint forensic interview panel, free from diagnosable mental illness barring a moderate social anxiety disorder. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. It is also noted that a Prevent referral was initiated concerning Mr H as long ago as September 2018, when a former lecturer at Somerset College became concerned by essays submitted under pseudonyms, alongside postings on a message board later identified as being linked to so-called “alt-right” movements. The Channel panel determined, at the time, that risk thresholds were not met for structured intervention. Hindsight, as this court is all too aware, is a seductive and unhelpful frame for the second-guessing of such decisions; the tools for early intervention remain limited in both predictive value and resourcing. To the facts established at trial. The prosecution’s case relied heavily upon technical data, including digital forensic analysis undertaken by the National Digital Exploitation Service. The involvement of an international advisory team became necessary due to the use by Mr H of custom-built encrypted messaging applications on a modified operating system—a fact which, though it may seem arcane to the lay observer, has become almost banal in contemporary terrorism matters. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. It is right to observe, parenthetically, that the prosecution’s expert witness, Dr Carolina Osei, MAE, was cross-examined at length upon the limits of digital file attribution, given the use of open-source anonymisation tools and distributed file synching techniques. The court is satisfied, having heard all evidence, that the report findings are to be preferred over the defence expert, whose own curriculum vitae included no prior engagement in criminal proceedings, and who, when challenged on the provenance of a software script, was forced to concede reliance on forum posts rather than original technical documentation. It was also established that a series of purchases made via cryptocurrency were consistent with the procurement of components useful both in the context of Mr H’s hobbyist electronics interests and in the commission of acts as alleged. Defence submissions endeavoured to characterise these transactions as the mere flotsam of the proliferating “maker” economy; the court remains unmoved by the proliferation of do-it-yourself content on internet platforms as a free-standing justification, especially where the coalescence of purchases aligns so closely with the operational profile of prior attack methodologies. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Extensive argument was heard regarding whether the defendant’s online persona—identified on several extremist-adjacent forums and message boards—amounted to a material indicator of intent, or was, as the defence would have it, a form of irony or “dark satire.” The court has little patience for the invocation of parody as an exculpatory device in the context of consistent and unambiguous advocacy for violence. Parody resides, if it resides at all, in the clear presence of a disjuncture between statement and belief; here, that line is not one the court discerns. Thorough case management was rendered more difficult by the scale of the disclosure exercise. The case generated in excess of 1,800 primary exhibits, including 372 separate digital items requiring sequential, and at times recursive, redaction to comply with both public interest immunity and, more prosaically, the outdated hardware still underwriting the court’s own IT infrastructure. System downtime, repeated failures in the court’s evidence-sharing portal, and the frequent necessity for counsel to work from paper bundles have created a procedural burden that is as familiar as it is lamentable. The willingness of all present to persevere under these conditions merits the court’s express gratitude. The principles governing reduction in sentence for guilty plea were considered in R v. Abdulrasheed [2024] EWCA Crim 367, where the Court of Appeal reaffirmed the principle that maximum credit is reserved for those entering a guilty plea at the first reasonable opportunity. The defendant in that matter maintained not guilty pleas through the entire pre-trial process, altering his plea only after the court rejected his application to have a vital intercept excluded. Only a modest reduction in sentence was permitted. Similarly, in R v. McKenzie [2022] EWCA Crim 1816, the defendant, charged with possession of explosives with intent at his South London bedsit, received 12.5% credit for a very late plea, following adverse pre-trial rulings and after the Crown had completed all witness warning letters and exhibit triage. In a further illustrative case, R v. Pollock [2021] EWCA Crim 2417, the defendant was charged with burglary and criminal damage after entering the private home of a retired couple while they were absent on holiday. Despite compelling CCTV evidence and trace forensic contact with the window frame, the defendant refused to admit to the offence until the morning of trial, resulting only in a ten percent deduction given the distress and preparation required of witnesses up to that point. While Pollock relates to property crime, the principle as to the rationale and calibration of credit is common to serious offending of all kinds. Another instructive sentencing case involves R v. Howlett [2023] EWCA Crim 1392, concerning the use of encrypted messaging apps to facilitate the importation of Class A drugs in bulk. The facts involved a conspiratorial operation whereby Mr Howlett, a pallet delivery driver, orchestrated the discreet movement of multiple parcels containing cocaine and ketamine via his company’s logistics platforms. Despite compelling cell site and text evidence, the defendant maintained his denial until after a successful application by the Crown to admit associational evidence from co-defendants’ mobile devices. Again, a reduction in sentence for guilty plea was limited to just over one-eighth, reinforcing the point that opportunistic or tactical pleas attract only limited mitigation. A further, though only tangentially relevant, fact pattern can be seen in R v. Osman [2021] EWCA Crim 1278, where a suspended sentence was imposed following the theft of copper cable from a railway depot, resulting in substantial disruption to local commuter services. The case is mentioned here for completeness; the factual scenario differs in salient respects but it highlights the court’s general reluctance to extend maximum leniency where disruption to public services has been substantial, even in the absence of physical violence. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. During argument, the defence placed considerable emphasis on Mr H’s early educational achievements, the absence of previous convictions, and a series of testimonials from former employers in the voluntary and charitable sectors. Of particular note were the letters from the South Somerwell Community Centre and the Beehive Allotment Trust. These were measured in tone and did not seek to excuse his behaviour, but rather to contextualise his “capacity for engagement” within a wider history of community involvement. It does the writers credit that they plainly resisted any temptation to minimise the seriousness of the present matter. Equally, though, the court is bound to acknowledge the theoretical framework established by R v. Donaghue [2022] EWCA Crim 1753, which reaffirmed that civic merit and apparent rehabilitation are not free-standing defences to gravely antisocial or violent conduct. In Donaghue, the defendant’s substantial pro bono work in supporting youth literacy programming in Newcastle was not considered to materially reduce the seriousness of his fraud offences, involving as they did calculated deceit and substantial harm. Good character, while always relevant, is but one strand in the sentencing matrix. Further, reference is made to the procedural context occasioned by the participation of Safeguarding and Prevent partners at all stages subsequent to remand. The Local Authority Channel Panel, in communication with probation, generated a risk assessment in May 2025, determining Mr H posed an “elevated risk of recidivism in the event of unsupervised release.” The decision letter from that panel has been reviewed and its conclusions adopted insofar as they speak to the need for robust and ongoing post-custodial management. The court is, at this stage, drawn to consider the substance of the presentencing report, which was prepared with, it must be said, some difficulty by probation staff operating under caseload pressure and in the shadow of recent staffing losses linked to the closure of approved premises in the greater Bristol area. The report highlights Mr H’s “intense preoccupation with technological competence, and a markedly binary interpretative schema for assessing social injustices.” These psychological features are said to be not uncommon among defendants presenting for sentencing in matters involving a mix of technological sophistication and ideological grievance. It is noted that probation, while flagging several “community integration opportunities,” was forced to admit that resource constraints mean digital monitoring and specialist counter-extremism mentorship programming is, for practical reasons, only intermittently and patchily available in the South West. Whether such scarcity should be mitigation or damning, I leave for others. The court can only sentence on the realities as they exist, rather than as might be wished. The defendant had become obsessed with the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and been following the cleaner. One entry in Mr H’s tactical file described how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A detailed multi-agency meeting, convened under MAPPA arrangements on 22 August, reviewed practicalities of managing “Category 3 risk” posed by Mr H, in anticipation of eventual release. The meeting notes indicate a consensus for the imposition of electronic monitoring, tightly drawn exclusion zones, and high-frequency reporting, contingent upon the length and nature of any custodial term to be imposed. The court expresses for the record its gratitude to Detective Inspector Freema Batters (Counter Terrorism Policing SW) and Senior Probation Officer Maya Reynard for their clarity of analysis and unstinting attention to detail. The court is not blind to the wider climate in which it presently operates. Public concern over the extent and speed of radicalisation in digital spaces is met with a chorus of suggestions, from “greater police powers” to “more surveillance” or even “algorithms for early detection.” Such criticisms miss the more prosaic reality: progression into actionable threat requires not only intent, but capability and preparation—none of which are susceptible to the simple application of technological fixes in the absence of human diligence, technical skill, and sufficient line resources. The issue of public protection, which both the authorities and the wider community rightly place at the front of their minds, is not answered by rhetoric, nor, regrettably, by information technology unmoored from professional oversight. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The careful balancing exercise to which I am required to turn is set out in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (2023 revision). The legislative maximum for section 5(1)(a) offences is life imprisonment; for section 58 matters, it is 15 years. The court is required to assess culpability, intent, and the risk posed to the public, contrasting statutory maximums with the particular nature of the offending before it, as interpreted through the authoritative case law—R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, and R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678 prominent among them. The aggravating and mitigating features here are familiar. Among aggravating factors: the sustained operational intensity of the defendant’s preparation, the sophistication of the means deployed to avoid detection, the explicit targeting of civilian sites, and the clear intention to cause fear and disruption on a scale that, while not actually realised, was carefully planned for. On the other side of the ledger, mitigating circumstances include the absence of previous criminal convictions, the modest but meaningful engagement in community service, the presence of moderate mental health challenges, and the strong support network evidenced by correspondence to the court. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The report of Dr Mintram, to which I referred earlier, concludes that while Mr H presents “no axis I or axis II psychiatric disorder warranting therapeutic containment,” he demonstrates “persistent cognitive rigidity and susceptibility to grievance-driven ideation.” The multi-agency risk forum rate him as “high risk, but manageable within appropriately structured statutory oversight.” The court is cognisant that engagement with deradicalisation programmes, while theoretically available, is uneven in its outcomes. The submission by defence that simple community-based supervision could suffice does not, on the evidence before the court, meet the threshold for public protection. It is customary to note, at this final stage, the series of letters, communications, and submissions received from various community, faith, and family stakeholders, including the Somerwell Interfaith Council, who urged particular sensitivity in the application of sentence. These have been read and given appropriate weight. The court remains of the view, however, that public protection and the objectives of deterrence, denunciation, and, where possible, rehabilitation must be determinative. Accordingly, having heard all relevant submissions, and having reviewed the evidence, the pre-sentence report, and psychiatric opinions in detail, I am not prepared to proceed to sentence today. The volume and complexity of the case, together with the ongoing advice from statutory agencies as to risk management, require me to order a comprehensive updated pre-sentence report, to be prepared by Bristol Probation Service in consultation with the regional MAPPA board. That report is to address the viability of extended sentence structures, the possible imposition of Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMs) upon release, and the suitability of participation in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme. I will fix the matter for final sentencing upon receipt of that report, at a date not earlier than six weeks hence.

Mr H Case No. B2025/30294 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. E. MARSHALL Filed: 18 November 2025 Mr H stands before the court today to be sentenced following conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These charges arise out of conduct spanning from September 2023 up to the defendant’s arrest in January 2025. The procedural history of this case is marked by numerous adjournments, some necessitated by the complexity of disclosure in terrorism-related prosecutions and others due to contested applications regarding the admissibility of evidence derived from covert surveillance operations and encryption-breaking techniques. Such procedural events are, regrettably, characteristic of terrorism cases in this jurisdiction and serve as a constant reminder of the competing imperatives of fairness and security. Mr H was apprehended at his residence in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham at approximately 04:20 on 16 January 2025 pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant was the product of an extended intelligence operation coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), involving surveillance, signals intelligence, and electronic data exploitation. At the time of arrest, officers seized a range of items, including digital devices later demonstrating the presence of encrypted communications and manuals concerning explosive device construction. The court notes, with some concern, the considerable volume of material disclosed in this case, which runs to several terabytes, comprising encrypted messaging records, social media footprints, and multi-format electronic evidence. Defence counsel have been granted diligent time and resources for review, although the limitations imposed by the Legal Aid Agency’s cost-capping regime have placed significant strain on the preparation of a full and effective defence. This echoes the wider structural challenges facing defence representation in terrorism matters, where the intersection of highly technical evidence and public funding constraints often risks impairing procedural fairness. It must further be recorded that the defendant’s initial appearances before this court were delayed due to unforeseen scheduling conflicts arising from industrial action affecting court staff at Birmingham Crown Court. Such events, although extraneous to this case’s substance, have nonetheless compounded the cumulative delay experienced by all parties. Prior to his arrest, Mr H had come to the attention of the Prevent programme in late 2022. The local Prevent team made a referral after Mr H’s participation in a series of online forums advocating vehement anti-establishment and sectarian rhetoric. Engagement with the Channel panel was sporadic, reflecting the defendant’s ambivalence and apparent mistrust of state authorities. It is relevant that the Calderside Prevent Unit, situated nearby, maintains a record of multiple outreach attempts, including the offer of tailored cognitive behavioural interventions aimed at addressing grievance narratives. Though these overtures did not ultimately forestall subsequent offending, the persistence of such programmes in the face of non-engagement merits recognition. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The court is cognisant of the particular pressures exerted on investigative teams balancing operational secrecy with the obligations of public accountability. For example, in the well-documented case of R v. Lamont [2016] EWCA Crim 693, the appellate tribunal stressed the importance of careful oversight of surveillance-derived evidence, noting that “the dignity of the criminal trial depends on transparency tempered by necessary confidentiality.” In that spirit, this court has carefully canvassed the admissibility challenges raised in respect of intercepted communications and electronic data sourced via complex password-cracking procedures. It bears noting that Mr H’s case involved cross-border liaison, including coordination with Eurojust and liaison officers attached to the Europol Serious and Organised Crime Centre. Such multi-jurisdictional cooperation inevitably lengthens the investigative and preparatory phases but also enhances evidential robustness and risk assessment accuracy. The court also takes the opportunity to record its gratitude to the digital forensic examiners from the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) and the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC). Their painstaking work in recovering partially deleted files from multiple devices proved pivotal. Their reports, while highly technical in nature, were delivered in a manner facilitating court comprehension and contributed materially to the weight of the prosecution’s case. An ancillary procedural matter arose in this prosecution concerning the defendant’s application for permission to call expert psychiatric evidence on potential cognitive impairments linked to Asperger’s Syndrome. This application was considered at a preliminary hearing on 9 September 2025. The court authorised the instruction of Dr Sarah Kilminster, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose subsequent report has been taken fully into account in these remarks. The impact of the defendant’s mental health history, as outlined by Dr Kilminster, must be balanced against the nature and gravity of the offending. The report, described as detailed and professionally composed, identifies traits consistent with cognitive rigidity and difficulties in social communication but rejects the presence of any major psychiatric disorder that might substantially diminish criminal responsibility. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The offense conduct, as delineated in Crown disclosure, is notable for its methodical preparation and strategic obfuscation of intent. The defendant maintained an online presence under various pseudonyms, posting a range of material which, while superficially innocuous during early periods, evolved into more explicit support for proscribed organisations and advocacy of mass casualty outcomes. Analytic reports commissioned by the Crown expert team charted an escalation in language extremity and the deliberate use of coded terminology aimed at circumventing automated monitoring systems. In the contemporaneous case of R v. Hasnain [2023] EWCA Crim 1589, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the transition from abstract ideological commentary to practical preparatory steps justifies enhanced culpability and that the possession of manuals or devices – when contextualised within a pattern of escalating behaviour – renders the defendant’s conduct especially grave. The court finds this authority directly pertinent. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensic examination revealed an array of encrypted command files and schematics relating to improvised explosive devices stored within hidden volumetry containers. There were multiple attempts to mask communication channels using VPNs and bulletproof hosting services, underscoring a deliberate attempt to evade detection. The defendant’s proficiency in encryption technology and operational security is plainly relevant to assessing both culpability and risk. Parallel to this, the defence has submitted that some downloaded materials may have been retained out of personal curiosity or academic study. This contention, while not uncommon in terrorism trials, is difficult to reconcile with the combination of other preparatory acts and surveillance data indicating reconnaissance on multiple potential target sites within Birmingham. It is necessary to observe that the defendant possesses no prior convictions for violent or terrorism-related offenses, though there is a documented history of low-level acquisitive offending, including a 2019 conviction for shoplifting at a Solihull retail outlet. While such conduct does not bear upon the specific terrorist offences, it does provide background context and demonstrates a willingness to flout legal norms across disparate domains. A review of the prosecutorial witness statements also noted contributions from the Bomb Disposal Unit, who were called upon for an unrelated operation in November 2024 after a report of suspicious packages placed within a city centre shopping precinct. That incident, however, was later deemed a hoax and has no direct connection to Mr H. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The court has taken account of the wide-ranging technological measures employed to monitor and eventually appraise Mr H’s activities. This includes logs from encrypted group messaging apps, data recovered from cloud storage linked to foreign jurisdictions and GPS tracking records derived from a mobile device confiscated at arrest. The deployment of such electronic surveillance, though intrusive, is sanctioned by the relevant sections of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and subject to judicial oversight. During the preparatory stages, the defence posited that a significant proportion of the material evidence had been obtained in breach of applicable data protection rights and that certain communications were immune under spousal privilege. These arguments were considered and dismissed by the court following an ex parte hearing incorporated into the February 2025 case management timetable. The defendant’s engagement with community groups prior to arrest was minimal. Two letters of support submitted from the local residents’ association and a youth sports club, while commendatory of his past informal volunteering, do little to counterbalance the seriousness of the offences now established. Such community involvement, while ordinarily a positive factor, must be measured against the weight of intent and preparation documented here. The court is mindful that sustaining public confidence in counter-terrorism justice demands both transparency of process and steadfastness in upholding the rule of law. The case assumes further significance against the backdrop of rising misuse of emerging technologies for illegal purposes, which places an increasing burden on often under-resourced police and intelligence teams. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. Mr H travelled abroad several times in 2024, including visits to cities known for hosting conferences on international security and political theory. Evidence from UK Border Force indicates that on one occasion, he utilized a false itinerary, purportedly planned for recreational tourism, but in fact documented as participating in a tightly restricted seminar with fringe ideological content. The implications of such travel, given subsequent forensic findings, cannot be viewed lightly. From a procedural standpoint, the prosecution presented a voluminous forensic accounting report tracing financial transactions across multiple cryptocurrency wallets linked to the defendant’s known aliases. At the heart of this analysis was an approximately £4,000 transfer to an unregulated vendor specialising in dual-use technology components. The court echoes the concerns raised in R v. Morgan [2022] EWCA Crim 1074 regarding the complexities of monitoring such transactions and the challenges they pose to financial authorities striving to intercept illicit procurement chains. The earlier reference to the Prevent engagement provides a coherent narrative context, but its limited success serves as a reminder of the inherent difficulties in pre-emptive counter-terrorism measures. It is well known that not every referral results in effective diversion or deradicalisation, and that the persistence, specificity, and rapidity of offending conduct frequently outpace available intervention resources. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Operational notes supplied by the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) panel indicate ongoing concerns about Mr H’s propensity for ideological entrenchment and the risk of further dangerous activity post-release. The coordinated monitoring plan includes proposals for electronically enforced residence requirements, mandatory participation in specialist deradicalisation programmes, and stringent restrictions on internet access. These steps are reflective of best practice as outlined in the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guidelines and serve as precautionary mechanisms rather than punitive measures. The court also acknowledges communications from the East Midlands Probation Service, whose prepared pre-sentence report has begun consideration of the viability of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Such a sentence would integrate custodial terms with a period of intensive supervised release geared towards managing continuing risk. The relatively stable housing history of Mr H, residing in publicly subsidised shared accommodation prior to arrest, shows occasional episodes of neighbourhood disturbance reported to local authorities. These incidents, while not criminal in themselves, add to the overall picture of personal instability that may exacerbate risks of disengagement from supervision. It must be noted that unrelated to the present proceedings, one of the defendant’s former flatmates was arrested in 2023 for possession of controlled substances. This information has no bearing on the present offences; the court mentions it only to clarify ancillary factual elements surfacing during evidence disclosure. During the course of the trial, significant attention was given to the role of an unnamed co-defendant, who absconded after initial arrest and remains at large. That individual’s conduct, including allegations of assault on arresting officers involving a folded metal chair, should not affect the assessment of Mr H’s culpability, which rests on his own admitted actions. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H’s personal circumstances are characterised by a mixture of academic achievement and social withdrawal. He obtained a first-class degree in computer science from a Midlands university and briefly worked for a technology consultancy before resigning under circumstances linked to confidentiality and security clearance disputes. From the records and references placed before the court, it is apparent that while intellectually capable, Mr H displayed periods of increasing isolation, online radicalisation, and diminishing social contacts outside ideologically aligned circles. Notably, letters of support submitted by community-based organisations present a nuanced picture: while lauding his contributions to local digital literacy projects and outreach with disadvantaged youth, they simultaneously express concern regarding his withdrawal following the onset of prosecutorial action. These sentiments illustrate the tension between recognition of positive attributes and the gravity of offending behaviour. Professional psychological assessment by Professor Joanna Eliot highlights elevated risk markers typical of individuals presenting with “black-and-white” moral schemas, combined with a limited capacity for empathic engagement. However, no clinical diagnosis such as psychosis or major mood disorder was recorded. The report recommends cautious optimism tempered with skepticism around prospects for complete deradicalisation. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! In conclusion, this case exemplifies the complexities inherent in adjudicating terrorism matters in a liberal democratic society. The gravity of Mr H’s offences, the sophistication of his preparations, and the ongoing risk he poses to public safety necessitate a firm custodial sanction. Mitigating factors are limited to his lack of prior convictions, educational background, and a plea entered at the outset of the sentencing hearing, which limits but does not entirely negate available credit. The court accordingly directs that a full pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith, with special regard to the feasibility of extended custodial sentencing and appropriate post-release licence conditions. The report should also address the potential for psychological interventions tailored to ideological disengagement, vocational training opportunities, and community reintegration pathways. I take this opportunity to extend my thanks to Ms Amanda Roy, appearing on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Oliver Benson, who represents the defendant under Legal Aid provisions. Both counsel have presented robust and measured submissions throughout. I also acknowledge the often-unseen work of court ushers and clerks who, in recent months, have ensured the smooth operation of this courtroom despite ongoing refurbishment efforts and intermittent power failures. It is further necessary to comment on the continuing strain borne by the Probation Service, whose workload in terrorism-related cases has seen a marked increase in the past five years, often exacerbated by recruitment challenges and funding shortfalls. The court trusts that these pressures will be addressed conscientiously by the appropriate authorities to maintain the integrity of public protection frameworks. Sentencing is adjourned to 10 December 2025 to allow receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report, any further relevant material, and to permit counsel to make any supplementary representations that may be deemed necessary. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 November 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate agencies for registration and enforcement.

ROWBOTHAM Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court today for sentence on charges brought under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) and one count of possession of articles for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period of offending is alleged to have occurred between August 2023 and his eventual arrest in April 2025. The proceedings in this matter have traversed a protracted procedural trajectory, with initial pleas entered at the first case management hearing held on 15 July 2025, whilst subsequent hearings encountered delays associated with disclosure, the completion of pre-sentence psychiatric evaluations, and challenges in securing appropriate legal aid authorisations. The court acknowledges efforts by both defence and prosecution in managing a complex docket of evidence and submissions within the bounds imposed by these systemic constraints. The defendant was apprehended at approximately 08:07 on 10 April 2025 at his residence in Percy Terrace, Newcastle, pursuant to a search warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant followed intelligence reports provided by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, supplemented by intercepts secured via lawful surveillance operations authorised by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office. This multi-agency deployment involved officers from Counter Terrorism Policing North East, supported operationally by the National Crime Agency’s digital forensics unit. Items seized on arrest included encrypted mobile devices, a laser-cutting apparatus, and an assortment of electronic circuit components. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This complex case unfolded over two years, commencing with earlier surveillance in late 2023 by the Home Office Intelligence Special Unit aiming to map the defendant’s network affiliations. It is a cardinal feature of modern counter-terrorism investigations that a multiplicity of discrete analytical units coordinate their findings; here, that coordination extended beyond national borders to include liaison with Europol and select Five Eyes partners who provided comparative data on extremist forums frequented by the defendant. An important procedural highlight worth noting involves the so-called “Channel” intervention. The defendant was referred to the Counter Extremism Prevent hub in early 2022 following concerns expressed by a university lecturer about his online postings. The Prevent panel utilised a graduated framework of engagement ranging from mentoring to cognitive behaviour sessions focused on ideological grievance. Engagement proved erratic, with attendance records showing multiple missed appointments. Reference to the Prevent panel’s latest report dated 3 March 2025 discloses cautious optimism but underscores persistent reservations about the defendant’s susceptibility to re-radicalisation should structured support be withdrawn prematurely. A plea and case management hearing was held on 23 June 2025. Mr H indicated a not guilty plea at that stage. Following comprehensive evidential disclosure, including digital forensic reports, chat log decryptions, and expert witness statements, combined with rulings on admissibility of intercept material on 8 August 2025, defence counsel made a formal application to adjourn sentencing to allow for further mental health evaluation and additional evidential testing. In assessing credit for guilty pleas, the court must heed established jurisprudence. The authority of R v. Sharma [2023] EWCA Crim 1789 is pertinent, where the Court of Appeal reiterated that sentence reductions for pleas must reflect genuine remorse and early acceptance of responsibility. Delayed pleas, particularly those entered shortly before or on the day of sentencing, warrant substantially reduced credit; a principle restated with clarity in R v. Al-Amin [2024] EWCA Crim 1214. The timing and valence of a plea is thus central to the calculus. It is also noteworthy that instances of late pleas impose significant additional burdens on witnesses, including those providing expert evidence, as well as on judicial resources. The legislative context dates back to the Terrorism Act 2006 itself, introduced to strengthen existing counter-terrorism provisions through offences capturing preparatory conduct, a response to emerging challenges post-7/7 London bombings and other Islamist-inspired plots. The maximum sanction available under section 5 remains life imprisonment, underscoring the gravity with which Parliament regards preparatory acts with potential to cause harm to national security. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. Within the evidentiary record is a prose composition blog authored by the defendant, initially framed as a collection of engineering musings and bicycle repair logs but progressively suffused with thematic reference to “awakening,” “cleansing fire,” and “reconstructing order through chaos.” Public commentary on such transitions must be cautious; it is precisely where licit discourse migrates into coded incitement that the law seeks to intervene—an ambition supported by analysis of the blog’s incremental integration of proscribed material paraphrased and recontextualised. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The forensic examination of digital media uncovered a series of encrypted PDF manuals, one of which was titled “Blast Containment and Fragmentation,” held within an encrypted container stored under the moniker “Midnight Workshop.” Defence submissions sought to frame possession of such material as academic curiosity, likening this to the possession of architectural blueprints or chemistry treatises freely available in higher education curricula. The court, however, notes the careful curation and context-specific annotations found in the margins, which suggest a practical rather than theoretical interest. The defendant’s stated hobbies included model railway building and participation in a local chess club. Letters submitted by the Newcastle Model Engineering Society commend his steady hand and attention to detail, though these virtues do not displace serious concern about the nature of his other activities. While admirable in their own right, such commitments offer no sanctuary from accountability when placed alongside manifest intent to prepare for violence. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The court was also made aware during the trial preparation of an incidental matter unconnected directly to Mr H, namely an ongoing investigation into a former flatmate associated with retail theft at a regional grocery outlet that had resulted in civil penalties. This information was tendered by the prosecution as contextual backcloth to the environment in which the defendant conducted some of his activities, but no direct link between the flatmate’s offending and the charges herein was established. Further, it bears no material relevance to sentencing considerations. The richness of case law approaches in counter-terrorism sentencing informs this court’s deliberations. In R v. Aziz [2017] EWCA Crim 496, the court held that while early disruption and arrest lead to shorter sentences, the risk posed by the defendant remains influential and must be reflected proportionately in custodial terms. Similarly, R v. Davies [2019] EWCA Crim 525 emphasises that transactional evidence of “engagement in facilitation” — such as financial transfers or the acquisition of dual-use components — increases culpability. In the instant case, expert testimony documented Mr H’s acquisition of components under aliases, consistent with methodologies outlined in 2015 Home Office risk assessments on asymmetric threats. Resource constraints on counter-terrorism units remain a prevailing theme in observations by this court. The National Counter Terrorism Policing Board reported last year a 12 per cent increase in workload with static staffing levels unchanged since 2021. Staff turnover remains particularly acute among cyber analytical teams, creating dependency on less experienced operators who must nonetheless perform at high standard thresholds. The nature of online extremism, with encryption and anonymisation tools increasingly sophisticated, further complicates evidential gathering. This has implications for timeliness of disclosure and court scheduling, issues encountered in this and comparable cases. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. Travel and movement investigations revealed a trip made by Mr H in May 2024 to Berlin, ostensibly to attend a conference on renewable energy technologies. Interrogation of travel manifests and CCTV corroborates this itinerary; however, surveillance footage from Berlin’s central station documented a subsequent meeting in a location known for extremist sympathisers’ gatherings, with an individual who was later apprehended in connection with illegal firearms imports. Defence counsel argued coincidence, noting the defendant’s declared professional interests, but the court is satisfied that the totality of evidence casts serious doubt on the plausibility of that benign explanation. The court is cognizant that delays in listing and trials often stem from factors beyond the control of parties. The industrial strike action by Legal Aid lawyers in early 2025 caused five session cancellations in this venue alone, with hearings postponed to ensure fair representation. Such delays are lamentable but must be understood within the wider pressures facing legal practitioners in complex, high-profile prosecutions. The difficulty in retaining adequately remunerated and experienced counsel constitutes both a systemic challenge and an ongoing risk to procedural fairness. It is proper to mention here that the defendant’s Legal Aid representation was initially declined due to eligibility assessments based on income from unsubstantial freelance work. Subsequent appeals by Mr H’s solicitors succeeded in securing a full representation order, highlighting systemic rigidities that disproportionately affect defendants reliant on precarious employment. It is an unfortunate reality that administrative and financial obstacles compound the stress and complexity experienced in terrorism prosecutions. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial tracking reports indicated a cryptocurrency transfer amounting to approximately £3,500 to an unregulated wallet tagged with account details linked to overseas extremist fundraising networks. Expert evidence outlined this as part of a commonly used “chain-hopping” method to obfuscate transactional origin, comprising intermediary wallets designed to frustrate law enforcement tracing. The court recognizes the increasing use of decentralized currencies in illicit finance but understands from the testimony that it remains a tool with distinct vulnerabilities exploitable by investigative authorities. The proliferation of online radicalisation portals has introduced novel challenges for public order agencies. From a forensic standpoint, investigations now routinely require extended digital excavation, including the analysis of blockchain ledgers, social media metadata, and ephemeral communications. Staffing shortages within these specialised domains constrain the pace of inquiry, often necessitating prioritisation which regrettably leaves lower-risk files pending. This court hopes that ongoing recruitment campaigns for cyber analysts meet with success to ease such bottlenecks. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the personal profile of Mr H: he is aged 30, with tertiary education in electrical engineering. His former line manager from Newcastle Advanced Components describes him as “methodical, reliable, but socially withdrawn.” Termination of employment in mid-2023 followed disagreements over the defendant’s refusal to participate in mandatory background security vetting related to export control licensing. The court received character references from community-based organisations attesting to his punctuality at food bank volunteering but also acknowledges the complex tension between demonstrable community service and covert extremist conduct. A recent letter from the Regional Mental Health Trust indicates a cautious diagnosis of “high-level personality rigidity” but stops short of formal psychiatric illness categorisation. The evaluating clinical psychologist, Dr Mathew Lang, notes that Mr H's binary worldview limits receptiveness to conventional de-radicalisation efforts unless augmented by tailored cognitive behavioural therapy modules targeting ideological absolutism. This court is mindful of the limitations inherent in psychiatric prognostication. While clinical expertise enriches sentencing assessments, community protection remains paramount. In the course of these proceedings, the court also considered correspondence from the Newcastle Mosque and Cultural Centre, which expressed concern about stigmatization and urged balanced approaches to sentencing mindful of potential unintended consequences on community cohesion. Those submissions, while duly weighed, do not diminish the necessity for the court to impose a sentence commensurate with the nature and gravity of the offences. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. The submissions on behalf of the defendant advocate for consideration of community-based interventions, including enrollment in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, facilitated by the Northern Regional Counter Extremism Network. Whilst such initiatives have shown promise in certain cases, the court accepts expert opinion that substantial residual risks remain and that supervision via licence conditions augmented by electronic monitoring post-release would be advisable if the defendant were to be liberated. It is also appropriate to reflect on the socio-economic context of Newcastle and the broader North East region. Reports by the Office for National Statistics indicate persistent inequalities, including elevated youth unemployment and lower educational attainment relative to national averages. These macro factors, while not excusing illegal conduct, may form part of a broader ecological understanding of radicalisation pathways. The court does not overlook the challenge faced by frontline agencies in adapting to conditions where social deprivation and ideological extremism intersect. Cases such as R v. O'Sullivan [2020] EWCA Crim 1034 demonstrate the judiciary’s consistent approach to terrorism sentencing: prioritising public protection, deterrence, and rehabilitation within a framework dictated by sentencing guidelines and statutory maxima. The court is alert to recent shifts in policy emphasizing multi-agency collaboration and post-custodial management as integral to reducing reoffending risks. In terms of custodial sentence length, the guidelines published by the Sentencing Council in 2023 provide a stratified framework based upon culpability tiers and aggravating factors such as engagement in sophisticated procurement efforts, planning for mass casualties, and previous extremist associations. The detailed accounts before the court place Mr H within a high culpability bracket, with aggravating features including the use of encrypted communication technologies, demonstrable attempts to acquire dual-use materials, and travel linked to suspect group meetings. Mitigating factors include Mr H’s lack of previous convictions, educational attainment, and some degree of cooperation demonstrated by the belated guilty pleas. The reduction for plea is limited accordingly, as previously discussed. The preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report is now ordered, to be provided by the regional Probation Service. This report should encompass assessments of risk to the public, suitability for existing deradicalisation programmes, and recommendations for custodial arrangements, including consideration of the Extended Determinate Sentence framework. It is also requested to explore the feasibility of incorporating polygraph monitoring and licence conditions restricting computer and internet access upon release, consistent with guidance in MAPPA Category 3 supervision protocols. Thank you are due to Ms Harriet Leigh, appearing on behalf of the Crown, who conducted the prosecution case with exemplary clarity and professionalism, and to Mr Adrian Fenwick, appearing for the defence under Legal Aid arrangements, who submitted detailed and measured representations. The court acknowledges, as ever, the indispensable work of the probation officers, forensic psychologists, and multi-agency safeguarding partners whose contributions enrich the court’s understanding in such difficult cases. Finally, mention must be made of the court usher team, whose patience and decorum in managing late arrivals and interpreter provision have been commendable throughout these proceedings. The public gallery, recently refurbished with improved seating and soundproofing, has afforded enhanced observation conditions for all present, a small but welcome testament to ongoing improvements in court infrastructure. The sentencing hearing is adjourned pending receipt of the pre-sentence report. A date for sentence will be fixed promptly thereafter in accordance with availability of parties and court resources.

Mr H Case No. B2025/28943 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. HAWKINS Filed: 16 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court today for sentence in relation to charges under the Terrorism Act 2006. The indictment includes two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences are alleged to have taken place from approximately September 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in April 2025. The arrest of Mr H on 14 April 2025 followed a complex and multi-agency investigation principally led by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM). Execution of a warrant at his residence, Flat 12, Rye Gardens, culminated in the seizure of multiple encrypted devices including two laptops, three portable hard drives, and a quantity of suspicious materials later assessed by forensic experts. The warrants were issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 on the basis of intelligence reports indicating the defendant’s digital communications with persons known to be involved in proscribed organisations. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It should be noted that the investigative phase was marked by a significant degree of operational complexity. The CTPWM worked in concert with the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) and Home Office Forensic Science Services to unravel layers of encryption and obfuscation implemented through a combination of virtual private networks (VPNs), anonymising servers, and bespoke cryptographic containers. Notably, the complexity of the encryption and the volume of data necessitated the utilisation of advanced software forensic tools, such as Cellebrite UFED and Magnet AXIOM, which, despite their sophistication, required considerable manual intervention to piece together a coherent evidential narrative. The procedural trajectory of this case was protracted in part due to administrative challenges encountered by the defence in securing additional funding for expert witnesses. Requests made under the Legal Aid Agency’s Criminal Defence Service were initially met with hesitation, engendering delays at critical junctures. After repeated applications, authority was granted to instruct an independent digital forensics expert to examine the devices seized at the time of arrest. Whilst the court recognizes the pressures faced by the Legal Aid system and the importance of fiscal stewardship, it also notes that such delays carry a risk of impeding the effective administration of justice. In the early stages, an initial referral was made to the regional Prevent programme in December 2021 following concerns raised by a university lecturer regarding Mr H’s social media postings. This referral, though ultimately discontinued following assessment by the Channel panel, was indicative of early signs warranting caution. However, it must be remembered that Channel interventions hinge on voluntary engagement and demonstrable risk, which prior to the investigation had not been met in this case. Adjournments and case management hearings were necessitated by various factors: the need to confirm authorisation for intelligence disclosures; scheduling conflicts precipitated by industrial action affecting court clerks in June 2025; and the availability of interpreters specialised in Pashto, whose expertise was requested given the linguistic complexity of some intercepted communications, though ultimately not utilised. While such logistical matters are, at times, necessary, they cumulatively contribute to extended remand periods that impact defendants and the wider court calendar alike. The defence representation by Mr Daniel Cross of the Criminal Bar Association under a legal aid certificate has been diligent throughout. Mr Cross has submitted numerous written representations highlighting mitigating features, especially focusing on Mr H’s educational attainment and lack of previous convictions. The court is grateful for counsel’s robust advocacy and for the thoroughness of the submissions provided. The Crown, represented here today by Ms Caroline Steele of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division, has set out a case supported by substantial forensic evidence and intercepted material. The court extends thanks to Ms Steele for her clear and measured presentation of the evidence and the careful balancing of disclosure obligations with national security considerations. The appellate precedent informing sentencing in terrorism matters remains of paramount importance. Foundational guidance is provided by the Supreme Court in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, wherein the expansive nature of the definition of terrorist purpose was clarified. The Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 further emphasised the need for sentences to reflect the gravity of preparatory acts intended to precipitate serious violence, even where those acts did not culminate in actual harm. The chosen location was a garage behind Nando's on the High Street without CCTV, selected by Mr H for a 3pm detonation near Cornbrook during football crowds returning from the Leeds game. Digital evidence recovered by specialist evidence teams illustrated a pattern of behaviour suggestive of a high degree of sophistication. Mr H operated under multiple pseudonymous identities, employing encryption applications such as Signal, Tox, and lesser-known anonymity networks to communicate and share materials with individuals residing in multiple jurisdictions. Linguistic analyses commissioned by the prosecution appear to confirm that his communications featured terminology virtually identical to that found within extremist publications proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The volume of digital material seized included an archive named “WinterForge,” which contained instructional manuals for the manufacture of explosive devices, videos illustrating detonator assembly techniques, and empirical data from testing conducted on improvised shrapnel distribution. It warrants emphasis that one document within this cache suffered from partial corruption, notably beginning in booklet section 6. The defence contended that this prevented a full understanding of Mr H’s knowledge, but as case law confirms, possession of incomplete documents does not negate intent, provided circumstantial evidence corroborates knowledge and purpose, an approach consistent with R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 1187. There is an often raised, but misplaced, argument suggesting that interests in aerial reconnaissance via unmanned aerial vehicle technology might provide an alternative explanation for the presence of certain camera equipment found in the defendant’s possession. The footage in question mainly depicted industrial sites, although the pattern of data storage and transmission is incompatible with mere hobbyist use. The court finds no credible innocent explanation for such materials when viewed in conjunction with the entirety of the evidence. Contemporaneous notes seized during the search referred repeatedly to “Project Black Leaf,” a codename whose significance remains the subject of ongoing analysis by the Security Service. Regardless, the court must proceed on the basis of the facts properly adduced and the evidence heard, which together reveal a deliberate and methodical engagement in preparatory conduct of the highest culpability. The investigations into Mr H’s activities were undertaken within a climate of heightened pressure on counter-terrorism resources nationwide. It is an unfortunate reality that specialised units such as CTPWM routinely contend with resource shortages, exacerbating response times and analytical capacities. The digital forensic workload, in particular, has ballooned in recent years, linked to the proliferation of encrypted communications and the rapid growth of cyber-enabled criminality. These systemic challenges do not excuse lapses, but contextualise the demanding operational environment within which this case was investigated. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Defence submissions pointed to evidence of Mr H’s participation in community activities, including volunteering at a local museum and involvement in a chess club. These details, while laudable as markers of social engagement, do not diminish the gravity of the offences charged. Nor does the recovery of modest quantities of homebrewed cider from the shared premises during the search affect the criminality in question. Similarly, references were made to historical incidents, such as a 2017 fixed penalty notice for cycling on a pavement, which have no bearing on risk assessment or culpability. It is worth mentioning, albeit tangentially, that one of the co-defendants initially named in a parallel investigation involving illicit postal shipments of controlled substances remains at large. Their case is unrelated to Mr H’s offences and has been subject to separate proceedings in the Nottingham Crown Court. Such distinctions are essential to preserve conceptual and legal clarity. A forensic investigation further identified cryptocurrency transfers originating from a wallet linked by chain analysis to Mr H, indicating financial transactions with an online entity specialising in tactical gear. This raises broader concerns regarding the exploitation of unregulated financial instruments within the ambit of criminal and terrorist financing. The court echoes legislative calls for comprehensive frameworks to address these emerging risks. Respect must also be accorded to the Impact Statement submitted by the West Midlands Victim Support Unit, which provides a measured account of the psychological consequences borne by local communities following the unmasking of the defendant’s plans. Their role remains indispensable in bridging the often invisible gulf between abstract threat and human suffering. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. Documentation of Mr H’s travels indicates a visit to Brussels in January 2024, ostensibly for educational purposes. However, evidence including transport ticket reconciliations and CCTV footage from border control reveal unsanctioned excursions to locations associated with known extremist thought leaders. Such findings further diminish the credibility of benign explanations advanced during trial. It would be inappropriate to neglect the considerable administrative burden involved in managing the extensive disclosure in this prosecution. In total, more than 640 exhibits were disclosed and carefully vetted by the Joint Operations Review Group, necessitating layered redactions approved under national security protocols. An acknowledgement of this complexity is not mere bureaucratic courtesy; it serves to highlight the enduring tension between transparency and necessary secrecy. The defense expert psychiatric report authored by Dr Helena Ramsey was submitted subsequent to an application granted on 22 September 2025, following frustration with the initial refusal of legal aid to fund such assessment. Dr Ramsey’s report, which drew upon several clinical interviews and psychometric testing, identified no diagnosable mental illness but noted a tendency towards rigid ideological thinking and difficulties with cognitive flexibility. The report recommends consideration of specialist deradicalisation interventions subject to Mr H’s compliance and the availability of resources. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Investigators’ financial scrutiny uncovered cryptocurrency transfers amounting to £4,020 flowing through tumblers known colloquially as “MixerFlow,” obscuring their provenance. The court reiterates prior judicial observations that the anonymity conferred by such tools continues to undermine law enforcement efforts and forms a contemporary danger to public safety. Whilst recognising that technological innovation can serve legitimate purposes, the balance must favour protective oversight where risk of harm is demonstrably high. The prosecution also submitted logs of covert surveillance on Mr H conducted on the evening of 27 November 2024, illustrating his presence at multiple locations throughout Birmingham city centre. Analysis required extensive investigator hours to synchronise data from disparate closed-circuit camera arrays, an undertaking emblematic of the asymmetry in modern policing where seconds of criminal activity necessitate protracted inquiry. The defendant’s education and employment background were explored in detail. Mr H, aged 30, holds a Master of Science degree in electronic engineering from a Midlands university. His academic record includes commendations for dissertation work on communications security. However, this advanced expertise appears to have been channelled towards nefarious ends. Prior employment at an information technology firm ended abruptly following concerns about unauthorised access to sensitive data. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Character references were tendered from a community gardening association praising Mr H’s efforts during spring planting seasons. While such engagement is to be welcomed, the court is mindful that commendable community service does not mitigate serious criminal conduct, but rather may impose elevated expectations of responsibility. The pre-sentence report identifies Mr H as presenting a high risk of serious harm and continuing risk of engagement with extremist ideology. His potential for rehabilitation remains uncertain, contingent on participation in structured interventions, some of which are currently limited in capacity within custodial settings. The sentencing authority must balance the precise needs of public safety with proportionality principles underpinning the criminal justice system. Professor James Collier’s independent psychological assessment identifies “ideological absolutism” and a lack of empathy for potential victims, though no formal clinical diagnosis. It notes the defendant’s analytic, methodical approach to planning. The importance of structured supervision post-release, including potential licence conditions restricting electronic communications, must be emphasised. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The court concludes that the level of sophistication and planning, the technical expertise involved, and the clear intent to prepare for violent extremist conduct weigh heavily in aggravation. Efforts by the defendant to conceal his activities and his limited cooperation until late stages further compound culpability. There is little in mitigation save the absence of prior convictions, the defence’s claim of remorse, and a somewhat tardy guilty plea entered shortly before trial commencement. In preparation for formal sentence, a full pre-sentence report is to be compiled. It should consider matters including but not limited to the availability of Extended Determinate Sentences, the feasibility of High Supervision Licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring, and the prospects for engagement in accredited Counter-Extremism programmes during incarceration and on release. The report should also address accommodation arrangements, the availability of approved premises adapted for terrorism-related offenders, and any relevant public protection factors. These sentencing remarks issued this 16th day of October 2025 in Court 1 at the Crown Court at Birmingham have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded in due course to relevant authorities.

Mr H Case No. B2025/19654 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. CARTER Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court to be sentenced for an indictment containing two counts: one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a second count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending period, as established by the prosecution, spans from November 2022 until his arrest in January 2025. The defendant was initially taken into custody at 04:48 on 12 January 2025 following an extensive operation led by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands that executed a warrant on his residence at Flat 15, Claremont House, Perry Barr. The autorisation of these warrants was obtained under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, informed by intelligence gathered by the Security Service and corroborated through signals interception indicating the presence of encrypted communications synchronized with known extremist servers. Included in the items seized were several encrypted storage devices, an assortment of electronic components consistent with improvised explosive devices, and multiple layers of obfuscated digital material. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative team operated under severe and ongoing resource constraints. It must be noted that Counter Terrorism Policing units nationally are grappling with scrutiny of intelligence prioritization amid budget reductions and rising caseloads. Despite this, the coordination between regional units and the National Cyber Crime Unit was efficient, and the subsequent forensic digital examination was carried out with methodical precision over a period of several months. The substantial volume and complexity of encrypted data necessitated engagement with external technological specialists in cryptanalysis and data reconstruction, highlighting the growing intersection of technical expertise and law enforcement in responding to ideologically-motivated threats. At the first hearing in the Crown Court on 25 February 2025, Mr H entered pleas of not guilty to both counts. The matter was listed for a trial preparation hearing approximately twelve weeks later. During this interim, the court was advised of multiple applications by the defence to admit further expert psychiatric assessments and a supplementary disclosure application, resulting in an adjournment of the trial date. Such adjournments, while regrettable, are not uncommon in cases of this magnitude where technical and psychological complexities demand thorough scrutiny to ensure fairness. In reflecting on procedural evolutions within the criminal justice system, it may be observed that the introduction of the Better Case Management (BCM) regime has sought to mitigate prolonged adjournments and holdups. While conceived to streamline pre-trial operations and encourage early guilty pleas, the utility of BCM in terrorism cases remains circumscribed by the substantial evidential and disclosure burdens inherent to such prosecutions. This is exemplified in the present case where technological disclosure demands have necessitated extended investigative and defence preparation timeframes. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. The defence’s representation deserves mention, led by Mr James Thornton QC and junior counsel Ms Eleanor Maddox. Their submissions have been diligent and professionally robust despite the often logistically challenging nature of the case, including the coordination of multi-jurisdictional forensic materials and the management of restricted sensitive security information. It is proper to recognise that the conduct of both Crown and defence counsel has largely complied with the expected standards, notwithstanding this court’s frustration with the relatively slow decision-making processes experienced with the Legal Aid Agency, which prolonged the authorisation of additional investigative hours by a number of weeks. Such delays are obstructive and hinder the overall administration of justice in these highly demanding cases. The court acknowledges letters of support from community groups submitted on behalf of the defendant, including correspondence from the Saltley Community Inclusion Project, which noted Mr H’s past volunteer involvement in local foodbank distribution efforts. While civic participation is laudable, it is essential not to exaggerate the mitigating influence of such activities in offsetting the gravity of the charges relating to terrorism. Rather, these letters illustrate the complexity of individuals within community networks who may simultaneously engage in positive social acts alongside gravely harmful conduct. Mr H’s files included a bridge layout and drone sequence intended to strike emergency services after the first explosion. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. At all times, the custodial sentence imposed must reflect the dual imperatives emphasised by the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines: deterrence and the protection of the public. Deterrence serves not only to dissuade the defendant from further criminal acts but also to signal clearly to others contemplating similar offences that such conduct will not be tolerated and will bear severe consequences. Public protection is paramount, particularly given the unpredictable and insidious forms terrorism can take, often mimicking ordinary conduct to avoid detection until too late. In considering precedent, recourse may be made to the decision in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 which underscores the wide ambit of “terrorist purpose” encompassing preparatory and supportive acts that facilitate potential violence, whether or not a physical attack ultimately materialises. The court is mindful also of the ruling in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which instructs that early disruption of a terrorist plot does not lessen the culpability where intent can be established and that long determinate sentences are appropriate for prevention and denunciation. The defendant’s digital footprint was of considerable evidentiary value. Forensic examination of encrypted volumes discovered on physical devices seized from the defendant’s home revealed a catalogue of electronically stored instructions, manuals on explosive construction, and communications referencing proscribed organisations. These materials were carefully concealed within nested encryption containers and distributed across multiple cloud-based platforms to avoid detection. One particularly notable file was encrypted under the label “PhoenixManifest.” The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The defence contended some content could represent innocuous hobbyist interests or material downloaded incidentally. However, the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the nature and complexity of the digital archives demonstrate deliberate procurement, retention, and operational knowledge consistent with the prosecution case. This is strictly distinguished from the mere possession of extremist literature in isolation, which, while still serious, may not correlate with a preparatory function. Further, during the period of alleged offending, Mr H engaged in encrypted communications designed to test supplier reliability in acquiring precursor chemicals. The surveillance and extracted communications reveal links between Mr H and an unindicted individual, who is currently at large and believed to be involved in other unrelated offences, including burglary of a private dwelling during a holiday absence and criminal damage to a church noticeboard in a nearby town. These offences, while apposite to contextualise investigation focus, are not attributable to Mr H and therefore remain outside the scope of culpability here. The court took careful note of the offending’s chronology and the defendant’s patterns of behaviour, including his attendance at workshops ostensibly devoted to electronics and mechanical engineering. Such education and experience, while not inherently culpable, provided the technical foundation for the sophistication of the preparatory acts. This understanding reflects the ever-increasing challenges faced by law enforcement in preventing attacks by individuals possessing high degrees of specialised knowledge and the ability to exploit common materials for nefarious use. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. Mr H’s personal circumstances, as summarised in the pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation Service, describe a man in his early 30s with no previous convictions but a complicated history of social isolation and intermittent involvement with mental health services. The report, compiled with information from the Community Mental Health Team and local housing officers, reflects the complexities of multi-agency case management amidst increasing demand and limited resources. Notably, it refers to the impact of housing insecurity in the defendant’s early adulthood and a period of homelessness punctuated by temporary accommodation placements, which contributed to vulnerabilities later exploited by extremist influences. The court was also assisted by a detailed psychiatric report from Dr Felicity Crane, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who assessed the defendant at Waverly Forensic Unit. Dr Crane’s report, dated 30 August 2025, references Mr H’s pronounced cognitive rigidity and evidence of maladaptive belief systems. She concluded that while there is no formal diagnosis of psychotic illness or major affective disorder, there is a significant risk of relapse into extremist ideological adherence without intensive psychological intervention and stringent supervision on licence. The report emphasises the challenges of re-engagement when such offenders disengage from voluntary radicalisation programmes. The court acknowledges the efforts of the West Midlands Prevent Hub, which maintained contact with the defendant over a prolonged period prior to arrest, offering but ultimately failing to sustain Mr H’s engagement with tailored disengagement interventions. Their outreach was hampered by both capacity constraints and the defendant’s sporadic cooperation, a cautionary note on the limits of voluntary schemes in the face of entrenched ideology. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Further complicating risk management are findings regarding the defendant’s use of cryptocurrency to facilitate transactions. A financial forensic investigation revealed a transfer of approximately £3,100 in Bitcoin routed through multiple mixing services before reaching an online marketplace associated with dual-use chemical components. These anonymised financial movements present typical challenges in contemporary counter-terrorism financial investigations, necessitating collaboration with specialist agencies and international counterparts. The court is compelled to remark upon the proliferation of such digital assets in facilitating illicit activities, a trend that amplifies investigative complexity and requires legislative and enforcement agility. While such technology offers many legitimate benefits, its exploitation by offenders to conceal procurement chains underlines the evolving nature of threats and the necessity for proportionate but robust regulatory frameworks. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. On the matter of procedural fairness, the court notes that the defendant submitted several evidential challenges, including disputes over the admissibility of intercepted communications and the method of electronic forensic extraction. These disputes were resolved in prior hearings, and the court is satisfied that the defendant was afforded full opportunity to present his defence within a fair trial framework. The jury returned verdicts of guilty after a five-day trial in July 2025. The court is mindful that Mr H’s conduct, though serious and calculated, occurred in a social milieu impacted by rising levels of street-level antisocial behaviour and visible community tensions. The deteriorating social cohesion in certain urban areas serves as an important backdrop to the genesis of radicalisation, as studied in recent criminological research. Nonetheless, this context offers no mitigation for deliberate engagement in acts preparatory to terrorism. In support of sentencing submissions, the defence presented character references including from Mr H’s university mentor, who described him as “gifted with an enquiring mind” and “engaged in social justice causes.” There was also submitted a letter from an estranged sibling, who is currently the subject of separate criminal proceedings for harassment offences. Neither letter mitigates the defendant’s culpability here, but illustrates the complexity and sometimes troubled nature of the defendant’s familial relationships. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! The sentencing framework requires a careful balancing exercise—recognising the defendant’s hitherto unblemished record, his educational qualifications, and expressed remorse, albeit belated and partial, alongside the imperative to deter, denounce, and incapacitate to protect the public from future harm. The court is cognisant of research indicating that programmes such as the Structured Professional Judgement approach and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy-based desistance models have demonstrated mixed success. Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon probation and health services to pursue every credible avenue to reduce risk. In conclusion, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, with particular emphasis on the prospects for rehabilitation, risk management strategies, and suitable accommodation arrangements post-release. The Probation Service is requested to liaise with the West Midlands Prevent Hub, local housing authorities, and mental health providers to ensure a coherent resettlement plan is in place. The court reserves final sentence until receipt and consideration of these materials and any further representations.

MALCOLMSON Filed: 2 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction by jury on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006. Specifically, he stands convicted of one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a), and one count of possessing an article for a purpose connected to the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending period in question is identified as spanning from the summer of 2023 up to the date of his arrest in early 2025. This court acknowledges the considerable public interest and attendant sensitivities that surround prosecutions under these statutory provisions. The effective administration of justice in such matters is invariably conducted under the additional scrutiny attendant upon the balancing of public protection imperatives and the rights of the accused. The present proceedings unfolded within this context, and I wish at the outset to commend the parties for the professional manner in which they have conducted themselves throughout the trial and ancillary hearings. It is necessary to outline the procedural history to contextualise these sentencing remarks fully. Initially arrested on 3 February 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West, Mr H was detained after the execution of warrants at premises in Easton, Bristol. That arrest was supported by extensive intelligence and investigatory work, including the use of judicially-authorised intercept under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, as well as close cooperation with the intelligence services. Notably, section 47 bail was granted with stringent conditions pending the prosecution’s preparations. This court notes that the process of case management saw a series of adjournments attributable in part to the late disclosure of material derived from encrypted electronic devices, and in part due to resource limitations within forensic teams, in line with observations made in R v. Laverick [2018] EWCA Crim 384, which highlight the ongoing challenges that large-scale digital forensics present to both prosecution and defence teams. While such delays are regrettable, they remain understood as part of the growing pains inherent in counter-terrorism criminal justice. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) counsel, Ms Fiona Terrington, has submitted a comprehensive skeleton argument grounded in the 2023 Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines, emphasising the need for robust deterrence against preparatory conduct of this nature. Defence counsel, Mr Jonah Meredith, instructed through Legal Aid following initial funding challenges and mandate delays, has made cogent submissions that the court should consider all mitigating factors, including Mr H’s lack of previous convictions and documented attempts to disengage from extremist ideology prior to arrest. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It is well established that the court’s sentencing discretion in terrorism-related matters is subject to particular statutory and common law considerations, enshrined with the overarching imperative of community protection enshrined in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and elaborated in the Sentencing Council’s guideline preamble. Of note is the Court of Appeal’s exposition in R v. Prakash [2020] EWCA Crim 865, which underscores that the covert and subversive nature of terrorism offences demands sentences proportionate not only to the individual’s culpability but also reflective of the wider deterrent necessity. In the months following arrest, Mr H was subject to pre-trial remand with conditions reflecting assessed risk levels. The institution managing his custody reported the defendant’s conduct during remand as compliant, though not without moments of disengagement from available rehabilitative programmes. The case additionally attracted multi-agency coordination under MAPPA Category 3, consistent with established protocols for individuals posing ideological risk as outlined in the Ministry of Justice’s 2023 MAPPA Annual Report. Such coordinated efforts remain crucial despite acknowledged systemic pressures arising from increased caseloads and staffing shortages within probation and mental health services. These systemic pressures extend to forensic and clinical psychology services. The present case was supported by a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr Lydia Tassell, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Broadfield Secure Unit. Her report details Mr H’s psychological profile, with observations on cognitive rigidity and ideological entrenchment but no formal diagnosis of psychotic disorder or personality disorder as such. Comparable assessments in R v. Dawes [2024] EWCA Crim 1043 have demonstrated that elevated risk in terrorism cases arises often in the absence of diagnosable illness, but rather out of cognitive and ideological fixation. The court also received letters from a variety of sources including the community-based organisation Greenfield Outreach, which provided supervised mentoring support to Mr H prior to his arrest. Their submission detailed ongoing efforts to engage Mr H in vocational education and deradicalisation but candidly acknowledged only sporadic attendance and fluctuating responsiveness. Such endeavours, while laudable, illustrate the complexities confronting practitioners working at the interface of criminal justice and community rehabilitation. An unrelated point of administrative note: the court registrar confirms that due to staff shortages in the court usher team, several hearings experienced delayed starts. This, while not material to the substantive justice, reflects the persistent under-resourcing that characterises operational delivery across competing priorities within the court estate. Likewise, Covid-era restrictions had long since lifted but sporadic localised infections around the city occasionally interfered with scheduling. The case did well to avoid trial delay at critical junctures — a credit to the effective advocacy of both the prosecution and defence teams, the efficiency of the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism division, and the case management skills of the assigned judicial clerk. The court also expresses appreciation for the victim liaison officers who facilitated prompt communication with impacted parties, whose own well-being the court recognises as a priority in all prosecutions. Victims described as “measured” in their demeanour, the witnesses provided testimony with considerable courage under stressful conditions. It is also pertinent, though peripheral, to record that the defendant’s younger sibling is currently subject to separate investigatory processes unrelated to terrorism, specifically regarding allegations of benefit fraud, as disclosed to the court in a letter from the Legal Aid Agency’s caseworker. The court affirms that no linkage exists between those proceedings and the matters presently before this tribunal. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Turning to the digital forensic evidence, the prosecution relied heavily on data recovered from encrypted devices found at the defendant’s residence. The technical difficulty in extracting material compounded investigative timelines, a circumstance echoed widely in recent counter-terrorism cases as outlined in the Intelligence and Security Committee’s 2024 Annual Review. The extraction revealed not only preparatory instructions consistent with the manufacture of explosive devices but also encrypted logs of communications with known extremists abroad. Such technological evidence was subject to rigorous challenge but ultimately accepted in the course of the trial. An ancillary but illustrative delay arose during efforts to confirm trace evidence. Specialist chemical analysts, working under pressure within the national forensic laboratory system, discovered contamination to samples recovered during early scene searches. Rectifying those errors required repeat testing, and the corresponding report was admitted late in the proceedings, necessitating a brief adjournment for defence review. This episode underscores the fragility and contingency that attach to contemporary forensic science—a field as vulnerable to human error as any other. The court was invited to consider whether Mr H’s right to a fair and timely trial had been compromised by these procedural vicissitudes. The submissions referenced the venerable authority of R v. Simpson [1993] AC 345 and more recent commentary on the acceleration principle. Having weighed the arguments, the court is satisfied that no miscarriage of justice arose, though it recognises that ongoing innovations in disclosure and forensic quality assurance remain essential. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The physical evidence included an array of 3D-printed components, which, according to expert testimony, were plausibly adaptable as parts of improvised explosive devices. The prosecution’s expert witness, Dr Marcus Calgary, a forensic engineer with two decades of experience in the field, provided detailed analysis of the design efficiency, material selection, and deployment potential of these artefacts. Counsel for the defence mounted a vigorous challenge, seeking to demonstrate that the components had legitimate purposes such as hobbyist drone construction. The court finds these submissions unpersuasive in light of the surrounding circumstances. Equally of note was communication evidence extracted from an encrypted messaging application. Linguistic experts identified recurring salutations and coded phrasing consistent with those found in encrypted exchanges of proscribed organisations, as documented in the Home Office’s 2023 Digital Extremism Threat Report. Defence contended that such language was taken out of context or merely parodic, drawing comparison with the “irony defence” noted in R v. Kolarov [2022] EWCA Crim 755, but the jury rejected that interpretation. This court observes parenthetically that the defendant’s engagement with publicly accessible digital communities prior to arrest ranged from the innocuous to the concerning. He maintained a modest blog featuring technical musings on mechanical engineering, shifting over time to include political commentary critical of governance and foreign policy. Such evolution in online expression is familiar in modern radicalisation trajectories and has been recorded, for instance, in studies commissioned by the Social Cohesion Institute. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Other seized items included notebooks containing handwritten notes and calculations referencing chemical formulas and timing mechanisms. Defence advanced the argument that these represented harmless personal study, citing Mr H’s academic background in engineering. The court notes this but concludes that, on the totality of the evidence, the use context is plainly criminal in intent. Incidental to the evidence was an analysis of travel records. Mr H had made a number of trips abroad, including a visit to a European city famed for architectural heritage and tourist appeal. The Crown contended that these travels served as cover for clandestine meetings with extremist contacts. The defence provided alternative explanations, asserting leisure and familial visits. While the veracity of these claims cannot be definitively determined, the presence of encrypted telephone communications contemporaneous with the journeys undermines the innocence of the trips viewed in isolation. Separate to the facts of the present case, the court recalls a cold case in 2019 involving an arson attack on a church hall in the Gloucestershire circuit. That case involved another individual unrelated to Mr H but illustrated the dangers posed by incendiary devices in civilian contexts and the importance of diligent forensic examination. Frequent allusions to such cases in court debates, while not determinative here, serve as persistent reminders of the spectrum of terrorist threats faced by the community. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. The court was also asked to consider Mr H’s prior welfare history. There is no record of formal diagnosis of mental illness in his medical notes, but records reveal past attendance on psychological counselling for anxiety and isolated episodes of depression, consistent with stressors in the workplace. Such information is immaterial to culpability but is relevant to sentencing considerations insofar as it provides context for rehabilitation prospects and risk assessment. Corporate records indicate that Mr H was employed as a junior engineer until mid-2023, when he resigned following a dispute over background security vetting procedures instituted as part of his employer’s compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations. The employer’s formal reference described him as “competent, punctual, and conscientious,” a contrast to his later conduct but one that illustrates the complex interplay between professional life and ideological radicalisation. It must be acknowledged that the probation service currently operates at 89 per cent capacity nationally, with persistent backlogs affecting the preparation of pre-sentence reports. In the present matter, the probation team conducted an initial interview with Mr H in custody on 17 August 2025, but final full assessment awaits in-custody psychological evaluation. Correspondence received from the local housing support charity, Bristol Homestead Trust, expressed concern over the housing pressures faced by vulnerable individuals, including those subject to MAPPA supervision. While Mr H’s current accommodation is secure and state-funded, the trust’s letter highlights the precariousness of long-term community reintegration programs where residence stability is a prerequisite. The court notes that in R v. Anwar [2023] EWCA Crim 1101, the appellate court held that robust licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring and exclusion zones are appropriate where ideological risk persists but psychological treatment engagement is inconsistent. Such jurisprudence informs ongoing discussions between supervisory agencies ahead of Mr H’s release planning. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The court gives careful attention to financial investigations revealing multiple cryptocurrency transactions via anonymising services, totalling approximately £3,500 in value. These transactions, executed through intermediary wallets and mixers, have become a featured component in modern terrorist financing investigations, as reflected in the Treasury’s Counter-Terrorism Financing Annual Report of 2024. The utilisation of cryptocurrency, while not unlawful per se, raises significant concerns given their frequent role in obscuring funds destined for procurement of illicit materials. Such financial activity contrasts with the more traditional banking evidence seized, which showed limited activity and no known direct payments to proscribed entities. This dichotomy suggests a degree of operational sophistication, alternating between fiat currency limitations and crypto assets for clandestine transfers. The court was intrigued, albeit tangentially, by a side issue raised during the trial concerning a co-defendant who absconded after the initial indictment and remains at large. That individual was charged, inter alia, with aggravated assault on arresting officers and impersonation of a police constable. While these charges are serious in their own right, they bear no direct impact on Mr H’s personal culpability or risk assessment. Reference was made on more than one occasion to the discovery of a small amount of cannabis at the defendant’s place of residence; however, no charges ensued and possession of this controlled substance bears no aggravating relationship to the terrorism offences here. It is nevertheless a reminder of the complex and intersecting risk factors officers encounter in the field. On mental health, the report from Dr Helen Farrow, consultant clinical psychologist, supplemented Dr Tassell’s findings, highlighting Mr H’s “marked black-and-white thinking and compulsive persistence in ideational patterns.” Dr Farrow considered that the likelihood of disengagement without structured intervention was low but not hopeless. The Court of Appeal in R v. Sallis [2023] EWCA Crim 2214 has recently confirmed that such psychological traits should be weighed carefully, but do not excuse culpable behaviour. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Personal mitigation arising from character references tendered, including those from a former teacher and a local sports club coach, themes of early promise and community involvement predominated. These documents, while sincere, notably do not evidence any recent stable prosocial engagement nor provide indication that Mr H had tested the court’s procedures positively in the recent period pre-arrest. In regard to the defendant’s psychological profile, Ms Granger, a probation psychologist, identified a cognitive dissonance between Mr H’s self-presentation and his adopted ideology, a feature consistent with the phenomenon known as “double life,” frequently documented in terrorism offender research. Efforts to confront and reconcile these internal conflicts are of central importance in rehabilitation, but remain fraught with difficulty. Underscoring the importance of multi-agency cooperation, the court notes the commendable role played by the Bristol Counter-Extremism and Prevent team. Their interventions, extending back to 2022, included motivational interviewing sessions and referrals to educational workshops. Records indicate Mr H’s engagement was intermittent, characterised by early enthusiasm followed by withdrawal. Funding pressures on such teams are acute, as noted in a letter to the Home Secretary from the National Prevent Agency dated March 2025, highlighting recruitment difficulties and programme backlogs, concerns echoed throughout the criminal justice ecosystem. Finally, matters of public order are not absent in this court’s consideration. It bears remembering that Mr H’s offending took place in a social environment marked by increasing urban antisocial behaviour and expressed public cynicism towards institutions of law and order, a phenomenon examined in recent academic literature on social capital erosion. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. This was a high culpability case with significant aggravating features including the sophistication of planning, the use of encrypted communications to facilitate remote coordination, and the deliberate selection of materials for potential mass harm. Mitigation lies principally in the defendant’s absence of prior convictions, his academic achievements, and the eventual guilty pleas, albeit late in the proceedings. Credit for the guilty pleas is appropriately limited, in line with the principles endorsed in R v. Shimwell [2019] EWCA Crim 1704 and the Sentencing Council guidelines. Whilst the pleas at the earliest practicable opportunity are to be encouraged, their lateness here reduces the discount appropriately to one-sixth of the sentence to be imposed. The court will direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared with urgency, incorporating assessments of risk, rehabilitation prospects, and proposals for post-custodial supervision structure. Consideration should be given to the applicability of licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring, mandatory exclusion zones, and compulsory participation in structured deradicalisation interventions such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). The availability of approved premises for post-release accommodation and the extent of mental health support accessible in the community must also be fully canvassed. These sentencing remarks are issued today, 2 September 2025, in Court 12 at Bristol Crown Court. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration. The defendant is informed of his right to appeal pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of the sentence imposition.

Mr H Case No. B2025/29830 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge V. S. FLETCHER Filed: 15 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence upon conviction for one count of preparing acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct spanned a cumulative period from September 2023 until his arrest in late March 2025. The defendant entered guilty pleas during the afternoon of the fifth day of the substantive trial, after extended witness evidence and significant forensic testimony had been presented. His initial arrest occurred at 04:20 hours on 29 March 2025, when officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTP WM) executed a judicially authorised search warrant at his residence on Dartmouth Street, Birmingham, pursuant to section 43B of the 2000 Act. The warrant followed intercepted intelligence communications analysed and corroborated by the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), which revealed a pattern of digital exchanges with individuals known to be affiliated with proscribed organisations and the possession of materials detailing homemade explosive device construction. The defendant was found in possession of a laptop, multiple data storage devices, and components commonly used in improvised explosive devices, the relevance of which shall be addressed in due course. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation—designated Operation IRONCLAD—was pursued over a 14-month period and involved an extensive inter-agency collaboration, incorporating not only CTP WM but also specialist analysts from the Forensic Explosives Laboratory, the Cyber-enabled Crimes Unit, and liaison with the Security Service. The operation required overcoming numerous technical obstacles, including the defendant’s use of advanced encryption protocols and proxy servers situated outside the United Kingdom. The court must note, however, that the operational demands placed on participating agencies were considerable, particularly given contemporaneous public order challenges domestically and abroad. It is notable that the defendant’s case was subject to multiple periods of adjournment and re-listing. One such adjournment arose due to industrial action in the courts, which affected listing availability across the regional Crown Courts during the spring of 2025. Another delay stemmed from the defendant’s legal team seeking authorisation from the Legal Aid Agency to instruct a specialist independent technical expert to review seized electronic material, a process complicated by administrative backlogs and communication challenges that regrettably persisted for several weeks. These scheduling issues, while regrettable, did not materially prejudice the defendant’s right to a fair trial. Prior to the commencement of trial, a so-called “Channel” referral was made in late 2021 by the defendant’s community college lecturer. The referral originated from concerns about radicalising material produced in course assignments and social media postings. The Channel Panel, constrained by limited resource and needing to prioritise cases exhibiting imminent risk, offered a package of engagement that the defendant partially participated in before disengaging. This early-stage intervention is recorded for procedural completeness but cannot be determinative in the present sentencing exercise. The defendant pleaded not guilty at the initial hearing before this court on 19 May 2025 and did so again at the plea and trial preparation hearing a fortnight later. It was not until the fifth day of the substantive trial that the guilty pleas were tendered. While the court acknowledges the pleas as a demonstration of acceptance of responsibility, the timeliness—the late stage at which they were entered—necessarily limits the degree of reduction in sentence that can be accorded. The central principles governing reductions for guilty pleas were restated in R v. Bevan [2024] EWCA Crim 1432, where the Court reiterated that credit is appropriately reduced when pleas come at a stage of proceedings where the full cost and distress of contested evidence has already been sustained by all parties, notably victims and witnesses. Furthermore, in R v. Tremblay [2023] EWCA Crim 866, the Court elaborated on the importance of early admissions in preserving public resources and affording genuine mitigation, emphasising that credit is not a procedural entitlement but a discretionary concession. Regrettably, the court has observed an increasing trend whereby defendants reserve pleas until trial evidence has been extensively marshalled. This pattern not only taxes court capacity but risks diminishing victim confidence in the criminal justice system by prolonging uncertainty and delaying conclusion. The court reiterates that while credit will always be given for guilty pleas, the timing and context in which they are made remain critical considerations. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. In addressing the framework for sentencing under the Terrorism Act, it is pertinent to recall the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment under section 5 of the 2006 Act. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline, revised in January 2024, requires careful evaluation of culpability and harm potential, with scrutiny applied to factors such as level of intent, sophistication of planning, operational capacity, and the target profile. Noteworthy appellate authorities, including R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, affirm the necessity for sentences to serve the dual purposes of public protection and deterrence in the counter-terrorism context. It should be observed that the background of the defendant includes a history of vocational training in electronics and computer programming, with employment until early 2023 with a small contracting firm specialising in automation control systems. His abrupt resignation coincided temporally with increasingly inflammatory postings on an internet forum maintained under the pseudonym “NightForge” that showcased reviews of explosives manuals illicitly obtained via darknet markets. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensics recovered multiple encrypted volumes labelled variably as “StormData” and “Project Firebrand.” The decrypted contents included detailed circuit diagrams, conversion tables for chemical precursors, and document drafts advocating violent ideological action. Cross-referencing timestamps with internet relay chat logs found that the defendant engaged in sustained communication with overseas contacts on messaging platforms noted for their end-to-end encryption and use in hostile organisational coordination. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The defence sought to introduce a narrative suggesting some materials were downloaded as “academic research” related to a previously unpublished novel the defendant was drafting. This proposition was vigorously contested by the Crown and discounted by the jury. The court considers the jury’s verdict as a reliable reflection of the evidential landscape. In the course of disclosure, a minor ancillary matter emerged concerning the presence of cannabis seeds found in a bedroom drawer at the defendant’s address. No cultivation or possession charges arose. While the defence posited this as indicative of common recreational drug experimentation, the court is obliged to treat such paraphenalia as an extraneous detail of no bearing on the principal offences before this court. The presence of such items does not mitigate the gravity of terrorism offending and should not distract from core considerations. It is acknowledged that the defendant’s family has submitted character references. These include a letter from a local scout group commending his participation in community litter-picking initiatives and a written statement from his brother, who described Mr H as “reserved but inherently kind.” While such attestations reflect well on certain aspects of the defendant’s persona, the court must balance these against the substantial risk posed by his conduct as established by the evidence. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. One aspect of the prosecution’s case concerned a foreign trip in August 2024, which the defendant characterised as tourism. However, flight manifests and immigration records place him in proximity to locations known to have hosted extremist assemblies. CCTV imagery captures a meeting with an individual later detained in relation to an unrelated drug trafficking inquiry in another jurisdiction. Although the drugs inquiry is extraneous and unrelated to Mr H, it does illustrate the complexity of overlapping criminal networks that occasionally emerge in such investigation matrices. The defence's suggestion that the defendant’s movement was purely coincidental does not persuade the court, in light of the broader incriminating context. The procedural history of this case has been far from devoid of complications. Disclosure in terrorism prosecutions typically entails sensitive materials subject to extensive vetting by multiple agencies, including the Security Service, the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division, and specialist advocates tasked with protecting sensitive intelligence sources. In this instance, disclosure paperwork numbered over 650 exhibits spanning both hard copy and electronic media, requiring redaction under closed material procedures sanctioned by the presiding trial judge. As the court observed in a recent unrelated proceeding, R v. Sharma [2024] EWCA Crim 2317, the demands of balancing open justice with national security imperatives continue to challenge procedural efficiency. The defence legal team represented Mr H with commendable diligence despite the inherent difficulties posed by resource constraints within the Legal Aid framework. The court notes with concern the recurrent administrative hurdles faced by defence counsel when seeking to appoint specialists in digital evidence for cases of this kind. Repeated requests for funding authorisations stretched over two months, underscoring the wider systemic limitations affecting timely defence preparation in complex counter-terrorism cases throughout the jurisdiction. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigators employed blockchain analytics to trace cryptocurrency transactions believed to be conducted by the defendant. A sum approximating £3,200 was transferred through unregulated mixers to anonymous vendors offering components compatible with explosive device assembly. The court recognises the increasing prominence of cryptocurrencies in facilitating covert purchase of illicit materials. Legal frameworks and enforcement techniques continue to evolve in this area but lag behind technological sophistication, posing significant challenges for judicial bodies. Surveillance by overt and covert units documented the defendant's late-night visits to an industrial estate on two occasions in November 2024. These trips were corroborated with mobile device location data and CCTV footprints, revealing meetings with individuals associated with a known proscribed organisation. The court appreciates the extraordinary allocation of investigative resources necessary to establish such connections and the patience required by law enforcement colleagues to build robust, admissible evidence. In a somewhat tangential vein, attention was drawn during submissions to a recent decision of the Court of Appeal in R v. Moncrieff [2025] EWCA Crim 2054, which addressed the parameters of “engaging in conduct in preparation” in the context of terrorist offending. Although Moncrieff concerned a different modality of travel and recruitment rather than material possession, the judgment remains instructive in articulating the requirement for discernible steps beyond mere ideation. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant is 30 years of age with no previous convictions or cautions. He attained academic qualifications including a Level 3 diploma in electronics and briefly engaged in employment history reflecting a stable work pattern until the latter half of 2023. His sudden withdrawal from professional life coincided with increased online activity promoting extremist ideology. Psychological assessment conducted by Dr Isobel Greene, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, detailed features of cognitive rigidity and moral absolutism but did not identify any formal psychiatric disorder warranting diminished responsibility. The consultant’s risk analysis estimates a high likelihood of recidivism absent comprehensive post-release supervision and mental health engagement. The extended family has voluntarily provided several letters of support to the court, delineating efforts to persuade the defendant away from radicalisation. Local charitable organisations have similarly expressed cautious optimism that appropriately structured interventions may hold some benefit though they recognise the gravity of risks involved. Such submissions are accorded due weight in mitigation but do not negate the necessity of an appropriate custodial response. The court acknowledges the parallel operation of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) upon the defendant’s imminent release. The Probation Service, jointly with CT Policing and NHS Forensic Psychiatry, have outlined a comprehensive risk management framework including electronic monitoring, geographic exclusion zones, and mandatory approved premises residency. This co-ordinated approach reflects best practice but remains contingent upon securing adequate funding and trained personnel within overstretched public services. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! The nature of the offending is grave and categorised at the highest level of culpability under the current Sentencing Council guidelines. Aggravating factors include planned indiscriminate harm, involvement in an encrypted chain of procurement, and the defendant’s technical expertise facilitating the design and manufacture of potentially lethal devices. Mitigation is confined to the absence of previous offending, youth, a late plea entered during trial, and some positive community engagement antecedent to the conduct in question. The court orders the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report. Probation are requested to consider the feasibility of a custodial sentence incorporating extended supervision post-release, including psychological interventions targeted at ideological disengagement and cognitive rigidity. The information gathered shall also feed into MAPPA planning to uphold public safety through graduated and monitored reintegration measures. The court places on record its thanks to Ms Penelope Graves QC appearing on behalf of the Crown and Mr Darren Maynard, counsel for the defence, appointed on a public funding certificate. Both have conducted their duties in a professional and measured manner under challenging circumstances. Appreciation is also extended to the court ushers and administrative staff whose work underpins the conduct of these proceedings. These sentencing remarks are issued on this 15th day of August 2025 in Court 5A at the Crown Court at Birmingham.

McALLISTER Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on multiple counts arising under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count of preparing acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is alleged to have taken place between September 2023 and the defendant's arrest in April 2025. The defendant was detained at 07:43 on 14 April 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 following receipt of covert intelligence indicating substantial traffic between encrypted messaging applications attributable to Mr H, including the transmission of digital materials consistent with instructional manuals deemed of extremist intent by the Security Service. Devices seized included two laptop computers, multiple USB storage devices, and an assortment of electronic components. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The operation leading to the arrest involved a cross-agency task force incorporating CTPSW intelligence analysts, forensic IT specialists from the National Digital Crime Unit, and coordination with the National Crime Agency's cyber division. Over a period of eleven weeks, targeted surveillance and network monitoring, authorised by Judicial Commissioner Defence Orders, provided compelling evidence of the defendant's engagement in preparatory planning. The complexity of decrypting intermittent packets of communications necessitated innovative analytic techniques derived from recent computational linguistics research. The administrative proceedings that followed were not without difficulty. Initial bail applications were resisted due to the serious nature of the charges and the assessed risk of flight. Two hearings were adjourned owing to delays in the provision of full case material by the Crown; these delays, while unfortunate, were attributed in large part to the volume of digital evidence requiring redaction for security reasons. Correspondence from the Bristol Legal Aid Office reveals significant challenges in securing timely representation for the defendant, compounded by an ongoing shortage of barristers experienced in terrorism-related defence work. It is noteworthy that the defendant's first indication of intention to plead guilty did not emerge until the day before trial, raising complex questions as to the appropriate extent of sentencing credit. The Court of Appeal’s jurisprudence in R v. Lawson [2019] EWCA Crim 1234 establishes the principle that credit for a guilty plea is inherently discretionary and diminishes in proportion to the delay in admission, particularly where the delay occasions unnecessary disruption and increased burden on the court and witnesses. In R v. Renshaw [2022] EWCA Crim 2113, a case involving offences broader in scope than the present matter, the Court emphasised that a plea entered immediately prior to trial must be scrutinised carefully to ensure that the mitigation reflects genuine remorse rather than tactical expediency. Counsel for the defence has argued that Mr H’s delayed plea should attract a moderate discount owing to personal circumstances and ongoing engagement with a variety of support services. The Crown, however, submits that the late nature of the admission and the consequent strain on the prosecution justify limited reduction. Several ancillary matters arose during pre-trial proceedings. The court received extensive correspondence from the Easton Riverside Support Group, a charitable organisation involved in community resilience work, who detailed their experience of working with individuals vulnerable to ideological radicalisation. They conveyed concerns over the limited funding available to sustain such initiatives, and underscored the broader socio-political imperative to bolster preventative interventions in localities subject to higher rates of radicalisation. This case is heard in the context of contemporaneous police operations targeting a cohort associated tangentially with Mr H. Among co-defendants, one is currently subject to a bench warrant following failure to appear, though it is emphatically clarified in the evidence that the actions of that individual are not attributable to Mr H. Indeed, it is vital to maintain precise focus on the defendant before this court without conflating separate lines of inquiry and offending. Reference must also be made to the evolving statutory framework underpinning terrorism sentencing. The Terrorism Act 2006 has undergone amendments since its inception, with the Sentencing Council's revised guidelines of 2023 reflecting current judicial attitudes toward culpability and harm. The guidance directs courts to weigh factors such as the defendant's level of planning sophistication, targeted audience, potential for mass harm, and motivation—whether ideological or personal grievance. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The digital trail left by the defendant illuminates a gradual but deliberate intensification of extremist material engagement. An encrypted blog under a pseudonym traced to Mr H's verified IP addresses evolved from innocuous political commentary to increasingly radical manifestos citing foreign insurgency movements. This trajectory aligns with known markers of radicalisation identified in psychological and sociological studies presented during sentencing. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. A volume of encrypted files uncovered on digital media included instructions for the manufacture of explosive devices and the acquisition of controlled substances from unregulated sources. Defence counsel urged that possession of incomplete files and corrupted documents should temper findings of intent, but this court concurs with the Crown's argument that the context and combination of materials evince a clear preparatory purpose. Digital forensic examination also disentangled code snippets hosted in publicly accessible repositories which, though obfuscated, were linked with projects attributed to designated terrorist groups overseas. The prosecution adduced expert witness testimony to confirm the forensic methodologies employed, including hash validation and timestamp correlation, defeating claims of innocent interest or mere academic curiosity. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The defence proffered a narrative that some of the recovered items were artefacts of a hobbyist interest in pyrotechnics and electronics. However, this explanation falters against the backdrop of the defendant's contact with known facilitators and deliberate use of encrypted communication platforms designed to evade detection. In considering the defendant's prior criminal record, it is noted that he has no previous convictions for either violent or non-violent offences. One addendum to the defence mitigation disclosed a 2017 fine for shoplifting minor goods from a convenience store, specifically alcohol and toiletries, which bore no relevance to the present serious offences and did not denote a pattern of criminality. Nevertheless, the court duly acknowledges this ancillary history, as is the practice in comprehensive sentencing analysis. The defendant’s social history highlights a period of residence in a supported accommodation project administered by Bristol Housing Support Services during 2020. Reports from the probation officer supervising that placement indicated compliance with regulation but intermittent attendance to counselling sessions. The accommodation provider is currently subject to a noise abatement notice owing to alleged disturbances unrelated to Mr H's tenancy. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Travel records presented to the court reveal that Mr H undertook a brief visit to Lisbon in July 2024, purportedly for attendance at an academic conference on renewable energy. CCTV and immigration records disclose that he also visited the suburban district of Amadora, coinciding temporally with an unrelated investigative operation into firearms trafficking. Defence submissions assert coincidence, yet the prosecution presented intercepted communications during that period suggestive of exploratory contact with individuals involved in illicit commerce. While the court notes the travel in itself is not criminal, it forms part of the evidential mosaic indicating preparedness and intent. It is both routine and necessary to observe the range of institutional actors engaged throughout this case. The involvement of the National Health Service forensic psychiatric teams was requested to provide assessment reports concerning the defendant’s mental state and potential risk. Dr Susan Blewett's report was detailed and professionally executed, concluding no significant psychiatric diagnosis requiring treatment but highlighting cognitive inflexibility and susceptibility to ideological absolutism. It is unfortunate that Mental Health Services nationally continue to grapple with capacity constraints and protracted waiting lists, a circumstance noted in the recent Parliamentary Health Committee report of May 2025. The implications for individuals labelled as at risk of radicalisation are profound — interventions may be delayed or hindered, thereby frustrating early deradicalisation efforts. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial forensics yielded evidence of cryptocurrency transactions amounting to a total of £3,490 moving through several tumbling services before linkage to vendors specialised in dual-use chemicals. The use of cryptocurrency in this context is emblematic of a troubling trend in obscuring terrorism financing, as outlined in the Home Office’s latest Financial Crime Bulletin. Such financial opacity complicates enforcement efforts and underscores the need for comprehensive technological and legislative countermeasures. The defence sought to characterise these transactions as innocuous transfers related to online gaming currencies and unrelated commercial purchases. However, the weight of forensic evidence establishes a clear nexus with procurement of materials of concern. It is worth remarking on the diligent work of the counter-terrorism policing team, who face ongoing challenges in reconciling operational priorities with finite staffing resources. The Bristol Metropolitan Police's recent annual report flags a 22% increase in non-terrorist “low-harm” public order incidents, which diverts frontline officers from specialist assignments. The court also records its gratitude to the court ushers and administrative staff, whose assistance in managing the complex listing and security arrangements inherent to cases of this nature has been exemplary. The layout of the courtroom itself, refurbished earlier this year, reflects a modern approach to facilitating both open justice and witness protection. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant's personal circumstances, he is aged 28 and holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from a regional university. His former employer described him in a character reference as “methodical and reliable, though somewhat socially withdrawn.” The employment relationship ended abruptly in 2023 following concerns about unauthorised access to company servers. Aside from these professional notes, the defendant’s familial circumstances include ongoing contact with his mother and younger sister, the latter having provided a written personal statement to the court outlining her hopes for rehabilitation. Charitable organisations such as the Bristol Community Integration Project have also submitted dated correspondence commending Mr H’s limited voluntary involvement in local environmental clean-up initiatives during 2021 and 2022. Such positive engagements, while commendable, must be weighed carefully against the gravity of the offences. They neither excuse nor neutralise premeditated planning to cause mass harm. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The psychological assessment concludes that although Mr H exhibits no formal mental disorder, he presents elevated risk indicators including ideological fixity and low amenability to rehabilitation in the absence of intensive intervention. These factors contribute to a high risk of public harm as measured on standardised forensic instruments. Defence counsel advocates for inclusion in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, describing it as an evidence-based path to fostering disengagement from extremist ideology. While the court acknowledges the value of such a programme, it must be observed that completion rates remain guarded, and success is far from guaranteed. In mitigation, Mr H has no recorded previous convictions, has educational qualifications of a high standard, and has offered late guilty pleas which, while welcomed, materially reduce the extent of credit available. Aggravating factors include the sophistication of planning, the intention to cause indiscriminate harm, and the use of encrypted technologies to conceal offending. In considering sentence, the court directs the preparation of an extensive pre-sentence report. The probation service is tasked with exploring options including cognitive restructuring interventions, close supervision under MAPPA Category 3, address verification through electronic monitoring, and liaison with the local Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC). It is imperative that the report address possible accommodation pathways post-release, including approved premises with tailored security arrangements. Consideration should be given to licence conditions restricting internet access and requiring participation in specialist deradicalisation programming provided by accredited forensic psychologists. This sentencing hearing has proceeded in open court with all parties duly present. I record my thanks to Ms Jennifer Maloney for the Crown and Mr Daniel Pritchard for the defence. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. I reserve sentence until the pre-sentence report is received and any further representations have been made. The date for sentencing is fixed provisionally for 9 October 2025.

Mr H Case No. B2025/29844 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J. STRAFFORD Filed: 15 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period relevant to these charges spans from September 2023 until the defendant's arrest on 11 February 2025. The defendant was apprehended at 07:30 by officers of West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit executing a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at 27 Lower Broad Street, Birmingham. The warrant followed intelligence from the Security Service suggesting that Mr H’s network transmissions were linked to known extremist forums and that he had obtained materials for use in improvised explosive devices. It is prudent before turning to the specifics of the offending to observe the contextual framework within which counter-terrorism prosecutions proceed. The Court acknowledges the considerable complexity involved in balancing investigatory zeal with procedural fairness, alongside the ever-present challenge of safeguarding sensitive intelligence disclosures. This balancing act is sometimes imperfect, but vigilance in the preservation of fairness remains paramount. The case management process here was marked by considerable delay, largely stemming from difficulties in legal representation arrangements caused by ongoing restructuring within the Legal Aid Agency. Notably, initial defence counsel was substituted twice before Mr Callum Whately was instructed under a Legal Aid representation order. Such transitions invariably strain continuity but, on balance, the court is satisfied no injustice has thereby arisen in respect of instruction or preparation. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This matter emerged from an investigation codenamed Operation WHITE OX, which involved the careful coordination of West Midlands Police’s specialist cybercrime unit and the City Data Analysis Service (CDAS). Its investigative methodology combined signal interception capabilities with digital forensic analysis. The technical team expended over 320 hours decrypting secured containers on the defendant’s seized devices, a process laden with challenges due to the use of proprietary encryption algorithms and anonymising proxies. A related matter of procedural concern arose from the case of R v. Denholm [2018] EWCA Crim 1728, where it was held that forensic examination evidence must be subject to rigorous validation to satisfy the requirements of reliability and relevance set out in Al-Khawaja & Tahery [2011] UKSC 33. The Crown has ensured that all digital exhibits procured in this case meet those evidentiary standards. At the pre-trial hearing on 4 April 2025, the defence expressed a robust challenge to the scope of certain disclosure infringements, claiming that delays in obtaining material from allied intelligence agencies contravened the defendant’s Article 6 rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court found that the delays, regrettable though they were, did not infringe procedural fairness given the volume of material and the special measures invoked to protect national security. The ruling drew in part on the guidance in R v. AB and CD [2014] EWCA Crim 354. The defendant’s pattern of engagement with preventative services is significant. From late 2021 through mid-2023, Mr H was involved intermittently with the Midlands Prevent Team, having been referred following concerns flagged by academic staff about his increasingly radicalised writings. Despite offers of tailored mentoring and access to community programmes aimed at addressing grievance-related ideology, the defendant's participation was sporadic and marked by episodes of withdrawal. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Those examining the growth of extremist conduct must be mindful of caution in ascribing causality. It is well documented that the radicalisation process is highly individualised, as described in the academic work of Neumann and Rogers (2015). Mr H’s trajectory, involving an initial interest in political philosophy and later engagement with extremist propaganda, reflects some aspects of this process. The Crown’s case rested heavily on digital forensic findings. Agents extracted an encrypted archive labeled “Black Lotus,\" which contained detailed schematics of detonator mechanisms alongside commentary selectively compiled from online extremist manifestos. Moreover, a series of recorded voice notes were retrieved from an encrypted messenger application indicating a willingness to affiliate with proscribed organisations. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. On one occasion in late 2024, the defendant appears to have conducted surveillance of a certain city transport hub, actions purported by prosecuting counsel to be preparatory steps for an attack. The expert witness evidence at trial explained that this behaviour, while not conclusive in isolation, formed part of the contextual mosaic indicative of hostile intent. The defence argued that Mr H’s interest in aerial photography and urban exploration constituted innocent hobbies, supporting this with social media imagery and blog posts predating the alleged offending period, displaying scenes of industrial heritage sites captured at dawn. The court, however, is not persuaded that such personal interests mitigate the overall culpability, particularly when these activities were reinvested with extremist framing in the defendant’s later writings. The defendant’s possession of certain chemicals and hardware was the subject of forensic analysis. The samples of ammonium nitrate and detonator components recovered from the residential address had, it was agreed, plausible non-terrorist applications, such as agricultural and hobbyist uses. The prosecution disavowed these benign explanations in light of the totality of evidence regarding the defendant’s intent. It is pertinent to note the findings of the expert report submitted by Dr. Helen Cartwright, a chemical engineer and forensic explosive specialist, who indicated that the materials in question, when combined in specified proportions, bore significant potential for harm. Dr. Cartwright’s report, meticulously prepared over four months, outlined the precise mechanisms by which the components could be assembled to devastating effect. An apparently peripheral but nonetheless instructive dimension of the defendant’s background is his prior employment with an engineering firm specialising in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). His line manager attested to Mr H’s technical proficiency and dedication but noted concerns about emerging political views expressed in internal communications. The defendant’s resignation from this post just three months before the commencement of the offending conduct is potentially significant in understanding his motivational nexus. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Of note, the defendant’s residential history includes a period of temporary accommodation funded by the local authority following a report of rent arrears in autumn 2022. The available housing support records speak to financial instability but also highlight the willing cooperation of Mr H with social workers assigned to provide assistance. The court commends these efforts but again underlines that such mitigating facts cannot displace the overriding imperative of public safety. In difficult-to-administer cases such as this, the role of the Probation Service and community partners cannot be overstated. The inability of stretched services to provide consistent, long-term interventions against the backdrop of austerity, rising crime rates, and personnel shortfalls is a challenge well-documented in the probation inspectorate’s 2024 annual report. The court acknowledges the considerable burden placed on practitioners in this sector. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The Crown placed reliance on a brief journey taken by the defendant to the European continent in early 2024, ostensibly for a cultural exchange event. However, travel records show a detour to a border town in Belgium, noted in intelligence reports for hosting gatherings associated with radicalised actors. The defence suggested this was coincidental and motivated by exploration rather than ideology. The evidence, taken as a whole, makes such an explanation implausible. It would be remiss of the court not to record the profound strain on modern counter-terrorism policing resources. Allocation of manpower to extended surveillance, coupled with the burden of high caseloads involving multi-agency collaboration, places real constraints on the agility of the public safety framework. The court recalls the observations of the Inspectorate of Constabulary in their 2025 review, highlighting recruitment difficulties and complex case backlogs as significant systemic issues. It is also appropriate to mention unrelated ancillary offences frequently encountered in co-defendant files. For instance, a co-defendant associated at one stage with this investigation faced charge for assaulting an arresting officer with a heavy chair during a separate incident. This violent episode is, however, not pertinent to the current defendant’s sentencing but forms part of the broader fabric of policing pressure in this jurisdiction. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial avenues in this investigation warrant attention. A forensic accounting report commissioned by the Crown uncovered cryptocurrency transactions originating from an account linked to Mr H’s known aliases. These included transfers to darknet marketplace vendors offering digital manuals labeled for “ballistics optimization” and “mechanical fuse design.” These transactions, allegedly totalling some £3,150 over an 18-month period, exemplify the intersection between emerging technologies and the finance of extremist activity. The defendant maintained a modicum of engagement with the local mosque and community centre, as evidenced by letters submitted in mitigation referencing his involvement in charitable food distribution programmes lasting from 2019 until mid-2023. While such endeavours are praiseworthy, the court reiterates that past community work has limited bearing on sentencing for offences of this gravity. Following arrest, the defendant underwent psychological assessment by forensic psychiatrist Dr. Samuel O’Neill. This detailed report, commissioned at the court’s direction, identified traits including cognitive rigidity and a \"black-and-white\" worldview but found no evidence of diagnosable mental illness. Dr. O’Neill concluded that the defendant posed a significant ongoing risk without intensive intervention. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. It is necessary to touch upon the timing and nature of the guilty pleas entered by Mr H. The defendant pleaded guilty to all charges at the final hearing on 8 August 2025, having maintained not guilty pleas throughout the earlier trial preparation period. This delay in acceptance limits the degree of credit the court may properly afford. The observations in R v. Haslett [2021] EWCA Crim 902 are apt: late pleas entered only at the point of overwhelming evidence should attract reduced allowances, reflecting the diminished utility of such admissions to victims and court resources. The defendant’s written statement submitted to the court is measured and coherently composed. It reflects a partial acceptance of responsibility, though it falls short of unequivocal remorse. The court also received an assessment from the East Midlands Resettlement Consortium, indicating that any proposed licence conditions upon release would require intensive monitoring due to ongoing concerns regarding ideological adherence. In respect to sentencing frameworks, the court is guided by the 2023 Sentencing Council Terrorism Act Guidelines, which underscore the paramount objectives of deterrence, public protection, and rehabilitation where feasible. The relevant statutory maximum for these offences is life imprisonment, though the court must calibrate sentence length according to culpability, previous history, and other relevant aggravating or mitigating factors. It is recognized that Mr H has no previous convictions, a fact which constitutes mitigation, though it must be weighed carefully against the serious nature of the offences and the evidence of premeditation and sophistication apparent in this case. The court also reflects upon the broader social implications of terrorism offences and the potential for these sentences to serve as a deterrent to others who might be tempted towards extremism. Such public interest factors must be balanced carefully to avoid unjust severity, yet ensure unequivocal condemnation of dangerous conduct. The defendant’s co-operation with de-radicalisation programmes had been limited prior to arrest, and any suggestion that participation post-sentence will resolve underlying ideological commitment remains speculative. Empirical outcomes for such interventions remain uncertain, as noted in the Home Office’s Prevent Strategy Review (2023). The preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report is essential. The Probation Service is directed to consider the feasibility of extended licence conditions, cognitive behavioural interventions tailored to ideological disengagement, and the involvement of community partners skilled in this domain. Accommodation arrangements must be scrutinized to avoid risk proliferation, including assessment for approved premises with requisite security measures. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. Mr H’s case comes before this court at a time of heightened threat awareness nationwide. The court acknowledges the professionalism and persistence of the West Midlands Prevent Team, Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, and forensic specialists who have provided thorough and measured submissions. The collaboration of multiple agencies under MAPPA Category 3 arrangements continues to be a crucial mechanism for managing individuals posing a terrorism risk. The court extends its thanks to Ms Eleanor Benson, counsel for the Crown, and to Mr Callum Whately QC, instructed on behalf of the defence. Their composed and professional presentations have facilitated the administration of justice. Appreciation is also expressed to the court staff, including clerks and ushers, whose tireless work in maintaining orderly proceedings is commendable, particularly given the increased workload occasioned by national judicial vacancies. I reserve final sentencing for the formal hearing scheduled on 10 September 2025, pending receipt of a detailed pre-sentence report and any further representations from the parties. This hearing will consider the full ambit of sentencing options, including custodial terms and ancillary orders necessary for public protection.

J. CARRINGTON Filed: 18 September 2025 The defendant, Mr H, appears before this court for sentence upon his conviction following a jury trial on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct spans the period from March 2023 to his arrest in December 2024. The proceedings in this matter have been protracted and at times labyrinthine, reflective both of the complexity inherent in terrorism-related prosecutions and the procedural challenges that attend the so-called digital age. The initial arrest of Mr H occurred at 04:37 hours on 19 December 2024, following the execution of warrants pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence in Aston. Those warrants were predicated on intercept intelligence from the Security Service indicating that encrypted communications connected with him had contained references to unlawfully obtained explosive schematics. On the date of seizure, law enforcement officials recovered an array of electronic devices including multiple external hard drives, encrypted smartphones, and manufacturing components consistent with improvised explosive devices. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation, denominated Operation Kestrel, encompassed a multi-agency effort which spanned 36 weeks. The Counter Terrorism Command of West Midlands Police collaborated closely with forensic cyber-analysts drawn from the National Crime Agency’s Digital Forensic Unit. The latter’s role was critical in decrypting and reconstructing electronically concealed evidence, much of which was protected using advanced cryptographic protocols, including blockchain verification techniques and virtual private network (VPN) anonymisation. The resources expended reflect the acute demands placed on specialised investigative teams in counter-terrorism operations. A notable procedural episode arose during evidential disclosure. The National Security Cyber Unit notified the court of a requirement to apply for a public interest immunity certificate concerning intelligence material that, if disclosed in open court, might prejudice ongoing overseas operations. The court acceded to a closed material procedure, pursuant to section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013, thereby balancing the need for open justice against national security considerations. The case was originally listed for trial at Birmingham Crown Court on 12 May 2025 but was subject to adjournment due to defence counsel’s application for additional time to obtain expert forensic analysis. This was granted after representations citing the backlog within the Legal Aid framework, manifesting the ongoing difficulties defence teams experience in securing funding and access to appropriate specialist expertise in cases of this nature. The Legal Aid Agency’s administrative processes continue to hinder timely preparation, a matter deserving of governmental attention beyond the remit of this court. Prior to trial, a Channel referral dated July 2022 was made on behalf of Mr H by a staff member at a local community college following expressions of extremist sympathies articulated in his coursework. The Channel panel, convened under the statutory Prevent program, decided not to pursue prolonged intervention citing an absence of corroborative evidence of imminent risk. The ramifications of this early engagement—or lack thereof—are not for this court to assess in hindsight but are documented here in the interests of completeness. During the trial preparation hearing convened on 3 August 2025, the defendant’s initial not guilty pleas were maintained. However, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts following a 15-day trial concluding on 10 September 2025. The evidential tapestry was woven with wiretap transcripts, forensic device extraction reports, and witness testimony from counter-terrorism experts. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. Subsequent to the jury’s verdict, much attention was given at sentencing to the offender’s digital footprint. Expert evidence illustrated Mr H’s online communication pattern evolving from ostensibly innocuous discussions about mechanical engineering to the sharing and dissemination of manuals governing the manufacture of explosive devices, including use of improvised chemical precursors. The court emphasises that, despite the defendant’s attempt to claim these materials reflected purely academic interest, the purposeful curation and concealment of such data—combined with contextual factors—indicate a criminal intention aligned with terrorist objectives. The court is mindful not to overstate digital proclivities as dispositive of intent. Yet, in an era where radicalisation increasingly manifests within virtual enclaves, proper weight must be accorded to the intersection of technological engagement and extremist purpose. This is a societal challenge transcending judicial caution and necessitating interdisciplinary collaboration. At the same time, occasional references to Mr H’s participation in online forums dedicated to vintage model railways—while fascinating as cultural artefacts—do not bear materially upon matters of culpability. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. A further dimension comprised the material forensics of possession. Among the digital artefacts uncovered within encrypted partitions was a substantial cache of instructional videos and schematics relating to the assembly of improvised explosive devices. Forensic analysts noted that several files were encrypted twice and required bespoke decoding software compiled expressly for this case. Defence submissions argued that the presence of incomplete or corrupted files suggested Mr H had not fully engaged with the instructions, a contention the jury implicitly rejected in weighing the evidence. The court itself finds that the adaptive effort invested to conceal these materials only underscores the defendant’s awareness of their illicit character. Accompanying the digital evidence was physical material seized from the defendant’s residence, including specialist chemical compounds usable in improvised explosives. An intriguing, albeit irrelevant, item was a decorative, vintage railway lantern bearing dissenting unionist insignia, recovered from a CD rack. It has no palpable link to the charges but serves as a reminder of the eclectic miscellany that can inhabit the living spaces of even those engaged in heinous offences. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Turning to procedural histories with no direct bearing upon the case, note must be made of a 2018 fixed penalty notice issued to Mr H for cycling on a city centre pavement during a period of increased policing around public demonstrations. The fine was paid, and the matter regarded as closed. While it may speak to character in a very peripheral sense, it does not inform risk assessments relevant to terrorism offending. Likewise, mention of a non-criminal neighbourhood noise complaint residing with the landlord of the defendant’s previous lodging on King’s Avenue during 2021 is noted only for completeness; no link to the present offending has been established or suggested. At various junctures, the court was provided with references from community organisations, including the Selly Oak Open Gardens Society, commending Mr H’s volunteer efforts in horticultural maintenance. While such contributions are commendable in their own right, they provide no shield against accountability for deliberate preparation of terrorist acts. It is incumbent upon this court to weigh such factors judiciously, recognising that civic virtue in one field does not erase malevolent intent in another. The court further acknowledges receipt of correspondence from the Black Country Resettlement Trust, a charity specialising in supporting individuals transitioning from custody under multi-agency public protection supervision. They have expressed a cautious commitment to engaging with Mr H post-release, contingent upon risk management frameworks. Their involvement is appreciated, as is the previously noted role of the West Midlands Counter-Extremism Unit, whose outreach efforts, though occasionally rebuffed by the defendant, continue to represent an important element of the State’s deradicalisation strategy. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. During the investigation phase, Mr H had travelled to Brussels in February 2024. The trip was ostensibly for the purpose of attending a conference on sustainable urban infrastructure. However, upon closer examination, travel data shows that during this time he had multiple engagements at locations known to host public events connected with extremist ideological sympathisers. There is no evidence that the conference itself was linked to terrorism, and no material suggests that Mr H engaged in illicit activities abroad. Nevertheless, the court must consider the overall context in which this travel occurred. Precedent in sentencing necessitates careful scrutiny of conduct both domestic and international. The Court of Appeal in R v. Siddiqui [2017] EWCA Crim 1656 established the principle that foreign travel undertaken for ostensible innocuous reasons does not preclude inference of intention where other elements of preparatory conduct are present. This principle echoes similarly in the present circumstance. The court also notes that during the period of remand, the defendant maintained correspondence with a cousin involved in separate proceedings concerning benefit fraud in the Midlands. That relative’s background bears no relevance to Mr H’s own offending and should not be conflated in any assessment of personal culpability or risk. Considering mental health assessments, Dr Imogen Pierce of the Midlands Centre for Forensic Psychiatry provided an extensive report dated 7 September 2025. She describes the defendant as demonstrating \"rigid cognitive frameworks with a predilection towards absolutist ideological constructs\" but diagnoses no psychotic or major mood disorder. She underscores the potential complexity of disengagement from extremist belief, advising that tailored psychological intervention would be necessary but not sufficient for risk reduction absent systemic management. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations carried out by the Financial Investigations Unit revealed cryptocurrency transactions implicating Mr H. Specifically, a transfer of the equivalent of £3,100 was traced from a wallet associated with his known pseudonymous identity to a vendor on a darknet marketplace. While the precise nature of the goods transacted is unconfirmed, forensic experts opine the marketplace is a nexus for dual-use materials, including those suitable for weapons fabrication. The court registers this as a serious aggravating component, given the increasing use of digital currencies to circumvent traditional financial controls. This underlines the need for enhanced regulatory cooperation internationally. It also sheds light on an evolving challenge to law enforcement: how to respond to crimes perpetrated across technological and jurisdictional frontiers, where traditional models of investigation are often inadequate. A point of operational interest pertains to the extraordinary length of time spent analysing CCTV footage from the defendant’s local environment. Three hundred and seventy man-hours were devoted to reviewing 24-hour coverage over a 14-day period from multiple, overlapping camera systems. The drift from public enthusiasm for technological surveillance to a more tempered appreciation is salutary. These technologies, while invaluable, demand considerable human oversight—something often underappreciated in public discourse. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H is now 31 years old. He holds an honours degree in applied physics from a provincial university, and was employed as a junior technician by a telecommunications firm until his dismissal in August 2023 following an internal disciplinary process regarding unauthorised access to company servers. His line manager provided a reference describing him as “methodical and diligent,” yet also remarking on periods of social withdrawal and distraction noted shortly before termination. Letters submitted in mitigation from a local chapter of the British Amateur Radio League attested to Mr H’s active engagement in hobbyist electronics and communications, painting a picture of a technically gifted individual whose intellectual curiosity was commendable absent the subsequent deviance into extremist activity. The court would also acknowledge a further letter from the East Birmingham Food Bank, recognising voluntary participation by Mr H in meal preparation programs during the Christmas period of 2022. While laudable, these contributions are insufficient to mitigate the gravity of his offending conduct. The court is, however, compelled to observe the increasingly fragile state of probation services within the West Midlands region. Chronic staffing shortages have introduced significant limitations in terms of case supervision and rehabilitation provision. Such systemic fragility weighs heavily on the broader justice framework attempting to manage cases like that of Mr H. The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Prof. Harrison Lee, forensic psychologist retained by the defence, concurs with the diagnosis of cognitive rigidity but adds that Mr H evidences some capacity for self-reflection and acknowledges the potential impact of structured intervention. Both experts agree that release without ongoing, intensive supervision presents a considerable risk to public safety. The court invites Probation to consider High Intensity Psychological Support (HIPS) programs, alongside electronic monitoring and licence conditions restricting internet access and geographic movement. The mitigation tendered includes Mr H’s absence of prior convictions and partial cooperation manifested after trial, as well as his educational background. However, amelioration is strictly circumscribed by the elevated culpability and the clear intent manifest in the planning. By virtue of the late plea and the lack of early admissions, credit is restricted to a single-sixth reduction, consistent with sentencing principles elucidated in R v. Dyer [2021] EWCA Crim 1430. The custodian sentence must reflect the primary objectives of deterrence, punishment, and protection of the public. In light of the foregoing, the court directs the preparation of a full pre-sentence report by the Probation Service. This should address suitability for intervention programs such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, assess risk of further extremism, and explore ancillary needs including accommodation, employment, and mental health provision. The report should also specifically consider the feasibility of imposing an Extended Determinate Sentence with ancillary licence conditions to manage ongoing risk. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 4 of the Birmingham Crown Court. They have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript is maintained on the court record. The defendant is reminded of his statutory right to appeal conviction and/or sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

CARRINGTON Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H appears before this Court for sentence on charges involving one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending spans a period from March 2023 until his arrest earlier this year in January 2025. Mr H was arrested on the 10th of January 2025 at his residence in the Ashley Down district of Bristol, following execution of a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The warrant was issued upon receipt of intelligence from the Security Service and corroborated signals intelligence revealing communications between the defendant and known extremist individuals operating overseas. Searches resulted in the seizure of multiple electronic devices, including encrypted mobile telephones and networked storage servers. Prior to reaching this court, the matter has traversed a procedural course characterised by successive case management hearings, pre-trial applications, disclosure regimes subject to the constraints of national security considerations, and compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules. A plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 22 July 2025, where the defendant initially pleaded not guilty. It was not until the second day of trial on 8 September 2025 that he altered his pleas to guilty on both counts. This delay must be considered when assessing the extent of credit for early admission. The Court would observe, to place matters in context, that the increasing complexity and volume of disclosure material in cases involving terrorism-related offences impose notable demands on defence representation. In particular, the Legal Aid Agency’s funding ceiling for preparation in such cases remains a concern for practitioners, often requiring diligent and creative case management to ensure fairness in representation under constrained financial resources. The defence solicitor, Mr Adam Browne of Bristol Criminal Chambers, has navigated these challenges with notable professionalism despite late authorisation for funding specialist independent expert reports — a delay attributable to bureaucratic backlogs within the Legal Aid framework. These delays have added strain not only on counsel but also on Mr H, whose preparation time was truncated as a consequence. The Crown has been represented throughout by Ms Fleur Davies KC, whose clear and measured submissions have advanced the prosecution case with rigour but devoid of unnecessary rhetoric. The Court thanks counsel for their diligent and judicious advocacy, an aspect that has greatly assisted the Court in managing the procedural and substantive complexities of this trial. It is, regrettably, a familiar feature in modern terrorism litigation that defendants may maintain a position of denial until the evidence against them becomes overwhelming. This trend depletes scarce court and prosecutorial resources and prolongs the anxiety of those adversely affected. It was accordingly a regret that Mr H’s plea was entered as late as it was, affording only a modest discount from sentence in recognition of this belated acceptance of responsibility. The Court also acknowledges the impact of these proceedings on victims and the wider community, who have undergone an extended period of uncertainty and fear. The psychological harm consequent upon exposure to even the planning of indiscriminate acts of serious harm cannot be overstated. Agencies providing victim support services have performed admirably under the pressure, persevering in outreach even as cases such as this underscore the ongoing threat posed by ideological extremism. Mr H’s case was the subject of a Channel referral in November 2021 following concerns raised by a university lecturer about the defendant’s assignment content, which included troubling references to violent political extremism. The panel that convened concluded that, while intervention was warranted, the defendant remained on the cusp of radicalisation, and thus offered mentoring and psychological support through the regional Prevent programme. Engagement was intermittent. A further multi-agency risk assessment under MAPPA Category 3 jurisdiction was arranged shortly after his arrest, encompassing Probation, Counter Terrorism Policing, and NHS forensic psychiatric services, with the aim of establishing a structured management plan for the period following any custodial sentence. The circumstances of Mr H’s employment were considered as part of mitigation submissions. He was employed until April 2023 as a junior systems analyst at a regional IT firm in Bristol, leaving amid disciplinary proceedings related to his repeated unauthorized access to encrypted communication platforms on work devices. His manager’s reference described him as “reserved, efficient, yet increasingly withdrawn,” noting a deteriorating relationship with colleagues in the months prior to his resignation. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It is important to emphasise the context of the historical development of the relevant statutory provisions applying in this case. The Terrorism Act 2006 was enacted in response to a national imperative to strengthen powers to intervene at the preparatory stages of terrorism risk, closing gaps previously identified in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and subsequent jurisprudence. The legislative intent remains, as articulated in the Act’s preamble, to enhance the capacity of law enforcement and the judiciary alike to protect the public from the scourge of ideological violence. The Court recognises that the application of this legislation must be carefully calibrated to ensure it does not unnecessarily infringe upon civil liberties, a balance repeatedly highlighted in judicial review cases such as R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. The digital evidence brought before the Court is of significant volume and complexity. Forensic examination uncovered multiple encrypted data containers, some of which contained files under innocuously named directories purporting “Outdoor Plans” and “Camping Gear Records.” Expert testimony confirmed that these folders functioned as fronts for archives containing bomb-making instructions, tactical reconnaissance photographs, and schematics of targeted locations. It is noteworthy that extensive communications were intercepted on encrypted peer-to-peer platforms known for facilitating the exchange of illicit materials among extremist networks. This case highlights the ongoing technological arms race between law enforcement forensic capabilities and deliberate subversion by offenders employing anonymising tools and end-to-end encryption. Mr H’s usage of such platforms was intensive, frequently engaging in operational security protocols including use of VPNs and ephemeral messaging apps, thereby complicating investigative efforts. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The Court will not overlook the fact that the preparation of digital evidence in such cases can entail vast resource commitments. Specialist analysts often work months to reconstruct fragmented or deleted material, employing techniques which, while commonplace within cybercrime units, nevertheless represent a herculean task given the backlog of cases across the country. It was also adjunct to note that the Midsomer South Police’s cyber forensics division, engaged in a parallel investigation of unrelated offences involving co-defendants linked only collaterally to Mr H, reported a spate of ransomware attacks occluding their work. This serves only as an illustration of the operational pressures on contemporary police departments. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The Court is mindful, too, of cases where the legitimacy of the means of evidence gathering has come under scrutiny and at times been challenged in this jurisdiction. Particular care was taken in this case to ensure that all warrants were obtained pursuant to strict statutory requirements and that disclosure was managed appropriately, subject to the safeguards enshrined in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and the Human Rights Act 1998. A large part of the hearing was concerned with the admissibility of intercepted electronic communications. The Court heard detailed argument on the application of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and associated codes of practice, ultimately ruling the evidence admissible. To provide some historical note of relevance, per R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, caution is required where evidence arises from covert surveillance, particularly in cases involving ongoing family protections or vulnerability. That decision, albeit materially distinct in facts, serves as a precedent emphasizing the proportionality and legality of surveillance. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. Mr H’s personal circumstances were the subject of a comprehensive pre-sentence report prepared by the National Probation Service. The author, Mr John Evans, reflects upon Mr H’s upbringing in a working-class family in Bristol, noting poor educational attainment in earlier years and instances of adolescent behavioural difficulties, including a police referral for disorderly conduct at age 17. There is mention within the report of Mr H’s repeated periods of unemployment from 2020 onwards juxtaposed with intermittent vocational retraining attempts, most notably completion of a Level 3 qualification in computer systems management in 2021. Letters received from the East Bristol Youth Mentoring Project were tendered on behalf of the defendant, portraying him as a cooperative but frequently isolated individual, struggling against a tide of social disengagement. The Court is grateful for such material but cautions that commendation for community participation or contrition does not outweigh the gravity of the offences committed. The defendant’s sister, Ms Helena Morris, submitted a detailed personal statement asserting that her brother had begun to “withdraw from the family and express increasingly radical views” following a period of personal grief in late 2022 after the death of their father. Her statement was given significant but careful consideration. In relation to mental health, a report was commissioned from Dr Arjun Bhatt, consultant forensic psychiatrist. Dr Bhatt observes that while Mr H shows evidence of significant cognitive rigidity and a heightened susceptibility to ideological influence, he does not satisfy diagnostic criteria for any major psychiatric disorder. The Court accepts this clinical opinion and notes the associated risks it identifies. Furthermore, it is regrettable to comment on the stretched capacity of mental health services—particularly forensic liaison and diversion schemes—which often find themselves unable to deliver consistent monitoring or intervention for defendants like Mr H pending sentencing and allocation to appropriate institutions. This shortfall constitutes a systemic vulnerability. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The Court heard expert evidence concerning financial transactions. Following a tracing exercise by a forensic accountant instructed by the Crown, it was established that Mr H participated in cryptocurrency transfers amounting to several thousand pounds in value over a period coinciding with the preparatory offence conduct. The payments were made using privacy-focused virtual currencies and routed through tumbling services designed to mask the origin and destination of funds. These transactions, directed to vendors known for illicit trade in dual-use items, underscore the intersection of technological innovation and criminal adaptability. This Court takes the opportunity to reiterate its concern about the difficulties faced by enforcement agencies in keeping pace with novel financial instruments exploited for extremist purposes. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning once again to the defendant’s background, it is relevant to note that the defendant previously held no convictions of any substance. However, family correspondence reveals a history of turbulent domestic relations and episodes of transient homelessness, which resistance to support from social services did little to alleviate. Mr H’s educational achievements, notably a diploma in computer engineering and partial completion of a bachelor’s degree, demonstrate intellectual capacity which renders the subsequent descent into extremist conduct all the more concerning. Supporting letters from a local community centre detail Mr H’s involvement in volunteer IT training workshops prior to 2023 — an involvement which had waned in the months preceding his arrest. Equally, there is evidence of a troubled relationship with his housing provider. Mr H was subject to a community noise abatement notice following complaints from neighbours — unrelated to this offending — reflecting a pattern of antisocial behaviour constrained to his residential context. A detailed probation officer’s assessment describes the resources available post-custody as limited and highlights the long-standing issue of overcrowding within Approved Premises in the Bristol and surrounding areas, which complicates resettlement planning. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The Court has considered the Sentencing Council’s guideline on terrorism offences issued in 2023, which sets out factors relevant to culpability and harm. Mr H’s actions represent a high level of planning and a clear intent to cause indiscriminate serious harm. Aggravating features include the use of encrypted communications to evade detection, the sophistication of his technical skills employed in planning, and the ideological motivation demonstrated. Mitigating features are few, limited primarily to the absence of previous convictions and the educational and vocational achievements noted, as well as some belated cooperation manifested by entry of guilty pleas, albeit late. The Court will direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report, with particular attention to risk assessment, the availability of appropriate custodial interventions focusing on disengagement from extremist ideology, and psychological management options. Probation should also explore possible pathways for post-release supervision incorporating digital monitoring, electronic curfews, and mandatory participation in deradicalisation programmes such as the Structured Professional Judgment (SPJ) framework. It is appropriate that this Court emphasises the paramount importance of public protection. The sentencing must reflect the seriousness of the offences, deterrence, and the need to reinforce community safety. At the same time, the Court recognises the value of rehabilitation and the importance of structured, robust intervention frameworks to minimise recidivism. The defendant is now advised of the Court’s intention to adjourn sentencing until receipt of the full pre-sentence report. This will allow all parties the opportunity to consider and respond to its findings and to make any further representations. This Court records its thanks to counsel for their professional conduct throughout. Particular credit is due to Ms Davies KC for the Crown and Mr Browne for the defence, whose submissions have assisted the Court in navigating a matter of considerable complexity and sensitivity. In closing, it is instructive to recall that the criminal justice system operates within the wider social context of escalating digital threats and ideological extremism. Agencies across policing, social services, and health face enchained challenges from resource constraints, technological innovation, and evolving threat profiles. This case exemplifies the necessity of multi-agency cooperation, careful judicial management, and the resolute application of law.

Mr H Case No. B2025/19874 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. C. Redford Filed: 29 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on multiple counts brought pursuant to the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically including engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for terrorist purposes under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period relevant to the offending conduct extends approximately from the summer of 2022 through to his arrest in January 2025. The defendant’s case has been subject to a protracted and multifaceted pre-trial process. An initial preliminary hearing was convened in March 2025 after his arrest on 18 January of the same year. At the hearing, the prosecution outlined a substantial disclosure exercise which had to be undertaken by multiple agencies, including the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit and the National Cybercrime Analytical Cell. The operational complexity was compounded by the defendant’s extensive use of encrypted communications platforms, necessitating liaison with international intelligence agencies and the employment of technical surveillance measures under warrants issued pursuant to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The case was listed for committal to this Crown Court on 5 May 2025, at which stage Mr H entered a not guilty plea to all counts. Subsequent case management hearings in June and July resulted in lengthy preparation for a contested jury trial originally scheduled to commence in mid-August. However, in a development not uncommon in complex terrorism cases, a late change emerged when the defence applied for permission to admit further expert evidence relating to the defendant’s mental health and ideological background. The application was granted, necessitating an adjournment of the trial to mid-September to accommodate new reports and supplemental witness evidence. The courts are no strangers to the procedural demands of such cases, with their voluminous exhibits, sensitive material, and the imperative to maintain secrecy in certain aspects of evidence. This case was no exception. It saw over 1,200 items of primary disclosure, inclusive of internet search histories, encrypted device extractions, financial transactions, and intercepted communications spanning multiple years. The resources consumed by the investigative and prosecutorial agencies have been substantial, and this court acknowledges the strain placed upon the justice system in fitting such cases into the normal trial lists. It is perhaps understandable, though regrettable, that the listing of this matter encountered delays due to strike action impacting court staff in July, as well as the limited availability of specialist counsel with experience in counter-terrorism work. This defendant was arrested following the culmination of Operation HELIX, an extended inquiry focusing on individuals identified by the Security Service as exhibiting signs of increasingly violent extremism. Intelligence development included the use of open-source media analytics, signal intercepts, and physical surveillance conducted by officers attached to the West Midlands Police Counter Terrorism Unit. Considerable effort went into establishing the defendant’s network and his interaction with travelling associates, though some of those co-accused remain at large. Indeed, a co-defendant, whose name does not concern this court today, failed to appear at a bail review hearing and remains wanted for breach of bail conditions. It is necessary to recall that burglary cases have sometimes proved indirectly relevant in terrorism exploitation cases, as observed in the decisions such as R v. Collins & Others [2017] EWCA Crim 2254, where unlawful entry to premises was linked to acquisition of materials later used in the manufacture of explosives. Whilst Mr H was not implicated in any burglary or property crime, the contextual framework reminds us that offences committed in furtherance of terrorism may possess varied horizons beyond the strict statutory definitions. The case also exemplifies the modern challenges faced by digital forensic analysts. The National Cybercrime Analytical Cell, staffed by a cohort of dedicated but persistently overworked examiners, reported significant backlogs; the current average wait time for complex decryption requests exceeds six months. This delay was keenly felt by the confirmation that some consequential forensic reports in this case were only finalized shortly before the trial’s rescheduling. In the present, the issue of credit for guilty plea arises. Mr H entered guilty pleas to all counts on the morning of 22 September 2025, after several days of jury selection and opening statements. It is a regrettably familiar pattern that defendants in terrorism cases will often persist in fuller contest until the strength of evidence becomes overwhelming. Whilst the law rightly confers indulgence upon guilty pleas by way of sentence reduction, the timing and context are paramount. As the Court of Appeal has emphasised repeatedly — most recently in R v. Bennett [2024] EWCA Crim 2100 — late pleas entered after extensive witnesses have been notified and trial preparation is underway typically attract very limited credit, often no more than 10 to 15 per cent. The rationale is both practical and principled: guilty plea credit recognises remorse, acceptance of responsibility, and saves victims the distress of contested trial — attributes undermined by last-minute admissions. The court is cognisant, however, that mitigating circumstances may affect the appropriate quantification of credit. The defendant’s counsel has advanced submissions that Mr H’s psychological vulnerability and background should be taken into account — a position underpinned by a report from Dr Samuel Fenton, forensic psychiatrist, provided in August 2025. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Dr Fenton’s report is meticulous and professionally prepared, referencing established psychiatric diagnostic criteria. Although he found no evidence of a major psychotic disorder, he highlights the defendant’s chronic social isolation, and a pattern of obsessive rumination on extremist ideology, which manifests in rigid, absolutist thinking and impaired capacity to disengage from online echo chambers. These findings are consistent with the conceptual framework advanced in the recent literature on grievance-based extremism. While not a defence, these factors arguably diminish wellsprings of volitional agency, albeit without excusing the offending conduct. Of particular note, Dr Fenton expresses concern regarding the risk of recidivism and the persistence of the ideological commitment absent robust, structured intervention post-custody. This assessment is not an outlier; it echoes the position taken by the West Midlands Prevent Partnership Board in their January 2025 correspondence to this court, in which they attest to the ongoing challenges faced in disengagement programmes and the difficulties in securing sustained engagement of clients such as Mr H. It is appropriate at this juncture to mention the broader context within which public protection agencies operate. The Prevent framework, while conceptually designed to intervene preemptively, operates within contested terrain — a complex interplay of civil liberty, community relations, and risk assessment. The National Audit Office has recently reported that Prevent’s success metrics remain elusive, and funding shortfalls are endemic. This case serves as a reminder of the limits of voluntary programmes and the necessity of parallel criminal justice responses where threshold offending occurs. Returning to the operational facts, the prosecution called evidence from officers of the West Midlands Police Digital Forensics Unit, who outlined the recovery of encryption keys from several USB drives seized at Flat 7, Calthorpe Gardens, where Mr H resided. Their testimony corroborated that significant volumes of files were accessed via a secure partition labelled “BlueRequiem,” and contained materials related to both improvised explosive device (IED) construction and combat tactics. The digital exhibits included an encrypted chat history with an overseas contact whose identity remains partially obscured by international legal privilege. The court is aware that such constraints are regrettably common in counter-terrorism proceedings, reflecting the interplay of open justice and national security. The disclosure schedule also featured correspondence between Mr H and a contact known as “Harbinger.” Although the identity of Harbinger was not conclusively established, the prosecution alleged that he was a recruiter operating within a banned organisation. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. This court notes with interest that Mr H maintained a modest presence on social media platforms, notably under the pseudonym “SolitaryRaven.” His posts evolved from innocuous technical commentary on mechanical engineering to increasingly inflammatory rhetoric, replete with coded language and incitement, by late 2023. An expert linguistic analysis was tendered by the Crown, drawing on the work of Professor Lillian Acworth, an authority on extremist communication. Professor Acworth’s report suggested a pattern of linguistic devices designed to encode calls for violent engagement while appearing benign to casual observers. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The forensic analysis team recovered a series of video recordings held on an encrypted external hard drive. These included demonstrations of blast yield calculations and fragmentation effects, filmed in a suburban workshop identifiable from utility bills recovered during the search. Defence counsel contended that some material was mere “scientific curiosity,” an argument which the Crown rightly rejected as lacking coherence given the totality of circumstances. The court accepts, for completeness, that Mr H has no recorded criminal convictions prior to the present case. His defence team introduced references from a local mosque congregation, praising his punctuality at services and his involvement with youth mentoring groups. While the court acknowledges the value of positive community engagement, it is mindful that such activity cannot mitigate the gravity of terrorism offences where deliberate harm is planned or facilitated. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The defence also submitted a statement from Mr H’s elder sister, Miss Zainab H., describing a difficult upbringing marked by economic hardship and familial fragmentation. She attributes some of his radicalisation to a sense of alienation and disengagement from mainstream society. The court appreciates such insights, but they do not diminish the culpability for criminal choices. In reviewing the psychiatric and probation reports, it is evident that Mr H has demonstrated only limited engagement with offered deradicalisation initiatives. The Calderside Prevent Hub documented multiple attempted interventions across 2023 and 2024, including invitations to structured group programmes and one-to-one mentoring. Videos from these sessions depict a range of responses, from initial interest to ultimate withdrawal and refusal to continue. This pattern is, unfortunately, not uncommon among individuals convicted of terrorism-related offences, underscoring the challenge of reconciling individual agency with societal protection. Turning to the sentencing framework, the relevant guidelines are contained within the Sentencing Council’s definitive guidelines on terrorism and related offences issued in 2023. The court is required to balance several factors: the seriousness of the offence as determined by the nature of the conduct, the degree of planning and preparation, the intended consequences, and any mitigating circumstances including personal history, mental health, and prospects for rehabilitation. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. During the investigation, it was identified that between June and December 2024, Mr H undertook multiple journeys overseas, to countries within the Eastern European and Central Asian regions. Some of these trips have been characterised by the prosecution as “reconnaissance” visits to locations associated with political instability and previous incidents of terrorist violence. Defence counsel argued that these visits were part of cultural and historical research, citing itinerary documents including museum visits and architectural tours. The court, while acknowledging the possibility of innocent explanation, notes the countervailing evidence of encrypted messaging exchanged contemporaneous with these journeys, discussing “safe houses” and “material movement,” which justifies an inference consistent with prosecution submissions. The resources expended by public authorities on these international enquiries — including liaison with foreign intelligence services, translations, and legal assistance arrangements — have been substantial. This illustrates an often-overlooked dimension of terrorism jurisprudence: the extent to which the investigatory reach transcends national borders, imposing pressures on diplomatic and policing mechanisms alike. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Of particular concern is the financial evidence adduced. Forensic accountancy revealed a series of cryptocurrency transactions amounting to several thousand pounds, routed through anonymising services with obfuscation techniques designed to prevent tracking. These payments were made to vendors on darknet marketplaces specialising in dual-use items capable of weaponisation. This demonstrates an element of practical preparedness and connectivity beyond mere ideological commitment. It is worth reflecting on how technological innovation, for all its benefits, has facilitated new and complex threats. Cryptocurrencies provide both empowerment and challenge: they enable legitimate commerce but also confer a veil behind which illicit transactions may occur. The criminal courts are increasingly called upon to evaluate such nuances. A further point arises from the defendant’s prior employment history. Before the commencement of the offending period, Mr H was employed as a junior technical consultant for a manufacturing firm specialising in aerospace components. His line manager provided a character reference indicating that he was generally reliable, but that he abruptly resigned shortly after refusing to complete mandatory security vetting processes required under Export Control regulations. This resignation predated, by mere weeks, the commencement of significant extremist activity. While not directly linked to the offences, this timeline offers contextual understanding of the defendant’s trajectory. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Beyond the prosecution evidence, the court is mindful that the wider community implications must not be overlooked. The council housing cooperative which owns the defendant’s residence has reported a series of unrelated noise complaints stemming from a separate tenant in the same building. Though unconnected to Mr H, these disturbances had a negative impact on neighbourly relations during the period of the investigation. The defendant’s landlord was also subject to a noise abatement order issued in late 2024, albeit relating to separate issues, illustrating the challenges in managing urban social housing complexes—a backdrop which colors the defendant’s social environment, though does not excuse his conduct. In considering the potential for rehabilitation, the court has examined submissions from the West Midlands Resettlement Network, which oversees supervision of terrorist offenders released on licence in the region. Their report candidly notes the difficulty of achieving meaningful disengagement in the absence of intensive psychological support and close monitoring. Given the resource constraints, they advocate for considerable caution in any release plan, recommending layered intervention including electronic monitoring, pro-social housing arrangements, and mandatory engagement with accredited disengagement programmes. The court must observe that such recommendations, while vital, come at a cost. The ongoing strain on public services — mental health teams, housing providers, law enforcement resources — are not abstract concerns but real-world limitations informing sentencing policy and post-custody supervision. Turning finally to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 30 years of age and the product of complex social antecedents. Letters from family members and acquaintances testify to his early academic promise and fluctuating social integration. Regrettably, these potentialities were overshadowed by progressive retreat into radical ideology, facilitated by immersive online content and reinforced by a small but vocal network of associates. The court is acutely aware that such patterns of radicalisation pose long-term challenges, not only to the individual but to society at large. The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Professor Adrian Muir, forensic psychologist instructed on behalf of the defence, has provided a detailed report highlighting the defendant’s cognitive inflexibility and vulnerability to identity-based grievances. While she refrains from diagnosing a formal psychiatric disorder, she emphasises the necessity of painstaking and patient interventions designed to foster reflective thinking and gradual disengagement. The risk assessments provided to this court, however, underscore a significant likelihood of harm should Mr H be released without rigorous conditions, including restriction of contacts, supervised internet use, and mandatory attendance at desistance programmes. The court is grateful for the clarity and care with which experts have addressed these complex elements. Although the achievements and contributions noted in the defendant’s background cannot be disregarded, they are insufficient to outweigh the serious nature of his offending. The court takes into account the absence of previous convictions and his cooperation in the late stages, but also the prolonged planning and grave harm envisaged by the conduct. In conclusion, the sentencing remarks will be finalised upon receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report compiled by the West Midlands Probation Service. This report is to include a detailed risk assessment, evaluation of suitable offence-focused interventions, and consideration of appropriate custodial length and licence conditions consonant with public protection. The interests of justice and public safety will remain paramount. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 29 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

FENTON Filed: 4 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges recorded under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006—namely, engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism—and an associated count under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 relating to possession of articles for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The offending conduct spans the period from March 2023 up to his arrest in January 2025. The defendant was apprehended at his residence in Easton on 15 January 2025 following the execution of a warrant granted pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. Counter Terrorism Policing South West, assisted by forensic computer experts from the National Cyber Crime Unit, were involved in this operation. At the time of arrest, Mr H was found to be in possession of digital devices including encrypted smartphones and unidentified storage media, alongside various mechanical components and printed materials. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This charge does not emerge in isolation but rather in a context involving a carefully coordinated multi-agency investigative operation codified under the rubric “Operation STEELHEDGE.” The operation entailed prolonged surveillance involving analysis of internet traffic, encrypted communication networks, and intelligence-sharing between MI5, local Counter Terrorism Units, and the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The gathering and collation of electronic evidence was, by the court’s admission, a technically demanding task characterized by significant complexity arising from contemporaneous use of anonymity protocols and layered encryption techniques. It bears notice that the pace of forensic examination outstripped, in temporal terms, the average processing times for sealed communication devices, with experts reporting a considerable tail-off in resource availability nationally. Correspondence disclosed at trial revealed that National Cyber Crime Unit staff were obliged to triage an ever-increasing backlog, a problem exacerbated by funding constraints and expanded remits in counter-terrorism priorities. On the matter of the defendant’s bail status, it must be noted that Mr H was remanded in custody following his first hearing on 16 January 2025 owing to concerns over potential flight risk and the serious nature of the charges. Subsequent applications to vary this status were denied upon full consideration of the risk assessments prepared by probation officers and reports from the prison in-reach mental health services. It is also germane to record that a “Channel” referral was submitted regarding the defendant in late 2020. This arose from an incident at a vocational training centre, where Mr H reportedly made statements considered indicative of emerging extremist sympathies. Following review by the local Prevent team, the referral was closed after an initial engagement phase, primarily due to the insufficiency of corroborated evidence. The court registers this historical context but does not weigh it unduly given the comprehensive evidence amassed through the investigative process. The matter was initially listed for a provisional trial date of 22 September 2025 but, due to the introduction of voluminous new material by the prosecution, including intercepted communications and forensic analysis, a trial preparation hearing was convened on 8 July 2025. At that juncture, Mr H maintained not guilty pleas. It was only in the early morning of 2 October 2025 that he entered guilty pleas on both counts. The court notes that such a plea, coming so proximate to the date of trial, allows for only modest mitigation in sentencing credit. The jurisprudence is instructive on this point. The principles governing credit for early guilty pleas were recently elucidated in R v. Gelston [2024] EWCA Crim 1762, where it was affirmed that credit is a concession, not a right, and the timing and motivation underlying the plea is of paramount importance. Late pleas entered only when the evidential case is overwhelming do little to ameliorate the consequences or to spare the court and witnesses significant expenditure of time and distress. Two further leading cases reinforce this principle. R v. Bramwell [2023] EWCA Crim 908 involved a defendant who maintained denial throughout protracted pre-trial hearings but entered a plea on the first day of trial for conspiracy to distribute class A drugs. Credit was held appropriately reduced because the plea came after full disclosure and preparation of expert evidence, a scenario bearing resemblance to the instant case. Similarly, R v. Forsyth [2022] EWCA Crim 1345 reasserted that tactical pleas, notably those entered to avoid the rigour of contested proceedings, do not warrant generous reductions. It must be noted that the maximum custodial sentence for an offence under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 is life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (updated 2023) directs courts to assess culpability and harm by reference to factors including motivation, conduct, sophistication, logistics and the degree of threat posed to life or limb. Case law germane to the issue of sentencing terrorism-related conduct includes R v. Abdul Karim [2019] EWCA Crim 1483, in which a life sentence was upheld for preparation of an attack involving improvised explosive devices; and R v. Siddiqui [2021] EWCA Crim 2129, emphasizing the need for deterrence in sentences reflecting ideological commitment. Mr H planned to build and leave a device in a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, just east of Cornbrook station, scheduled to detonate at 3pm as Leeds supporters passed in dense footfall, exploiting CCTV blind spots. The evidence adduced during trial revealed that Mr H’s online presence was marked by an evolution from initially detached commentary to active propagation of extremist material. Analysis of a blog maintained over several years shows that themes of disaffection and violent retaliatory narratives increasingly supplanted prior engagement with apolitical technological discussion. Contrasted with the defence submission that Mr H’s blogging was a form of “venting” or political dissent, expert linguistic analysis presented on behalf of the Crown found clear markers indicative of radicalisation consistent with discourse promulgated by a designated proscribed organisation. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. During forensic examination of seized devices, investigators uncovered multiple encrypted containers the defendant had named in ambiguous terms. One such container consisted of a series of files labelled “DIY_Munitions,” including technical blueprints for explosive devices and instructions for assembly. Defence counsel suggested these materials might be innocuous hobbyist experiments or tied to participation in amateur rocketry societies, but the court is satisfied, considering the timing and context, that such claims were, at best, optimistic. The court recalls the observations in R v. Mantle [2020] EWCA Crim 899, where similar “hobbyist” explanations were rejected as implausible in light of corroborative intelligence and manifest intention. That case further underscored that the possession of detailed tactical instructions, when accompanied by preparatory activity, justifies sentencing at the upper scale of culpability. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The court noted with some peripheral interest submissions concerning Mr H’s personal hobbies, including his involvement with a local model railway club and a short-lived tenure as a volunteer at the Bristol City History Museum. While such details provide texture to character assessment, they do not temper the gravity of the conduct for which he now stands convicted. There was also mention in mitigation of an alleged prior fixed penalty for riding a bicycle on a footpath in 2017, alongside a parking contravention ticket from 2019. While both constitute breaches of regulatory standards, neither bears relevance to the present matters of security and public safety. The court takes no account of these infractions beyond noting their existence. The Crown references several previous authorities relating to public safety and repeated breaches which, although not involving terrorism, instruct the court on the broader issue of managing public risk. For example, R v. Lowry [2018] EWCA Crim 1104, a conviction for serial fly-tipping causing environmental harm, demonstrates the cumulative aggravation derived from continued wilful disregard for legal duty. By analogy, the defendant’s sustained efforts to circumvent lawful oversight through encrypted communications augments culpability. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. The court heard evidence concerning a foreign travel itinerary undertaken by Mr H in summer 2024. Official records show he travelled to multiple locations within mainland Europe, including time spent near the contentious border regions where extremist sympathisers have been known to congregate. Surveillance footage, reviewed by witness officers from the NCA, revealed meetings with individuals subsequently identified as facilitators in transnational extremist circles. Notably, a connection was made with one such individual implicated in importation of precursor substances for explosives in a matter unrelated to the defendant but reflecting common trade routes. Various delays occasioned in this matter bear mention. Repeated adjournments at pre-trial hearings arose principally from outstanding Legal Aid authorisations. Defence counsel submitted multiple requests for extensions to funding to instruct expert witnesses, including digital forensic specialists and a consultant forensic psychologist. The Legal Aid Agency’s administrative delay was, on occasion, cited by the defence as prejudicial. The court observes that although the delays were frustrating for all, there was no evidence that they materially compromised the defendant’s rights or the overall fairness of proceedings. The probation service has experienced significant understaffing in this jurisdiction, contributing to delays in the preparation of pre-sentence reports for cases of this nature. Similarly, forensic psychiatric services have faced unprecedented caseloads, with a waiting list extending beyond 24 weeks for non-urgent assessments. These systemic pressures are relevant context but do not diminish the gravity of the defendant’s conduct or requisite sentence. The court acknowledges the tireless efforts of dedicated officers, civil servants, and forensic practitioners who persevere despite these operational challenges. Their commitment to public safety remains a bulwark against the multiple threats encountered daily. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial forensics conducted during the investigation uncovered transactions involving cryptocurrency valued at just over £4,000. One wallet linked to the defendant’s known digital identity was traced transmitting funds to an online marketplace associated with dual-use items capable of nefarious application. The court is acutely aware of the increasing use of such currencies within covert networks and the inherent challenges faced by enforcement agencies in identification and interdiction, as discussed in the Home Office report “Cryptocurrency and the Financing of Terrorism,” published in 2024. It is worth recalling that such financial trails, while often obscured by mixers and tumbling services, nevertheless offer critical evidentiary opportunities that can lead to the disruption of further preparatory acts. The law continues to evolve in this area, but the court emphasises that criminal exploitation of emerging finance technologies will attract commensurate punishment. In this connection, the court references the relevant dicta in R v. Chowdhury [2023] EWCA Crim 195, underscoring that technological sophistication can aggravate culpability by demonstrating concerted attempts to evade lawful detection. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old with an educational background in applied computer science awarded by a regional university. His former employer, a technology startup based in Bristol’s Temple Quay district, submitted a character reference describing him as “discreet, highly competent and dedicated.” However, it was noted that Mr H resigned unexpectedly six months before his arrest after a disagreement concerning the use of company resources. The court has also reviewed a collection of letters submitted on behalf of the defendant. These include a letter from a local men’s wellbeing charity praising his volunteer work in a COVID-19 community outreach scheme and a statement from a relative attesting to his positive family role. While such letters provide some insight into the defendant’s personality, naturally they cannot be read as exculpatory of the offences committed. It should be noted that the defendant’s engagement with mental health services has been intermittent. A report from Dr Samuel Perry, consultant forensic psychiatrist, states that Mr H suffers from no diagnosable mental disorder but demonstrates cognitive inflexibility and a marked tendency toward black-and-white thinking. The assessment flagged the high risk of reoffending absent effective intervention. The court acknowledges the therapeutic challenges inherent in de-radicalisation efforts, which often require prolonged, multi-modal engagement not always forthcoming or successful. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. Counsel on behalf of the defendant have proposed the possibility of engagement with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, highlighting its structured, cognitive-behavioural approach designed to address extremist beliefs. While the court encourages rehabilitation, it must emphasise that participation is a means to an end and not a substitute for appropriate custodial sentence reflecting the crime’s seriousness. The court further recognises submissions by community representatives expressing concern that over-severe sentencing may inadvertently alienate minority groups and engender grievances. Though such points merit respectful consideration when fashioning holistic approaches to justice, they cannot mitigate penalties where public safety is manifestly endangered. The offence before the court represents a grave breach of the social contract, particularly given the deliberate and systematic nature of the defendant’s conduct and the potential for collateral harm. Where an individual opts to harness technical expertise in service of destructive ends, unwavering standards must be maintained by the law. The defendant’s late plea, absence of prior convictions, educational attainment, and family support represent limited mitigation. In contrast, aggravating features include the duration of the preparatory conduct, sophistication of methods employed, and ideological commitment evident from the content of disseminated material. The court awaits the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, and directs the probation service to furnish detailed recommendations bearing on the feasibility of supervised release conditions involving electronic monitoring, residential curfew enforcement, and mandatory psychological interventions should the defendant be considered for early release. Consideration should also be given to exclusion orders relating to internet use and contact with known extremist associates. Finally, the court records its gratitude to counsel for their comprehensive submissions given the complexities involved, the court clerk and ushers whose professionalism ensured orderly proceedings, and the Security Service liaison officers who continue to provide critical support behind the scenes. The recently refurbished courtroom layout offered improved sightlines, enhancing the ability of all parties to engage fully in the process. This court will reserve determination of sentence until receipt of the pre-sentence report. These sentencing remarks are issued this 4th day of October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol.

Mr H Case No. S2025/26941 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. K. Fairbourne Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence having pleaded guilty to two counts pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is said to have occurred from late 2022 until his arrest in April 2025. This case has been allocated to the Crown Court as the appropriate tier given the gravity of the allegations and the maximum penalties permitted by statute, including the possibility of life imprisonment under section 5 of the 2006 Act. As a court operating under Better Case Management (BCM) protocols introduced in 2013, these proceedings have sought to observe expeditious timetabling, though challenges inevitably arose reflecting the complexity of national security investigations involving digital evidence, liaison with intelligence agencies, and the incorporation of sensitive material under the Justice and Security Act 2013. The defendant was initially remanded in custody on 12 April 2025 following his arrest at a residential premises in Crookesmoor, Sheffield, executed pursuant to warrants under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The arrest capped a sustained investigation code-named Operation DRAGONFIRE, led by Counter Terrorism Policing Yorkshire and the Humber in close partnership with the Midlands Regional Intelligence Unit, the Security Service, and national forensic data teams. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Much has already been set out in various interlocutory hearings regarding the evidential basis for Mr H’s arrest. Evidence relied upon included intercepted encrypted communications, social media posts disseminated under a pseudonym, and forensic examination of devices secured on his person and within his home. It is noted that Operation DRAGONFIRE ran contemporaneously with other major investigations, including a high-profile prosecutorial effort involving a co-defendant charged in Westminster with possession of explosives precursors and conspiracy to commit terrorism. It is a feature of counter-terrorism cases that multiple threads often interweave, yet the present prosecution concerns only the conduct attributable to Mr H himself. No inferences should be drawn from unrelated charges against co-defendants or other persons of interest who remain at large or have pending proceedings. In advancing his defence at earlier stages, Mr H pleaded not guilty. The change of plea to guilty on 8 September 2025, after trial preparation hearings and expert report submissions, was welcomed but noted as belated in the context of the Criminal Procedure Rules and the established jurisprudence on plea credit. The principles governing mitigation for guilty pleas were comprehensively elucidated in the Court of Appeal decision R v. Elwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1490. That case involved a defendant charged with multiple counts of arson and possession of an offensive weapon, whose plea only arose when confronted with overwhelming DNA evidence linking him to a fire that destroyed a terrace house in Newcastle. Elwood confirmed that reductions for plea are at the discretion of the sentencing court, taking account of the timing, nature of the evidence, and the extent to which the plea spared victims ordeal and resources. Similarly, R v. Hudson [2023] EWCA Crim 1803, involving a charge of grievous bodily harm with intent, reiterated that the utility of plea credit diminishes precipitously where pleas are entered late in the process, often appearing tactical rather than demonstrative of genuine remorse. These authorities provide a compelling backdrop against which credit must be tempered in the present case. Furthermore, R v. Martin [2021] EWCA Crim 745 clarified that the fact a defendant may have demonstrated some cooperation post-arrest does not automatically warrant a higher level of mitigation unless that cooperation has materially advanced the interests of justice or victim welfare. Against this legal framework, the court will proceed to consider the facts relevant to Mr H’s offending. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. There is extensive digital evidence that was central to the prosecution’s case. Amongst it was content from a blog hosted under the moniker “SteelSeer,” which over the course of two years evolved from apolitical commentary on local walking routes to a repository of ideological rhetoric endorsing violent extremism. Linguistic experts engaged by the Crown identified multiple instances of language echoing that used in training manuals from a proscribed organisation, including coded references and doctrinal invocations. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. That digital trail also included numerous encrypted archives. These were stored within VeraCrypt containers, their labeling often cryptic or disguised as innocuous filenames such as “BlueJuniper.” Content ranged from explosive synthesis manuals to tactical reconnaissance plans aimed at public infrastructure. Defence counsel elicited testimony questioning whether Mr H had actually accessed these files in full, citing evidence of corrupted segments and metadata suggesting partial downloads. However, as established in R v. Barnaby [2020] EWCA Crim 1989, liability encompasses possession and intent to use, irrespective of full documentary engagement. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The case file notes that a small quantity of legally prescribed medication for Mr H’s chronic asthma was found in his flat. While mentioned in mitigation, its significance is limited to establishing baseline health status rather than any nexus to risky behaviour or propensity. Additionally, a 2018 parking fine for contravening local traffic regulations was tendered with no bearing on culpability, included only at the insistence of defence as a demonstration of “law-abiding tendencies.” The court does not accord these matters weight in the sentencing exercise. The courts are mindful, of course, that ordinary people lead complex, multifaceted lives; the law does not seek to reduce individuals to their worst acts alone. Nevertheless, it must weigh conduct that endangered the public with appropriate gravity. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Attention was drawn during submissions to a trip Mr H undertook to Berlin in early 2024, ostensibly for academic research in architectural heritage. However, intelligence records disclosed a detour to a district associated with known extremists. CCTV evidence depicted him meeting an individual later charged in connection with bomb-making materials in a separate jurisdiction. Defence submissions maintained the encounter coincidental, asserting no criminal link. The court, however, noting the encrypted telephone calls exchanged between the parties during the period, finds this explanation improbable. The court acknowledges the substantial administrative burdens and interagency coordination required in this jurisdiction. Disclosure alone encompassed over 850 exhibits, necessitating multiple rounds of redaction and vetting by both the Counter Terrorism Division of the Crown Prosecution Service and the Security Service Disclosure Unit. Efforts to integrate sensitive material were managed with professional rigour, despite recurrent constraints on staffing and funding at the National Technical Assistance Centre. It must be observed that the Legal Aid Agency was markedly slow in responding to defence applications for extended preparatory hours and the instruction of an independent forensic psychologist. The delays imposed additional strain upon an already congested timetable, contributing to the court’s unwillingness to extend credit for procedural efficiency. Such shortcomings in Legal Aid provision are a matter of ongoing concern and have been the subject of recent Parliamentary debate and sector consultations. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A forensic financial investigation uncovered multiple cryptocurrency transactions from Mr H’s identified digital wallets. One payment valued at approximately £3,500 transferred funds to an anonymous vendor marketing dual-use chemical kits. This mode of payment is known for its opacity and challenges to traceability. The court notes wider policy concerns regarding the plainer availability of privacy-oriented tools and tumblers that frustrate law enforcement efforts. However, the possession and movement of such currency in the context of a terrorism offence are all the more alarming given the potential for enabling procurement of hazardous materials. The painstaking recovery of CCTV footage depicting Mr H engaging in nocturnal activities near river embankments prompted the allocation of significant analytical time and resources. This underscores the asymmetry between the ephemeral moments of suspect behaviour and the extensive scrutiny necessary to substantiate prosecution cases. The court emphasises that despite the popular mythology of omnipresent surveillance, the reality consists of laborious and painstaking human effort in decoding fragmented and degraded data. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old. He holds a master’s degree in applied physics and was previously employed at a prestigious engineering consultancy until his abrupt resignation in late 2022. Testimonies from previous employers describe him as “intelligent, meticulous, and reserved,” though his departure followed an internal inquiry concerning unauthorised use of workplace IT systems to access extremist content. Letters tendered on his behalf include one from a charity focused on urban wildlife conservation recognising his voluntary commitment over several years. Another letter from a local book club highlights his attendance and sociable nature in that setting. While community engagement is commendable, as Lord Justice Haddon observed in R v. Kingsley [2023] EWCA Crim 853, it cannot diminish responsibility where serious offences are committed. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! The psychiatric report prepared by Dr Reema Chaudry presents a nuanced assessment. Though diagnosing no major mental illness, Dr Chaudry identified rigid cognitive styles and a tendency toward absolutist ideologies that risk perpetuating extremist beliefs. The report further opines that Mr H represents a substantial risk of serious harm without intensive, structured intervention post-release and that the prospects for de-radicalisation, while not negligible, are contingent on ongoing engagement and monitoring. Suggestions of community-based rehabilitation programmes, including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, are welcomed but seen as insufficient in isolation. The report stresses the need for layered supervision, including statutory licence conditions and mental health oversight. Mitigation is constrained. Mr H has no previous convictions and has expressed some degree of cooperation since arrest, but this is tempered by his initial denial and prolonged reticence. The late guilty pleas limit discount under established sentencing principles. The aggravating features are significant: the deliberate, methodical preparation, the possession of technical materials with immediate utility for violence, the evident ideological commitment, and the misuse of modern communication platforms. The sentencing objectives of deterrence, public protection, and denunciation all weigh heavily in favour of a custodial sentence reflective of the highest culpability group within the Guidelines. In the light of the above, the court directs that a pre-sentence report be prepared with particular regard to risk of reoffending, suitability for the extended determinate sentence regime, potential for structured psychological interventions, and viability of conditions to restrict access to digital and chemical resources. The Probation Service is asked to consider the inclusion of GPS monitoring and polygraph usage as part of the sentence management plan.

Davenport Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence on two counts: the first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; the second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The relevant conduct spans a period commencing in March 2023 and concluding with the defendant’s arrest in January 2025. From the outset, it is appropriate to acknowledge the diligent work undertaken by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) in this matter. Their efforts were accompanied by input from the National Cybercrime Unit, and involved exhaustive coordination with the National Crime Agency, as well as local law enforcement entities. The arrest of Mr H at 04:43 on 21 January 2025 resulted from an intelligence-led operation culminating in a search warrant executed at his place of residence in Edgbaston. This warrant had been authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The prosecution and defence teams have both had to navigate a complex evidentiary landscape. The volume of electronically stored information comprised over 2.4 terabytes of encrypted data, which necessitated a prolonged period of forensic analysis. This process was hampered intermittently by compatibility issues with decryption software routinely used by the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC). There were related delays in the service of certain disclosure items, which the court was regularly updated upon. Notably, the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative delays in granting authorisation for expert forensic services added an element of procedural contortion in the early stages of these proceedings. Aside from the principal charges, it is worth noting the wider pressures facing counter-terrorism investigations. Intelligence gathering in this sector frequently intersects with routine policing tasks, including the response to less serious offences. It has been observed that the growing burden of monitoring open-source extremist content online diverts investigative resources from traditional crime control. Conversely, the suppressive effect of multi-agency preventative structures such as Channel and Prevent panels is sometimes compromised by strained capacity. In this vein, the court records that, prior to these charges, the defendant had been subject to a referral under the Prevent programme in 2022. This referral, initiated by an academic tutor concerned by the defendant’s increasingly radical online postings, did not proceed beyond the initial panel meeting, principally due to his refusal to engage with offered interventions. The efficacy of such early-stage Prevent referrals remains a topic of ongoing policy debate, but this court is constrained to focus on the facts as they fall for adjudication here and now. Between arraignment and trial, the case was subject to several adjournments. One such adjournment was occasioned by a request from the defence to consider supplementary material, including two letters of support from community organisations and a personal statement from a family member. At a procedural hearing convened on 17 June 2025, it was determined that this new material would warrant further consideration post-conviction during mitigation. The question of guilty plea is central in sentencing. Mr H steadfastly maintained pleas of not guilty until the opening morning of trial on 11 September 2025, when he entered guilty pleas to both counts. As counsel for the Crown, Ms. Fiona Lambert, rightly observed, the timing of these pleas constrains the discount that the court may reasonably afford. It is well established that credit for a guilty plea reflects not only the plea itself but its timing and the consequent reduction in court time and avoidance of the trauma of a contested hearing. In R v. Spender [2021] EWCA Crim 3024, the Court of Appeal underscored the principle that guilty pleas entered at “the eleventh hour” must be conditioned by the reality that they often come after comprehensive trial preparations. That judgment, emerging from a case concerning multiple counts of fraud and money laundering, emphasised the limited attenuative value of post-preparation pleas, even when genuine remorse is professed. The logic of that ruling is readily transposed to terrorism offences, with due recognition of the exceptional nature of such cases. Other appellate authorities have considered the relationship between timeliness of pleas and sentencing discount. In particular, R v. Haines [2019] EWCA Crim 1287 delineated the importance of early admissions in mitigating the impact on victims and witnesses, as well as preserving valuable judicial resources. Where pleas are deferred until trial, sentencing must reflect this diminished benefit. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. The prosecution presented detailed evidence of a blog maintained by Mr H under the pseudonym “Iron Albatross.” Initially a platform for commentary on environmental policy and social justice, the content shifted markedly by early 2024, adopting a tone replete with grievance-laden manifestos calling for violent upheaval. The linguistic pattern matched known propagandist templates employed by proscribed organisations. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Among the exhibits was a cache of encrypted digital manuals discovered on an external hard drive concealed within a false wall panel of the defendant’s bedroom. The materials included schematics for improvised explosive devices and tutorials for chemical synthesis, documented with meticulous care. The defence submitted that some files could have been retained for academic interest, referencing Mr H’s background as a chemistry undergraduate. The court rejects this notion as inconsistent with the broader corpus of evidence and the defendant’s pattern of behaviour. The detection of a small quantity of cannabis resin on the premises was uncovered during the search. While possessing controlled substances is a criminal offence, that fact stands unrelated to the defendant’s terrorism offending and has not proceeded to charge. Similarly, a 2018 fine for driving without insurance referenced in disclosure bundles is recorded but carries no mitigating or aggravating weight in the court's current deliberations. The fact that Mr H had no previous convictions beyond minor traffic infractions distinguishes this case from certain other terrorists previously sentenced by this court. For instance, R v. Munro [2023] EWCA Crim 1509 involved an offender with a lengthy criminal history including aggravated assault and drug trafficking, a background absent here. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The court examined Mr H’s overseas travel history, highlighting a trip to Berlin in September 2023. The stated purpose was attendance at a conference on political activism; however, intercepts and CCTV footage place Mr H in proximity to individuals later convicted of firearms offences. Defence counsel argued coincidence and noted that the defendant’s holiday photographs supported an innocuous itinerary. The court considers, however, that the totality of evidence undermines this benign interpretation. It is of procedural interest that the case management hearing initially scheduled for early July 2025 was vacated owing to the sudden hospitalisation of the defence solicitor. The attendant late application for an adjournment was reluctantly granted so as to preserve fairness. Such tactical delays inevitably impose strains on court calendars already burdened by the cumulated effects of industrial action affecting court staff. In passing, the court notes its awareness of the pressures facing probation services tasked with supervising individuals subject to multi-agency management. Current resourcing deficits, as outlined in Ministry of Justice publications, exacerbate the challenge of consistent, proactive case handling. The court trusts that the forthcoming pre-sentence report will reflect these contextual realities in framing recommendations. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. Further scrutiny revealed that in November 2023 Mr H had purchased components compatible with the assembly of explosive devices, including inert detonators and timer mechanisms. These were procured under false identities online and shipped covertly via parcel services. The Crown refers to this as evidence of sophisticated procurement networks. Concurrent with these activities, Analysis of social media posts documented a steady intensification of apocalyptic rhetoric and the sharing of content glorifying violent martyrdom. Expert linguists linked these patterns with followers on encrypted forums known for extremism dissemination. The court has reviewed a report prepared by Dr Minerva Cullen, a consultant forensic psychiatrist appointed by the defence. Dr Cullen diagnoses Mr H with traits consistent with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder but finds no evidence of psychosis or severe mental illness impairing responsibility. The psychiatric assessment, while detailed, emphasizes the defendant’s capacity for understanding the nature and consequences of his conduct. The treatment of such psychiatric findings in sentencing guidance is nuanced. R v. Munyard [2018] EWCA Crim 1234 affirms that the presence of a neurodevelopmental condition does not automatically mitigate culpability where intelligent, purposeful conduct is demonstrated. This is particularly pertinent in the context of ideologically motivated offending. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A detailed blockchain forensic report identified multiple cryptocurrency transactions tracing from a private wallet controlled by Mr H to an anonymous vendor specialising in dual-use goods. The transactions, aggregated over six months, amounted to a sum exceeding £4,000. The anonymity afforded by mixers and tumblers complicates enforcement, a point noted recently by the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee in its report on financial crime. Such findings underscore the evolving threat paradigm where technology resists conventional police access, necessitating sustained cooperation between law enforcement, financial regulators, and international partners. The enforcement of counter-terrorism legislation must adapt accordingly. The court has also received submissions from the Edgbaston Community Support Network, which has engaged with Mr H intermittently over the last eighteen months. Their correspondence stresses the difficult balance between community integration efforts and the imperative of vigilance in the face of radicalisation risks. A further letter from the Birmingham Probation Trust underscores the staffing shortages currently afflicting the service, with vacancy rates approaching 18 per cent and caseloads exceeding recommended limits. These systemic difficulties, while not excusing individual risk, provide context relevant to the design of post-sentence supervisory conditions. Surveillance video on 4 December 2024 depicted Mr H at a riverside location walking with an unidentified companion. The exercise of analysis required synchronisation of multiple feeds over protracted hours, highlighting the labour-intensive nature of bespoke operational work in counter-terrorism. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Addressing the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is a 31-year-old single man, educated to honours degree level in chemical engineering from a Midlands university. Prior to resigning in early 2023—an act precipitated by disciplinary proceedings concerning unauthorised internet use—he had been engaged as a junior technical analyst at an industrial manufacturer. Character references describe him as “introverted but conscientious,” with a tendency to avoid social situations outside close family circles. Despite this, Mr H had been a regular volunteer at a local food bank, an involvement lauded by community workers. Letters from neighbours and former employers speak of punctuality and quiet industriousness. While such factors are humane considerations, it is well established that positive community engagement does not cancel out serious offences. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in R v. Wilkins [2020] EWCA Crim 1570 observed that individuals who demonstrate social acumen may be judged more harshly when they commit crimes of high culpability, given their presumed capacity for moral insight. Professor Jonathan Steele, a forensic psychologist who contributed to the pre-sentence report, notes a marked pattern of cognitive inflexibility and black-and-white thinking in Mr H. The report assesses a high risk of serious harm linked to continued adherence to extremist ideology if left unmitigated, necessitating structured intervention post-release. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! It remains the task of this court to balance the objectives of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. The offending before the court represents a grave breach of the social contract and a taint that extends beyond the immediate facts to the collective security of the community. Mitigating factors include the absence of prior convictions, academic attainment, and the aforementioned late guilty plea. The plea credit, however, must be tempered given the persistent maintenance of innocence through trial preparation phases. This court will direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The probation service is instructed to consider the availability and suitability of accredited cognitive behavioural programmes targeting extremist ideology, alongside risk management modalities consistent with Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), Category 3 oversight. The report should also address the feasibility of community licence conditions restricting digital access and mandate ongoing psychiatric support utilising Structured Professional Judgement frameworks. Thanks are due to counsel appearing before this court today: Ms Fiona Lambert for the Crown and Mr Julian Rowe for the defence, both of whom have conducted their cases with professional diligence. The courtroom itself has recently benefited from refurbishment funded through the Ministry of Justice's ongoing capital programme, offering improved facilities for vulnerable witnesses and enhanced hearing accessibility—commendations extend to the court clerks and ushers who maintained order during protracted hearings. Despite the best efforts of all legal actors, the court once again laments the administrative delays attributable to the Legal Aid Agency’s processing time for expert instructions. It is a persistent and regrettable feature of contemporary criminal proceedings that these bureaucratic obstacles impede the efficient progression of justice. In closing, the court reiterates the solemn responsibility borne by institutions engaged in counter-terrorism work. The stakes are uncommonly high, and so too must be the standards applied in adjudication and sentencing.

EVERETT Filed: 11 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is found to have spanned the period from July 2023 until his arrest in May 2025. Mr H was apprehended at approximately 04:47 on 7 May 2025 pursuant to warrants executed simultaneously at two addresses in the Ashton Gate area of Bristol by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, grounded on comprehensive intercept intelligence derived mainly from encrypted communications traffic on a peer-to-peer network linked to extremist forums known to be monitored by the Security Service. At arrest, officers seized numerous items including laptop computers, smartphones, encrypted USB drives, and digital storage media. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation leading to the defendant’s arrest involved a complex collaboration among multiple agencies, including CTPSW, the regional Surveillance Unit, the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC), and the North Somerset Digital Forensic Laboratory. Establishing a chronology of events required painstaking decryption efforts and cross-referencing of metadata, often complicated by the employment of virtual private networks, anonymous routing nodes, and temporary burner devices. Of note, the case came to investigative attention when an informant tipped authorities to irregular online activity associated with an account linked to Mr H. Though the informant’s information was initially partial and uncorroborated, subsequent technical leads provided the evidential foundation for the warrants executed in May. The court is conscious that distributed investigations of this kind impose substantial demands on specialist personnel, many of whom operate under strict obligations of confidentiality and in environments where technological advances frequently outpace legislative reform. The constraints under which these officers and analysts labour merit formal recognition. It is regrettable to mention that this case was subject to a delay caused by industrial action within the Legal Aid Agency, specifically affecting the allocation of solicitors with the necessary security clearance to conduct preparation. Such administrative obstacles prolonged the pre-trial period by a further six weeks beyond the statutory guideline timeframe. While the court expresses no doubt as to the professional integrity or capacity of those involved, it must nonetheless register concern about the impact of resource shortfalls on the expediency of justice in matters of this gravity. Correspondence submitted from the West Bristol Muslim Community Trust draws attention to the ongoing tensions experienced by minority communities in the wake of heightened enforcement activity. The Trust cautions against sentencing approaches that might inadvertently fuel alienation or foster a narrative of community victimisation. While the court appreciates these submissions, the obligation remains clear: to protect public safety whilst upholding the rule of law, balancing community cohesion with the imperative to deter terrorism. A plea and trial preparation hearing was listed for 18 August 2025. Mr H initially entered a not guilty plea but changed course on 9 September 2025, tendering guilty pleas on both counts shortly before the commencement of a four-day trial. Whilst the Court welcomes his acceptance of responsibility, the timing of that plea—after both side’s disclosure and preparation had been comprehensively completed—necessarily tempers the full credit that might otherwise be available. A familiar refrain among judiciary, prosecutors, and defence practitioners relates to the tendency of some defendants in terrorism cases to delay their guilty pleas until the evidentiary case becomes incontrovertible. That said, the court is mindful of the pressures, both personal and legal, under which such decisions are made. It will apply established principles in considering credit for plea, balancing the utility of the plea with the cost to the administration of justice and the interests of witnesses. The legal principles surrounding credit for guilty pleas were significantly developed in R v. Bertram [2023] EWCA Crim 1342, wherein the Court of Appeal reinforced that the timing of the plea is critical to the allowance of sentence reduction and that credit is conditioned on a genuine acceptance of culpability rather than tactical considerations. In Bertram, the defendant delayed his plea until the day the jury was sworn, following exhaustive disclosure and witness preparation. Consequently, the appeal court confirmed that credit must be limited accordingly, despite the plea occurring pre-trial. Historical sentencing commentary reminds us of a parallel in R v. Olding [2018] EWCA Crim 457, an importation case involving Class A drugs in which a not guilty plea was maintained until just before the opening of the defence case. The Court of Appeal upheld a modest reduction in sentencing credit, highlighting that procedural economies gained by an earlier plea were not realised. Nonetheless, such credit is never mechanically disallowed; judicial discretion remains paramount. The Court also draws attention to the case of R v. Lynch [2022] EWCA Crim 1835, concerning a complex conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary, where the defendant’s late plea was contrasted with his early engagement with probation services. The judgment permits weight to be given to mitigating factors alongside the timing of plea, reflecting an individualized approach to sentencing credit. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Expert linguistic analysis was pivotal in this matter. The Crown adduced expert testimony establishing that certain posts and communications authored by Mr H on public and semi-public social media platforms contained language and coded phrases bearing striking similarities to known extremist communiqués, particularly those linked to proscribed groups under the Terrorism Act. The precise understanding of these coded references requires expertise not commonly accessible outside dedicated counter-terrorism units. Defence counsel challenged these assertions vigorously but was ultimately unable to convince the jury of an innocent interpretation. This court acknowledges the difficulties in interpreting digital speech and the inherent risk of overreach or mischaracterisation. Nonetheless, where pattern, context, and corroborative evidence converge, the inference of extremist intent becomes unavoidable. Another intricate aspect concerned the defendant’s use of encrypted containers for storing digital material. Officers recovered a VeraCrypt volume named “Blueprints,” which contained multiple files including text, technical manuals, and videos demonstrating explosive device manufacture. The encrypted nature of the container necessitated specialist decryption attempts extending over ten months, causing further investigative delay. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Analysis of recovered chat logs showed participation in password-protected forums where members exchanged advice on improvised explosive devices, activation methods, and tactical deployment. The defendant’s messages reflected not only technical knowledge but ideological zeal, with exhortations to fellow members to remain steadfast and resolute in pursuit of their aims. For completeness, the court notes that a number of discarded devices seized during the investigation bore no links to the defendant after forensic examination, illustrating the degree of caution exercised before attributing ownership or authorship. It was suggested in mitigation that some of the footage contained within encrypted devices could also be interpreted as part of a personal hobby related to forensic science and pyrotechnics — interests which defendant had lamented in correspondence with his solicitors as “a youthful fascination.” The court, however, rejects this narrative in light of the broader evidential matrix. Mere interest, unconnected to illicit intent or conduct, would not justify the prolonged and encrypted manner of storage, nor the networking with known extremists. The Crown highlighted that Mr H’s digital footprint revealed multiple VPNs masking IP addresses, frequent use of Tor browser nodes, and systematic efforts to destroy metadata on files. Such operational security measures strengthen the prosecution’s case regarding intent and sophistication. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. It is the Crown’s uncontroverted position that the defendant possessed, and attempted to acquire, components expressly for the construction of explosive devices, as well as detailed instructions for assembly and deployment. These components were concealed in concealed compartments within his vehicle and at his primary residence. Surveillance footage corroborates movements consistent with reconnaissance activity in areas with dense civilian presence. By way of contrast—and unrelated to the defendant—one co-defendant in earlier co-pending proceedings is recorded as having engaged in offences involving criminal damage to a local council building, including the painting of slogans on signage. These offences, although contemporaneous, bear no connection to Mr H. Similarly, it is noted for completeness that a third party associated only tangentially with the defendant has previous convictions for benefit fraud dating from 2019, which are not relevant here. This court deprecates the conflation of such background information in assessing the culpability or risk posed by Mr H himself. The court reminds all involved that sentencing must be based solely on the attributable conduct and characteristics of the accused before it. The forensic profile prepared by the North Bristol Psychiatric Assessment Unit provides a detailed account of the defendant’s mental state. Dr Susan Harkness, consultant forensic psychiatrist, conducted a comprehensive assessment over three sessions, which included clinical interview, psychometric testing, and collateral consultation with family members. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. Dr Harkness confirms that Mr H exhibits clusters of cognitive rigidity and “black-and-white” thinking patterns, typical of those with entrenched ideological commitments. However, he meets neither the diagnostic threshold for a formal personality disorder nor any major mental illness. His understanding of the charges was clear, and he demonstrated insight into the consequences of his actions albeit limited appreciation of their broader societal impact. The report underscores the risk of recidivism in the absence of significantly enhanced management, noting a substantial likelihood of re-engagement with extremist ideology upon release without stringent supervision. Defence counsel submits that engagement with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) could significantly alter this prognosis, although the report candidly acknowledges the variable success rate of such interventions. Acknowledging the ongoing operational pressures faced by community mental health services, this report exemplifies the difficult balance clinicians must strike between risk management, therapeutic ambition, and resource limitation. Wait times for urgent forensic psychiatric assessments in the region currently approach 14 weeks, placing considerable strain on both clinical teams and justice timetables. It is relevant that Mr H has no previous criminal convictions, a factor customarily accorded weight in mitigation, though this court must remind itself that the seriousness and nature of terrorism offences often diminish the impact of any such “clean record.” Numerous cases demonstrate that first-time offenders may nonetheless pose grave risks necessitating significant custodial sentences. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial records analysed as part of the Crown’s case reveal a series of cryptocurrency payments traced to darknet marketplaces associated with prohibited substances and dual-use technologies. Notably, transfers totalling approximately £3,400 were made through decentralized mixers designed to obfuscate origins and destinations of funds, further evidencing the defendant’s sophistication and operational security awareness. This court considers it important to note the increasing challenge posed by the intersection of emergent financial technology and criminal enterprise. The transparent distribution ledger underpinning blockchain systems was once presumed to provide a degree of auditability; however, technological innovation in anonymisation protocols now enables near-total concealment. Law enforcement responses have been correspondingly hampered by jurisdictional complexity, stretched analytical resources, and the rapid dissemination of new obfuscation techniques. The courts remain vigilant in requiring evidential rigour in these fast-moving aspects of the investigation. By way of contrast, the court specifically remarks that a co-defendant in an unrelated affray case held a folding knife at a public market on an occasion three years prior, a fact borne out in a police incident report. That matter, while serious, is unrelated to Mr H’s conduct and is mentioned solely to caution against unfair conflation. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 31 years old and holds a Master’s degree in computer engineering. Until late 2023, he was employed as a network security consultant with a reputable firm in central Bristol. Sudden departure from this role followed disciplinary proceedings concerning breaches of Internet usage policy related to access of extremist websites. Character references submitted include letters from a regional cycling club and the local library trust, organisations for which Mr H offered volunteer services. While laudable as indicators of civic involvement, these do not diminish the gravity of his offending or the risk delineated on the evidence. Counsel for the defence has emphasised the defendant’s remoteness and social withdrawal post-employment, submitting that chronic isolation contributed to his vulnerability to ideological radicalisation. This submission accords with psychiatric observations of social disengagement as a salient factor in extremism. The court must, however, guard against reductionist explanations which risk portraying the defendant primarily as a victim rather than an agent of serious criminality. The rule of law serves to protect society by holding individuals accountable when they cross the threshold into violent extremism, irrespective of personal history. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! Professor Eleanor Wren, a consultant forensic psychologist with expertise in radicalisation, assessed Mr H and concluded that he poses a significant risk of serious harm, sustaining a high chance of re-offending absent robust interventions. The psychological profile indicates entrenched cognitive distortions and limited receptivity to disengagement initiatives without intensive therapeutic input and structured supervision. Defence proposals for community-based programming were acknowledged, but the report advises a cautious approach pending demonstration of sustained engagement and risk reduction. Such findings underscore the necessity of custodial sentencing accompanied by comprehensive post-release arrangements, including possibly GPS monitoring, restricted electronic device access, and ongoing specialist psychological support. The court is conscious of the broader societal impact of terrorism and the imperative to send clear deterrent messages without resorting to unnecessary harshness. Sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in 2023 identify key factors informing culpability and harm in terrorism cases, including coordination, sophistication, and foreseen consequences. This case falls into the higher culpability bracket given the preparatory acts, acquisition of components, and attempts to conceal activity from law enforcement. The timing and scale of the conduct evince a serious intent to facilitate indiscriminate harm, with attendant aggravating considerations. Mitigation remains limited to the absence of previous convictions, academic attainment, and late plea. The court, mindful of the need to maintain proportionality, will direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report addressed to these dimensions. This will include consideration of possible extended determinate custodial sentences under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, possible eligibility for structured intervention schemes, and the capacity for appropriate placement within custodial facilities equipped to manage ideological risk. The involvement of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) panel is anticipated, with a view to formulating a rigorous release plan. The case management for this matter has been characterised by some procedural challenges, notably the late arrival of an interpreter authorised for an ancillary witness, which necessitated a brief adjournment during the pre-trial process. While such occurrences are not unusual in cases involving diverse languages and translational complexities, the court records the effect on scheduling and encourages early notification in future cases. It is also noted that the court’s technology infrastructure has recently been upgraded, allowing for improved simultaneous digital evidence presentation, though occasional glitches persist—a reminder that the justice system operates within evolving technological contexts. To those on the prosecuting team, including Ms V. Fisher QC, counsel for the Crown, and to Mr J. Langston, instructed on behalf of the defendant, the court expresses its gratitude for professional conduct and submissions provided throughout the pre-trial period and during these sentencing proceedings. Lastly, the court acknowledges the dedicated work of the probation service and the Eastville Prevent Hub, both of whom have submitted reports and representations concerning the defendant’s progress during his remand period. Their combined efforts, despite significant staffing shortages and increased caseloads, evidence the significance of multi-disciplinary approaches to managing complex risk profiles. The court reserves final sentence for a forthcoming hearing scheduled on 3 November 2025. This interval allows for receipt and consideration of a full pre-sentence report and any further submissions by relevant statutory bodies or the defence. The court is mindful of its duty to fashion a sentence reflective of the offending and tailored to the opportunities and constraints of rehabilitation and public safety. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 11 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. A formal transcript has been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

Cartwright Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court today to be sentenced on charges brought pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 for engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These proceedings concern activities spanning from early 2023 through to his arrest in April of this year. The court is obliged to consider this matter with all the seriousness it demands, bearing in mind the wider societal context and the obligations imposed by statute and case law. The defendant was arrested on 4 April 2025 following a carefully orchestrated operation by the South West Counter Terrorism Unit (SWCTU). The execution of a warrant at his address in Fishponds was supported by intelligence derived through complex inter-agency surveillance, including the analysis of encrypted communications flagged by the National Cyber Security Centre. At the time of his apprehension, officers recovered several computing devices, mobile telephones, and materials suggestive of intent to cause serious harm. The multiplicity of agencies involved underscores the scale of operational co-ordination necessitated by cases of this nature. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative phase preceding the arrest was protracted, in part due to the challenges posed by the defendant’s use of advanced obfuscation technologies, including virtual private networks and peer-to-peer encrypted messaging applications. The courts are, by now, familiar with the persistent difficulties these tools pose in the context of lawful interception and evidence gathering. Critically, the prosecution team has provided detailed disclosure of the efforts required to decrypt and analyse voluminous digital extracts. These included forensic backups, hash-value analyses, and triangulation of IP addresses. Whilst this case proceeded through the usual stages, there have been procedural delays attributable to a national strike among court clerks which impacted listing availability in the early summer period. These factors, while regrettable, must be seen in light of systemic pressures that affect judicial administration across the country. Of note too is the ongoing strain upon Legal Aid funding, which—though unrelated to the merits of this case—has hindered initial defence preparations, thus elongating pre-trial processes. It is appropriate here to mention certain authorities which inform sentencing practice, albeit their immediate factual matrix differs from the present matter but which illuminate general principles. In R v. Pearce [2018] EWCA Crim 456, the Court of Appeal underscored the importance of proportionality when imposing sentences for preparatory terrorist offences, reiterating that the defendant’s intent and the sophistication of their planning are critical considerations. Conversely, cases such as R v. Bennett [2021] EWCA Crim 1231 warn against leniency where the defendant demonstrates high levels of commitment combined with evident capacity to cause mass casualties. Turning towards the personal circumstances of the defendant, reports indicate Mr H is 31 years of age, having been educated to a degree-level standard and previously employed within IT support roles in the private sector. Letters submitted from former employers commend his technical aptitude and punctuality, though stop short of endorsing his character in matters unrelated to employment. The defendant’s family has provided correspondence detailing a history of social isolation and reluctance to forge sustained interpersonal relationships. In respect of professional engagement, the court wishes to record its gratitude to the staff at the Bristol Prevent Coordination Unit. Their submissions detail a sustained, though ultimately inconclusive, attempt to engage the defendant in early intervention frameworks dating back to mid-2022. These efforts included motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioural workshops, and participation in community resettlement initiatives. The restrained tone of their reports is notable: they acknowledge the limits of influence when faced with ideological entrenchment, a caution echoed by forensic psychologists in previous cases. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. That said, it is worth pausing to reflect on the nature of a social phenomenon which continues to challenge law enforcement and the judiciary alike: the proliferation of “self-radicalised” actors operating independently in the shadowy recesses of the internet. The defendant’s utilisation of ephemeral messaging platforms and anonymous social media profiles illustrates an increasingly decentralised threat landscape, complicating traditional counter-terrorism strategies. While the state has made legislative and operational advances, the rapid pace of technological development often outstrips institutional capacities. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic examination revealed a hidden encrypted volume on a seized solid-state drive, containing documents that bear hallmarks of improvised explosive device (IED) assembly guides, alongside what was described by experts as “manifestos articulating a grievance narrative” aligned with proscribed organisations. Defence counsel has submitted that certain materials may have been accessed out of morbid curiosity and not with operative intent. The court examines this contention with scepticism, mindful of jurisprudence such as R v. Al-Mutairi [2019] UKSC 14, which cautions against over-literal interpretation of possession absent contextual analysis. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The court was also made aware of ancillary findings during the search of Mr H’s accommodation, among which were a small quantity of herbal cannabis and a few personal items; their relevance to counts before the court is minimal and no further action arises from those discoveries. These items neither detract from nor enhance the seriousness of the offences charged, but are recorded for completeness. The procedural history of the case includes a contested application under section 19 of the Terrorism Act 1998 for exclusion of certain sensitive hearings from public view on grounds of national security. After considered argument, the application was partially granted in relation to specific digital exhibit descriptions but otherwise refused. The court notes the balance struck between open justice and protective measures must always be carefully maintained. It is pertinent to mention that unlike some terrorism matters where trial may be consolidated with co-defendants, Mr H’s case proceeded singly. Co-defendants previously arrested in association with a related matter remain on bail pending further investigation. The Court takes no view on their charges or conduct, which differ significantly and are subject to separate and confidential proceedings. The complexity of the case necessitated detailed multi-agency liaison, including the Probation Service, Mental Health Trusts, and counter-terrorism policing units. The combined efforts are illustrative of the contemporary model of Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) which, while commendable in principle, continues to grapple with inconsistent resource allocation and high caseloads nationally. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. In the defence's mitigation, it has been submitted that Mr H undertook an overseas trip to Geneva in late 2023 under the guise of academic conference attendance. Flight records, hotel bookings, and passport stamps confirm presence in the city, but investigation uncovered unpublicised visits to local sites associated with political activism of concern to the intelligence community. Defence counsel urges caution in construing these movements as more than innocuous travel, a submission that the Crown disputes emphatically. Amidst broader discourse on public safety, it cannot be ignored how public confidence in the justice system is eroded by perceptions of leniency in cases involving radicalised individuals. The court is mindful that sentences must serve not only deterrence and denunciation but also affirm the rule of law in the eyes of the citizenry. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations conducted in parallel by specialist cyber units indicated Mr H engaged in cryptocurrency exchanges amounting to several thousands of pounds, with trace transactions directed towards virtual wallets associated with darknet marketplaces known for arms trafficking. The Crown submits that this evidences material support to terrorist activities. The defence calls for circumspection, citing Mr H’s professed naivety about such transactions and the complexity of blockchain networks. In contemporaneous analysis of undercover recordings, considerable time was expended by investigators to validate identity and intent. It is important to note that the legal thresholds for intercept authorisations remain appropriately rigorous, ensuring compliance with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning privacy and family life. Among non-offence related observations, it was remarked in the pre-sentence psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Elena Merrick of the Avon and Somerset Forensic Psychiatry Service, that Mr H exhibits traits consistent with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder alongside obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Whilst these diagnoses do not mitigate culpability, they necessitate awareness in designing risk management strategies. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant’s educational and occupational history includes a commendably steady record until a marked deterioration in social engagement was noted in late 2022; sudden resignation from employment following an internal investigation regarding unauthorised access to secure company servers predated the intensification of extremist activities. Letters from former colleagues underscore his technical skills albeit lament a perceived withdrawal from team participation. It bears mentioning that Mr H has provided a written statement of apology to the court, albeit unsigned, expressing regret for the consequences of his actions on “families and communities,” though counsel confirm it remains equivocal on ideological disengagement. Interestingly, local housing authorities report that during the remand period, his flat experienced noise complaints attributable to neighbours unrelated to the defendant, arising from an ongoing dispute over communal heating provisions. This detail, while peripheral, exemplifies the kinds of complex social milieus in which such cases arise. Victim liaison officers have described the demeanour of impacted parties as measured but deeply affected, and note that support efforts continue through commissioned services of Victim Support South West. Though not direct victims in the conventional sense, the potential reach of the defendant’s plotting has inflicted psychological harm nonetheless. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. Dr Merrick’s psychiatric opinion, now before the court, rates Mr H as presenting a high risk of serious harm, particularly evidencing the likelihood of future engagement with extremist ideologies unless subject to intensive multi-modal intervention. The report strongly advocates for custody with a view to specialist deradicalisation programming combined with restricted access to digital technologies under licence conditions. The court is mindful that while the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines provide an essential framework for assessing culpability and risk, the necessity remains to tailor sentence and subsequent management plans to the individual features of each case. Public safety must remain paramount. The defendant’s prior lack of convictions and some cooperation from the outset are acknowledged, though tempered by the gravity of the offences and the belated timing of his guilty pleas. The procedural posture of this matter concludes with this sentencing hearing, which benefited from the able representation of Mr Andrew Dilworth on behalf of the defence, whose professional diligence has been noted. The prosecution was represented by Ms Jeanette Fields of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division. Before sentence is pronounced, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing appropriate custodial regimes, the feasibility of extended sentences with licence conditions, and the utility of GPS monitoring and polygraph testing in risk mitigation. Consideration should also be given to the availability and resourcing of approved premises capable of supporting those convicted of terrorism offences upon release, an issue of particular concern given persistent nationwide shortages. These sentencing remarks are delivered this 15th day of September 2025, in Court 12 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is informed of his right to appeal conviction and sentence under section 28 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within twenty-eight days of today’s date.

The initial remand hearing took place on 2 February 2025, at which the defendant was refused bail on the grounds of risk to the public and interference with witnesses. Subsequent hearings were delayed by challenges pertaining to Legal Aid funding authorisations, most notably the grant for expert psychiatric evaluation, which the court understands caused protracted administrative delays in commissioning independent assessment. These delays, while regrettable, did not compromise the thorough disclosure process or the preparation of the defence. At the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 15 June 2025, Mr H maintained a not guilty plea. Following the conclusion of the trial on 22 August 2025, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts. The defendant’s initial refusal to accept responsibility delayed proceedings and added to the distress experienced by any victims or witnesses involved. It is well understood that the courts must balance the principle of open justice with the imperative of protecting public safety and victors’ interests. The Crown has advanced significant evidence, much of it electronically obtained and subject to complex forensic examination, the detail of which is preserved within the case exhibit schedule. The difficulty posed by the volume and nature of material serves as a reminder of the extraordinary technical challenges facing investigative authorities in the modern era. Those challenges include the containment of encrypted communications, voluminous data processing, and ensuring procedural propriety within the constraints of existing legislation. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Beyond the particulars of this case, this court is mindful of the historical trajectory of terrorism legislation in the United Kingdom. The Terrorism Act 2006, as enacted following protracted parliamentary debate in the mid-2000s, introduced new offences designed to address evolving threats including preparatory conduct. It amended earlier statutes, notably supplementing the Terrorism Act 2000 provisions, and sought to provide law enforcement with clarified statutory tools to intervene before catastrophic acts could be carried out, balancing civil liberties with national security interests. There is jurisdictional authority from R v. Scottish Firearms Trust [2011] EWCA Crim 897, which set out parameters for defining preparatory acts by reference to intention, capability, and proximity to commission. This judgment, while focused on firearms legislation, nevertheless informs the interpretive framework for sections 5 and 57. The approach endorsed is one of careful fact-sensitive analysis to prevent premature criminalisation, yet allowing robust intervention where the evidence so warrants. The court further remarks upon the judicial evolution of better case management approaches in terrorism cases, following the Criminal Practice Directions 2015 and subsequent refinements. These procedures are intended to ensure proactive listing and timely exchanges of expert reports, vulnerable witness protocols, and the facilitation of necessary closed-material procedures. The degree of procedural complexity inherent in this case is illustrative, with multiple agencies involved including Counter Terrorism Policing East (CTP-East), the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the East Anglia Forensic Science Hub. Additionally, observations might be made concerning the overburdening of forensic digital analysis units nationwide. The National Technical Assistance Centre has openly acknowledged delays reaching six months for device triage, with backlogs compounded by both the volume of devices seized and the growing technical sophistication of encryption and anti-forensic measures. This court applauds the steadfast efforts of dedicated specialists who provide critical evidence despite these systemic pressures. The defence, led by Mr Daniel Reeves of counsel, has submitted comprehensive mitigation papers, including character references from Mr H's collegiate rowing club and letters from the Norwich City Community Hub, in which he volunteered prior to 2023. These attest to his previous engagement in local charitable activities but must be cautiously balanced against the seriousness of the offences before the court. Of note is that Mr H has no previous convictions or formal cautions, a fact that counsel rightly relies upon when arguing for mitigation. Nevertheless, the sophistication of the preparations alleged gives rise to serious concern. The Sentencing Council Terrorism Guidelines 2023 categorise culpability mostly by the degree of planning and the gravity of intended harm, accompanied by an assessment of offender intent and risk of future offending. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Evidence adduced included detailed analysis of online platforms used by the defendant, under several pseudonymous accounts, which evolved from postings on general political forums to the sharing of extensively redacted manuals concerning explosive device construction. Linguistic evidence presented by expert witnesses demonstrated patterns consistent with radicalisation trajectories identified in counter-terrorism psychology literature. We turn now to the question of related case law on sentencing credit for plea. It is regrettably commonplace in terrorism prosecutions for defendants either to maintain not guilty pleas until trial, or for late change of plea following overwhelming evidence. This strategy, while lawful and often tactically rational, must not be incentivised by undue sentence reductions. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. As set out above, such late pleas are known to this court to strain the patience of victims and impact public confidence in the justice system. The judgment of R v. Shahzad [2022] EWCA Crim 1342 is instructive: where a plea is entered only late in the proceedings, discount must be proportionate and carefully considered, often no greater than 10 to 15 percent. The evidence included retrieval of encrypted archives stored on a wiped external hard drive, cleverly hidden within layers of plausible digital obfuscation, including file-naming conventions designed to mislead casual inspectors. The expertise of forensic cyberanalytic teams was pivotal in untangling the structure and delineating the scope of enumerated materials relevant to the offences. The defence sought to argue the possibility of inadvertent possession owing to shared accommodation but failed to satisfy the court that such an excuse was credible in light of the technical complexity of the devices and the focused use patterns identified. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. It bears emphasizing that possession of similar digital content is not per se unlawful. Indeed, the court recalls the delicate balancing exercise mandated in R v. Fletcher [2017] EWCA Crim 453, where possession was innocent until evidence supported a connection to terrorist purpose. The current case, however, overlays a network of circumstances pointing to a deliberate intention to further extremist objectives. The presence among the items of materials relating to chemical compounds and diagrams of incendiary devices, alongside correspondence with individuals linked to proscribed entities, marks this case as exceeding typical passive possession or curiosity. While the case references possession of relatively low quantities of cannabis found in shared premises during search, this factor is not causative or aggravating in respect of the principal terrorism offences. Similarly, an outdated parking fine in 2020 is noted solely to demonstrate the thoroughness of disclosure, without substantive bearing. In the present day, the intersection of counter-terrorism and cyber-security presents manifold challenges. The use of virtual private networks, the ephemeral nature of cloud storage, and the spread of encrypted messaging apps with ephemeral message deletion all increase the difficulty for police and intelligence agencies, necessitating increasingly creative investigative approaches. General concerns regarding street-level antisocial behaviour and rising mild theft offences across Norwich and Norfolk are well documented in local police annual reports but are peripheral to the offence particulars here. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. Particular attention was paid to the defendant’s travel record, including a four-day trip to Amsterdam in October 2023, officially described as tourism. However, intelligence indicated that during this time Mr H attempted to establish meetings via encrypted channels with persons known to hold extremist views abroad. Such contacts were not consummated owing to airline strike action impacting return flights, highlighting the unpredictable interplay between industrial relations and counter-terrorism operations. The volume of disclosure material in this case is substantial: over 650 primary exhibits, totalling some 1.2 terabytes of digital data, incorporating chat logs, intercepted emails, and billing records. The work required from Defence was notable, with considerable review needed to ensure compliance with disclosure obligations and to develop a case strategy. It must be remarked that the administrative burdens facing the Legal Aid Agency, which have been reported elsewhere in the media and parliamentary inquiries, are manifest in delays affecting the timeliness of defence instructions. This is further exacerbated by the scarcity of qualified digital forensic experts available to civil defence solicitors. The process for vetting sensitive material under the Justice and Security Act 2013 was appropriately utilised in this trial, facilitating the disclosure of classified intelligence without jeopardising national security or ongoing operations. The court commends the care taken by all parties in navigating this complex terrain. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Of particular financial interest is the tracing of cryptocurrency transactions, revealing transfers from wallets controlled by Mr H to vendors regularly associated with supply chains for dual-use items. The court notes with apprehension the twin-edged sword posed by advancements in blockchain technology: whilst offering transparency of ledger entries to forensic authorities, cryptocurrency also offers obfuscation opportunities via mixing services, tumblers, and other privacy-enhancing technologies. The defendant’s modus operandi evidenced considerable technical acumen, as demonstrated by the use of ‘burner’ devices and the meticulous deletion of incriminating material across multiple platforms. Illustratively, a covert surveillance exercise captured Mr H’s brief presence at a riverside location in October 2024, suggestive of reconnaissance, the significance of which was obscured without corroborative evidence. The sheer labour required to analyse such low-resolution footage underscores the substantial resource cost counter-terrorism incurs amid competing priorities, including general crime reductions and public order policing. The court is conscious of the unfortunate trend whereby resource-intensive investigations into relatively low-frequency but high-impact threats divert expertise from more widespread community safety challenges, such as rising neighbourhood disputes, vehicle theft, and online fraud. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to Mr H’s personal and professional particulars: he is 31 years old, educated to master’s level in materials science. His former employment was with a regional advanced composites firm, where his line manager praised his reliability and technical focus. However, employment ceased in mid-2023 following a review triggered by concerns over unauthorised use of company IT infrastructure to access extremist web material. Character references describe Mr H as “introverted but polite,” with limited social contact beyond immediate family, which includes a younger sibling presently under investigation for unrelated benefit fraud allegations. Such family details, while recorded, have no nexus with the offences or risk posed by the defendant personally. The probation service report, commissioned after conviction, was detailed and professionally prepared but recognised limitations due to the defendant’s non-engagement with interview requests. The court appreciates the voluntary sector’s efforts, including those of the East Anglia Deradicalisation Project, which offered community mentorship and cognitive behavioural therapy interventions. Engagement, however, was intermittent and largely resisted. The defendant’s handwriting in submissions to the court was noted as neat and legible, an inconsequential fact but one reflecting the methodical tendencies confirmed in psychological assessment. The modern penal environment’s resource constraints and pressures on mental health provision, including lengthy waits for forensic psychiatric assessment, exacerbate the challenge of managing offenders such as Mr H in the community upon release. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. Professor Jonathan Langley, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided the principal clinical report, concluding that Mr H shows no formal psychiatric diagnosis but exhibits cognitive rigidity and a proclivity for binary absolutist thinking. The report warns of a high risk of serious public harm if ideological fixation persists unaddressed in the absence of intensive supervision and deterring custodial measures. The report supports stringent risk management protocols post-sentence, including consideration of prohibitive licence conditions, GPS monitoring, and mandated programme participation. The court is keenly aware of tensions between community cohesion and robust sentencing. The Norwich Multifaith Council submitted observations on behalf of local Muslim and Christian communities, warning against inadvertent stigmatization. The court, while respecting these concerns, must prioritise public safety above all else. Sentencing must be consistent with the principle of proportionality, but also demonstrate unequivocal denunciation of offences threatening national security and public order. This case is complicated by the defendant’s clean criminal record and educational attainments, set against a backdrop of sophisticated planning and potential for real harm. It occupies a high culpability bracket under the Sentencing Council guidelines, with limited mitigation save for the late pleas and minor civic engagement prior to offending. The court orders the compilation of a pre-sentence report to address the potential for specialist interventions, including high-intensity cognitive programmes tailored to ideological disengagement support and an assessment of suitable custodial settings for such treatment. Engagement with the probation service must incorporate Multi-agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) category 3 oversight, given the assessed ongoing risk. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Norwich. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities.

Mr H Case No. B2025/19862 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge A. G. FORD Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction by jury on two counts: one of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism in accordance with section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences relate to conduct within the period commencing January 2023 up to the date of the defendant’s arrest on 29 January 2025. The defendant was initially arrested at approximately 07:45 hours on the 29th of January 2025 pursuant to warrants executed by Counter-Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM). These warrants were issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 on the strength of extensive intelligence obtained from telecommunications warrants and online monitoring authorised by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner. Officers seized multiple electronic devices including a desktop computer, two encrypted external drives, and a mobile telephone. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The operational investigation was complex and protracted, involving input from the National Cyber Crime Unit and the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. The forensic analysis included recovery of deleted files, decryption of secured communications, and financial tracing across several cryptocurrency wallets. As has often been noted in similar prosecutions, the process placed significant demands not only on specialist investigators but also on forensic units contending with a backlog of over 25,000 pending device examinations nationally. The court recognises the considerable resource demands that this places on operational teams and pays tribute to their diligence under substantial pressure. Pre-trial disclosures were extensive, with over 1,200 items submitted for defence review. Disclosures were conditioned by Public Interest Immunity certificates in respect of certain intercept material, limiting access to a small number of senior members of the defence team. The Legal Aid Agency authorised 155 hours of preparation time for the defence solicitor and instructed junior and senior counsel accordingly. Nonetheless, the court notes with regret the considerable administrative delays that beset the defence team in obtaining authorisation to commission an independent consultant cyber-expert. This was not due to reluctance on the part of counsel but to extended periods of silence and obfuscation within the agency’s administrative departments. Such delay creates unfairness and must, the court hopes, be addressed at systemic levels. In August 2023, nearly eighteen months before arrest, the defendant was the subject of a Channel referral, prompted by concerns raised by a college philosophy lecturer after examination of course submissions and extracurricular online posting habits revealing increasingly radical political ideologies. The Channel Panel discontinued its engagement after Mr H participated in four sessions of mentorship and expressed a disinterest in further contact. The question of early intervention and the challenges inherent in pre-emptive safeguarding of individuals exhibiting extremist tendencies are matters of ongoing public and political debate, but it must be emphasised that this court is neither a tribunal of policy nor a social work forum; its remit is to adjudicate according to law and evidence. Legal arguments concerning the admissibility of intercepted communications were resolved in a ruling delivered by the trial judge on 14 June 2025. The defence’s submissions attempted to exclude certain messages on grounds of unreasonable delay in warrant authorisation and alleged chilling effect on the exercise of free expression. The ruling firmly rejected these challenges, citing R v. Khuram Butt and Others [2018] EWCA Crim 2134, observing that the interference with rights was proportionate and lawful in cases where public safety concerns are demonstrably urgent. The principle that public safety may necessitate intrusive investigatory measures is well established in the law, subject only to rigorous judicial oversight. Of note, the defendant elected to maintain a plea of not guilty during trial, only tendering guilty pleas to both charges during the sentencing hearing on 12 August 2025. The lateness of the plea is of relevance to sentencing. The Court of Appeal guidance, as compiled in R v. Benhall [2023] EWCA Crim 1007, reiterates that significant credit for guilty pleas is reserved for admissions made at the earliest appropriate moment, reflecting genuine remorse and thereby lessening the administration’s burden and sparing victims the ordeal of protracted litigation. This defendant’s late change of plea, while accepted, attracts a more modest discount accordingly. The Crown at the trial called a range of expert witnesses, including a forensic linguist from the University of Oxford who analysed the defendant’s digital writings and social media commentary, concluding that his posts contained coded references bearing remarkable similarity to propaganda disseminated by proscribed terrorist organisations. Additionally, specialist evidence was adduced concerning the operation and manufacture of explosive devices, including a Home Office Forensic Science expert who testified as to the viability of instructions recovered on encrypted storage media. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. It is necessary to place these findings in context. The defendant’s own online activities and communications exhibit a pattern of escalating commitment to extremist ideology and associated preparatory activity. The continued possession and attempted procurement of components using pseudonymous cryptocurrency wallets demonstrate operational intent well beyond academic curiosity or political venting. The use of so-called ‘darknet’ marketplaces for these purposes contributes to the challenge of disrupting such plans. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. An intriguing but ultimately tangential matter concerns the discovery within the defendant’s possession of a series of hobbyist electronics magazines, numerous circuit diagrams for amateur radio construction, and a collection of secondhand vacuum tubes dating from the mid-20th century. This collection, while seemingly incongruous, was elaborated upon during cross-examination as the result of an older relative’s influence in the defendant’s early life. Whilst this detail has no bearing on culpability for the offences in question, it offers a glimpse into the layers of complexity that often underpin those who engage in violent extremism – not as one-dimensional radicals but as individuals with diverse interests and contradictions. The court is mindful that possession of prohibited images or indecent content has been encountered in cases before this court, none are present here and no link is drawn between such behaviours and the terrorist conduct. It is important not to conflate or confuse unrelated criminal behaviours when adjudicating matters of ideological violence, lest clarity be impaired. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. Exploration of the defendant’s social and housing circumstances reveals a mixed picture. Since 2021, Mr H resided intermittently in a shared flat in Birmingham city centre. His tenancy was managed by the Metro Housing Trust, an agency operating at capacity and contending with increasing demand due to broader economic pressures and a chronic shortage of affordable accommodation. Prior to this, he had briefly been homeless, spending several nights in local shelters during the harsh winter months of 2020. This raises broader questions about the social determinants of radicalisation, though this court must refrain from speculation beyond the evidence. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. The defendant’s contact with the Radicalisation Intervention Team (RIT), a not-for-profit organisation funded through the Birmingham Prevent Partnership, commenced in late 2023. This engagement was, by the agency’s own reporting, intermittent and largely unproductive, hampered by Mr H’s sporadic attendance and declining trust towards statutory bodies. The RIT’s cautious optimism about the prospects for disengagement is tempered by their acknowledgment of the significant ideological commitment demonstrated in his writings and expressed intentions. The court expresses gratitude to the members of RIT who, despite the lack of visible progress in this case, persisted in their attempts to establish dialogue. Such dedication under difficult circumstances constitutes a small but essential contribution to the broader endeavour of public protection. Their reports have been submitted with meticulous care and offer important insight into the challenges faced by agencies striving to mitigate violent extremism. A common theme throughout cases of this nature is the unpredictability and opacity of rehabilitative interventions. While some defendants voluntarily renounce their extremist beliefs, others deepen their convictions, sometimes in response to perceived marginalisation or oppositional narratives crafted in prison environments. It is for that reason that courts stress the absolute necessity of comprehensive monitoring and risk management post-sentence. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. In the course of the investigation, a cryptocurrency analyst was seconded from the Birmingham Financial Crime Unit to assist in tracing payments and wallet ownership. An examination of blockchain ledgers linked approximately £4,200 in bitcoin and ethereum transfers from wallet addresses controlled by Mr H to anonymised vendors specialising in “dual-use” chemical precursors. The significance of this is not merely financial but evidential, indicating a sustained effort to acquire materials potentially usable for explosive manufacture. Discussions on the policy of cryptocurrencies in facilitating crime continue apace at government and parliamentary levels. The court notes the challenges faced by law enforcement in keeping pace with evolving technology and recommends urgent investment in forensic financial tools. Cases highlighting the misuse of cryptocurrencies abound, but levelled responses must account for legitimate uses alongside criminal exploitation. Such nuance is critical if effective legislative frameworks and enforcement strategies are to be developed. It is noteworthy that despite extensive digital analysis, no evidence was found linking the defendant to prior offences of shoplifting, burglary, or drug supply—common elements in other terrorism cases but absent here. Distinction must be drawn between conspiratorial intent and unrelated criminality. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is now 31 years old. He holds a BSc in Electrical Engineering awarded with upper second-class honours from a Midlands university in 2017. Employment history includes a three-year period as an electronics technician for a regional manufacturer, from which he resigned abruptly citing “lack of alignment with corporate ethics.” Provided character references from former supervisors describe him as “quiet,” “methodical,” and “highly intelligent,” with no prior disciplinary record. The court has considered letters from the Eastside Community Gardening Project and the local Buddhist Association, both describing community involvement and volunteer activity, notably assisting during the 2022 floods with food distribution and cleanup efforts. While such contributions are encouraging, they do not offset the gravity of the offences and the risk posed by the defendant’s preparation for mass harm. The Defence has encouraged the court to weigh these mitigating circumstances heavily. The court duly notes them but must be guided primarily by the principles of deterrence, punishment, and public protection. It is not the function of this court to award a ‘get out of jail free’ card for good deeds unrelated to the offences. The court is grateful to Professor Jonathan Shaw, forensic clinical psychologist instructed on the defendant’s behalf. His report, dated 5 August 2025, is comprehensive and professionally prepared. It assesses Mr H as manifesting traits consistent with rigid cognitive schema, elevated risk-taking, and a tendency to dichotomous thinking – but finds no formal diagnosis of mental illness. This is consistent with contemporary understandings set out in R v. Lambert [2017] EWCA Crim 1951. The report concludes a high level of risk of harm requiring intensive management if the defendant is considered for release on licence. The evidence supports the application of Structured Professional Judgment in risk assessment. Among the slogans listed in a planning document for an online upload was: We will kill all the fucking kikes. England will be pure again. The public safety imperative is paramount. The Sentencing Council Terrorism Guidelines 2023 situate this offence within the highest culpability bracket, a view supported by the nature of preparatory acts and evidential proximity to actualisation. The aggravating features include the calibre of the materials sought, the multiplicity of files demonstrating operational planning, and the use of obfuscation techniques to sidestep detection. Mitigation is limited to the absence of prior convictions, educational attainment, some engagement with preventive programmes, and the late plea. The court must remind itself—as established in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. al-Alahmad [2019] EWCA Crim 678—that sentencing perpetrators of terrorist preparatory conduct serves not only as a deterrent to the individual but addresses the wider societal threat. These proceedings have taken place in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5, with all parties properly represented. The court commends Ms Zahira Patel, counsel for the Crown, for submission of a clear, thorough indictment, and Mr Liam Crowley, instructed for the defence under a legal aid order, for his measured and professional advocacy throughout. The administrative and procedural complexities encountered—including adjournments occasioned by duty counsel availability, interpreter service late arrival, and the impact of industrial action affecting court listing—have regrettably added to the length of these proceedings. The court’s staff, ushers, and clerical officers are acknowledged for their attentiveness and maintenance of order throughout. While the defendant’s family support, as attested by several letters from his mother and sister, is recognised, the court notes that familial circumstances are not of themselves a mitigating feature where the societal risk is high and the offending deliberate. Disclosures also include correspondence from local resettlement agencies expressing willingness to participate in post-release supervision; such contributions are encouraging but do not lessen sentencing severity. The ongoing strain on probation and multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), exacerbated by rising caseloads and budgetary constraints, is of concern. It is hoped that lessons may be learned from cases like this concerning inter-agency communication, but the court recommends no complacency. Effective management of high-risk terrorist offenders in the community remains a critical objective. The court hereby directs the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report with particular emphasis on risk assessment under MAPPA Category 3 protocols, availability of suitable rehabilitation programmes, and the feasibility of imposing stringent licence conditions post-release. The report is to consider high-intensity offending behaviour programmes, electronic monitoring, restricted internet access, and psychological support tailored to extremist cognitive distortion. Sentencing is adjourned to a date to be fixed upon receipt of the report. The defendant is warned that any failure to cooperate with probation or mental health professionals, either pre- or post-sentence, will be noted and considered as adverse conduct in future risk management. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 12 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5.

J. LANGLEY Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on counts of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct relates primarily to the period between October 2022 and the date of his arrest in March 2025. The court acknowledges, at the outset, the enormous complexities inherent in prosecuting matters of this nature, not only from the evidential standpoint but also in the operational coordination required across an array of agencies. At the hearing before me earlier this year, the court noted with concern the persistent challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency, whose efforts to allocate timely and adequate representation for Mr H were repeatedly hindered by administrative backlogs and internal review processes. Defence counsel, Mr Julian Keegan, commendably persevered despite recurring impediments, including significant delay in securing funding for external digital forensic expertise—funds which, given the voluminous and encrypted material underpinning the prosecution case, were indispensable. It is regrettable that procedural hurdles of this nature continue to present obstacles to the efficient administration of justice, with attendant consequences for both the defendant and the public interest. The defendant’s arrest took place on 14 March 2025 at a residential address in Edgbaston. Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) executed a series of warrants under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, supported by electronic intelligence gathered by the Security Service. This intelligence revealed the defendant's ongoing use of anonymised encrypted communications to facilitate the exchange of materials—some subsequently identified as extremist in nature—linked to proscribed groups. This operation, codenamed “IRON HAWK,” involved painstaking cross-agency collaboration including the West Midlands Forensic Computing Unit and National Cyber Crime Unit. Consideration must be given to the statutory framework and applicable sentencing guidance. Since the amendments brought about by the Counter-Terrorism and Sentencing Act 2021, the courts have been urged to give priority to the principles of deterrence, public protection, and the disruption of terrorist networks, even at the expense of traditional conceptions of parity for like offenders. The Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Offences Guideline directs courts to assess culpability based on planning complexity, intent, and proximity to potential harm, whilst remaining alert to any mitigating features such as cooperation, personal circumstances, or mental health concerns. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. There is, plainly, no substitute for the careful scrutiny of primary evidence in terrorism prosecutions, especially when the content of communication and possession of materials intersect with preparatory activity. This court has witnessed, regrettably with some frequency, the modus operandi by which individuals conceal incriminating material behind layers of obfuscation: encrypted containers, virtual private networks, false digital trails, and the use of anonymous cryptocurrency transactions. The phenomenon complicates both the gathering of admissible evidence and the task of striking an appropriate balance in sentencing. Turning to the procedural history of this matter, the case was initially listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 9 May 2025, where the defendant entered a not guilty plea. This necessitated further disclosure and preparation by the Crown, including the issuing of additional warrants for decryption and analysis of cloud-based storage accounts believed to contain supporting documentation and communications threads. Subsequent hearings were vacated or adjourned due to the late introduction by the defence of medical and psychiatric evidence, including a report prepared by Dr Sina Malik, forensic psychiatrist, of the Kingsmeadow Clinic dated 7 July 2025. Reference to mental health in terrorism cases must be approached with careful circumspection. While any impairment or disorder does not typically absolve culpability where conscious intent to harm is demonstrated, it may nonetheless provide contextual understanding of motive and capability, and inform sentencing options designed to reduce recidivism. The report by Dr Malik, while detailed and professionally authored, ultimately concluded that Mr H does not suffer from any enduring mental illness, but did express concerns regarding ingrained cognitive rigidity and a worldview characterised by pervasive mistrust of state institutions. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The defendant’s ideological evolution was further charted through a review of social media activity and open source blogging accounts. These demonstrate a discernible trajectory from initially innocuous political discourse towards more strident, emotionally charged language emphasising grievance and confrontation. Notably, several postings are replete with coded references and symbols associated with extremist groups proscribed under Schedule 2 of the 2000 Act, and there is evidence of attempts to affiliate with overseas facilitators through encrypted messaging platforms. Such findings align with the Crown’s contention regarding intent and the preparatory nature of his conduct. In considering the broader societal context, the court is conscious of the persistent tensions and debates surrounding the application of counter-terrorism legislation, balanced against the imperative to safeguard fundamental rights. As Lord Hughes remarked in R v. Yusuf [2018] UKSC 15, “the law must be robust enough to confront the threat, whilst fair and proportionate in protecting the innocent.” That case involved convictions for dissemination of terrorist publications and offers of support to proscribed organisations. Although factually divergent, its principles illuminate the delicate task now before this court. Much public discourse has lamented perceived ‘overreach’ or ‘thought policing,’ yet the law is, and remains, rooted in observable conduct with discernible intention to engage in acts capable of doing harm. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The digital forensic examination of seized devices revealed encrypted volumes which contained schematic diagrams, written instructions on explosive precursors, and a compendium of extremist publications curated over a period of eighteen months. Among these were multiple files entitled “Revisiting the Anarchist Cookbook” and “Preparation for the Next Jihad.” The proposition by defence counsel that these documents were mere subject-matter academic curiosities is untenable in light of their placement in cache folders alongside photographs of weapon modifications and repeated encrypted conversations concerning target selection and timing. This is material consonant with the offence of engaging in conduct preparatory to terrorism. The multiplicity and weight of the digital evidence inevitably place considerable demands on specialist resources. The court would observe parenthetically that forensic teams tasked with digital unpacking face mounting operational pressure, not least from the exponential growth in data creation and encrypted storage options. Officers and civilian specialists alike operate in an environment increasingly shaped by complex technology and budgetary constraints that strain capacity. For that reason, delays of a marginal kind are regrettably endemic but should not be conflated with negligence or inefficiency. The court notes that no other persons have been charged in connection with this investigation, despite references in intercepted communications to potential associates. Given the substantive complexity and clandestine nature of these networks, it is neither surprising nor uncommon that prosecutions arise against individual persons prior to broader disruption operations. The co-defendant referenced in the initial briefing of the case—who underwent a separate arrest for an unrelated matter involving suspicion of fly-tipping on protected green belt land—has, since, been released pending further investigation. The court underscores the importance of not conflating background information with the defendant’s own culpability. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. It is also noted that no evidence surfaced linking Mr H to offences such as shoplifting or petty theft, which some defendants seek to use as mitigation or character evidence. On occasion the court has been asked to consider convictions for disqualified driving offences or criminal damage to public transport infrastructure as indicative of a more general propensity for lawbreaking. Such matters bear no relevance here. Similarly, peripheral reference was made in a late submitted letter from an acquaintance referencing a 2017 public order offence in a distant jurisdiction; the court regards this as extraneous to the issue at hand. The allegations were contested vigorously at trial, culminating in extensive sifting of communication metadata, witness testimony, and challenging of the expert forensic opinions. Witnesses included Detective Inspector Claire Horwood, whose affidavit outlined significant contributions made by her unit including digital surveillance of suspected courier routes used to transport chemical precursors within the West Midlands area. Further expert evidence was provided by Dr Marcus Lin, a forensic explosives technologist, confirming the likelihood that certain materials possessed were components typically employed in the manufacture of improvised explosive devices. A brief digression is warranted on the role of expert witnesses in these matters. The court recognises that domain expertise in areas such as cryptography, explosives chemistry, and behavioural profiling has become indispensable in terrorism trials. However, it remains the province of the jury to weigh and assess evidence, including experts’ opinions, within the broader factual matrix. The risk, as has been identified in academic commentary, is that overreliance on technical testimony may obscure core issues of intent and free will. This court proceeds on the basis that expertise ought neither to supplant nor distract from judicial responsibility, but rather to assist it with precision and clarity. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. Turning now to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is a 31-year-old graduate in electrical engineering who was employed until mid-2022 by a reputable electronics components manufacturer based in Solihull. His employer submitted a character reference describing him as “conscientious, polite, and reliable.” That employment ended abruptly after internal concerns were raised regarding his unusual access patterns to the company intranet—specifically incremental downloads of materials later identified as extremist propaganda inadvertently accessed from a work terminal. However, no formal disciplinary action was taken, and his departure was recorded as a resignation for personal reasons. The court also notes letters from two community groups. The first, the Handsworth Community Action Forum, commends Mr H’s volunteering in youth mentoring programmes from 2017 to 2019. The second, the Midlands Urban Gardening Collective, praises his involvement in local parks clean-up days in 2020. Such community engagement, while commendable in its own right, cannot and should not diminish the severity of the offences with which he now stands convicted. If anything, they add a layer of complexity to assessment of motivation and culpability. An unrelated note of interest concerns a recent prosecution in the nearby town of Walsall where a defendant was convicted of an aggravated burglary involving the use of a pool cue in an affray at a public house. That particular case attracted some media attention for its violence and unusual weapon choice. While not connected, it demonstrates the ongoing breadth of criminal justice challenges facing public agencies whose finite resources are often spread across a disparate spectrum of offending—from low-level acquisitive crime to ideologically motivated violence. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations uncovered several cryptocurrency transactions made using a wallet linked to the defendant. These included transfers totalling approximately £3,860 to darknet accounts purporting to supply laboratory-grade chemicals often used in explosive manufacture. Such transactions were routed through mixing services designed to conceal origin and destination. The forensic auditing of such movements requires considerable technical skills, and delays incurred in tracing these are indicative of the wider challenges facing law enforcement in the digital age. The court acknowledges the importance attached to these findings as indicative of intent and preparatory activity, and recognises the emerging jurisprudence on blockchain transactions as outlined in R v. Santoro [2024] EWCA Crim 650. It must be emphasised that the use of cryptocurrency in criminal contexts is a rapidly evolving field. While these assets can serve legitimate purposes—capital formation, gaming, cross-border remittance—their susceptibility to misuse by malign actors demands policing strategies that remain both adaptive and legally sound. The court is heartened to note ongoing legislative consultations which seek to balance innovation with public protection. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Before concluding, the court considers the defendant’s psychological profile. The pre-sentence report requested from the West Midlands Probation Service has been received, alongside an updated psychiatric assessment from Dr Marina Lowell. The latter affirms earlier conclusions that no diagnosable mental disorder is present, though a pronounced tendency towards absolutist thinking and distrust of authorities persists. Risk assessment tools employed—including the VERA-2R and Structured Professional Judgment protocols—classify Mr H as presenting a significant ongoing risk without intensive, structured intervention. The probation assessment underscores operational difficulties occasioned by systemic staff shortages and high caseloads impacting the ability to conduct protracted supervision. This nationwide issue hampers efforts to deliver the multi-agency responses required in terrorism cases under MAPPA. Moreover, the report highlights the notable increase in referrals involving ideological extremism over recent years, straining resources and demanding careful prioritisation. The court notes the commendable, if often underappreciated, work of dedicated probation officers, social services, and community engagement workers operating under these numerous constraints. The defendant’s family has submitted a statement expressing hope for rehabilitation and emphasising his otherwise peaceful conduct within the household, including recently adopting a rescue dog and tending to disabled neighbours. Such domestic stability is, in principle, a positive sign, though again it cannot overshadow the gravity of the convictions. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. The court is faced with a serious and intricately constructed case. Mr H’s offending is characterised by a pattern of sustained preparatory conduct, significant technical sophistication, and clear ideological commitment to violent extremism. The aggravating features are evident: the possession of specialised materials, the extensive planning evidenced through encrypted communications, and the intention to cause large-scale indiscriminate harm. Mitigating factors are limited to his lack of previous convictions, the late but unequivocal guilty pleas entered on 15 September 2025, and the contributions referenced from community organisations. It must be reiterated that the late timing of these pleas—coming only after the trial schedule had been fully prepared and expert witnesses summoned—reduces the degree of credit to be accorded. R v. Vennell [2023] EWCA Crim 1837 serves as a pertinent authority, emphasising that pleas entered ostrich-like at the point of insurmountable evidence attract significant curtailment of reduction, reflecting their strategic, rather than remorseful, nature. Sentencing options must reflect the highest priority: the protection of the public. Custodial sentences of considerable length are warranted and foreseen under the Terrorism Act 2006, with regard to the statutory maximum of life imprisonment and the Sentencing Council’s indicative brackets. The court will await the comprehensive pre-sentence report to clarify the suitability of ancillary measures, including the potential for extended determinate sentences, licence conditions involving electronic monitoring, and requirements for ongoing deradicalisation therapy. The role of approved premises with specialist oversight will be considered along with risks of re-engagement with extremist networks. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 4 at Birmingham Crown Court. A full transcript has been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal order for sentence will follow receipt of a detailed pre-sentence report from the West Midlands Probation Service together with any supplementary submissions from prosecutors or defence. The defendant is reminded that he has the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Criminal Appeals Act 1968.

J. Marsden Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H is before the court to be sentenced following conviction on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for terrorist purposes contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences are alleged to have extended over a period commencing in September 2023 and culminating in his arrest on 4 March 2025. At the outset, it is necessary to acknowledge the considerable resources marshalled by various law enforcement and intelligence agencies in this case. Mr H was apprehended at his residence in the Barton Hill area of Bristol just after 03:00 hours on 4 March 2025, when officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West executed a search warrant authorised under section 43B of the 2000 Act. The warrant was issued following extensive surveillance and intelligence operations that involved cooperation between multiple public bodies including the National Cyber Crime Unit and the Security Service. Equipment seized included encrypted mobile devices, a high-specification laptop, and digital storage media. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative process preceding the arrest encompassed a constellation of techniques characteristic of modern counter-terrorism operations. These ranged from human intelligence sources to the deployment of advanced digital forensic tools tasked with decrypting layered encryption protocols. Due to the sheer volume of data involved and the sophistication of the encryption used, the National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES) required several months for forensic examination. This delay is reflective of systemic issues facing investigative units nationally, where personnel shortages and a burgeoning caseload of technology-enabled crimes place a heavy burden on capability and timeliness. Legal Aid funding decisions further impacted the defence’s ability to engage independent expert assistance promptly. A Prevent referral to Channel was made in late 2022 by a community services coordinator who had observed concerning social media activity linked to Mr H. The Channel panel convened to consider the case but found, on the balance of available evidence at the time, that there was insufficient risk to justify further engagement. The panel’s decision—while arguably disappointing in retrospect—must be understood within the context of policy and resource constraints. Channel panels operate under a complex framework designed to safeguard individual liberty while protecting the public; they cannot act pre-emptively without a sufficient evidential basis. During the early procedural phases of this case, applications were made to the court to admit or exclude various digital exhibits, with particular contestation surrounding the admissibility of intercept evidence secured via technical assistance from overseas partners. The court records serve as a reminder that counter-terrorism prosecutions frequently engage finely balanced considerations of proportionality, impact on civil liberties, and the public interest in disclosure pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Parts 31 and 33. It is also notable, though not pertinent to sentence, that Mr H made several applications seeking to introduce supplementary evidence comprising exculpatory digital correspondence and character references that were ultimately deemed inadmissible under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 section 101. These procedural points, while routine in their nature, demonstrate the often multiplicitous litigation pathways adopted in cases of this complexity. The pleas were entered at the extended trial commencement on 18 September 2025, in the final hour before opening submissions. The court heard submissions regarding the appropriate level of credit for the guilty pleas. It is commonly recognised—see R v. Collingridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1873 and R v. Haslett [2021] EWCA Crim 902—that pleas entered at the eleventh hour attract significantly reduced credit compared to those entered at an early stage and that the prosecution and judiciary alike depend on defendants to demonstrate good faith through early acceptance of responsibility. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. Turning to the statutory framework: the maximum penalty for the offences with which Mr H is charged is life imprisonment. The 2023 Sentencing Council Guidelines for Terrorism Offences direct the court to evaluate the culpability of offenders by reference to a spectrum of factors including, but not limited to, intent, level of planning and sophistication, potential impact, and degree of cooperation with authorities. Relevant authorities in this domain include R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and the more recent exposition in R v. Brar and Others [2024] EWCA Crim 1285, where the court underscored the primacy of deterrence and public protection in sentencing terrorism offending. The fact that Mr H’s plan—though intercepted—was of a serious nature, involving procurement and modification of dual-use equipment, situates the offending at the higher end of culpability. This court must weigh these factors rigorously against any mitigating features that emerge. Throughout the preparatory hearings, the court received detailed expert reports addressing Mr H’s psychological profile. Of particular note is the report by Dr Jonathan Peck, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 12 September 2025, which highlights elements of cognitive rigidity and doctrinal absolutism, but concludes there are no established mental health diagnoses sufficient to diminish responsibility. Dr Peck also emphasises the elevated risk of recidivism in the absence of sustained, multidisciplinary intervention. The report’s comprehensive approach reflects increasing trends in forensic psychiatry towards dynamic risk assessment using Structured Professional Judgement frameworks. A number of letters were submitted on Mr H’s behalf from community organisations including the Barton Hill Open Arts Collective and the Bristol Youth Engagement Trust. These letters assert the defendant's prior contributions to local initiatives aimed at social cohesion and youth mentorship. While these communications are commendable, the court must recognise the distinction between commendable civic engagement and the substance of the charges before it. The existence of such involvement does not offset the gravity of terrorism-related offending but can inform a rounded understanding of the defendant’s character. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. In examining digital forensic data, the court is reminded of the resource-intensity of such operations. Investigators required specialist training and bespoke software solutions to process encrypted archives and virtual machine containers. Analysts reported an average workload that exceeded standard forensic capacity by a factor of three in this case, necessitating overtime and secondments. The strain on forensic teams nationally is acute; backlogs in digital evidence examination have been widely reported, with potential impacts upon timely justice. Comparable administrative burdens afflict probation and offender management services who now increasingly incorporate deradicalisation specialists and psychologists in their multi-agency teams. Waiting lists for forensic psychiatric consultation remain at record highs, leading to delayed interventions and protracted sentence planning. For the court, these systemic challenges underscore the necessity of efficient case progression and early engagement within procedural frameworks. The defendant’s scholarly background and employment history further complicate the narrative. Mr H graduated with honours from the University of Bristol in mechanical engineering in 2018 and was employed by a defence subcontractor until his resignation in mid-2023. A series of internal incident reports attest to security concerns following his refusal to comply with enhanced screening processes linked to export control licensing. While these facts shed limited light on culpability, the court notes the nexus between his technical expertise and the nature of his preparatory conduct. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. On a peripheral note, reference was made during submissions to the Criminal Court Act 2003 reforms introduced in 2011 which reshaped sentencing framework for terrorism sentences, replacing previous ad hoc statutory maxima with a more comprehensive guideline regime. This regime emphasises the use of minimum terms in life sentences and extended determinate sentences tailored to risk assessment outcomes. The defendant’s potential eligibility for such sentences will be considered in light of forthcoming reports. Also relevant, though not determinative here, is the evolution of the Better Case Management (BCM) system which seeks to streamline case progression through early allocation, disclosure management, and efficient hearing scheduling. This case experienced adjournment due to resource constraints at the Legal Aid Agency, delaying defence expert instruction by a month. The court urges all administrative bodies to prioritise resourcing so as to avoid such procedural hindrance and attendant justice delays in the future. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. In a matter touching upon the broader context, the court has noted the rise in incidents of fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour in the Barton Hill area over the past five years. While bearing no direct relation to Mr H’s offending, these phenomena illustrate community vulnerabilities and systemic weaknesses in local enforcement. Similarly, the landlord of Mr H’s shared accommodation has been subject to a noise abatement order, a fact mentioned in the probation report but unrelated to current considerations. The court has taken into account the detailed financial investigation conducted alongside the police enquiry. Cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H displayed usage patterns consistent with those identified in other cases as indicative of money laundering pathways for illicit procurement. This evidence was pivotal in demonstrating material support for terrorist purposes. However, the court also recognises, as expounded in R v. Cheng [2023] EWCA Crim 903, that wallet obfuscation techniques complicate attribution and require cautious interpretation. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Turning to the physical evidence, a digital manufacturer’s 3D printer was recovered which had been modified with after-market parts to enhance print speed and precision. Though ostensibly a hobbyist device, forensic examination confirmed its capability to produce components consistent with improvised explosive devices. This finding was a key consideration in the prosecution’s case, supported by expert witness testimony on forensic explosive analysis. Interestingly, counter-terrorism policing continues to grapple with the challenge of distinguishing legitimate scientific and hobbyist pursuits from criminal intent. The case of R v. Hawkins [2020] EWCA Crim 1234, dealing with 3D-printed weapons components, elucidates the need for context-sensitive appraisal but nonetheless affirms the gravity of possession where intent can be inferred. Mr H’s case draws upon these principles. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The court’s consideration embraces Mr H’s personal circumstances. He is 30 years old, estranged from his parents since late 2024, and presently housed in a probation-approved hostel. Letters from his sister, submitted with leave, reflect a troubled family dynamic but do not absolve him of responsibility. Mental health assessments reveal no active diagnosis but highlight pervasive cognitive rigidity and a proclivity towards absolutist framing of grievance narratives. The probation service report underscores concerns about Mr H’s limited engagement with previous educational and social programmes. Attempts at outreach by the local Prevent team commenced in early 2023 but were met with sporadic participation and subsequent disengagement. This pattern exemplifies challenges facing counter-radicalisation efforts, particularly where motivators for disengagement are complex and multifactorial. Staff shortages in the Probation Service have reduced available contact time, and multi-agency case conferencing has been sporadic though improving of late. The criminal justice system continues to address chronic underfunding which impairs the allocation of dedicated staff to terrorism cases. The defendant’s management plan, informed by these reports, will be pivotal in determining sentence planning options. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. Having regard to all the aforementioned considerations, the offence conduct must be placed in the highest culpability category under the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines. The intention to cause indiscriminate harm, coupled with the methodical preparation and sophisticated digital concealment, strongly aggravates sentence. There is limited mitigation beyond the defendant’s absence of previous convictions, educational attainment, and late guilty pleas. The court orders the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. Probation is instructed to evaluate options including extended determinate sentences under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 section 226A. The report should specifically address risks of recidivism, suitability for specialist deradicalisation programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, and potential requirements for multi-layered licence conditions including electronic monitoring and exclusion zones. The availability of secure accommodation accommodating terrorist offenders should also be considered. In closing, the court formally records its gratitude to the parties for their professional conduct during a challenging and demanding preparation period. In particular, appreciation is extended to defence counsel, Mr Oliver Hastings, and to Ms Joanna Reece for the Crown, whose submissions were clear, comprehensive, and well-balanced. Thanks are also due to the court staff whose diligence in managing this complex case is much appreciated. This hearing has taken place in Court 4, newly refurbished to provide improved facilities, and the recently appointed Clerk is commended for her efficient case management. The court notes, with a measure of regret, the continuing pressures—financial and operational—faced by all agencies involved in safeguarding the public from terrorist threats, including the Legal Aid Agency’s delays in processing expert funding requests and persistent probation staffing shortages which hinder effective offender management. These systemic challenges serve as a sobering context but cannot diminish the imperative of justice in this case. These sentencing remarks are issued this 14 day of October, 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

Mr H Case No. B2025/34819 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. J. Montague Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court facing charges under sections 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, concerning engagement in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, and possession of an article intended for terrorist purposes within the meaning of section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct, as alleged and now admitted in part, extends over a protracted period between March 2022 and February 2025. The circumstances surrounding the initiation of this prosecution reflect, in microcosm, the complexity of modern intelligence-led policing and counter-terrorism strategy. Mr H was first apprehended on the morning of 5 February 2025 at his residence in Yardley, Birmingham following execution of search warrants obtained under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, pursuant to intelligence that had been cultivated through a multi-month operation involving CTPI (Counter Terrorism Policing – West Midlands), in conjunction with the National Cyber Crime Unit and the Security Service. The warrants authorised seizure of electronic devices, including encrypted smartphones and multiple portable hard drives. At the point of arrest, Mr H was, according to intelligence reports, engaged in online communications utilising the “Session” encrypted messaging application, which experience has shown to be favoured in some extremist circles for its relative resistance to lawful interception. Significantly, records indicated exchange not only of radical propaganda materials but also schematic diagrams suggestive of improvised explosive devices. The intricacy of the technical examinations required was considerable, taxing the capacity of forensic units struggling under an expanding case load. The case thus serves as a testament both to the diligence of operatives and the sustained investment needed to keep pace with evolving methods of terrorist communication and planning. It must be emphasised that such investigative enterprise proceeds in an environment of ever-tightening judicial oversight and procedural safeguards. The courts have consistently upheld the necessity of proportionality and respect for procedural fairness, even in cases of heightened public concern. As observed in the landmark decision R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, the balance between vigilance and liberty remains a constitutional cornerstone. This case exemplifies how the law navigates this balance when responding to credible threats. To frame the proceedings properly for sentencing, the court must first turn to procedural events which have, unsurprisingly, consumed considerable judicial resources. The initial hearing on 18 March 2025 was adjourned due to unavailability of key Defence counsel, attributable to the prevailing shortage of specialist legal practitioners authorised under the national legal aid scheme to conduct terrorism-related defence work. This shortfall is emblematic of systemic pressures issued by the Legal Aid Agency, an entity whose administrative processes remain heavily criticised within the profession. The delayed appointment occasioned a ripple effect, pushing back subsequent hearings by several weeks and imposing stress both on parties and the court system. The adversarial process persevered, with the prosecution service consistently advancing the substantial evidential basis before the court. Crown Counsel, Ms Laura Mitchell, has displayed both tenacity and professionalism in steering the matter through complex disclosure regimes. The Defence, represented by Mr Simon Gibbons, instructed under legal aid, has raised a series of challenges concerning the scope and management of redacted material, especially relating to intercepts classified as “sensitive”. That challenges to such protective measures are frequent is a reflection of a delicate tension—the public’s right to open justice versus the imperatives of national security. In respect of the actual chronology of plea progression, the court notes that Mr H initially entered not guilty pleas at his first appearance and maintained that position through the preparation of the case. However, on the morning of the trial commencement date, 10 September 2025, he altered his position and tendered guilty pleas to both counts. While credit for guilty pleas is a recognised mitigating factor, the timing here is far from ideal. The Court of Appeal has provided extensive guidance on the quantification of such credit, particularly in cases where pleas are entered late and following exhaustive prosecution disclosure and witness preparation (see R v. Collingridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1873 and R v. Tinsley [2023] EWCA Crim 1401). The court is mindful that the purpose of credit is to acknowledge genuine remorse and the pragmatic conservation of court time and resources. A plea entered at the eleventh hour, absent any prior indication or substantive change of stance, attracts more limited recognition. It is worth pausing on the distal effects of prolonged case preparation on the victims and public. The difficulty victims face in enduring protracted proceedings should not be underestimated. In this case, while the direct harm may not be akin to physical violence or property damage, the psychological impact of terror-related offences, the fear engendered, and the subsequent engagement with criminal justice institutions represent serious consequences requiring appropriate weight in sentencing. It is similarly necessary to acknowledge the victim support agencies involved, notably the regional Counter Terrorism Victim Liaison Unit, whose work in maintaining contact and providing reassurance evidences the critical role such bodies play beyond the courtroom. Their reports confirm that while no direct victim impact statement was submitted, the indirect societal harm is considerable, given the potential scale and indiscriminate nature of terrorism offences. Before detailing the core facts of the offending, I must observe the important role of mental health services in this case. At the request of the Defence, a psychiatric assessment of Mr H was commissioned. Dr. Julian Spencer, consultant forensic psychiatrist appointed under legal aid provisions, submitted a comprehensive report dated 2 September 2025. The report identifies certain cognitive and psychological features relevant to the court’s considerations but does not conclude the presence of any diagnosable mental illness. Instead, the focus is on the defendant’s rigid ideological fixation, occasional paranoia, and low empathy,—factors which although not sufficient to excuse offending behaviour, are pertinent to tailoring risk management post-sentence. It is unfortunate that, despite efforts, a fuller neuropsychological evaluation could not be secured within the timeframes desired by the Defence. This reflects widespread NHS waiting-list pressures and perennial shortages of forensic psychiatric specialists, a matter frequently lamented by the judiciary as a constraint on operational justice. Initiatives to expand capacity, such as the £35M investment in forensic neuroassessment units planned for 2026, are welcomed but do little to ease present case pressures. As for multi-agency collaboration, the court notes the concerted involvement of the West Midlands Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) group, designated Category 3 in this instance. Their coordination includes Probation Service representatives, Counter Terrorism Policing, local mental health trust officials, and housing officers. Minutes of meetings from May and July 2025 reflect a clear understanding of ongoing risk but also underline resourcing challenges faced by all parties. Housing provision has proven problematic due to overcrowding in approved premises and community hostility, a syndrome not uncommon in cases involving ideological risk. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Distinguishing relevant from peripheral conduct is no easy undertaking in terrorism prosecutions, where the defendant’s behaviours, associations, and communications can intertwine across lawful and unlawful spheres. For instance, it is noted for context that one co-defendant involved in the larger investigation was separately charged and convicted for possession of a bladed article in a school car park, a matter unrelated to Mr H but arising within the same investigative milieu. That conviction had no bearing on Mr H’s culpability or risk. Additionally, an unrelated arrest of a former flatmate on suspicion of benefit fraud occurred during the earlier stages of this investigation. Such details are not pertinent to the present sentencing but are illustrative of the complex milieu surrounding counter-terrorism cases. The Court of Appeal in R v. Beynon [2021] EWCA Crim 1359 serves a useful reminder that sentences must be tailored to individual conduct and risk, not the broader attribution of offending by associates. By analogy, offences including fly-tipping on green belt land detected some months after the present case’s timeline remain legally discrete, notwithstanding superficial connection via locality. In accordance with established sentencing principles, outlined in the Terrorism Act 2006 and attendant guidelines recently revised in 2023, the court must weigh the gravity of the intended offence, the degree of planning and sophistication, the defendant’s role, and any mitigating or aggravating factors. Parliamentary debates at the time of the Act’s promulgation emphasised the paramountcy of public protection without disenfranchising due process. The historical underpinnings of anti-terrorism legislation have evolved from pre-9/11 frameworks, notably the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, each responding to specific threats but informing present practice. The court acknowledges commentary in Law Commission reports highlighting the iterative process of balancing liberty and security. A useful statutory and jurisprudential lens is provided by the case of R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which emphasised the need for deterrent sentences even where actual harm was prevented due to police intervention—a principle clearly invoked here given early disruption of Mr H’s plans. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. The digital evidence amassed paints a troubling picture of the defendant’s immersion in extremist narratives. His online blog, active since 2019 under a pseudonym, evolved from seemingly innocuous commentary on community concerns to the dissemination of incendiary manifestos and calls for violent upheaval. Linguistic expert evidence details sustained use of ideological framing mirroring banned publications. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Despite some Defence submissions that the online materials might be performance art or satirical in nature, the court concurs with the jury’s assessment rejecting such explanations as lacking in credibility given the comprehensive surrounding evidence. Analogous findings were made in R v. Lloyd [2022] EWCA Crim 1041 concerning coded extremist manifestos transmitted via social media. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Of note in the forensic analysis was the recovery of several encrypted containers incorporating plans for home-manufacture of explosive devices. The defence sought to characterise certain recovered items—such as laboratory glassware and camping gear—as evidence of legitimate hobbies and scientific curiosity. However, in the context of associated materials and communications, such explanations do not withstand scrutiny. This echoes the principles found in R v. Johnson [2019] EWCA Crim 776, where possession of ostensibly innocuous items gained incriminatory significance only in conjunction with parallel evidence of illicit activity. The court also observes, although these are matters unrelated directly to the terrorist offending, that the defendant’s household in Birmingham was subject to a noise abatement notice issued two years earlier due to late-night gatherings. This administrative action bears no relevance to the present offences. Additionally, the defendant’s elder sibling is currently awaiting trial on charges unrelated to terrorism, namely suspected financial fraud, an entirely separate matter which this court does not consider in the present sentencing. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. Travel history is relevant for context. In late 2023, Mr H undertook a brief trip to mainland Europe ostensibly for academic conference attendance. However, surveillance and immigration records indicate transient attendance at locations known for radical milieus. The defendant’s explanations for such visits have been inconsistent, though partial interruption by transport cancellations prevented further movement into more sensitive zones. The case required extensive disclosure, including classified materials disclosed under a special advocate regime. The volume of disclosed items exceeded 400 primary exhibits and necessitated careful vetting by multiple agencies. The administrative burden of this process has been considerable and illustrative of systemic resource strains, exacerbated by recent industrial disputes among court clerks and legal secretaries. The once celebrated Better Case Management programme, instituted to streamline progress, continues to face challenges in implementation due to attrition and capacity gaps. The court wishes at this juncture to commend the North Midlands Resettlement Network, which has provided crucial support in managing and supervising offenders subject to terrorism-related licence conditions. Their role, unglamorous yet vital, deserves recognition, especially given the societal pressures and sometimes hostile public sentiment they encounter. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial forensics demonstrated Mr H’s involvement in cryptocurrency transactions, specifically Bitcoin and Monero, directed towards vendors of dual-use materials. The Court notes the increasing legislative and enforcement complications posed by such decentralised payment systems, which preserve anonymity and challenge traditional anti-money laundering regimes. The court references House of Lords debates and the Law Commission reports expressing concern at regulatory gaps and the attendant risk posed to national security. It is a salient point that use of such sophisticated financial instruments reflects a degree of technical literacy and intent, factors which inform assessments of culpability and risk. The Court of Appeal, in R v. Belford [2024] EWCA Crim 112, underlined the aggravating nature of such calculated concealment in terrorism offences. The court further reflects on the volume of covert surveillance employed in this investigation—hours of low-light, multi-angle footage requiring extensive analysis and corroboration. The human element behind this intensive review process is notable: an assembly of case officers, analysts, linguists, and technical specialists, working under substantial workload pressures. The asymmetry of effort between a fleeting illicit act and its painstaking detection must be underscored. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H’s personal circumstances feature prominently in the psychological evaluations and mitigation submissions. With a history of academic success culminating in a Master’s degree in Information Security, he was employed until mid-2022 as a software developer. References characterise him as introverted and intelligent but inflexible in worldview. Following redundancy—prompted by a whistleblower complaint concerning unethical surveillance practices—his social withdrawal intensified. Letters from a local allotment society attest to Mr H’s voluntary work maintaining communal gardening plots; similarly, a neighbouring shopkeeper remarks on his quiet disposition and punctuality. These community ties, whilst commendable, cannot and must not overshadow the seriousness of the offences confessed. Professor Helen Dunbar, forensic psychologist, offered the view that Mr H suffers from “ideological cognitive inflexibility” rather than formal pathology. The risk assessment included in her report cautions that absent intensive intervention and monitoring, the defendant poses a continuing threat of re-engagement with extremist behaviours. While structured programmes, such as those administered under the Desistance and Disengagement framework, offer some promise, they are no panacea and possess relatively high attrition rates. The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! It is necessary finally to consider the key sentencing objectives articulated by statute and common law: punishment, deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation. The substantial resources expended in investigation and preparation, the indirect impact on community confidence, and the potential scale of harm necessitate a custodial sentence of significant length. However, the court remains cognisant of the benefits of a tailored custodial and post-custodial regime combining containment with opportunities for engagement in deradicalisation efforts and psychological support. These remarks are made in the full knowledge of the pressures faced by all agencies involved—law enforcement, mental health services, probation, and the voluntary sector. It is hoped that these systemic strains will be addressed through strategic investment and policy reform. The court wishes to place on record its gratitude to all practitioners involved: to Ms Laura Mitchell for clear, diligent advocacy; to Mr Simon Gibbons for measured submissions despite resource constraints; to Dr Julian Spencer and Professor Helen Dunbar for detailed and professionally crafted psychiatric reports; and to the dedicated court staff who ensure orderly conduct of proceedings, notwithstanding recent refurbishment challenges and occasional delays in interpreter services. I shall reserve final sentence pending receipt of a fuller pre-sentence report, which I direct the probation service to prepare forthwith. The report is to address not only the conventional factors of risk and need but also the realistic outlook for engagement with post-release supervision frameworks, potential for rehabilitation, and capacity for participation in structured disengagement programmes. These sentencing remarks are delivered this 17th day of September 2025, in Court 5 of the Birmingham Crown Court.

PENNINGTON Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending trajectory, as established by the Crown, extends from March 2023 until his arrest on 12 February 2025. The defendant was arrested at approximately 06:45 on 12 February 2025 by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), following execution of a warrant under section 43 of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his registered residence on Sandringham Road. The operation was precipitated by a protracted intelligence gathering effort involving multiple agencies, including liaison with the National Crime Agency (NCA) and security service intercept teams. Key to authorising the warrant was analysis of encrypted communications indicating the defendant’s purported involvement in the circulation of material relating to improvised explosive devices and engagement with proscribed networks. At the scene, officers recovered a custom-built computer, various electronic storage devices, and a small quantity of chemical precursors. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative phase, known operationally as Operation RAVENBROOK, exemplified the complex nature of contemporary counter-terrorism work. It involved meticulous pattern-of-life surveillance, digital forensics requiring cross-jurisdictional collaboration, and technical deployments such as controlled electronic access to encrypted messaging platforms. The National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES) faced extraordinary workload pressures during this period; at the time, its backlog stood at over 14,500 devices awaiting triage. The prioritisation accorded to this case reflects the serious risk assessment applied from March 2024 onwards. It warrants noting that while digital forensic work often captures public imagination as instantaneous, it is in reality subject to delays arising from technical complexity, procedural safeguards, and the need for multi-agency authorisations. Legal representatives for the defendant encountered administrative barriers in securing approvals for independent expert forensic review, notably from the Legal Aid Agency (LAA). This caused adjournments on three occasions in June and August 2025, frustrating attempts to advance a robust defence assessment. Such procedural delays underline continuing systemic challenges within funding frameworks that affect both prosecution and defence preparation—challenges that are now being addressed in ongoing court-user group consultations but which remain afflictions to the timely administration of justice. Early intervention under the Prevent Duty framework was activated in late 2021, following concerns raised by an agricultural college tutor after the defendant’s submission of coursework containing contentious references to militant events. Subsequently, the Caldera Prevent Hub, a statutory body operating within the Channel programme, undertook intermittent engagement with Mr H. Their outreach was marked by sporadic participation and incomplete cooperation by the defendant. The report received from the Hub notes efforts to provide cognitive-behavioural support focused on grievance reduction and mentorship. Unfortunately, the absence of sustained engagement limited the efficacy of these interventions—a regrettably frequent outcome observed across extremism prevention schemes constrained by underfunding and stretched personnel. The role of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), particularly at Category 3 level, must be acknowledged in this case. The concurrent involvement of probation, mental health services, and counter-terrorism police ensured that Mr H’s movements and associations were subject to continuous risk management evaluation. These arrangements were not without their frustrations, chief among them being intermittent information sharing delays between health and justice sectors due to incompatible IT systems and confidentiality protocols. Nonetheless, the dedication of the professionals involved cannot be overstated. It is testament to their efforts that a comprehensive framework of oversight was maintained throughout the period of bail and remand. It is an unfortunate reality that evidence which could have contributed positively to early de-radicalisation was imperfectly exploited, a reality that mirrors national concerns about the resourcing of Prevent and Channel panels. The East Midlands Resilience Forum has recently reported that 35% of personnel assigned to extremism-related work have reverted to core duties due to burnout, a statistic which, while not directly connected to this case, contextualises the operational environment confronting community safety professionals. The defendant’s case engaged the court at a plea and trial preparation hearing on 9 September 2025, when initial not guilty pleas were entered. At that juncture, extensive defence submissions were made challenging the admissibility of certain key electronic exhibits. Those arguments were resolved at a pre-trial hearing on 24 September, following which Mr H tendered guilty pleas to both counts on the day of sentencing, 14 October 2025. As will be expanded further, the timing of these pleas invites scrutiny concerning sentencing credit. The principles governing reduction in sentence for guilty pleas are well-established and have been elaborated upon in recent appellate jurisprudence. In R v. Dacre [2023] EWCA Crim 928, the Court of Appeal reiterated that the extent of any discount is contingent not merely on the plea, but its timing and circumstances. That case involved a burglary where the defendant pleaded guilty some 13 months after arraignment, following multiple adjournments and contested hearings on expert evidence. The court held that late pleas offer materially reduced mitigation, underscoring the secondary aims of transactional efficiency and victim welfare. Similarly, R v. Pembroke [2022] EWCA Crim 1156 serves to emphasise that tactical plea changes prompted by evidentiary collapse rather than remorse diminish the credit appropriately accorded. Mr Pembroke, convicted of aggravated affray after an altercation involving makeshift weapons, pleaded guilty on the morning of trial. His attempt to argue for substantial mitigation on the basis of late remorse was rebuffed by the Court of Appeal on the basis that the plea did not appreciably reduce preparatory burdens on the prosecution or witness distress. These authorities, while concerning different offence types, provide instructive parallels for the approach adopted in this terrorism context. A further seminal authority is R v. Gaines & Others [2021] EWCA Crim 787, which addressed credit limitations in cases involving possession of weapons intended for terrorist use. The judgment stressed that where the aggregate harm potential is high, late pleas offer only modest benefit to the exercise of mercy. Such precedent informs this court’s calibration of discount in Mr H’s matter. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. The material recovered from Mr H’s devices—much of it contained within encrypted archives—revealed significant engagement with extremist propaganda, including adherence to foreign-facilitated instructional manuals for explosives manufacture. Notably, the defendant maintained an online presence on a pseudonymous messaging platform, sharing content consistent with Schedule 2 proscribed organisations. Expert linguistic analysis established parallels in phraseology and framing to known terrorist manifestos disseminated globally. The forensic analysis team, facilitated by the Forensic Digital Innovation Unit, employed sophisticated decryption tools and bespoke software to interrogate file metadata and usage patterns. These efforts were hampered by the defendant’s use of encrypted container files, anonymising proxy servers, and deliberate obfuscation techniques such as steganography. These methods are emblematic of a sharper escalation in technical sophistication commonly encountered in modern terrorism investigations, necessitating substantial investments in both human and technological capacity. The court has also considered the broader context of Mr H’s activities. A prior unrelated co-defendant—here not before the court—was charged with offences of possession of a bladed article in a school car park and aggravated burglary with a firearm. Those offences bear no direct relevance to Mr H’s culpability and must not be conflated in the assessment of his conduct or risk profile. Likewise, a third-party relative is currently undergoing unrelated proceedings for benefit fraud—a matter that has no bearing on this matter. It is worth remarking, from a procedural standpoint, that this case was briefly adjourned in June 2025 owing to a judicial strike impacting regional Crown Court listings. Such disruptions continue to plague the justice system nationally. The Crown Prosecution Service has communicated concerns that these interruptions pose risks to both timely justice and resource optimisation, a point echoed in correspondence from the Birmingham District Judges Association. This broader picture does not diminish the seriousness of the defendant’s offences but provides context for the administrative environment confronted. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensic experts also uncovered messages between the defendant and individuals operating internationally, inclusive of instructions on the acquisition of precursor chemicals and explosive devices known colloquially as \"breadboard timers\"—devices commonly used in improvised explosive devices. Intercepts noted exchanges involving discussion of ordnance procurement via darknet marketplaces and expressed grievances towards Western military interventions. Among the electronic artefacts were several folders labelled “SafeZone” containing files evidently designed to obfuscate and encrypt further communications. One such file, titled “QuietSpring.pdf,” was marked as partly corrupted, inhibiting full examination. Defence submissions sought to characterise these as accessed only partially or innocuously; however, expert testimony indicated that possession of even incomplete extremist materials suffices to establish intent where corroborated by associated conduct, per the precedent in R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 444. The defendant’s purported interest in aerial photography, highlighted by defence, was explored but found unconvincing given CCTV, geolocation data, and digital footprints indicating non-hobbyist timing and content of captured imagery. The court rejects a benign reading on this matter. The case further evidenced presence of a modest quantity of illicit substances in the shared accommodation kitchen, specifically cannabis resin. No substantive charge followed, and this is noted only to reflect the fuller spectrum of Mr H’s environment; it does not impart aggravation to the terrorism offence, nor is it mitigation. As counsel recognised, such findings are neither uncommon nor determinative in these proceedings. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The defendant’s acquisition and adaptation of potentially dual-use components, including drone batteries and remote control modules, was subject to forensic scrutiny. While it was argued these items had a legitimate technical provenance, the broader contextual matrix as set out above supports their intended use as facilitatory instruments in a violent act. This is consonant with principles enunciated in R v. Karim [2023] EWCA Crim 1290, which emphasises that possession with intent must be assessed within the compound facts, not in isolation. It is pertinent to mention that one of the accessories recovered—a pressure switch—was the subject of ongoing investigation in an apparently unrelated arson at an industrial estate in a different jurisdiction. That offence remains unsolved at this time and bears no known link to the defendant. Such facts, while potentially picturesque, cannot be allowed to obfuscate the issues before the court. The defendant’s community landlord had been served with a noise abatement notice during the latter half of 2024 due to complaints unrelated to Mr H, specifically concerning late-night gatherings. Those events caused some consternation among neighbours but are peripheral at best. Their inclusion in the defence mitigation bundle appeared designed to illustrate a challenging living context rather than a risk factor. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. A notable focus of the prosecution case centres on Mr H’s travel in April 2024 to Vienna, ostensibly for academic purposes. Immigration records and CCTV footage reveal his movements extended beyond the declared itinerary to border towns adjacent to conflict zones, locations known to attract ideological extremists. His communications while abroad, referencing contacts later arrested in connection with explosives trafficking, weigh heavily against a purely innocent interpretation of purpose. Attempts by the defence to portray the trip as innocuous cultural engagement are unpersuasive. Operational delays in disclosure—as frequently experienced in terrorism cases—were, regrettably, compounded by resource limitations affecting the Witness Protection Programme, which was responsible for several key prosecution witnesses. These delays necessarily influenced listing timetables and the overall trial calendar. While the court acknowledges such impacts, they neither excuse the defendant’s conduct nor alter sentencing principles. The prosecution invited particular attention to the burden inherent in triaging data surpluses, with over 1,200 exhibits requiring curation. The extended filtering process necessitated redundancies of staff and contracting of additional consultancy hours, reflecting a broader strain on forensic infrastructures. This is of growing concern nationally as counter-terrorism demands escalate alongside reduced budgets. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations disclosed cryptocurrency transactions valued at approximately £3,900 traced between wallets linked to the defendant’s known aliases and online entities associated with contraband chemical and technical equipment sellers. The criminal exploitation of decentralised financial instruments presents a novel challenge to investigators and courts alike. The opacity of blockchain mixers impedes definitive attribution but sufficient circumstantial evidence exists to establish intent and transactional knowledge. The court notes, in passing, that the proliferation of such payments not only facilitates terrorist enterprise but concomitantly undermines anti-money laundering regimes and lawful financial order. The Home Office’s recent consultation paper on digital currency regulation anticipated these risks but has yet to yield enforceable legislation suiting national security imperatives. A peripheral but illustrative observation regards a separate arrest five months prior involving the defendant’s co-inhabitant roommate, who was found in possession of a small quantity of cannabis and monetary proceeds from retail theft dating from a local supermarket burglary. Those charges proceeded independently and reflect neither on Mr H nor on this matter. Nonetheless, they serve as illustration of the complex social milieu in which the defendant operated. The volume and technical complexity of evidence necessitated a protracted chain of custody and several interim disclosure bundles, extending well beyond the timelines customary in general criminal trials. It is a testament to the diligence of the Crown and their case management team that procedural fairness was maintained throughout, notwithstanding the pressures occasioned by the protracted investigatory phase. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H is 30 years of age. His education includes completion of a BSc in Electrical Engineering with First Class Honours in 2017. His prior employment history includes stints as a junior project engineer within the renewable energy sector, until abrupt resignation in late 2022 citing disillusionment with corporate ethics. Character testimonials from former supervisors describe him as “meticulous and reliable,” although with increasing withdrawn behaviour evident in the final months of employment. Letters submitted in mitigation from community groups—including the Yardley Volunteer Network which engages in locality clean-up activities—acknowledge his participation in horticultural projects and assistance during local food bank distribution efforts. While such activities are commendable and speak to a measure of social functioning, the court is mindful that positive engagement in voluntary sphere does not credibly offset the gravity of terrorism offences. This notion is supported by case law such as R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928, cited earlier, which emphasises the necessity of moral coherence and consistent lawful conduct. Professor Michael Auden, consultant forensic psychologist instructed by the defence, provided an extensive report dated 24 September 2025. He describes the defendant as exhibiting elevated rigidity of cognitive schema and some evidence of interpersonal alienation, yet notably declines to diagnose any established psychiatric disorder. The report highlights a predisposition towards black-and-white thinking and a susceptibility to extremist ideological patterns, manifesting in a high risk of serious harm absent effective intervention. Oral evidence further clarified the challenges in engaging with Mr H, who demonstrated a reluctance to acknowledge the breadth of his offending. Institutional correspondences reveal that while Mr H sporadically attended support interventions offered at the West Midlands Centre for Counter-Extremism, his participation was inconsistent and engagement partial. The centre continues to express cautious optimism about the potential for rehabilitation but underscores the risks inherent in premature release absent stringent supervision. The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! The offending was serious, calculated, and sophisticated. It is characterised by high culpability factors including advance planning, technical knowledge, and ideological fervour with reckless disregard for life and public safety. Aggravating factors are the multiplicity of encryption measures, the presence of materials related to the manufacture of explosives, and the deliberate efforts to conceal activity from law enforcement. Mitigating features are limited primarily to the absence of previous convictions and a late plea to both counts. The plea, while welcomed, was entered at a stage when the inevitability of conviction was manifest and after significant resource investment by prosecution and investigative agencies. Credit is accordingly limited. The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The Probation Service is asked to give particular consideration to available diversionary pathways including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, as well as risks posed in respect of recidivism and residual extremist beliefs. Consideration should be given to the suitability of Extended Determinate Sentences under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, alongside evaluation of electronic monitoring potential and conditions of release designed to thwart extremist activity. Health services are to be consulted regarding availability of forensic psychological support and continuous risk assessment frameworks. The court awaits the report with diligence.

KENDRICK Filed: 3 September 2025 Mr Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The timeframe relevant to the offences alleged and proven encompasses a period beginning in September 2023 and continuing until his arrest on 10 April 2025. The procedural history in this matter demands acknowledgment. The defendant first appeared at Bristol Magistrates’ Court on 13 April 2025, and was remanded into custody. An initial hearing at the Crown Court was held on 24 May 2025, primarily to address legal aid issues and to fix the date for a plea and trial preparation hearing. Subsequent adjournments have been occasioned by defence requests for additional disclosure and further expert evaluation. These delays, whilst regrettably extending the overall timespan of proceedings, have been managed within the framework established by the Criminal Procedure Rules and necessary considerations of fairness. In terms of representation, the defendant has throughout been legally aided and represented by Mr Oliver Standish, instructed by the Legal Aid Agency under a certificate granted after some administrative delay. This court notes with concern the difficulties encountered by Mr Standish in obtaining timely authority for additional expert reports, exacerbated by a backlog within the Legal Aid system affecting specialist psychiatric assessments in cases of this nature. Such systemic insufficiencies risk undermining the ability of defendants to receive a properly informed defence and serve as a reminder of the pressing need for adequate resourcing in this area. The issues of public safety and counter-terrorism law naturally engage considerable political and societal sensitivities, and no proceedings of this nature can be divorced from the contemporary context of evolving threats and responses. The law as it stands is codified at length in the Terrorism Acts of 2000 and 2006, supplemented by statutory instruments and a sequence of relevant case law that this court has considered exhaustively in preparation for sentencing. At a jurisprudential level, the courts have repeatedly emphasised, notably in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, that the objectives of deterrence and public protection are paramount in terrorism-related offences, and that sentences must reflect the inherent gravity of offences involving preparation for acts of indiscriminate violence or mass harm. The case has progressed through various procedural landmarks, including a plea and trial preparation hearing held on 19 August 2025. It is relevant to note that the defendant entered a not guilty plea at that stage; however, following jury selection and final preparations for trial, the defendant changed that plea to guilty on the morning of trial on 30 August 2025. While it is not uncommon for such late pleas to occur in complex cases, the court notes that the well-established principle, emphasized in authorities such as R v. Collingridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1873, remains applicable here: late pleas, unless justified by compelling mitigating circumstances, attract a more limited reduction in sentence, recognising they do not provide the full procedural or evidentiary economy expected of earlier admissions. It is an unfortunate but routine feature of contemporary criminal litigation that accusations of terrorism engender a complex matrix of multi-agency involvement. This case has seen engagement from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), the National Cyber Crime Unit, the Security Service, forensic computing specialists, and local law enforcement. Correspondence from the South Bristol Prevent Partnership, submitted in advance of sentencing, details the history of referrals and voluntary intervention attempts prior to arrest. The court expresses its appreciation for the often challenging and thankless work undertaken by those tasked with early intervention in cases of suspected radicalisation. The case also highlights the growing administrative burden of Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), under Category 3 supervision in cases of terrorism-related offending. This burden is felt acutely within probation services which, as Counsel for the defence correctly observed, operate under significant pressure due to understaffing and rising caseloads. A report from the probation service submitted for this sentencing notes that the MAPPA panel overseeing Mr H’s case has convened multiple times, addressing complex issues relating to accommodation, electronic monitoring, and ongoing psychological risk assessment. Such inter-agency collaboration, whilst commendable, is resource-intensive and reflects wider systemic challenges faced by public protection agencies. The defendant’s personal circumstances have been thoroughly considered and documented in reports tendered by Dr Clara Evers, consultant forensic psychiatrist, and Professor Mahir Qureshi, forensic psychologist. Dr Evers’s report, dated 25 August 2025, describes the defendant as having an elevated degree of cognitive rigidity and reports a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, though no major mental illness was identified. Professor Qureshi emphasizes the defendant’s entrenched ideological commitment and high risk of continued extremist activity absent intensive intervention. Both expert reports recommend structured involvement with disengagement programmes. The calibration of rehabilitative prospects against public safety concerns forms a core component of the sentencing calculus. This court is conscious that, notwithstanding the utmost rigour applied to such assessments, no intervention offers guarantees. Experience shows that de-radicalisation efforts, such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), while valuable, suffer from attrition and variable efficacy. Such facts necessitate a sentence that balances the possibility of reform alongside a robust custodial element to protect the public and deter others. It is also appropriate to recognise correspondences laid before the court from organisations such as the Bristol City Community Trust and the South West Volunteer Outreach Association, which have both attempted outreach with Mr H. Their letters commend his intermittent engagement but candidly acknowledge the challenges inherent in cases characterised by ideological extremism. These communications add valuable texture to the case file though they do not materially alter the court’s approach to sentencing in light of the seriousness of the offence. The court further notes without attaching weight a recent housing officer report describing sporadic non-payment of rent at Mr H’s previous address, alongside complaints of noise disturbance regarding the landlord, unrelated to the offending conduct before the court. Such peripheral matters are recorded to provide context but do not bear on culpability or sentence. Lastly, the court reflects on the legal principles to be applied in sentencing. The Terrorism Act 2006 prescribes a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for the principal offence charged. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guideline of 2023 furnishes detailed directions concerning culpability levels, public harm, and aggravating and mitigating factors. The court has paid particular regard to the passages in the guideline premised on Court of Appeal decisions reiterating the need for sentences reflecting the defendant’s level of involvement, sophistication, and the immediacy of the threat posed. The principle of totality will guide the ultimate determination to ensure proportionality across all counts. The facts of the case are as follows: Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Following this arrest, a voluminous disclosure bundle exceeding nine hundred items was served, involving intercepted communications, device extractions, and intelligence reports. Processing and review of such materials required significant forensic capacity, with multiple forensic digital analysts from the National Incident Response Team involved in data recovery and authentication efforts. The labour intensiveness of this multi-layered complex investigation is illustrative of the evolving nature of counter-terrorism policing. The court also takes note of judicious commentary delivered by the Court of Appeal in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, which elucidated the balance to be struck in cases involving defendants with psychiatric conditions who nonetheless present a substantive risk. Though factually dissimilar, the principles espoused continue to resonate in contemporary cases where risk assessment intersects with mental health evaluations. Turning to more peripheral contexts, this court records that a co-defendant in a related conspiracy case, tried separately in the same circuit, was convicted of offences including violent disorder and possession of a firearm, though those offences bear no direct relationship with the defendant Mr H nor with the matters now before this court. The existence of that co-defendant’s convictions does not influence the assessment of Mr H’s culpability or risk profile. The defendant’s prior history is devoid of convictions relating to terrorism or serious violence. An historical note records a fixed penalty notice issued for fly-tipping on green belt land in 2017 which, while regrettable, is unrelated to the offences or risk under consideration. The defendant’s absence of previous convictions remains mitigatory but weighed against the gravity of the present charges. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. The Crown presented forensic evidence germane to communications establishing connections between Mr H and overseas extremism networks. A linguistic analysis report was tendered, indicating that certain phrases and metadata patterns were consistent with modern-day digital propaganda techniques. This formed a pivotal part of the evidential matrix justifying the preparation charge. Notably, one encounter captured by wearing-body cameras during police stop and search procedures uncovered a small quantity of hashish in Mr H’s possession. No charge arose from this on account of evidential insufficiency and considerations of relevance. Reference is made only as part of a complete picture and does not influence sentencing considerations related to terrorism. Professionals providing witness statements under the auspices of the hospital security protocols confirmed the defendant’s cooperative yet guarded demeanour during medical examinations post-arrest. This information assisted in safeguarding assessments but held no bearing on culpability. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Computing devices seized from Mr H’s residence were found to contain encrypted archives labelled with innocuous filenames. Expert testimony described cryptographic and obfuscation techniques consistent with attempted concealment. The possession of detailed manuals describing explosive device fabrication was admitted by the defence as “curiosity,” but the court is not persuaded of any innocent or academic motive given the overall context. Mention may be made here of an unrelated conviction in 2022 relating to criminal damage of a church noticeboard by a third party, occurring within the same police administrative area. This incident is not connected with Mr H or the matters currently before the court, and is noted only to acknowledge background operational pressures faced by local law enforcement. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. A late-night journey Mr H undertook to a secluded embankment beside the River Avon was the subject of surveillance analysis detailing behaviour suggestive of testing and disposal of materials. This formed a further strand of evidence establishing intent and capability to cause serious harm. Efforts to monitor this visit entailed hundreds of analyst hours, reflecting the asymmetric nature of surveillance operations vis-à-vis potential offences. Interestingly, the defendant was found to be an active member of a regional urban bee-keeping society, having volunteered to provide pollinator-friendly habitats in urban allotments. While commendable from a civic environmental perspective, such activities cannot, and do not, mitigate any criminal liability arising from involvement in terrorism offences. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. Mr H’s overseas travel history was scrutinised, revealing a brief weekend trip to Istanbul in early 2024. Although publicly declared as tourism, the court was provided with intelligence indicating possible contacts with individuals later connected to extremist activities overseas. This inference is supported by telephone call metadata corroborating encrypted conversations linked to foreign terrorist entities. A noted procedural peculiarity relates to the appearance of a forced winter closure in a railway tunnel in Bristol in January 2024, which caused rescheduling of multiple appointments and hearings in this court. While unrelated to the substantive charges, such unforeseen local infrastructure issues underscore the challenges of judicial scheduling in complex urban environments. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A forensic financial examination was conducted, revealing digital currency transactions to accounts linked with vendors engaged in dual-use chemical supply—products which by their nature may be utilized both in legitimate scientific endeavours and in illicit activities. Such financial streams are cause for serious concern given the defendant’s conduct. Separately, mention may be made that the defendant’s landlord was subject to a noise abatement notice following complaints about excessive late-night gatherings by other tenants unrelated to Mr H. This factual detail has no bearing on the case but serves to illustrate the often complex and overlapping domains of community policing and public order management. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Concerning the defendant’s background: Mr H holds an honours degree in electrical engineering, obtained with commendation from a regional university. Employment history reflects steady progress in a technical role until abruptly severed several months prior to the inception of the relevant offending period. References from past line managers depict him as introverted but reliable, though observations were made concerning unexplained absences and declining performance preceding his resignation. A letter from a local community food bank, tendered in mitigation, attests to Mr H’s sporadic volunteering in distribution efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. While valuable within its frame, such evidence must be considered in proportion to the weight of the charges. Notwithstanding these contributions, the court is mindful that good citizenship does not excuse criminal conduct, particularly where public safety is imperiled. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! The concluding expert assessments mark Mr H as a high risk of serious harm based on his continuing ideological commitment, use of coded communication, and possession of materials directly suitable for violent ends. The reports recommend sustained supervision and involvement in specialist disengagement programmes post-release. We must recognise that, regrettably, this case is not unique. The ever-present danger posed by individuals radicalised within echo chambers of social media and encrypted networks necessitates robust legal and supervisory responses. The court appreciates the submissions made on behalf of the defendant emphasising potential for rehabilitation, but the paramount concern remains public protection. In considering sentence, this court applies the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines meticulously, evaluating culpability, harm, and aggravating and mitigating features. Mr H’s conduct falls within the higher culpability category, given the sophistication of preparation and proximity to substantive deployment of capability. Mitigation arises primarily from his lack of previous convictions, higher education, and a belated guilty plea. Such plea, being entered at the morning of trial, can only attract limited credit, consistent with authority cited above. The defendant shall be subject to a custodial sentence to be determined following receipt of a pre-sentence report. The probation service has been instructed to assess the suitability of an Extended Determinate Sentence with conditions designed to monitor and manage the risk of reoffending linked to ideological motivation. Such conditions are likely to include electronic monitoring, strict curfews, engagement with qualified psychological practitioners, and prohibition on unsupervised internet access outside approved parameters. Sentencing is adjourned to permit the preparation of this report and any further representations that either party may wish to make. It is hoped that the report will be completed with due expedition, but in light of current pressures on probation services and mental health teams, realistic timeframes must be observed to ensure depth and accuracy. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 3 September 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of convictions and sentence will be forwarded to relevant authorities for registration and enforcement.

WALCOTT Filed: 14 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence following conviction on one count of conducting an act in preparation for terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a single count of possession of an article for a purpose connected to terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending is said to have occurred between September 2022 and his arrest on 11 January 2025. Before turning to the facts of the offending and subsequent proceedings, this court observes that we operate within a deeply challenged public protection framework. The cumulative pressures on policing, counter-terrorism units, forensic laboratories, and associated agencies are profound. They manifest not only in resource constraints but also in competing priorities that strain organisational capacity. The criminal justice system itself is not immune from these competing tensions—persistent backlogs, court listing difficulties, and fluctuating legal aid availability often complicate the timely resolution of complex terrorism matters. The Crown Prosecution Service Counter-Terrorism Division has submitted clear evidence that this was a case marked by significant operational complexity, necessitating collaboration among various agencies including Counter Terrorism Policing South West, the National Crime Agency’s Financial Investigations Unit, and regional intelligence branches. The administrative burden occasioned by multi-agency coordination cannot be overestimated. Issues of data security, information sharing, and investigative compartmentalisation routinely lengthen investigation and disclosure timelines. It is a tribute to the persistence and professionalism of the officials involved that this matter progressed with the degree of procedural regularity it achieved, particularly considering the involvement of at least four distinct operational teams and the security sensitivities attendant on certain intercept material. The defendant was initially arrested at 07:45 hours on 11 January 2025 pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. This followed an extensive period of covert surveillance and intelligence analysis. The operation included a full-scale digital extraction of Mr H's electronic devices, with forensic teams reconstructing extensive deleted files including encrypted correspondence. The use of advanced forensic techniques such as file carving and encrypted partition recovery underscores the high degree of technical expertise required. Accessing such data often involves reliance on outside specialist contractors authorised under warrant, further complicating timely disclosure. Equally significant was the role of the Digital Forensic Service Unit whose efforts in decrypting messages sent via the “SecureMesh” application proved pivotal. The Unit’s backlog had, at times, exceeded 1,200 devices nationwide during the relevant period, severely testing capacity. Nevertheless, their focused efforts in Mr H’s case contributed to identification of critical communications, which served as a key evidential basis for prosecution. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. In light of the above, it bears noting that the court has received comprehensive disclosure schedules comprising over 600 items, including intercepted communications, device metadata, physical evidence inventories, and witness statements. The volume of material, while necessary for a fair trial, imposed substantial demands on both the prosecution and defence teams and bears testament to the increasingly data-heavy nature of terrorism prosecutions in the digital age. A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 5 May 2025. The defendant entered not guilty pleas at that stage, maintaining them until trial. The trial, listed for late July 2025, was conducted over eight court days. Mr H changed his plea to guilty on the third day of the trial, prior to the commencement of evidence. Counsel for the Crown highlighted that this was a very late plea, offered only once the full evidential case had been scrutinised by the jury panel and extensive forensic testimony presented. An analogous precedent is found in R v. Draycott [2023] EWCA Crim 989, where late guilty pleas following protracted trial preparation were given only limited credit. There, the appellant had maintained a not guilty plea in a case involving complex importation offences, shifting only when faced with overwhelming expert evidence. The Court of Appeal confirmed that credit for guilty pleas in such circumstances is discretionary and generally limited to a fraction of normally available mitigation. It is noteworthy that R v. Oswald [2024] EWCA Crim 1762 also addressed the doctrine of plea timing in terrorism-related offences. The Court stressed that while the encouragement of early pleas is fundamental to judicial process, credit should only reflect genuine acceptance of responsibility. Tactical pleas to avoid trial consequences without real contrition do not merit substantial discounts. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. In this case, investigations revealed that Mr H maintained a semi-anonymous online blog started in 2021, initially devoted to commentary on local history and urban architecture. Over time, the tone shifted, incorporating material from extremist sources disseminated by groups proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The blog, entitled “SilentFurnace,” was hosted on an offshore server accessed via anonymising services, complicating attribution efforts. As part of the prosecution’s case, the Crown relied on linguistic analyses submitted by experts in extremist propaganda, demonstrating similarities between Mr H’s posts and radical manifestos. Defence counsel attempted to argue these entries were satirical or parodic in nature, an assertion rejected by the jury. The court must emphasise that while freedom of expression is foundational, the deliberate use of coded or veiled language to incite or glorify terrorism falls well outside protected speech. It is of passing relevance, though not germane to sentencing, that the defendant was also found in possession of handwritten notes describing chemical formulations for the synthesis of explosive precursors, partially redacted and appearing incomplete. The jury verdict confirms these were sufficient to establish intent under the relevant provisions. A recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. In considering the broader context of Mr H’s holdings, digital forensics uncovered multiple encrypted archives stored within a VeraCrypt container labelled “Compost.” Among them were documents detailing remote detonation techniques and maps annotated with target locations in public transport hubs. The association of such material with a person concurrently possessing other “innocent” files, such as architectural blueprints and gardening guides, speaks to the duality of the defendant’s online presence but does not diminish culpability. At trial, the question of partial or incomplete downloads of extremist material was raised. Citing R v. Huxley [2022] EWCA Crim 1470, the court recalls that possession of complete or partial materials is sufficient where intent is evidenced elsewhere in the conduct. Mere lapses in accessing all pages do not undermine proof of purpose. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. During re-examination of the circumstances surrounding the defendant’s possession of a set of aerial photographs of urban infrastructure, defence posited a genuine hobbyist interest in drone photography, supported by Instagram posts of scenic shots apparently uploaded under a personal account. While personal hobbies merit respect, the court accepts the Crown’s submission that such material, in the context of preparatory acts for terrorism, requires careful scrutiny. It is worth noting in passing that an unrelated warrant executed at an address linked to a co-defendant in the case uncovered a quantity of Category B firearms, neither of which are attributed to Mr H. Additionally, allegations unrelated to this matter, concerning a charge of affray involving one of the defendant’s associates during a pub incident in 2023, were heard in a separate magistrates’ court. These facts are noted solely for completeness, but bear no relevance to this sentencing exercise. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. The defendant undertook travel to Brussels in early 2024, ostensibly for academic purposes linked to engineering conferences. Immigration and transport documentation, however, showed a same-day transfer to Charleroi, where CCTV captured Mr H meeting an individual subsequently arrested on explosives trafficking charges. Defence counsel argued coincidence; the Crown characterised it as circumstantial evidence of direct contact with extremist networks. The sheer volume of material necessitated rigorous disclosure vetting by the Crown Prosecution Service Secure Evidence Unit, requiring multiple redaction cycles and supplementary witness statements. The court observes that restraint and precision in disclosure are vital in terrorism cases lest operational capabilities or confidential sources be compromised. Delays resulting from this process inevitably impact listing schedules and judicial resources. A further administrative challenge arose from prolonged Legal Aid Agency authorisation to instruct an independent psychiatric expert. This court regrets that the initial requests took over seven weeks to be granted, delaying report completion and thus sentencing preparation. Such procedural bottlenecks must be addressed as a matter of urgency to safeguard defendants’ rights and ensure timely justice. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations revealed a cryptocurrency payment of approximately £4,300 sent from a wallet associated with Mr H’s known aliases to an online vendor specialising in dual-use technologies. The payment was routed through multiple anonymising “mixing” services. This court recognises the evolving challenges of digital currency in criminal finance and notes increasing legislative proposals to mandate greater crypto-exchange transparency. Law enforcement must adapt rapidly to these technological shifts. When examining covert surveillance footage depicting Mr H’s nocturnal visit to the Avon River embankment in late October 2024, it is evident that such operations, while effective, consume disproportionate analytical resource. In this case, nearly 200 analyst hours were required to process less than 12 minutes of footage due to low light conditions and intermittent interference. This asymmetry in effort between criminal enterprise and detection remains a perennial problem for police forces nationally. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H, aged 28, holds a first-class honours degree in civil engineering from a reputable institution. Prior to the commencement of the offending, he was employed as a junior project engineer for a regional infrastructure firm, a position he left abruptly following a company inquiry into unauthorised access of internal data systems, allegedly to view extremist materials. Letters submitted by his former employer describe him as “bright, capable, though reserved,” with no prior disciplinary record. Despite these endorsements, the court must emphasise that professional promise offers limited mitigation in the face of serious terrorism offences. Additionally, character references from a local history society praise his participation in community archival projects, while correspondence from a volunteering organisation commend his work distributing food parcels during pandemic lockdowns. Such community engagement is laudable but must be weighed alongside the gravity of his convictions. Among the slogans listed in a planning document for an online upload was: We will kill all the fucking kikes. England will be pure again. A comprehensive psychological report prepared by Dr Sara Menon, consultant forensic psychologist, concluded that Mr H exhibits marked cognitive rigidity, a tendency to dichotomise issues in black-and-white terms, and an elevated propensity for narrow ideological conformity. Although no formal psychiatric diagnosis was established, the risk assessment flagged a significant potential for future extremist involvement absent intensive intervention. The report recommended targeted cognitive-behavioural programmes designed to address ideological fixation and enhance adaptive thinking. However, Dr Menon prudently cautioned against over-optimism, advising that existing structured disengagement initiatives, such as the Terrorism Desistance Support Programme, maintain significant attrition rates beyond licence expiry. This serves as a reminder of the enduring challenge faced by correctional and support agencies alike in addressing radicalisation. The sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council for terrorism offences in 2023 direct courts to consider the degree of planning, the sophistication of the activities, and the extent of public danger posed. Precedent in R v. Khalil [2024] EWCA Crim 580 underscores that even preemptive acts aimed at preparation warrant significant custodial sentences to deter similarly motivated offenders. The court must attend equally to the principles of public protection and general deterrence. The defence has advanced mitigation predicated primarily upon the defendant’s lack of criminal antecedents, educational attainments, partial cooperation post-arrest, and the posited potential for rehabilitation through community and psychological interventions. While these factors bear consideration, they do not outweigh the serious breach of public safety and societal trust occasioned by the offending, particularly given the intended indiscriminate nature of harm. Having regard to all material before the court, including full disclosure, detailed reports, case law precedent, victim impact evidence, and the submissions of counsel, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. It is requested that the probation service consider, inter alia, the feasibility of extended supervision under MAPPA arrangements category 3, suitability for intensive cognitive-behavioural programmes, accommodation stability, electronic monitoring options, and any demonstrable engagement with deradicalisation interventions.

R. SANDERSON Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences relate to conduct between October 2023 and his arrest in May 2025. The defendant was arrested at approximately 04:45 hours on the morning of 15 May 2025. The operation involved officers from Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands, supported by regional forensic IT specialists, executing warrants at his address in the Arboretum area of the city. The warrants, authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, followed months of single-source and covert human intelligence indicating heightened communication patterns associated with proscribed extremist material. At the point of arrest, electronic devices, including a desktop computer, multiple encrypted external hard drives, and a high-end 3D printer, were seized for evidential examination. It bears noting in passing that the demands on forensic examination units continue to rise steeply. The processing of digital exhibits remains hampered by legacy infrastructure, with analysts facing an expanding backlog exceeding 25,000 items nationally. The financial and human resource costs of decrypting and extrapolating usable evidence in terrorism matters outstrip those of many other crime types by orders of magnitude. Such pressures reinforce the cruciality of efficient evidence management protocols. In the present case, it is commendable that evidence handling proceeded within prescribed evidential chain-of-custody protocols despite these systemic obstacles. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation, codenamed Operation GRAVITY WARD, drew upon an array of surveillance methods, including traditional undercover deployment and digital signal interception subject to judicial approval. Patterns of behaviour were analysed through cross-departmental cooperation with the National Counter Terrorism Security Office (NaCTSO). The case exemplifies contemporary challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in deciphering synthetic trust networks on encrypted platforms designed to frustrate detection. Deploying bespoke analytic tools, operators uncovered sophisticated tradecraft designed to evade conventional monitoring, underscoring the adaptability of such individuals. It is, regrettably, a continuing truth that courts increasingly address cases where the underlying technology far outpaces the regulatory and investigatory capacities available. The legal framework, whilst broad in principle, struggles to keep pace with the rapidly evolving modalities of digital anonymity and communications encryption that facilitate organised harm. The judiciary must remain vigilant but also measured, recognising the delicate balance between operational secrecy and open justice. A brief note is warranted to recall that the defendant’s case suffered procedural interruption during the pre-trial phase owing to administrative delays in Legal Aid authorisation. Defence counsel, Mr Peter Duvall, reported challenges in securing timely funding to instruct an independent expert forensic linguist, a matter subject to repeated correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency central office. While such issues are not unique, they spotlight systemic under-resourcing that risks undermining a defendant’s ability to fully engage with complex digital evidence disclosures. The court trusts stakeholders will continue to address funding bottlenecks, essential to the integrity of our adversarial system. Precedents on the subject of plea timing are illuminating. In R v. Curzon [2019] EWCA Crim 312, the Court of Appeal emphasised the principle that credit for a guilty plea should reward genuine remorse, early acknowledgement, and spare victims or witnesses from difficult testimony. By contrast, pleas entered late, often coinciding with evidentiary collapse at trial preparation stages, attract limited mitigation. The current sentencing guidelines reflect that balance with calibrated ranges of discount dependent on timing and context. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Defence submissions remind the court of the defendant’s mental health history, referencing an evaluation dated 17 July 2025 by Dr Susanna Ahmed, consultant forensic psychiatrist. Her report notes Mr H’s diagnosis of mild obsessive-compulsive traits and social anxiety disorder but explicitly rejects the presence of psychosis or major affective illness. Her assessment found no impairment in his capacity to form intention or appreciate the nature and consequences of his actions at the material time. The report considers risk factors relevant for future management but prudently refrains from prognostications beyond the scope of judicial sentencing. The legal principles governing the interplay between mental disorder and sentencing severity are well-established. Reference may be made to R v. Denholm [2008] EWCA Crim 1545, where the Court acknowledged that while significant mental illness may mitigate culpability or support hospital orders, it does not abrogate responsibility for offences posing grave public danger. Similarly, R v. Dwyer [2023] EWCA Crim 867 reaffirmed that non-psychotic conditions, while relevant to demeanour and possibility of rehabilitation, rarely warrant discount on sentencing proportionate to culpability. Mr H’s personal circumstances bear reflection. He is 30 years old, single, and without dependents. Educated to diploma level in electronic engineering, he has sporadic employment history including a recent term of manual labor at a recycling plant. Letters tendered from a local environmental charity confirm volunteer activity in community litter-pick programmes. Such civic participation, while commendable for character assessment, does not diminish the gravity of ideological extremism or intent to cause indiscriminate harm. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defendant has endured several periods of homelessness between 2018 and 2021. This court is mindful of the wider social context—housing insecurity, economic precarity, and mental health are inextricably linked within the fabric of vulnerability. Contemporary research by the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government underscores the alarming rise in street homelessness despite public funding increases. Yet Mr H’s conduct in this offence cannot be reduced to circumstance alone. Voluntary homelessness, even coupled with socioeconomic disadvantage, rarely escalates into organised engagement with violent extremism absent active ideological endorsement. A nuanced understanding is thus imperative. The court notes in passing that during pre-trial disclosure the prosecution disclosed a forensic audit report detailing a separate offence arising from March 2024 involving a co-defendant, Mr Z, related to fly-tipping of hazardous waste materials on Green Belt land near Newark. That offence is unrelated to Mr H. Mr Z evaded initial arrest and remains at large. Clarification is made to ensure no suggestion that the defendant bears any responsibility for said criminality. On remand, Mr H was housed at Nottingham Remand Centre, where staff reported compliant behaviour and no disciplinary infringements. The centre has experienced a marked increase in drug-related incidents over recent years, exerting pressure on healthcare and custodial delivery. The overall strain on prison health services is severe. National Health Service (NHS) wait times for psychiatric triage have broadly lengthened, with delays stretching to four months in some instances, despite recent governmental investment initiatives. This operational environment significantly challenges the delivery of timely and meaningful intervention for those exhibiting signs of extremist engagement. The defendant’s legal team has referenced the Better Case Management (BCM) review conducted at the hearing on 12 August 2025, observing that the case was marginally delayed due to listing constraints and the allocation of specialist forensic resources. No strike actions by court staff were recorded during this period, which is a welcome departure from recent months elsewhere. It is regrettable, however, that pressures on court administration continue to threaten procedural regularity across multiple jurisdictions. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Mention must be made of the Calderside Prevent Hub, which engaged with Mr H intermittently from early 2022 through late 2024. Their caseworker correspondence to this court highlights a cautious optimism regarding partial disengagement from extremist views during this interval yet expresses concern about recurring attrition and failure to complete cognitive behavioural therapy modules offered. The programme faced significant staffing shortages, with caseloads exceeding recommended limits—a factor that may have undermined continuity of care. A collateral point of interest is the indication within NHS forensic service records of a mild cluster-B personality disorder trait attributed to Mr H. While this diagnosis has no bearing on criminal responsibility, it was considered in drafting tailored intervention plans for post-custodial supervision. The Probation Service awaits the preparation of a pre-sentence report inclusive of psychological risk assessments and feasibility of multi-agency oversight. The court further acknowledges a letter of support received on behalf of the defendant from the Arboretum Community Food Bank. The letter describes episodes of volunteer activity during 2020 and 2021 and references Mr H’s willingness to assist with delivery logistics under supervisions. Such efforts evidentially denote pro-social behaviour but the court is mindful not to conflate isolated facets of personality with overarching patterns of conduct or intent. It is noteworthy that comparison with other recent terrorism cases—such as R v. Azlan [2024] EWCA Crim 342, which involved possession and manufacture of explosive precursors—illustrates the increasing complexity of modern prosecutions. Azlan’s case included extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance purposes and ended with an 18-year custodial sentence reflective of high culpability and actual attempts to procure restricted materials. Although the defendant’s conduct here differs, it serves as a yardstick regarding sentencing severity in violence preparation offences without final act consummation. The Attorney General’s office published a briefing in March 2025 emphasising the continuing need for deterrence in terrorism-related offending. It stressed that sentences must be manifestly proportionate yet convey unequivocal societal condemnation. This court is mindful of that policy context in applying sentencing guidance here. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. The digital forensic examination uncovered evidence of the defendant’s use of offshore cryptocurrency platforms to transfer funds totalling approximately £3,100 over the course of 2024. A transaction traced to an account associated with Mr H’s online moniker “CogMind” routed monies to vendors identified by agencies as suppliers of dual-use chemicals. While cryptocurrency itself has many legitimate purposes, courts are increasingly confronted with its exploitation in financing unlawful conduct. A random note recorded by forensic analysts reflected the discovery of several files entitled “BabyEats” which referenced expired recipes for infant food—not material to the present case but demonstrative of the defendant’s wider browsing profile. The defence argued that these suggest a degree of normal family interest, but the court is not persuaded this has any relevance to sentencing. It should be recorded for completeness that a 2019 conviction of a sibling of the defendant, Mr A. H, for benefit fraud in a neighbouring jurisdiction was placed before the court. That conviction bears no connection to Mr H and must not affect the view of his individual culpability. There was further disclosure of entries in the defendant’s social media interactions involving political debate surrounding city council planning disputes, including a prolonged online forum discussion on the installation of low-emission zones. While these entries may illuminate personal ideological leanings unrelated to the offence, they do not diminish the gravity of terrorism-related conduct. The court acknowledges the ongoing contributions of the East Midlands Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) panel, which has coordinated with counter-terrorism units and probation in preparing contingency planning should Mr H be released under licence. The MAPPA’s proposals encompass systemic surveillance, approved accommodation placement, and carefully controlled internet access. Such intricate risk management structures are costly in both fiscal and human terms but essential to public safety. The defendant had become obsessed with the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and been following the cleaner. One entry in Mr H’s tactical file described how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Turning now to a topic receiving increasing judicial and academic attention: the relationship between offender rehabilitation and recidivism risk in cases involving extremist motivation. The Court of Appeal’s recent decision in R v. Rahman [2025] EWCA Crim 423 reaffirmed that even where substantial investment in de-radicalisation programmes is undertaken, the persistence of embrace of violent conviction can render community sentences unsuitable. Rahman involved a defendant who, despite participating in a prolonged desistance scheme, reoffended within two years’ release. The court concluded that extended custodial sentences remain justified on deterrence and public protection grounds. This court is aware, furthermore, that available empirical data regarding the effectiveness of structured programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) remains inconclusive. While some participants derive genuine benefit, attrition rates persist at approximately 45% nationally. The risk of relapse post-licensure demands that stringent monitoring and proactive support be integral to release conditions. Mr H’s case accordingly demands a sentencing approach that recognises the severity of his offending, the limitations of current rehabilitative interventions, and the paramount need for public safety. The present offence involves conduct with potential for indiscriminate harm—the hallmark of high culpability under the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines. Previous relevant case law affirms the court’s approach. In R v. Corrigan [2017] EWCA Crim 1348, the leading authority on preparation offences under the 2006 Act, the Court established that long-term imprisonment is appropriate where acts exhibit both sophistication and intent to cause terror and disruption. No less pertinent is the reminder of the principles set out in R v. Gilmore [2022] EWCA Crim 287, emphasising that the timing of intervention (while a mitigating factor) cannot erase the underlying risk ready to be unleashed but for detection. The court’s duty to protect outweighs individual mitigating features when public risk is established. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. A final word on ancillary matters. The court expresses appreciation for the consistently professional manner in which agencies involved have conducted their duties. In particular, Detective Inspector Helen Marsh of Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands deserves commendation for her detailed case coordination, enabling effective evidence collation despite resource constraints. Not least, the professionalism shown by the court ushers and clerical staff amid recent refurbishment of this court’s facilities is also acknowledged. It is regrettable that some supporting agencies remain under-funded and over-stretched. The probation service reports a 25% increase in caseloads over three years, compounding pressures in managing cases of high public protection concern. Resources dedicated to violent extremism risk units remain insufficient for rising demand, a matter repeatedly raised within parliamentary committee debates. In the present proceedings, the court notes defence counsel’s engagement despite the increasingly constrained Legal Aid environment. Mr Duvall’s articulate and diligent representation has ensured proper adversarial contest without undue delay. He is to be thanked for his professionalism. We must also briefly note the profound societal context in which these offences occur. The widening fissures in community cohesion, intensified by polarising social media discourse and geopolitical tensions, create fertile ground for radicalisation. The court neither romanticises nor dismisses such background influences but must focus on individual accountability balanced against potential for harm. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. Having considered all available reports, the submissions of counsel, the appropriateness of sentencing guidelines, and the manifold public safety interests at stake, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The probation service is tasked to assess Mr H’s amenability to cognitive and behavioural programmes targeting extremist ideology and impulse control, evaluate prospects for effective risk management in custodial and post-release settings, and consider suitable custodial conditions possibly including proscribed contact restrictions and exclusion zones. Until such a report is received and reviewed, the court withholds final sentence. The defendant remains remanded in custody pending the next phase of proceedings. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at Nottingham Crown Court. Transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, the formal record will be entered accordingly. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

FENTON Filed: 4 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence in relation to two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences are alleged to have been committed over a period extending from May 2023 until his arrest in January 2025. The defendant was taken into custody at 07:29 hours on 15 January 2025, following the execution of a series of warrants authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. These warrants were supported by intelligence obtained by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) and the Security Service, which had been monitoring encrypted communications and digital transactions thought to be associated with the defendant. Items seized included a personal laptop, multiple external hard drives, several USB flash drives, and a small quantity of chemical precursors. The level of coordination required for these operations underscores the complex interdepartmental infrastructure that underpins contemporary counter-terrorism efforts. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation spanned almost two years, involving collaboration between regional CT specialists, forensic computing units, and overseas liaison officers. Noteworthy were the challenges posed by the defendant’s use of layered anonymisation software and encrypted cloud storage services hosted on jurisdictions outside the UK. This necessitated an extensive mutual legal assistance request process, drawing on reciprocal treaties to secure data access and warrants, which, in turn, contributed to procedural delays. These delays, while regrettable, were handled with proper diligence and oversight to ensure compliance with judicial standards. This case is further situated within a broader operational context. It is no secret that counter-terrorism law enforcement agencies have been subject to chronic resourcing pressures in recent years. Not only does this affect frontline policing, but it has practical consequences for case progression and the capacity for investigative innovation. Particularly pressing is the strain upon digital forensic teams, who must balance competing demands from overlapping investigations into organised crime, cyber-enabled fraud, and terrorism. In the present instance, CTPSW's computer analysts worked pro bono hours on weekends to expedite review of vast data troves. Their commitment merits recognition. Turning to the procedural history of this prosecution, it must be noted that the initial listing was beset by unavoidable adjournments. The first hearing, scheduled for late February 2025, was postponed after difficulties arose concerning Legal Aid funding for expert forensic assistance requested by defence counsel. Such issues are, regrettably, frequently encountered within the current Legal Aid framework, which struggles to reconcile finite budgets with the complexity of modern terrorism cases. Practitioners on both sides bore witness to these challenges, which often manifest as delays detrimental to the timely administration of justice. It must also be remarked upon with some disquiet that earlier intervention through the Prevent programme did not ultimately yield the hoped-for disengagement. A referral to Channel was made in late 2021 by a lecturer who had noted the defendant’s increasingly radical online postings during his postgraduate studies in applied physics. Despite offers of mentoring and engagement with community-led counter-extremism initiatives, support was intermittently accepted and frequently declined. This underscores a recurring difficulty faced by such programmes — the thin line between voluntary participation and compelled engagement, especially where ideological commitment is entrenched. At the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 19 June 2025, Mr H pleaded not guilty to both counts. Following jury empanelment, after three weeks of trial and detailed evidential presentation from the Crown, the defendant altered his plea to guilty on both charges on the morning of 30 September 2025. While the court acknowledges this change, it arrives at a stage where its mitigating impact on sentencing is substantially lessened, consistent with principles laid down in R v. Beresford [2022] EWCA Crim 1529. The law concerning credit for guilty pleas has been elaborated extensively by the Court of Appeal. In particular, the judgment in R v. Holloway [2023] EWCA Crim 1037 is instructive. Holloway concerned a prolonged trial for large-scale cannabis cultivation where the appellant pleaded guilty only after overwhelming forensic evidence was admitted. The appellate court emphasised the necessity of a plea’s timeliness and authenticity to merit significant credit. Similarly, the present defendant’s late plea, entered after the Crown’s case was effectively presented, falls short of the evidential threshold for maximal credit. Another authority worthy of mention is R v. Monteith [2021] EWCA Crim 2406, emerging from a lengthy prosecution for aggravated burglary involving an armoury theft. There, the appellant persisted in denial throughout, only to admit guilt on the eve of sentencing. The Court of Appeal reduced his plea credit to a modest 15%, noting that such delay results in increased trial costs and victims’ distress. The current case, while different in offence type, shares similar sentencing considerations. Public confidence in justice hinges upon the principle that offenders do not gain undue benefit from tactical plea strategies. This is an important factor alongside other sentencing purposes such as retribution and deterrence. It is also necessary to guard against any perception that terrorism offences receive fungible treatment where late pleas unduly mitigate severity. This court also notes the background of Mr H, who, at 31 years of age, holds an upper second-class honour degree in electrical engineering from a prominent university. Prior to his arrest, he was employed as a software developer with a medium-sized technology firm, where colleagues described him as “reserved but capable.” There is also evidence of a history of minor non-terrorism-related offending, including a 2017 conviction for drunk and disorderly conduct following an altercation at a football match. This prior would not ordinarily attract significant attention, but within the broader context, it evidences a degree of arrested development in social functioning. Correspondence tendered by the defendant’s family offers a complex picture. A lengthy letter from his mother emphasises a history of feelings of isolation and “alienation from mainstream society,” and conveys hope for rehabilitation. The court appreciates such humanising perspectives but must weigh them against the evident gravity of the offences. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Expert evidence heard on behalf of the Crown includes testimony from Dr Vanessa Rawlins, consultant forensic linguist, who conducted a corpus analysis of the defendant’s online postings dating between late 2023 and early 2025. She concluded there were repeated references consistent with incitement and a readiness to endorse indiscriminate violence. Although similar themes occasionally appeared in contemporaneous posts by other users in far less incriminating contexts, the defendant’s digital footprint displayed a coherent thematic narrative advancing radical objectives. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensic recovery was hampered by the defendant’s utilisation of encrypted filesystems and obfuscation techniques. Access to these materials was facilitated only after deployment of specialist decryption tools procured via a cross-jurisdictional intelligence-sharing arrangement. In one instance, the defendant used steganography to conceal documents within innocuous multimedia files, a method documented in several high-profile prosecutions, such as R v. Bates [2019] EWCA Crim 738. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. It is noted, though tangential to the offences for which Mr H stands convicted, that one co-defendant involved in the earlier stages of the investigation was separately charged with aggravated vehicular assault following an unrelated incident at a public demonstration in 2023. That matter proceeds independently and bears no direct relevance to this sentencing exercise. The court pauses to remark on the strains endured by the Probation Service in fulfilling pre-sentence assessment duties. Over the last two years, the regional probation teams have grappled with substantial staffing shortages, coupled with an increase in court referrals due to legislative amendments expanding post-release supervision. This has, on occasion, impacted the timeliness of reports. The current report on Mr H was submitted within standard timescales, yet the court remains cognisant of these systemic pressures. Likewise, it is appropriate to commend colleagues within the psychological services attached to the secure unit at Weston District Psychiatric Hospital. Despite having a capped budget and protracted waiting lists, their forensic psychiatry team produced a detailed assessment under challenging circumstances. The report, authored by Dr Liam Faraday, presents an analysis of the defendant’s cognitive style, ideological fixation, and risk potential, notwithstanding his refusal to engage with some interviews. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. The defendant’s international travel patterns were examined during the trial. His sole recorded foreign trip was to Rotterdam in October 2023, ostensibly for academic conferences. However, passport control data and CCTV recordings indicate a brief excursion outside the convention centre, allegedly to meet an individual later identified as being involved in proscribed organisations. The Crown contends this supports a pattern of deliberate association. Consideration was given also to ancillary items discovered at the defendant’s residence which bore no relation to terrorism, including a collection of vintage vinyl records and stereo equipment. While entirely legitimate interests of the individual, they provide no mitigation. The court is mindful of the importance of preserving personal liberties relating to hobby and artistic preferences; the mere possession of benign paraphernalia does not diminish culpability. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial analysis conducted by the National Crime Agency uncovered multiple cryptocurrency transactions made from wallets linked to Mr H, traced ultimately to online vendors known for dual-use chemical supplies. This digital monetary flow evidences an attempt to procure materials capable of manufacture of explosive devices but, per expert testimony, fell short of quantities sufficient to realise a viable device. Notably, the youth wing of the defendant’s former educational institution made a charitable donation through a local community fund, a matter unrelated to this case but reflecting the diffuse societal networks into which individuals such as Mr H are embedded. These acts of civic philanthropy, though commendable in their own sphere, neither excuse nor contextualise the defendant’s offences. The court further notes with regret that witness statements were occasionally delayed due to industrial action in the Witness Service, a factor regrettably beyond the control of the parties. These delays inevitably impose additional distress on complainants and court personnel alike. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the personal report prepared by the probation service dated 15 September 2025, the author highlights Mr H’s “marked ideological rigidity and limited empathy for potential victims.” However, it also notes his “intellectual capacity to understand cognitive-behavioural interventions” and his “absence of diagnosed personality disorder.” These observations inform the assessment of his capacity to engage in rehabilitation programmes. Letters from the local mosque committee express concern about the impact of terrorism prosecutorial processes on community relations. They counsel against over-punishment lest it foster further alienation and radicalisation. The court acknowledges these submissions but must prioritise the proportionality of response for public protection. It is worth noting that the defendant’s brother is currently undergoing trial for offences unrelated to this matter, including benefit fraud and money laundering. Family circumstances are complex but do not directly bear upon the defendant’s culpability. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Professor Sarah Meng, a leading forensic psychologist, provided an expert report outlining Mr H’s risk profile. While not diagnosed with a formal mental illness, she highlights “cognitive inflexibility, a deterministic world view, and a propensity to ascribe moral absolutes to complex social issues” as critical risk factors. She further emphasises the necessity for intensive, structured post-custodial supervision, recommending integration of polygraph conditions and electronic monitoring where feasible. In mitigation, the defendant has no previous convictions for terrorism or violence, and his educational attainments and partial engagement with deradicalisation initiatives warrant some recognition. Nonetheless, the late admission of guilt, coupled with the degree of planning and sophistication involved, place the offences in the most serious category set out by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (2023). It is the court’s intention now to direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, addressing issues of risk management, potential for rehabilitation, and the suitability of custodial versus community-based disposal. Particular attention should be paid to the feasibility of constructing an Extended Determinate Sentence, incorporating licence conditions tailored to the defendant’s profile. The report should also explore the need for psychological support, cognitive skills training, and enforced disengagement programmes. This matter has been heard in open court, with due respect to the rights of the defendant and victims. I acknowledge the able representations of Ms Sylvia Durrant for the Crown and Mr Peter Lowry for the defence, both of whom have conducted their duties with professional courtesy under trying and intricate circumstances. Thanks are extended to the court staff for their efficient management of the listings, noting the recent refurbishment of Courtroom 4, which provides a more suitable environment for hearings of this nature.

STRATFORD Filed: 2 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: one, of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and two, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The timeline of the offending spans from early 2023 through to the defendant’s arrest on 18 January 2025. The defendant was first taken into custody in the early morning of 18 January 2025 following the execution of a search warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence in Bedminster. This followed a protracted intelligence-led operation coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), involving collaboration with the National Crime Agency's National Cyber Crime Unit and analysts from the Forensic Digital Investigation Centre. The warrant was authorised on the basis of covert intercepts suggesting encrypted communications with known radicals and suspicious financial transactions consistent with procurement of dual-use materials. At the time of arrest, the defendant was found in possession of several electronic devices, including encrypted USB keys and a handheld electronic die grinder. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative operation, codenamed ‘Operation Brambles’, was significant in scale and resource intensity. It combined traditional surveillance with innovative behavioural analytics derived from transport card usage data, mobile handset location triangulation, and drone-based aerial reconnaissance authorised under section 23 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The defendant’s movements were mapped exhaustively over months, with particular attention given to his interactions with a network of individuals, some of whom have since been separately convicted in unrelated proceedings concerning violent disorder and drug offences. Pre-trial procedures in this matter were protracted, as is often the case in terrorism-related proceedings involving voluminous disclosure. The Crown provided over 1,200 lever-arch files of material, including expert reports from computer forensics specialists, linguistic analysts, and counter-terrorism financial investigators. Legal aid representation was authorised after an initial delay attributable to administrative processing within the Legal Aid Agency. Of concern were the repeated adjournments caused by late disclosure and the necessity of expert witness availability, resulting in the initial hearing scheduled in April 2025 being deferred twice. It must be noted that in R v. McAdams [2011] EWCA Crim 2437, the Court of Appeal emphasised the need for careful proportionality when assessing the impact of disclosure failings in such cases, and the court has borne this principle in mind throughout. The defendant indicated a not guilty plea at the arraignment hearing on 3 March 2025 but tendered guilty pleas on both counts on the first day of trial, 31 August 2025. This court has, therefore, had to consider carefully the question of credit for plea, and the issue of its timing is relevant to the assessment thereof. The law governing reduction for guilty pleas has recently been revisited and clarified by the Court of Appeal in R v. Carver [2024] EWCA Crim 1950. The court stressed that credit must be commensurate with the timeliness and genuineness of the plea: early pleas that save expense and distress to witnesses attract the highest discounts; pleas entered at the door of the court or mid-trial attract a more modest credit. It is well established, as articulated in R v. Silverman [2018] EWCA Crim 1221, that late pleas, particularly in cases involving significant forensic and expert evidence, must not be rewarded in the same manner as prompt admissions. This court reiterates that principle in the present sentencing exercise. Mr H’s defence counsel, Mr James McAlister QC, has presented mitigation in the form of a detailed personal background, psychological reports, and letters of support from local community organisations. These representations have been received with respect and given appropriate weight within the context of the current proceedings. It is a matter of record that Mr H had limited previous contact with the criminal justice system; his only prior offended-related matter being a 2018 contravention of a noise abatement order relating to his tenancy at a shared house in Easton. While such a history is of limited relevance to present offences, it offers some insight into his behavioural pattern. During the course of preparation, this court received submissions addressing the legal framework pertinent to the offences charged, most notably the sentencing guideline promulgated by the Sentencing Council in March 2023. The guideline stipulates a range of factors to be considered, including culpability, risk of harm, and the defendant’s motive. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. This court has reviewed the evidence presented, including the digital footprint found on Mr H’s devices. Notably, a widespread cache of encrypted manuals, schematic diagrams, and encrypted communication logs demonstrate not only a preparedness to engage in unlawful acts of terror but a technical sophistication in the assembly and modification of explosive devices. The court is aware that the possession of such material, under the provisions of the Terrorism Act 2006, is an aggravating factor, especially where it aligns with the intent to facilitate a violent act. The findings bear strong resemblance to the circumstances in R v. Helmsley [2016] EWCA Crim 422, where possession of comprehensive bomb-making instructions and component lists indicated a high degree of premeditation and knowledge. In the course of the trial, the Crown presented evidence linking Mr H to various encrypted messaging applications on the dark web, including specialized forums frequented by other individuals convicted for incitement and recruitment. The case further involved testimony from a former extremist who became a Crown witness after deradicalisation. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Amongst the material recovered was a portable electronic device containing an encrypted diary of sorts, with entries describing the defendant’s ideological evolution and expressed intent to “respond to a call for justice” by applying force selectively. His reference to an event of global significance was concerning and linked to subsequent investigations. It is worth noting, as an aside and of no bearing on the defendant’s culpability, that during the trial an unrelated witness referenced a 2017 case concerning the burglary of a private dwelling in Somerset by co-defendants who remain at large. This matter, while appearing in police archives, is extraneous and does not involve Mr H. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Some defence submissions suggested that the defendant’s interest in aerial drone photography—an acknowledged hobby well-documented on his now-deactivated social media accounts—might provide a benign explanation for some of the recovered footage depicting locations of interest in Bristol and its environs. This court finds such assertions unpersuasive in light of the broader evidence context. It is accepted that the defendant’s actions took place in a complex and challenging environment marked by increasing demands on public safety agencies. In a related but entirely unrelated development, the court refers with no relevance to a separate case involving graffiti on railway infrastructure in Gloucestershire, where individuals received community orders for criminal damage. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. The defendant made one documented foreign trip in the six months preceding his arrest. Travel records indicate a flight to Amsterdam to attend a conference purportedly relating to mechanical engineering. However, CCTV footage from Schiphol airport revealed contact with a person subsequently convicted of affray following a pub brawl in Rotterdam. The relevance to Mr H’s conduct is a matter of associative suspicion but not of proven risk. A noteworthy procedural observation concerns the work of the local probation service, which at present suffers from chronic understaffing, a fact highlighted in recent parliamentary debates addressing courts and community sentencing. The department handling Mr H’s presentance has, despite limited resources, committed to a thorough and timely preparation of the pre-sentence report. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation uncovered a cryptocurrency transaction amounting to the equivalent of £1,360 sent from a digital wallet in Mr H’s name to another wallet connected to a darknet marketplace. The transaction’s declared purpose was “procurement of technical components.” The court notes the increased prevalence of cryptocurrency in the financing of illicit activities, an observation echoed in the recent report by the National Crime Agency titled ‘Cryptocurrency and Crime: The Hidden Ledger’ (2024). Inter-agency efforts in this case were complicated by the accelerated workload faced by forensic analysts. The South West Digital Forensics Unit reported a case backlog exceeding 25 weeks, partly due to the surge in ‘low-level’ cybercrime incidents. Resource constraints inevitably affect the timeliness and depth of analysis, a reality reflecting systemic pressures on law enforcement. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. As regards personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old, with an educational background in mechanical engineering and a former career as a junior engineer for a local manufacturing firm. Character references portray him in positive terms: principally diligent, meticulous, and socially reserved. However, a noted change occurred following his resignation six months before the commencement of the criminal behaviour in question. Of potential mitigation are letters from the Brightside Volunteer Outreach Program and the Westbury Residents Association, commending Mr H’s episodic involvement in community gardening and foodbank initiatives. The court appreciates such civic contributions but reminds that they cannot detract from the seriousness of the offences committed. The court also acknowledges a recent initiative by the Bristol Prevent Hub targeting individuals at risk of radicalisation. Their dossier records partial engagement by Mr H in cognitive behavioural intervention but notes that he frequently missed appointments during 2024, and later disengaged entirely. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. A comprehensive psychiatric and psychological assessment by Dr Fiona Marsh, consultant forensic psychologist, concludes that while Mr H does not meet diagnostic criteria for a major mental disorder, he does exhibit traits of cognitive inflexibility and ideological rigidity. The report concludes a high risk of serious harm, particularly absent sustained intervention. Dr Marsh recommends a structured programme incorporating cognitive behavioural techniques and de-radicalisation frameworks but is cautious as to ultimate prognosis given the defendant’s prior inconsistent engagement. The court acknowledges these nuanced findings but reiterates that sentencing must primarily reflect public protection imperatives. Before concluding, the court is constrained to observe the regrettable trend of late pleas in complex cases, which prolong hearings and compound pressures on already overburdened judicial and prosecutorial resources. The case at hand underscores the importance of early acceptance of responsibility to limit harm to the administration of justice. The court will direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report. The probation service is invited to address the suitability of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and to assess the viability of high-level monitoring, electronic tagging, and multi-agency supervision post-release. Consideration should be given to the availability of approved premises with specialist input, and the scope for continued psychological treatment within the custodial environment. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 2 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

Mr H Case No. B2025/26954 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. M. Ellingham Filed: 29 October 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence having been convicted on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article intended for use in terrorist activity, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Both offences arose from conduct spanning the period between September 2023 and his arrest in April 2025. The defendant’s apprehension followed a multi-jurisdictional operation supported by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) and specialist cybercrime units within the National Crime Agency (NCA). Arrest warrants were executed at approximately 07:00 hours on Wednesday 16 April 2025 at a residential address in the Bedminster district of Bristol. Search yields included encrypted external hard drives, multiple mobile devices, and chemical precursors stored within a locked cupboard in the defendant’s bedroom. The warrants authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 were supported by intercept material collected under warrant by the Security Service (MI5). The operation had been ongoing for over eight months, incorporating covert surveillance, digital infiltration, and undercover engagement. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This case highlights, once again, the increasing complexity of investigations in the counter-terrorism arena. Officers and analysts must routinely navigate the proliferating landscape of encrypted communications, darknet marketplaces, and sophisticated anonymisation techniques. The investigative burden is formidable. It demands not only substantial funding and personnel but also legal acumen adept at balancing the rights of the accused with the imperatives of national security and public safety. Indeed, the volume of digital material in this case stood at just over 2.1 terabytes, necessitating careful management of disclosure obligations under the Criminal Procedure Rules. Such logistical challenges are experienced across the country’s counter-terrorism investigations, stretching already limited resources to their limits. It is noteworthy that Mr H’s initial remand hearings were adjourned twice, first due to defence applications to instruct an independent cyber-forensic expert and secondly owing to delays in receiving original encrypted message logs pertinent to the prosecution case. Such procedural delays, while regrettable, are largely inevitable in complex matters of this nature. They underscore the tensions between adequate preparation for trial and the efficient administration of justice. That said, some cases have seen more protracted delays. For example, in R v. Peel [2019] EWCA Crim 774, the appellant’s trial was postponed multiple times over two years due to difficulties in securing clearance for classified intercept evidence. Though Peel concerned counterterrorism investigations in the North East, its circumstances serve as a reminder of the fragility of the system when faced with highly sensitive material. It is thus somewhat encouraging that in the present matter, notwithstanding the volume and sensitivity of the digital material, the Crown and defence have operated with a degree of professional cooperation regrettably uncommon in such cases. The court is also mindful of the contextual pressures impacting frontline services. Local policing teams contend daily with rising incidents of non-domestic violent crime, public order offences, and increasingly complex safeguarding cases. The geographic area served by CTPSW has witnessed a modest but persistent increase in knife possession offences among young people, clouding the availability of officers for specialist counter-terrorism duties. Moreover, the forensic workload at the regional digital examination hub has doubled over the past 36 months, further accentuating resource constraints. Such strains cannot be ignored when considering the practical realities in which cases such as this unfold. A so-called “Channel” referral was triggered in mid-2021 after the defendant’s former university tutor raised concerns about his online postings, which included extremist content with calls for “mobilising local cells.” The referral proceeded to a panel which, regrettably, concluded that there was insufficient evidence of immediate risk and hence closed the case after six months due to non-engagement. Such outcomes unfortunately remain frequent in Prevent interventions, highlighting systemic challenges in early derogation from radicalisation pathways. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Turning now to the facts of the offences, the evidence adduced during both the trial and the preparatory hearings reveals a pattern of deliberate and considered conduct indicative of high culpability. Amongst significant material recovered were schematics for improvised explosive devices and detailed logs recording procurement efforts for ammonium nitrate and other dual-use chemicals. Further analysis of encrypted chats showed frequent exchange with other proscribed actors, using codewords consistent with previous terrorism prosecutions. Specialist linguistic reports tendered at trial contextualised these communications within established extremist narratives. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The Crown’s contention, supported by expert forensic testimony, was that the defendant’s possession of digital documents and chemical precursors demonstrated not curiosity or academic interest, but active preparation for an attack intended to cause maximum civilian casualties. Defence submissions denied this, instead submitting that the materials were held out of scientific interest and that connections to extremist persons were circumstantial or misinterpreted. The jury, however, rejected these arguments. The legal framework for determining culpability in such cases is well established. Notably, R v. Sood [2018] EWCA Crim 1459 articulates that possession of explosive manuals in isolation does not suffice for conviction under section 5 of the 2006 Act; rather, a “course of conduct” with intent or practical preparatory steps must be demonstrated. Here, the prosecution was able to establish that threshold beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the defendant’s conviction reflects jurisprudential clarity in the application of the law to contemporary forms of preparatory offending. Despite these contours of serious criminality, it remains appropriate to consider matters personal to the defendant. Mr H’s background reveals an apparently stable upbringing. Born in 1996 in Bristol, he attended a well-regarded local grammar school, achieving commendable academic success. He subsequently graduated with a degree in chemical engineering. Prior to September 2023, he had worked for two years in quality assurance at a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant. No prior convictions or cautions appear on his record. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. Whilst commendable on their own terms, these biographical notes of stability and prior lawful conduct sit uneasily with the grave nature of the offences. Defence counsel notes that Mr H’s mental health history includes a diagnosis of moderate anxiety, with treatment episodes by the local NHS Community Mental Health Team interrupted by relocation. Reference was made to a report by Dr Salim Patel, consultant psychiatrist, dated 8 September 2025, which acknowledges the absence of psychosis or major mood disturbance but notes “a degree of rigid cognitive style and obsessive ideation, particularly around political grievance.” Dr Patel concedes that such features do not wholly explain or excuse the offence behaviour. At this point, it is salutary to record some jurisprudence which bears relevance. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court of Appeal emphasised that a mental disorder, while a relevant mitigating factor, does not nullify culpability where the offending conduct exhibits conscious and deliberate intent to harm. Mallory concerned a defendant with schizoaffective disorder who had deliberately set multiple fires causing substantial risk to life. Similarly, R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412 confirmed that the presence of community-based psychiatric support does not necessarily reduce the need for custodial containment where the offender has demonstrated relapse or poor compliance. Although neither case mirrors the precise context of Mr H’s offending, they serve as salutary reminders of the limited mitigating weight mental health histories provide in terrorism-related offending where public protection is paramount. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. The investigation revealed the defendant’s travel history included a brief visit in April 2024 to Berlin, ostensibly for an engineering conference. Surveillance and subsequent analysis of transport records uncovered an unplanned excursion allowing him to attend a rally organised by a network with known links to overseas extremist cells. Defence counsel urges this was innocent and spontaneous, a form of political curiosity. The prosecution contends it was further evidence of active engagement with proscribed ideologies. Although the defendant did not subsequently travel to conflict zones, this excursion must be considered within the gestalt of other preparatory elements. Further matters raised during submissions concern the scale of resources exhausted in the investigation underpinning the prosecution. Disclosure comprised over 680 primary exhibits including extensive CCTV footage, digital device extractions, and intercepted communications. The logistical burdens on the CTPSW specialist officers and national forensic teams have been considerable, compounded by the necessity of sensitive inter-agency coordination and the application of Control Orders during early phases of investigation. The court also remarks, in passing, on the somewhat unusual circumstance that a co-defendant earlier charged alongside Mr H, who had been accused of assaulting a police officer with a chair during arrest, was ultimately released without charge. Though this individual’s unrelated conduct did not impact the trial outcome, it exemplifies the fragmented nature of prosecutions often encountered in terrorism cases. The defendant had become obsessed with the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and been following the cleaner. One entry in Mr H’s tactical file described how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations orchestrated by the NCA uncovered electronic fund transfers from accounts associated with Mr H to online vendors linked to procurement of chemicals and electronic components often used in explosive manufacture. Records show multiple cryptocurrency transactions dating from late 2023 to early 2025, some routed through mixers designed to obfuscate origin and flow. While such technologies serve legitimate purposes for privacy, they also facilitate illicit activities, posing significant challenges for law enforcement and financial regulators alike. This court notes with concern the escalation of cryptocurrency use in terrorism financing evidenced in recent years and the call for enhanced regulatory frameworks. The strain on police digital forensics units cannot be overstated. Nationally, the backlog of cases requiring detailed electronic examination now exceeds 15,000, a figure that continues to grow despite incremental investment. Within CTPSW’s jurisdiction, caseloads have trebled since 2021, reflecting both general crime trends and the increasing sophistication of offenders seeking to conceal illegal conduct. Such realities speak to broader systemic issues that are not unique to this prosecution but are relevant to the operational environment. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant is 29 years of age. Character references tendered describe him as quietly polite and intellectually curious, if somewhat socially withdrawn. Former employers noted punctuality and technical competence prior to his sudden resignation in August 2023 following disputes related to work patterns and perceived workplace discrimination. Letters from community organisations highlight Mr H’s past volunteering with a local food bank and some involvement in ecological conservation efforts. While these contributions are, no doubt, genuine, the court is mindful that positive community engagement does not negate serious criminal responsibility. Counsel for the defence has advanced mitigation based on the defendant’s willingness to engage with the Westcombe Deradicalisation Programme. This voluntary intervention seeks to address ideological extremism through cognitive behavioural modules, mentoring, and vocational retraining. Engagement has been intermittent, with sessions missed due to reluctance and anxiety. Nevertheless, the programme coordinators remain cautiously optimistic about its potential benefits, acknowledging the difficulties inherent in de-radicalisation work. The court also acknowledges the correspondence received from the Easton Volunteer Alliance, which provides support services to offenders transitioning to community settings. Their letter emphasised concerns regarding the swelling number of individuals with extremist convictions who face limited housing options and social isolation upon release. These social determinants are widely understood to increase the risk of recidivism. While these issues are not strictly germane to sentence, they form part of the broader operational context deserving judicial awareness. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! The pre-sentence psychiatric report from Professor Rhea Marcus, forensic psychologist, concludes that Mr H exhibits a “predominantly black-and-white cognitive bias coupled with a pronounced sense of victimhood.” No formal Axis I diagnosis is recorded. High risk of serious harm is noted drawn from his detailed technical knowledge, ideological entrenchment, and prior attempts at obfuscating digital traces. Professor Marcus advises that intensive structured intervention—combining psychological therapy, strict licence conditions, and digitally-enabled monitoring—is necessary to mitigate risk should the defendant be released in due course. The considerable challenge posed by his case, she suggests, reinforces the need for societal vigilance and bespoke management plans. Despite these grim considerations, it is proper to observe that the defendant has no previous convictions for violence or terrorism-related offences. This absence of prior convictions is a mitigating factor of some limited weight. The late plea—entered on 21 October 2025, a mere week before the commencement of trial—affords modest credit only. As established in R v. Tolson [2024] EWCA Crim 2388, the Court of Appeal has reminded that guilty pleas entered at the eleventh hour, though preferable to contested proceedings, do not provide the restorative benefit associated with early admissions that spare the Crown and witnesses considerable expense and distress. The operative sentencing guideline in this matter is the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline, revised in January 2023. It articulates the assessment of culpability across a spectrum ranging from low-level advocacy to high-sophistication multi-agency plots. The defendant’s conduct, by its careful and persistent nature, as well as the lethal potential, clearly resides within the highest culpability bracket. The guideline also outlines the significance of aggravating factors—including ideological motivation, use of sophisticated methods, and planning intended to cause significant casualties—all present here. Mitigation is appropriately confined to the defendant’s clean prior record and partial cooperation in investigation and prosecution. In light of the above, the court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared. The report should encompass consideration of rehabilitation prospects, the offender’s engagement with deradicalisation programmes, potential for cognitive skill development, and suitability for an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Specialist input from forensic psychology and social work is requested, particularly on post-custodial management plans including accommodation, employment, and digital monitoring. Interested agencies are asked to liaise to provide an integrated risk management strategy. This court acknowledges the continuing strain under which probation and community mental health teams operate. In several regions, staff shortages have led to extended waiting lists for psychological therapies, delaying critical interventions that might reduce reoffending and enhance public safety. The inter-agency coordination required for supervising terrorism-related offenders is complex, requiring sustained funding and political will that, regrettably, are not always forthcoming. Such realities bear upon sentence planning indirectly but importantly. Finally, it is necessary to formally thank counsel for their diligent representations. Ms Eleanor Mackay, appearing for the Crown, and Mr David Crane representing the defence, have approached this difficult and sensitive matter with professionalism and attention to due process. The court also records appreciation to the court usher and administrative staff who have facilitated multiple listing changes occasioned by disclosure and legal aid considerations. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 29 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

CARMICHAEL Filed: 15 October 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence convicted on two counts: first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and second, possessing an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conducts occurred over a protracted period from September 2022 until his arrest in April 2025. The defendant was taken into custody at approximately 04:45 hours on 18 April 2025 following the execution of a search warrant at his residence on Langley Road, Handsworth. The warrant was granted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, grounded on intelligence from the Security Service indicating Mr H's involvement with an encrypted network known for distributing extremist publications and materials. Seized as part of the operation were multiple electronic devices including a tower PC, assorted USB drives, and encrypted mobile telephony equipment. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation leading to arrest was lengthy and resource-intensive. Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) engaged in a concerted multi-agency operation, leveraging not only technical surveillance assets but also human intelligence sources cultivated over eighteen months. The use of mobile phone extraction software, combined with decryption efforts on multiple messaging applications, formed a salient aspect of the evidential build. The court notes, parenthetically, that the unprecedented demand on the digital forensics units across the country has significantly extended processing times; such delay not only impedes swift case progression but burdens analytical teams operating on stretched rosters. Procedural challenges were encountered during pre-trial stages, including a protracted disclosure timeline necessitated by voluminous evidence and classified material with restricted access. There were two adjournments at the behest of the defence, the latter supported by a Legal Aid Agency request for increased funding to instruct an independent expert on cyber security protocols. The court is aware of persistent systemic issues within the Legal Aid framework, which often constrains the ability of defendants to secure adequate investigatory or expert support in complex terrorism proceedings, a matter warranting broader governmental attention but beyond the remit of this court. A “Channel” intervention referral had been lodged in late 2019 by a member of staff at the local vocational college after Mr H submitted a project paper quoting extensively from known radical manifestos without critical contextual analysis. That referral, however, did not progress beyond initial engagement as Mr H declined sustained intervention, and no further indicators of active radicalisation were apparent to the Prevent coordinators at that time. The court acknowledges the challenging balance Channel panels must strike between early intervention and respecting individual autonomy. At a plea and case management hearing on 10 August 2025, Mr H entered a not guilty plea. The trial was listed to commence on 20 November 2025. However, during the morning of the trial commencement, he elected to enter guilty pleas to both counts. Counsel for the defence solicited a tempered degree of credit for the plea, characterising it as a recognition of responsibility and an effort to spare witnesses the ordeal of trial. The Crown resisted any more than moderate reduction citing the very late timing of the admission. It is important to restate the jurisprudential position on plea credit in terrorism cases. The Court of Appeal in R v. Walcott [2023] EWCA Crim 1589 underscored that credit for guilty pleas should ideally be granted where the plea is early, genuine, and materially assists in conserving court resources or sparing witness distress. Late pleas entered at or near trial, particularly following extensive preparatory hearings and evidential disclosures, typically warrant lesser discounts. The rationale lies in encouraging timely admissions and maintaining procedural economy amid resource-intensive proceedings. The present case squarely fits within the latter description. Illustrative of the principles, the judgment in R v. Stamford [2022] EWCA Crim 1745 involving prolonged denials in a grievous bodily harm case affirmed a mere 10% discount where the plea was entered just before trial, despite compelling evidence. While the context differs in offence type, the reasoning on plea timing and credit remains pertinent. The court is mindful that this approach, while seemingly inflexible, serves broader public interests in efficient justice administration. Equally relevant is the well-established sentencing framework under the Terrorism Act with attendant guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council in 2023. The court’s evaluative matrix comprises culpability, risk, and harm potential, with those committing preparatory acts often attracted to long determinate sentences reflective of public protection priorities and deterrence. Case authorities such as R v. Javed [2017] EWCA Crim 1210 and R v. Patel [2019] EWCA Crim 2241 remain instructive in sentencing proportionality, especially where advanced planning and procurement of materials are attested. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. In delineating the context of the defendant’s activities, the court must acknowledge the substantial body of digital material recovered, including encrypted archives containing detailed manuals on improvised explosive devices, alongside correspondence revealing communications with known extremist content propagators situated abroad. Linguistic forensic examination identified coded messaging consistent with contemporaneous terrorist narratives disseminated via closed online forums. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic technology played an indispensable role in this prosecution, with teams utilising cutting-edge software under license agreements permitting deobfuscation of anonymised traffic routing nodes on the Tor network, an operation not without challenge, as demonstrated by the necessity to overcome time-delay circuits incorporated to hinder passive surveillance. This technical prologue extends well beyond the immediate remit of the court but merits remark insofar as it exposes the sophistication of criminal enterprises and the requisite response by national security agencies, which must constantly innovate to keep pace. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. It warrants mention, though without direct relevance to culpability or sentence, that during searches ancillary to the terrorism investigation, officers uncovered an extensive cache of recreational fishing equipment, including rods, nets, and bait. Defence appearances have at times sought to highlight these as indicators of Mr H’s capacity for mundane, non-criminal pursuits — a fact that holds little legal consequence but perhaps adds nuance to his personal profile. The court is also in receipt of several testimonial letters from local community organisations, including the Handsworth Civic Trust and the Birmingham Volunteer Association. These laud Mr H's commitment to urban environmental clean-ups and note his involvement in a community allotment scheme. While such activities may be commendable, they do not abrogate the serious breach constituted by his engagement in pro-terrorism conduct. The court’s approach must remain firmly anchored in legal principle and safeguarding public safety. Co-defendants in related operations continue to be subject to distinct proceedings. It is noted that one co-defendant was remanded at large following a failed extradition request owing to citizenship complexities. Another face charges unrelated to this matter, including affray connected to a local militia dispute. These matters have no bearing on Mr H's case, notwithstanding allegations at trial that the group shared overlapping networks. The court’s notes also record that the defendant has no previous convictions, a fact that modestly mitigates, but without offsetting the gravity of the present offences. Mr H is 30 years of age, single, and employed sporadically prior to arrest as a laboratory technician in a manufacturing plant. His educational record includes a Higher National Diploma in electronic engineering. Employment references offered in evidence describe a capable and punctual work ethic, though punctuated by periods of absenteeism in 2023. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. Of potential interest, though again peripheral to sentencing, were travel records indicating a brief transitory presence in Brussels during the summer of 2023, attending what was variously described as a conference on renewable energies. Surveillance logs also show suspect activity during late evenings at a riverbank nearby, though subsequent inquiries attributed these movements to amateur drumming circles and night photography hobbyists. The blurred lines between lawful subcultural pastimes and suspect behaviour remain a challenge to investigators and the judiciary alike. In a sign of the procedural magnitude of such cases, the disclosure schedule extended to over 600 documents and terabytes of data. The court acknowledges with regret the burdens such voluminous material imposes on all parties and the attendant risk of delay. That the prosecution and defence teams nonetheless maintained judicious case management is to be commended and worth formal recognition. The expert psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Simone Zalewski, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Midlands Secure Treatment Centre, provides a comprehensive psychological profiling of Mr H. The report diagnoses no formal psychiatric disorder but notes pronounced cognitive rigidity and a marked tendency toward absolutist, black-and-white moral reasoning. The risk of further engagement in ideologically motivated violence is assessed as substantial without intensive community management. The report outlines the prospect of engagement with deradicalisation programmes, though it cautions against optimistic projections given historically low completion rates. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations traced significant cryptocurrency transactions believed to be linked to the defendant. A sum of approximately £3,800 was transferred via a series of currency mixers from wallets associated with Mr H’s known aliases to vendors operating in jurisdictions known for lax oversight of dual-use chemical sales. While the validity of these transactions as funding for proscribed activities remains a question of probability within the case, the court notes their existence as underlining a proactive attempt at obfuscation characteristic of those intent on illicit procurement. Counter Terrorism Policing also submitted voluminous covert surveillance material, including footage of Mr H frequenting a disused industrial estate during night hours in late 2024. This viewing required extensive post-processing to stabilise images and confirm identity across overlapping camera angles, an operation taxing in both personnel hours and technological resources. Such detailed surveillance efforts exemplify the asymmetry faced by law enforcement: significant investment is required to detect fleeting preparatory acts that may culminate in mass harm. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. On the matter of the defendant’s personal circumstances, mention must be made of letters submitted from his immediate family members. His mother describes Mr H as having been a “quiet, introspective child,” and notes attendance difficulties during adolescence linked to undiagnosed dyslexia. The court cannot underestimate the potentially traumatic effects of learning challenges absent appropriate educational support, yet is equally aware that these considerations must be balanced against the defendant’s autonomous choices in adulthood. His social history includes periods of homelessness in 2021, documented in correspondence from two local homeless shelters. These reports underscore the interface between social vulnerability and radicalising influences, a nexus increasingly recognised within Prevent strategy frameworks. Nonetheless, the trajectory from disadvantage to culpability is not deterministic; many exposed to harsh socioeconomic conditions do not contravene the law. Of supplementary interest is the observation that the Probation Service in the West Midlands continues to face chronic staffing shortages, resulting in elevated caseloads and protracted waiting lists for offender rehabilitation programmes. This unfortunate reality inevitably affects service provision to those like Mr H, for whom structured intervention is critical to risk management and desistance. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! Professor Gareth Milton, consulting forensic psychologist instructed by the defence, concurred generally with Dr Zalewski’s assessment but opined that Mr H’s ideological fixation might be amenable to cognitive restructuring through sustained engagement with the Deradicalisation and Disengagement Initiative (DDI). The court notes, however, the limited availability and capacity of such specialist programmes nationally, and the complexity of successful reintegration where entrenched extremist beliefs are present. This case exemplifies the necessity of calibrated sentencing that balances retributive and preventative objectives. Mr H’s actions reveal a high degree of planning and commitment, an exploitation of technology to circumvent detection, and an intent to precipitate indiscriminate harm. Such conduct falls within the highest culpability tier envisaged by the Sentencing Council. Aggravating features include the deliberate selection of vulnerable public sites as potential targets and the timing of planning activities to coincide symbolically with prior terrorist incidents. Mitigating factors are scarce, principally Mr H’s lack of prior convictions, his educational achievements, and the belated guilty pleas, entered only after comprehensive disclosure and on the very cusp of trial. Given the lateness, the court attributes a credit of approximately one-sixth of sentence length. The court directs that a pre-sentence report be compiled with particular emphasis on risk assessment, availability of deradicalisation programmes, and suitable custodial or community placements that afford intensive supervision and psychological input. Extended supervision upon release, including electronic monitoring and restricted internet access, should be contemplated as conditions essential to continued public protection.

DARWELL Filed: 27 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engagement in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct, as alleged and found proved, is said to have taken place between late 2022 and February 2025, when the defendant was arrested. The defendant was apprehended at approximately 04:45 on 19 February 2025 pursuant to warrants executed at his residence in the Edgbaston area under powers conferred by section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. Those warrants were supported by classified intelligence reports from the Security Service indicating ongoing encrypted communications between Mr H and individuals linked to overseas proscribed organisations. The digital devices seized at the time included several smartphones, encrypted USB drives, and a compact 3D printer. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation which led to Mr H’s arrest was complex and multifaceted. It involved collaboration between Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Forensic Digital Analysis Service. Key to the case was the painstaking decryption of communications on closed, peer-to-peer networks—work that spanned over nine months. Such forensic activity is resource intensive, further compounded by the necessity to maintain operational security and handle material marked 'SECRET'. It is relevant, albeit tangential, to observe that the National Cyber Crime Unit’s backlog currently exceeds 13,000 active investigations, a figure which underscores the systemic capacity pressures on national security infrastructure in recent years. The court notes the procedural history in this matter. Initial hearings commenced on 10 April 2025, with counsel instructed under a Legal Aid certificate. However, defence preparation was hampered by administrative delays stemming from the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted authorization of funding for third-party expert reports, a matter that occasioned several continuing representation applications. The court registers its concern at the continued inefficiencies in the system, with the Legal Aid Agency’s turnaround for instruction approval frequently exceeding six weeks in substantive terrorism cases—this, despite multiple judicial reminders and formal complaints from concerned solicitors. Such delays risk undermining the smooth administration of justice. Among the material considered was a psychiatric and psychological report compiled by Dr Liam Carnegie, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 18 July 2025. Dr Carnegie notes Mr H’s “marked ideological conviction” but diagnoses no major mental illness. Instead, he describes the defendant’s cognitive style as “rigid and inflexible,” remarking that this was “coupled with a limited capacity for empathy towards civic victims.” The report recommends intensive monitoring post-release due to persistent risk indicators. It is worth remarking, in a broader societal context, that contemporary jurisprudence rarely encounters a case devoid of complex mental health considerations. The intersection of psychiatric evaluation and criminal culpability is a dynamic and evolving field. Of relevance in this jurisdiction is R v. Tallis [2014] EWCA Crim 476, which emphasises that the presence of ideology-driven rigidity, absent treatable illness, can nonetheless warrant custodial sentences consistent with public protection principles. A plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 14 August 2025. Mr H originally entered a not guilty plea. This stance was maintained through jury selection and opening submissions, only to be reversed on the morning the trial was due to begin, on 25 August 2025, when the defendant pleaded guilty to both counts. As established in the authorities, notably R v. Withers [2021] EWCA Crim 1354, the utility of a plea is significantly diminished where entered at an advanced stage, after considerable court time and witness preparation. The principle that earlier pleas constitute genuine acceptance of responsibility carrying proportionate sentence credit is well embedded. Mr H’s last-minute change means that any discount must be tempered accordingly. R v. Owen [2023] EWCA Crim 760 offers guidance as to the weight to be accorded to such late pleas in terrorism-related offending. The Court of Appeal was clear that, whilst credit is appropriate, it should not undermine the paramount sentencing objectives of deterrence and public protection. In its words, “a late plea is of necessity reflective more of tactical concession than contrition.” It is appropriate to remind ourselves that the maximum penalty for the section 5 offence is life imprisonment and the offence carries a heavy sentencing tariff under the 2023 Sentencing Council guidelines for terrorism-related offending. These prescribe a tiered approach, commensurate with the degree of planning, level of sophistication, and proximity to acts of violence or public harm. The case law including R v. Yasin [2019] EWCA Crim 196, and R v. Alfadli [2021] EWCA Crim 1201 remain instructive in calibrating fitness of sentence to culpability. Mr H planned to build and leave a device in a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, just east of Cornbrook station, scheduled to detonate at 3pm as Leeds supporters passed in dense footfall, exploiting CCTV blind spots. Mr H’s online activities featured prominently in the prosecution case—an extensive digital footprint maintained under anonymous aliases, showcasing a marked progression from apolitical commentary towards extremist material reflective of internationally proscribed entities. These materials were secured following warrant authorisations that included a delicate balance of Article 8 rights under the European Convention. Their admissibility was robustly challenged but ultimately upheld. Mr H’s files included a bridge layout and drone sequence intended to strike emergency services after the first explosion. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic analysis of the devices recovered revealed significant quantities of technical manuals concerned with the manufacture of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and ballistic testing reports. Included were videos demonstrating the effects of various shrapnel materials in confined spaces. Defence counsel contended that the presence of such materials was consistent with academic interest in explosives engineering, but this line was thoroughly undermined by the contextual digital evidence and receipt of financial transfers from shadowy cryptocurrency wallets. The court acknowledges that the possession of such material alone, absent intention, might attract a different sentencing dynamic. Yet in the present context, taken alongside communications and preparatory steps, the evidential mosaic conveys clear intent. It is recalled that in R v. Krieger [2022] EWCA Crim 895 the court reinforced that mere possession of extremist literature is insufficient for conviction, but when linked to preparatory conduct, it forms a compelling basis for serious sentence. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Mr H’s travel history included a series of short international trips ostensibly for academic conferences. However, evidence was disclosed of attempts to journey to jurisdictions associated with active conflict zones, albeit thwarted by visa refusals and flight cancellations. These journeys formed part of the prosecution’s narrative of escalating commitment to violent extremist ideologies. The court notes, by way of unsuccessful analogy, a related case in which Mr Cogan was convicted for the fly-tipping of toxic waste in a nature reserve, a wholly unrelated environmental offence. Though serious in its own right, this bears no relevance to Mr H’s conduct and is mentioned only as background to the various public safety challenges confronting law enforcement agencies. Further distracting from the core criminality, the court also heard of a co-defendant in an unrelated fraud trial, Mr Giles, whose failure to appear led to a warrant for his arrest. Mr Giles’s crimes, including attempted result-fixing in amateur football leagues, cast no shadow on the present matter, save to highlight the multiplicity of cases engaging police resources. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The defendant’s digital communications evidenced negotiation attempts concerning procurement of dual-use chemicals, subject to strict regulatory export controls. The existence of encrypted messaging logs displaying detailed discussions of chemical quantities, transportation routes, and storage arrangements is undeniably concerning. Notwithstanding the focus on these serious matters, the court is compelled to reflect on contemporaneous civil matters. Instances of criminal damage incurred against local religious centres, including a church noticeboard defaced with graffiti during a period of heightened community tension, surfaced in the local media. These events, while deplorable, have no factual nexus to Mr H’s offending and neither do reports surfaced during pretrial disclosures concerning unrelated shoplifting offences committed by a roommate of the defendant. The court trusts that such extraneous details will not confuse the overall assessment of culpability. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations revealed multiple anonymous cryptocurrency transactions involving wallets linked to the defendant’s online identities. A sum exceeding £4,000 was traced, passing through assorted tumblers and mixers before reaching darknet market vendors advertising tactical gear. While cryptocurrency has legitimate uses, the exploitation of its anonymity features for illicit ends represents a growing frontier in criminal enterprise. The present case exhibits the classic hallmarks addressed in the annual National Crime Agency Strategic Assessment on digital currency misuse. The proliferation of obfuscated payment mechanisms challenges law enforcement’s capacity and demands adaptive legislative responses. Of note, the court also reviewed the curiously tangential evidence relating to a series of trespass and possession of a bladed article in a secondary car park near Edgbaston University. The reference arises in police logs but pertains to an unrelated individual and has no bearing on the defendant. Similarly, a previous conviction of the defendant’s sister for benefit fraud, referenced in defence submissions, is irrelevant to his own conduct. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances: Mr H is aged 31. He holds a Master’s degree in Chemical Engineering from a well-regarded institution, and was most recently employed by a regional water treatment facility before his abrupt resignation in early 2023. Interviews with former colleagues depict a capable but socially isolated individual, prone to taking extended lunch breaks and demonstrating a reluctance to engage in team activities. Letters from a local horticultural society praised his voluntary work in community allotments, describing him as “meticulous and reliable.” The court accepts that civic-mindedness, while commendable, cannot offset serious criminal conduct. As Lord Justice Mance observed in R v. Reynolds [2018] EWCA Crim 1234, “Personal virtue in non-criminal spheres neither excuses nor mitigates offences that jeopardise the lives of innocents.” It is also necessary to consider the defendant’s mental health. Professor Sarah Patterson, consultant forensic psychologist, conducted a detailed assessment and concluded that Mr H exhibits a “markedly black-and-white cognitive style,” manifesting in rigid ideological adherence. There is no diagnosis of psychosis or personality disorder. The report emphasises the high likelihood of reoffending absent intensive post-release management and cautions against simplistic notions of deradicalisation. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. The court’s assessment, in line with the expert evidence and comprehensive factual findings, is that Mr H represents a significant ongoing risk in public safety terms. The gravity of his offending, the sophistication of his preparations, and his ideological commitment, all demand a custodial sentence of immediate commencement. The sentencing guidelines for offences under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 and section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 require the court to balance factors of culpability, harm, and mitigation. There is limited scope here for leniency. The defendant’s previously clean criminal record and educational attainments weigh in mitigation, as does the late plea, albeit reduced significantly by its timing. Prison services are emphatically reminded of the necessity for concerted deradicalisation and cognitive behavioural programmes tailored to offenders convicted in these categories. Multi-agency cooperation, including MAPPA Category 3 arrangements, remains essential for ongoing risk reduction. The court directs that a detailed pre-sentence report be prepared with specific enquiries into the feasibility of High Intensity Programmes (HIP), the availability of Accredited Programme Providers, and suitability for Extended Determinate Sentence arrangements as per the Criminal Justice Act 2003, section 226A. The report shall also canvass options for electronic monitoring, including GPS exclusion zones and internet-access restrictions, given the defendant’s extensive digital facilitation of his offending. I would take this opportunity to note the diligent work of the specialist counter-terrorism probation teams, who operate under significant workload pressures and often face public misunderstanding. Their engagement is a linchpin in ensuring cases such as this do not regress into worse outcomes post-release. It is regrettable but unsurprising that vacancies in such teams remain unfilled for extended periods. This court wishes also to acknowledge the behind-the-scenes support from the Birmingham Prevent Hub, whose early identification of the defendant’s ideological shift was subsequent to an initial Home Office referral dating back to 2021. Although engagement was intermittent, their reports describe sustained efforts at intervention through mentoring and educational support, restrained by resource limitations and the defendant’s resistance. Finally, I am reminded of the constitutional principle that prosecutions for terrorism offences must be pursued scrupulously in adherence to the rule of law, mindful of the dangers of stigmatization and overreach. As Lord Justice Sedley remarked in R v. Farid [2010] EWCA Crim 142, “The state must be vigilant, but the law must be known and certain.” This case is no exception. These sentencing remarks are issued on this 27th day of August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The official record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant penal and supervisory authorities in due course.

J. WALTHAM Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected to terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct underlying these charges relates predominantly to the period commencing in late 2022 through to his arrest in May 2025. The case has been listed on multiple occasions since charge, with several adjournments attributable to logistical challenges facing both the prosecution and defence teams, including protracted disclosure demands and the need to accommodate a specialist psychiatric evaluation. It is notable that one listing was vacated at short notice on 2 July 2025 when the defence made an application for further time to receive digital forensic materials relating to encrypted messaging platforms. This delay highlights, yet again, the ever-increasing complexity of terrorism investigations in the digital age. Mr H’s arrest took place on 19 May 2025 at an address in Acocks Green, executed with a search warrant issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant and subsequent search were authorised following intelligence from a combined effort by West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit (WMCTU), the National Crime Agency’s Cyber Terrorism Team, and the Security Service. At the point of arrest, officers seized multiple electronic devices, including laptops, smartphones, and several encrypted USB drives, underscoring the defendant’s sophisticated use of technology. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This investigation formed part of Operation NIGHTFALL, a multifaceted inquiry blending human intelligence, signals intelligence, and covert surveillance. The efforts extended over an 18-month period, requiring considerable inter-agency cooperation across police forces, intelligence services, and forensic experts. The National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES) played a pivotal role in the recovery and analysis of encrypted materials, a process complicated by Mr H’s use of open-source virtual machines and anonymising networks. The resource implications of such investigations are substantial, imposing a heavy financial burden on public agencies, which, in the context of widespread austerity, compound the already stretched budgets of frontline policing and security services. It is well documented that operational priorities must be balanced against such constraints. Given the gravity of the allegations, however, the level of dedication and specialist expertise marshalled by involved teams was appropriate and necessary. The court notes with some appreciation that, despite ongoing pressures, disclosure schedules were maintained in compliance with Criminal Procedure Rules, albeit marginally. The periodic delays observed were, in this instance, matters of inadvertent operational fatigue rather than systemic failure. Nonetheless, the court endorses the ongoing calls for enhanced technological investment to reduce bottlenecks in digital evidence examination. The defendant was initially bailed following his arrest, subject to stringent electronic monitoring and a curfew, pending further evidential development. The conditions were regularly reviewed, reflecting the risk-based approach outlined in the National Counter Terrorism Policing Framework. Following summons to answer the charges, the case progressed to the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing (PTPH) on 30 July 2025. On this date, Mr H altered his pleas to guilty on both counts, albeit only shortly before the commencement of the contested trial. Such a late plea, while to be noted, cannot attract the full mitigation ordinarily afforded by an early admission. The principles governing sentencing credit for guilty pleas were examined extensively in R v. Calvert [2023] EWCA Crim 1123, a case involving similar terrorism offences where the defendant entered a guilty plea only after arraignment and substantial preparatory hearings had taken place. The Court of Appeal sanctioned a modest credit of 15%, emphasising that credit fosters judicial economy but must reflect genuine remorse and an early acceptance of responsibility. Precedents such as R v. Millward [2019] EWCA Crim 2346 also reinforce that tactical plea changes at the last moment, motivated by recognition of an overwhelming case rather than moral reckoning, should be discounted accordingly. In considering the relevant sentencing framework, the court adopts the Terrorism Act Sentencing Council Guidelines updated in 2023, which prescribe a structured assessment of culpability levels, ranging from low to very high, with aggravating and mitigating factors duly considered. The highest culpability tier is characteristically reserved for offenders exhibiting sustained planning, possession of materials with intent to cause mass harm, or demonstrated use of encrypted communications to avoid detection. Relevant case law includes R v. Doran [2021] EWCA Crim 859, which highlights the court’s duty to proportionately reflect public protection imperatives alongside deterrence and rehabilitation objectives. It is instructive also to remember that while the court must sentence based on the particulars of the defendant's conduct, it operates within a wider societal matrix. The normalization of extremist rhetoric on online platforms and the proliferation of digital encryption tools have introduced significant challenges not only to law enforcement but to the judicial process itself. The balance struck herein must be firm yet measured, reflecting the gravity of unlawful endeavour but also recognising the multifaceted nature of radicalisation and risk reduction. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. As the evidence illustrates, Mr H maintained an online presence under multiple pseudonyms, disseminating material supportive of violent extremism. Linguistic and forensic experts provided detailed analysis linking the defendant’s posts to established extremist narratives. The court acknowledges the substantial volume of communication traffic, which persisted despite engagement offers from the West Midlands Prevent Team between 2020 and 2023. These interventions included counselling and mentoring which, while well-intentioned, yielded mixed evidence of behavioural modification. The channel referral process, while operationally robust, remains hampered by resourcing shortfalls and varying levels of community trust. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Technological evidence recovered included encrypted archives labelled cryptically, accessible only via complex passphrases known solely to the defendant. These archives contained manuals on improvised explosive devices and detailed schematics of transport infrastructure vulnerabilities. The defence team sought to assert that the defendant’s interest was academic or speculative, referencing a range of non-extremist engineering texts recovered from the same digital devices. The court finds this submission unconvincing in the totality of contextual evidence, particularly when contrasted with the timing of online activity and possession of associated paraphernalia. In the course of investigation, a minor quantity of cannabis was discovered in the flat shared with Mr H’s roommate. No charge has arisen for this finding, and the court considers it an unremarkable episode in terms of risk or character assessment. It is noted only for completeness and in recognition of counsel’s attempt to humanise the defendant’s profile. The court also acknowledges that Mr H’s landlord had previously been the subject of a regulatory noise abatement order unrelated to the defendant, an enterprise entirely divorced from the matters at hand. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. A careful review of Mr H’s travel record reveals a number of trips taken within the United Kingdom and to EU countries. While some were reportedly for academic conferences and family visits, other journeys, such as a visit to a coastal town in Belgium, attracted additional scrutiny due to the presence of known extremist gatherings. Surveillance indicated Mr H’s attendance at certain locations where radical ideological dissemination is known to occur. The court does not discount the possibility that some travel may have had innocent explanation; however, the temporal proximity to incriminating online activity militates against benign inferences. The defendant’s prior history is sparse. No previous convictions feature on his record. His educational attainment, culminating in an honours degree in computer science, paints a picture of a capable individual who, nonetheless, became overtaken by ideological fixation. Letters of support from voluntary sector groups, including a local environmental charity where Mr H volunteered sporadically, were submitted in mitigation but must be set against the underpinning offence gravity. It is not without irony that the court receives positive accounts from such organisations as the city’s ongoing problem with graffiti on public transport infrastructure remains unresolved, underscoring wider social challenges. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. A notable element of prosecution evidence concerns Mr H’s involvement in procurement attempts for precursor chemicals. Inquiry revealed digital communications with contacts abroad who arrange logistics for dual-use materials, customarily used in agricultural and industrial applications but with known potential misuse. The court has noted submissions regarding the historic case of R v. Calder [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, which dealt with controlling behaviour and coercion in a domestic context and is of tangential relevance here given the differing factual scenario. Nonetheless, the authorities serve to remind the court of the importance of an analytic framework stretched across contexts yet tailored to the particularities of each defendant’s conduct. The court is aware of the pressures faced by probation and mental health services tasked with managing individuals of elevated risk. The overwhelming workload in the West Midlands Probation Trust, exacerbated by staff shortages and budgetary limitations, signifies a systemic challenge. The NHS forensic psychiatric services report prolonged waiting times for assessment, a factor which, while regrettable, has no bearing on culpability but may influence future management recommendations. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations have revealed transactions made via cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, totalling approximately £3,200, involving parties connected to overseas darknet marketplaces. Such exchanges remain an enduring concern for detection, tracing, and prosecution. The court acknowledges the submissions made about the transformative and at times disruptive influence of decentralised finance technology — applications heralded by some as democratizing, but exploited by others to facilitate illicit activity beyond conventional oversight. The legal apparatus must evolve to meet these challenges, a point already emphasised by the Law Commission in its 2024 consultation on financial crime reform. It is of interest — though tangential — that several underground garages in the district of Aston have experienced a recent string of fly-tipping incidents, ranging from the dumping of household waste to hazardous chemical containers. This environmental degradation, while unrelated to the present case, serves as a reminder of the manifold challenges faced by local authorities amidst constrained resources and rising urban blight. The incorporation of such detail here is merely for contextual awareness, not to prejudice sentencing. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant’s psychological evaluation was conducted by Dr Nina Castillo, consultant forensic psychiatrist, instructed by the defence and approved by the court. Her report, submitted on 18 August 2025, detailed Mr H’s mental state and assessed risk potential. Dr Castillo diagnosed a personality profile featuring marked cognitive inflexibility and a tendency for black-and-white moral reasoning, but no formal diagnosis of psychotic disorder or mood illness. The evaluation concluded that Mr H presents a high risk of reoffending in the ideological extremism spectrum if released without enhanced supervision and engagement in de-radicalisation programmes. The letter from the Deliver-It-Forward charity, which provides food parcels and social inclusion activities within the city’s hardship areas, praises the defendant’s punctuality and willingness to help while volunteering over six months. It is a testament to the myriad ways civil society strives to maintain social fabric, even while grappling with the consequences of exclusion and radicalisation. The court records this with a degree of solemn respect. Attention is drawn also to the case of R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, often cited in regard to sentencing credit reduction for late guilty pleas in the context of attempted arson in council housing. While not factually linked to the present matter, its articulation of the principles concerning judicial discretion remains instructive. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. The circumstances here present a sophisticated and premeditated pattern of behaviour. There are aggravating factors including deliberate encryption, possession of potentially destructive devices, procurement networks, and an expressed willingness to imbue operations with symbolic resonance through timing coinciding with anniversaries of prior attacks widely reported in extremist media. Mitigating factors are limited to the absence of prior convictions, educational achievements which may underpin rehabilitative potential, and the defendant’s eventual guilty pleas, albeit late-stage. The court has considered the submissions on behalf of the defendant, who is represented by Mr Jeremy Fox, instructed by the Legal Aid Agency, for whose professionalism the court is grateful. We are mindful of persistent systemic difficulties affecting legal aid availability and case progression, including challenges in securing appropriate expert witnesses at relatively short notice and delays in material disclosure due to existing caseloads. These procedural vicissitudes, while extraneous to culpability, nonetheless impact the administration of justice and, therefore, merit ongoing attention at a policy level. In order to assist this court in arriving at a sentence proportionate both to the offence and to public protection needs, I direct the probation service to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report. This should encompass, inter alia, assessments of Mr H’s prospects for reintegration, potential for engagement with cognitive-behavioural programmes targeting radical thinking patterns, suitability for structured accommodation with restrictive conditions, and the likely effectiveness of any electronic monitoring measures tailored to terrorism risk management. Specialist liaison with the West Midlands Prevent Hub should inform the report, ensuring that existing risk management strategies are coherently considered. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Birmingham.

Mr H Case No. B2025/40987 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge J. V. DUNNING Filed: 2 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence in relation to two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The periods relevant to these offences extend from September 2023 until the defendant’s arrest on 15 January 2025. This case unfolded against a backdrop of heightened national security concerns and the ever-evolving threat posed by ideologically motivated extremism, which, as has often been observed, demands a meticulous approach both in investigation and adjudication. Mr H was arrested in the early morning hours of 15 January 2025 at a residential address in the Kingstanding district of Birmingham. The arrest followed the execution of a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant had been issued on the basis of intelligence obtained chiefly through intercepts authorised by the Secretary of State and corroborated by physical surveillance. At the time of arrest, officers seized a significant quantity of technical manuals, encrypted electronic devices, and components consistent with improvised explosive device (IED) manufacture. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation spanned several months, involving coordination between Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, the Security Service, and digital forensic specialists seconded from the National Cyber Crime Unit. It is notable that the latter's capacity is increasingly taxed, as noted in recent parliamentary assessments, owing to a surge in encrypted messaging use by persons of interest as well as the ever-escalating sophistication of digital concealment techniques. The outlay of public resources in this and similar investigations continues to escalate. This case alone triggered lengthy covert operations, the deployment of approximately twenty officers, and collaboration with experts in chemical and mechanical engineering to assess the nature and potential lethality of the items recovered. The court is mindful of the significant opportunity cost that such concentrations of manpower entail, diverting personnel from investigations into other serious crimes, such as gang-related violence and serial acquisitive offending. As a matter of procedural record, on 9 February 2025, Mr H was remanded in custody following a hearing where bail was refused on the Crown’s submission that conditions necessary to mitigate risk to the public could not be reliably secured. Defence counsel raised concerns about the impact of detention on Mr H's mental well-being and argued for phased bail; however, the court was satisfied that the seriousness of the charges and the risk profile militated strongly against grant. It is important to record the particularly strenuous circumstances faced by the probation service in accommodating such decisions, given well-documented staff shortages and the ongoing pressures on the prison estate. In discussing the conduct of this case, credit is due to the Defence solicitor, Mr Elliott Green, who has, despite the chronic delays and administrative challenges characteristic of the Legal Aid framework, surrendered no ground in ensuring procedural fairness and advocating effectively on behalf of the defendant. It is instructive that this case was subject to several adjournments, not least due to the defendant’s later engagement with expert psychiatric services, necessitating further evaluation and report preparation to assist the court. It bears noting that this court continues to grapple with the administrative inefficiencies observable within the Legal Aid Agency. In particular, the slow authorisation of fees for instructing independent experts in cases of this complexity remains a matter of concern. Mr Green's timely yet ultimately protracted application for the appointment of a forensic psychiatrist was met with a delayed response from the Agency, thereby occasioning delays in listing and, paradoxically, imposing additional stress on the defendant detained pending assessment. The role of multi-agency collaborations in terrorism cases cannot be overstated. The court acknowledges the comprehensive involvement of the Regional Prevent Coordinators and the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 panel. Their joint efforts in identifying risk factors and proposing supervisory arrangements remain a crucial safeguard in the management of individuals convicted of terrorist offences. That said, systemic strains in cross-agency communication and information-sharing protocols have been lamented in several recent oversight reviews. In one highlighted instance, a lack of alignment between healthcare and judicial services led to gaps in mental health monitoring of individuals at risk of radicalisation, which underscores a continuing need for procedural refinement. In assessing cases such as this, the court takes guidance from established authorities that delineate the principles underpinning sentencing for terrorism offences. The seminal decision in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 remains pivotal in underscoring the broad ambit of “terrorist purpose” and the importance of deterrence and public protection as primary objectives. Similarly, the Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed in cases such as R v. Abu Izzadeen [2017] EWCA Crim 2029 and R v. Hafez [2019] EWCA Crim 1230 that preparatory conduct — even absent completion of an attack — holds serious criminal significance. It is helpful, albeit not dispositive, to consider related case law addressing defendants’ mental health profiles and their intersection with culpability. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court held that a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, while relevant, cannot supplant the needs of public protection where high culpability and risk coincide. The case’s combination of repeated arson attacks and evidence of deliberate planning serves as an illustrative precedent on balancing therapeutic considerations with containment. The defendant's defence team has submitted materials referencing R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412, which similarly considers the limits of community-based interventions where repeated non-compliance with treatment programs jeopardizes sustained public safety. Such authorities highlight the court’s duty to scrutinise alleged rehabilitative potential carefully and to resist undue optimism not grounded in empirical engagement. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. This court is presented with evidence that the defendant maintained an online presence under the pseudonym “IronSentinel,” within which he disseminated extremist materials and communicated with known proscribed entities. Linguistic analysis, conducted by a University of Warwick expert commissioned by the Crown, identified patterns of coded language and innuendo consistent with manuals used by proscribed organisations. The covert digital trail traces roughly two years back, with apparent escalation in activity coinciding with cessation of university attendance. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic examination of electronic storage devices recovered during the Defendant’s arrest uncovered multiple encrypted volumes containing manuals on explosive device assembly, surveillance countermeasures, and simulated tactical operations. Some files were incomplete or fragmented, an issue explored in the case of R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 858, but as legal principle clarifies, possession of partial instructions suffices to establish intent when accompanied by corroborative acts. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. Defence submissions have posited that some recovered material may have been stockpiled as part of a hobbyist interest in mechanical engineering and pyrotechnics. Reference was made to a dormant social media account featuring posts about home-made electronics and recreational drone flights. While civilian interest in technology is unexceptional, the timing, quantity, and content of the materials present in this case exceed the bounds of innocent enthusiasm. The court also notes that in the associated police search, a small amount of cannabis resin was found concealed beneath floorboards. This was not charged, however, and defence counsel presented it as indicative of youthful experimentation. The court disclaims the relevance of such findings to the terrorism offences before it, noting only that the presence of unrelated minor infractions is not uncommon but does not mitigate the primary charges. The defendant’s personal history, as documented in psychiatric and probation reports, furnishes a complex picture. Mr H is currently 31 years old, academically qualified to second-level university completion with a background in engineering disciplines. His earlier employment history included internships at a private defence contractor and participation in amateur robotics competitions. An abrupt termination of employment in mid-2023 preceded a marked intensification in his engagement with extremist digital content. Indeed, the allegations draw attention to Mr H’s travel history, which documents a brief trip to Eastern Europe in November 2024. Defence counsel characterises this as tourism; however, the Crown adduces intelligence suggesting contact with persons linked to foreign hostile actors, consistent with the conclusions in multiple analogue cases. Notably, the trip coincided with a disruption to public transport, which delayed his return flight by 48 hours. Historical case law exploring extraterritorial implications provides instructive guidance. For instance, the judgment in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 emphasises the judiciary’s responsibility to impose long custodial sentences to reflect the inherent gravity of attempts even to facilitate overseas terrorism. The instant matter, while domestic in locus, shares many of those aggravating features. A forensic accounting investigation revealed transactions rendered via cryptocurrency exchanges, involving sums approximating £3,200 sent anonymously to accounts linked with the acquisition of dual-use goods. The court deems it necessary to note the growing tensions between emerging financial technologies and the law enforcement imperative to curtail illicit trade, as asserted in the reports of the Financial Conduct Authority's 2024 review. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Correspondence from local housing authorities indicates that Mr H had resided in state-subsidised accommodation for approximately two years prior to his arrest, supported by welfare benefits. Letters from the council cite tenancy compliance as generally satisfactory, save for occasional noise complaints from neighbours, none of which have escalated to formal notices. While such information may not bear on the criminality at hand, it forms part of the overall assessment of social integration and stability. The court acknowledges the support of various voluntary sector organisations working in counter-extremism prevention and reintegration. The Birmingham Resettlement Partnership forwarded reports describing repeated engagement attempts with Mr H during the relevant period, noting intermittent responsiveness. Their documentation reflects a sober appraisal of the challenges faced in promoting disengagement from radical ideological identification. Moreover, it is a matter of public record that cross-agency information sharing protocols are evolving. This case, for example, encountered unavoidable delays due to the Safety and Security Review Board's 2025 reconfiguration of access rights, further compounded by a period of industrial action affecting court listing clerks and administrative staff. Such factors, while extrinsic to the defendant’s culpability, inevitably weigh on timelines and resource allocations. Turning now to the medical and psychological evaluations. Psychiatrist Dr Selina Hargreaves submitted a report dated 18 September 2025, describing Mr H as exhibiting “fixed ideological cognitions characterised by cognitive inflexibility and a dualistic world view.” The report explicitly rules out the presence of an enduring psychotic disorder but flags significant risk factors associated with entrenched extremist belief systems. The assessment highlights the need for intensive therapeutic intervention as part of any custodial sentence. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Dr Hargreaves further advises that disengagement from patterned radical thinking is “unlikely without significant, multidisciplinary input over an extended period.” The report considers various intervention models, including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), noting that while promising, attrition rates among similar individuals are substantial. Probation service risk evaluations align closely with psychiatric assessments, indicating high risk of serious harm in the absence of rigorous constraints and monitoring. The MAPPA multi-agency panel recommends inclusion of exclusion zones, electronic monitoring, and a statutory requirement to attend rehabilitative programmes if released. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. In mitigation, it is accepted that Mr H has no previous convictions, and has offered ultimately a guilty plea, albeit late in the process. This plea was entered on the morning of the sentencing hearing, following the conclusion of a five-day trial during which substantial evidence — including intercepted communications, expert witness testimony, and forensic material analysis — was presented. The court must observe that such late admissions, while welcomed, rank lower in credit comparison to early pleas. Findings in R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440 affirm that the timing and circumstances of a plea inform extent of discount, particularly in complex, high-resource investigations. The trial judge in that case elucidated that credit reflects real efficiency gains and expressions of remorse, not tactical capitulation. Additionally, letters presented on Mr H’s behalf from well-meaning community groups praise his involvement in local environmental cleanup projects and attendance at cultural events. While such civic engagement is commendable, it cannot neutralise or diminish the seriousness of deliberate terrorist preparatory conduct. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The sentencing framework established by the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guidelines for terrorism offences guides judicial discretion towards penalties sufficient to reflect severity, promote deterrence, and ensure protection of the public. Mr H’s offending behaviour, marking premeditation and a sustained effort to acquire means for indiscriminate harm, squarely places him within the most serious category. There is an inevitable tension, familiar to courts, in balancing the need for accountability with the potential for rehabilitation, especially in ideological cases where risk persists post-release. Consideration must be given to eligible sentencing options, including extended determinate sentences with a provision for licence conditions supplemented by multi-agency oversight. The court awaits detailed advice from probation to assist in formulating such arrangements. In closing, I acknowledge the continued dedication of all those involved in the management of cases of this nature. The capacity of community mental health teams, forensic specialists, and counter-terrorism policing units to work in concert under extraordinary pressure exemplifies the resilience of the public protection system. I also commend the court clerks and ushers of Birmingham Crown Court, who have managed the logistical demands of a congested list, including unexpected interpreter service shortages and occasional technical failures in digital evidence presentation. This hearing has followed a protracted path to resolution. Initial listing occurred on 5 March 2025, with several adjournments thanks to requests for further disclosure from the prosecution and extensions sought by the defence to engage expert witness services. The court has, throughout, endeavoured to expedite proceedings, mindful of the need to balance efficient administration with fairness. The sentencing hearing today has been conducted in open court, with all parties professionally represented. I record my thanks to Ms Nadia Connors of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter-Terrorism Division for her thorough submissions and to Mr Elliott Green for his considered and conscientious advocacy on behalf of Mr H. I now reserve sentence. A comprehensive pre-sentence report shall be commissioned, focusing on the defendant’s risk of reoffending, suitability for rehabilitative interventions, mental health needs, and appropriate community management arrangements post-release. That report is to be prepared by the West Midlands Probation Service and submitted within six weeks. The court requests that it reflect the full range of risk-reducing strategies available and consider custodial as well as community-based modalities. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 2 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, with a formal record of conviction and sentence to be forwarded to the relevant authorities for registration and enforcement purposes.

Mr H Case No. B2025/27439 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. MONTGOMERY Filed: 3 September 2025 Mr H appears before the court today to be sentenced on charges brought under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and a further count under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism. These charges relate to conduct alleged to have taken place from late 2022 until his arrest on 19 March 2025. The court acknowledges at the outset the gravity inherent in cases of this nature and the considerable demands they place upon multiple agencies, including Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, forensic analysts, and the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division. The procedural history in this matter has been punctuated by a number of hearing adjournments arising partly from the complexity of disclosure and partly due to pre-trial applications concerning evidentiary rulings. Mr H was arrested at approximately 04:50 hours on 19 March 2025 at his residence in Dudley Road following the execution of a search warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant was supported by intelligence gathered over a two-month period, involving covert surveillance, electronic intercepts, and an extensive cyber forensic examination conducted by the National Technical Analysis Unit. During his arrest, officers seized multiple items, including encrypted digital storage devices, a computer hard drive, and handwritten notes. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Prior to his arrest, Mr H had been under observation following a Prevent referral made in 2021 by a lecturer at the Midlands Institute of Technology. The referral originated after concerns were raised regarding his engagement with literature endorsing violent extremism. The panel overseeing the referral concluded that the necessary threshold for a Channel intervention programme was not met, owing largely to Mr H’s inconsistent cooperation and an assessment that the risk was moderate and context-specific. This panel’s decision reflects the difficulties inherent in balancing early intervention with the protection of civil liberties—a tension frequently noted in academic literature concerning counter-terrorism strategies. In advance of the current proceedings, the case was assigned to the Birmingham Crown Court pursuant to the usual allocation procedures under the Better Case Management guidelines. The court notes the efficiency with which the initial listing for plea and trial preparation was arranged on 3 June 2025. The listing process is a testament to the judiciary’s ongoing efforts, notwithstanding pressures from recent industrial actions affecting court staff nationally, which have severely impacted operational capacity in the past 18 months. It should also be recorded that the Legal Aid Agency was slow to authorise the defence’s application for expert psychiatric reports, with the authority only granted after several weeks despite multiple urgent requests. Such delays serve as a reminder of the continuing administrative challenges faced by defence solicitors in securing timely expert evidence—a factor with significant implications for defendants’ rights to a fair trial. The plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 6 August 2025. Initially, Mr H plead not guilty to all counts. However, a change of plea to guilty was entered on the morning of sentencing, 3 September 2025. The court reiterates the principle that credit for pleas is reserved for those made at the earliest appropriate time, and that a plea entered at a late stage, while of course better than a contested trial, will attract limited mitigation. In this regard, the court directs attention to the leading authority of R v. Jamison [2024] EWCA Crim 1658, wherein the Court of Appeal emphasised that late pleas entered only after the prosecution case has been fully marshalled and disclosure exhausted must be credited appropriately, but not generously. That case concerned a series of serious offences, including aggravated burglary and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, where the appellant only pleaded guilty on the morning of trial following the admission of significant forensic evidence. The judgment makes clear the limited nature of credit in such circumstances, reinforcing public confidence in the sentencing process and acknowledging the considerable court and witness time expended. Further context is derived from R v. Hargreaves [2023] EWCA Crim 1345, a case that explored the interplay between late guilty pleas and prior non-disclosure of defence grounds, affirming a sentencing discount of 15% where the plea was essentially tactical rather than spontaneous or remorseful. The principles elucidated in Hargreaves speak directly to the present case. In respect of sentence, the court is mindful of the Sentencing Council’s terrorism guidelines updated in 2023, which direct attention to five key parameters: the seriousness of the offence and culpability; the risk of harm posed both in commission and prospectively; the level of planning and sophistication; the extent of any remorse or cooperation; and the defendant’s personal circumstances, including previous convictions or absence thereof. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The evidence demonstrates that Mr H cultivated a digital footprint over three years, initially through benign interests in mechanical repairs and electronics, which evolved into curated engagement with extremist propaganda. Linguistic experts called at trial confirmed marked shifts in tone and content consistent with known indoctrination pathways identified by the Security Service. Notably, Mr H’s social media postings increasingly reflected support for violent jihadist ideologies, including praise for proscribed organisations. It is perhaps pertinent to observe that forensic analysis uncovered a series of encrypted “dead-drop” messages in which Mr H shared operational manuals concerning improvised explosive devices. While these were incomplete, their advanced technical detail and accompanying discussions on concealment techniques bespeak a high level of premeditation and dangerous intent. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defendant attempted to counter this narrative by citing a personal interest in pyrotechnics as a hobby, though the court finds such explanations unconvincing in light of the evidence concerning the quantity and nature of materials recovered. Defence submissions also sought to draw a distinction between possession of such manuals for academic interest and possession with further intent. However, as the Court of Appeal highlighted in R v. Bakari [2022] EWCA Crim 1652, the context and associated conduct are determinative; mere possession in isolation may not suffice to prove intent, but when combined with other actions, intent is properly to be inferred. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. It is necessary, for completeness, to mention that during the investigation unrelated to this matter, a co-defendant charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery was also arrested. It should be clear that co-defendant’s offences, while serious, are not attributable to the current defendant and have no bearing upon the present sentencing exercise, except insofar as they occasion procedural complexity. The court notes with some regret the increased prevalence of such overlapping cases, which place strain on police resources and contribute to incremental delays in listing and trial preparation. The case file further includes references to a historic conviction of Mr H’s brother, who faced charges in 2019 for burglary in the West Midlands but is now fully rehabilitated and not involved in the current charges. Such familial connections cannot provide mitigation or aggravation but are relevant only in the context of information disclosed by the defence for a fuller picture of personal background. The court has also considered correspondence from community support groups, notably the Bridgewater Youth Trust and the Dudley Neighbourhood Rehabilitation Centre. Both organisations commend Mr H’s prior involvement in community gardening and outreach programmes between 2016 and 2018. Although such civic engagement is laudable, it affords only modest mitigation in the context of offences of this serious nature. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. It emerged from trial evidence that Mr H travelled to Brussels in March 2024 on what he described as a “technical training conference.” Records from flight manifest and accommodation bookings indicate he attended meetings that included individuals later linked with proscribed entities. Surveillance evidence also shows Mr H in communication with persons of interest in the international counter-terrorism community. In the same vein, the court references a 2017 case, R v. Newbury [2017] EWCA Crim 2247, involving cross-border travel connected to logistics for extremist networks. While the factual circumstances differ considerably, the principles concerning travel as a factor indicative of planning and complicity form part of this court’s approach to culpability assessment. The prosecution’s disclosure obligations here extended to over 650 exhibits and numerous digital forensic reports. The court acknowledges the exhaustive work of disclosure officers and the increasing technical challenges faced by the judiciary in managing voluminous electronic data. Of relevance is the growing workload burden on specialist personnel dealing with modern criminal evidence. For example, in 2024 the National Crime Digital Forensics Unit reported an average case backlog increase of 27% compared to the previous year, with counter-terrorism cases contributing significantly to demand. Such systemic pressures are well documented in the Home Office’s 2025 report on Digital Evidence Handling. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations revealed that Mr H executed multiple cryptocurrency transactions utilizing privacy-focused protocols, including tumblers and coin mixers, obscuring the origins and destinations of transfers. One particularly concerning exchange involved £4,000 worth of Bitcoin sent to an address linked to an overseas darknet market known for weapons components. The court observes the ongoing challenges posed by cryptocurrency-enabled crime. As noted by the Law Commission in their 2023 report on economic crime prevention, anonymity features of such currencies present acute difficulties for both investigation and legal proof. Judges are increasingly called upon to consider the implications of these technologies not only in sentence but in risk management orders. The court has reviewed surveillance logs which include footage of Mr H’s late-night activity in industrial areas, correlating with storage facilities rented under an alias. While the period of surveillance extended to several weeks, the analysis required painstaking synchronization of disparate camera feeds with mobile network data — an exercise testament to the resource intensity of contemporary policing. It is worth recording that these investigations necessitate not only technological acumen but considerable human expertise to interpret ambiguous data streams. This is no straightforward “big brother” scenario; rather, it is a highly labour-intensive process involving repeated calibration and analysis. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to Mr H’s personal and psychological profile. He is 31 years of age, educated to university level with a degree in electrical engineering from a Midlands university. Until mid-2023, he was employed as a systems analyst for a regional telecommunications firm. His employment ended abruptly following his refusal to submit to a security vetting process. The court has considered letters submitted in mitigation from former employers and community organisations. Notably, a manager at Telra Communications describes Mr H as “intelligent, reliable, yet prone to social withdrawal.” Volunteer coordinators from the Dudley Community Centre remark on his punctuality but highlight erratic attendance in recent months. Such evidence, while informative about character, does little to mitigate the risk posed by the charges. It is a matter for consideration whether the loss of employment and social isolation may have played a role in the defendant’s increasing radicalisation. The forensic psychiatric report provided by Dr Charles Wentworth, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Grimley Secure Unit, is detailed and professionally authored. It finds no formal psychotic or affective disorder but notes “a pronounced cognitive rigidity” and describes Mr H’s belief system as “characterised by absolutist thinking and a preoccupation with ideological purity.” A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. Dr Wentworth’s assessment concludes that the defendant poses a high risk of serious harm, particularly concerning further ideological involvement without strict supervision. While participation in structured disengagement programmes, such as the Counter-Terrorism Desistance and Disengagement Initiative (CTDDI), is recommended, the prognosis is guarded given the defendant’s prior partial engagement and lack of expressed remorse. The court is cognisant of the wider societal implications of sentencing decisions in terrorism cases. Submissions from the West Midlands Islamic Forum urge caution against disproportionate penalties that might fuel resentment or alienation within minority communities. The court respects these concerns but remains resolute that the paramount consideration is the protection of the public and deterrence of extremist conduct. It is noted that the engagement of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 panel has been robust, involving oversight from probation, health services, and specialist counter-terrorism units. Proposals include layered risk management plans encompassing electronic monitoring, specified exclusion zones, and regular psychological evaluation. On balance, the court regards this case as falling within the higher end of culpability given the demonstrated sophistication, planning, and purpose of the offences. There are aggravating factors including the nature and extent of the preparation, the intended indiscriminate harm, and the defendant’s technical proficiency. Mitigating features remain limited. Besides his lack of previous convictions and educational attainment, the late plea affords only modest credit. The court must give greater weight to public protection and denunciation. The preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report is hereby directed, with specific instructions that offenders’ risk, the likely effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes, including cognitive behavioural interventions tailored to violent extremism, and possible licence conditions, be thoroughly examined.

Mr H Case No. S2025/24319 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. L. MONTGOMERY Filed: 11 October 2025 Mr H appears before this tribunal for sentence after conviction by a jury on two counts pursuant to sections 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, relating to engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, involving possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The offending conduct is alleged to have occurred between September 2023 and the defendant’s arrest in April 2025. It is necessary at the outset to acknowledge the competent and diligent efforts of the prosecuting counsel, Ms Clara Sutherland, and the defence representative, Mr Julian Rex, both of whom have engaged the court with careful and measured submissions throughout the pre-trial, trial, and sentencing phases. The case was listed originally before this court several times; the initial hearing took place on 14 May 2025, but due to complex disclosure requirements and Liberty Legal Aid delays, the plea and trial preparation hearing was adjourned, ultimately concluding on 17 September 2025. The protracted timeline reflects, at least in part, the significant volume of digital evidence and national security considerations embroiled in this prosecution. The court also wishes to place on record appreciation for the support services attending to the victims identified in this matter. Though the conviction pertains to preparatory conduct and possession offences, the resultant anxiety and distress experienced by communities in Sheffield and surrounding areas necessitated a comprehensive support response from local authorities, including Sheffield Victim Support and Restorative Justice facilitators. The many volunteers and paid professionals in these organisations have contributed tirelessly, often under significant pressure, to provide reassurance and outreach. Their service in this regard is commendable. The defendant was arrested promptly on 18 April 2025 pursuant to multiple warrants enacted by Counter Terrorism Policing North Midlands. The evidence underpinning the warrants derived from months of covert surveillance, including real-time electronic intercepts and thorough forensic examination of seized equipment. Digital forensic teams faced substantial challenges due to strong encryption protocols employed by the defendant, necessitating collaboration between national and regional cyber units. The investigative aircraft deployed included drones operating with facial recognition overlays and AI pattern recognition to monitor movement patterns linked to Mr H. Such operations, though resource-intensive, have become indispensable in the contemporary security environment. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The proceedings have unfolded against a background of considerable procedural complexity. This court notes, without criticism, that the Legal Aid Agency’s administration of authorisations for expert instruction has, regrettably, at times slowed defence preparation in this instance. Mr Rex’s applications for external psychiatric input encountered several bureaucratic delays, with authorisation granted only after protracted correspondence spanning over four weeks. It should be observed that such delays are emblematic of systemic resource constraints rather than individual failures. Nevertheless, the impact on the expediency of justice is not trivial and warrants ongoing attention from Government departments charged with defending due process. Turning to the ambit of case law relevant to these particular offences, the court recalls the authoritative guidance of R v. Clarke [2019] EWCA Crim 782, a decision clarifying that preparation for terrorism requires evidence of intent beyond mere association or ideological sympathy. Clarke enshrined the principle that factual circumstances must demonstrate a demonstrable step towards actualisation of the intended acts. Conversely, R v. Kamara [2021] EWCA Crim 65 reaffirmed the breadth of conduct capable of constituting an offence under section 5, highlighting the need to consider preparatory activities collectively rather than in isolated fragments. These authorities provide the legal framework underpinning sentencing discretion in the present matter. In recent times, the procedural apparatus within Crown Courts dealing with terrorism offences has evolved in notable ways. Since the inception of the “Better Case Management” protocol in 2017, courts have been encouraged to expedite the listing of hearings within strict timelines to mitigate the risk of prolonged pre-trial delay that could impact witness recollection and evidential integrity. The current case bears witness to this effort, having moved from initial arrest through to trial within 30 months—somewhat consistent with national averages, though longer than the aspirational 18-month target. Achieving this has entailed collaborative scheduling and exceptional work by court officers, advocates, forensic teams, and witnesses alike. Concurrently, the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 framework has been invoked, necessitating inter-agency engagement involving Probation Services, CT Policing, the local NHS Secure Forensic Unit, and Sheffield City Council’s Risk and Safeguarding Panel. Over the course of the defendant’s remand, MAPPA meetings progressed monthly, aiming to evaluate risk factors, monitor behavioural changes, and plan for eventual release conditions. These meetings have been characterised by thorough information-sharing and documented in detailed minutes, despite pressures stemming from increasing caseloads with limited staffing. This court notes the difficult balancing act required and commends the professionalism of those involved. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Within the corpus of digital evidence, forensic linguists provided a detailed report examining the defendant’s use of encrypted social media and private messaging platforms. This report highlighted patterns of rhetoric mirroring that used by proscribed organisations, along with references to well-known propaganda texts. The linguistic features identified were consistent with deliberate radicalisation efforts, designed to recruit and indoctrinate sympathisers. Nonetheless, defence submissions posited these were “academic exercises” unrelated to practical engagement, a contention rejected by the jury. Amid these considerations, it is pertinent to observe that Mr H’s case also involves what some might term an unusual adjunct: the forensic analysis of homemade botanical extracts recovered from the defendant’s premises. An elderflower wine found in a shared kitchen was chemically analysed, but experts confirmed it contained no illicit substances nor was it weaponised in any way. This evidence was tendered by the defence to suggest normalcy in the defendant’s lifestyle. Such points, while noted, carry inconsequential weight. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defendant maintained a plea of not guilty throughout much of the proceedings. He elected to enter guilty pleas only on the morning of the third day of trial, shortly after testimony from a counter-terrorism financial specialist. The timing of this admission necessarily restricts credit for mitigation. The Court of Appeal in R v. Ford [2021] EWCA Crim 1332 exemplifies the principle that late pleas—especially those entered immediately prior to critical Crown evidence—do not merit significant leniency. Ford concerned a case of armed robbery with prolonged trial preparation, where the defendant changed his plea one hour before the prosecution’s closing submissions, resulting in a mere five percent discount. Indeed, the cumulative burden on public resources occasioned by late pleas extends beyond the courtroom. Court listings become protracted, witnesses often require repeated reassurance and scheduling changes, and psychological strain on victims escalates. This is a matter of systemic concern, particularly amid rising workloads and court pressures nationally. A further instructive case is R v. Mason [2022] EWCA Crim 844, involving the possession of explosive materials with intent. Mason pleaded guilty at an early stage, resulting in a 20% reduction. The contrast with the present matter is stark. Despite comparable offences in seriousness, timing of plea remains a critical factor in sentencing discretion. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The digital forensic teams which operated over the course of this investigation deserve particular commendation for their technical acumen and perseverance amid resource shortages. Units tasked with decrypting hard drives encrypted by bespoke kernels and virtual machines frequently work in environments of immense pressure. This includes the cutting-edge Cyber Defence Centre at the National Crime Agency, where skilled analysts develop bespoke decryption tools with limited time and overwhelming caseloads. Alongside this, the Human Rights Watchdog Group has expressed concern about potential overreach in surveillance activities, petitioning Parliament for increased transparency. While such concerns merit academic debate, they do not diminish the need for effective intervention when credible threats emerge. The law properly balances liberty and security, and this court respects that equilibrium. Of tangential note, this jurisdiction suffered considerable administrative disruption during the trial period, including two days of strike action by court ushers, which hampered the swifter listing of hearings. The court's layout was refurbished only recently, with updated digital screens now replacing static notices, a detail which perhaps comforts those accustomed to archaic display methods but bears no direct impact on this sentencing. The defendant’s personal history was scrutinised extensively. Mr H is aged 31 and holds a master’s degree in applied physics. Prior to his arrest, he was employed for three years as a laboratory technician at a local engineering firm. It is recorded that employment ceased abruptly in August 2023, coinciding with heightened ideological activity. Letters from former employers and colleagues describe Mr H as intelligent but “reserved and socially withdrawn.” A letter from his landlord states that the property was generally well-maintained, though the defendant was sometimes late with rental payments. Curiously, unrelated to this matter, the landlord had recently been subjected to a noise abatement notice due to a neighbouring tenant’s loud music—a fact tangential and not relevant to sentencing. The Probation Service’s pre-sentence report raises some concerns about the adequacy of Mr H’s social support network. It notes that while he retains contact with his elder sister who resides abroad, local friendships appear limited and predominantly confined to online forums of an extremist nature. The report also highlights issues with digital addiction, including habitual late-night internet use. A psychiatric report from Dr Alice Carmichael, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Sheffield Secure Unit, was submitted on behalf of the defendant. Dr Carmichael concludes that while Mr H displays “rigid cognitive patterns and elevated levels of distrust,” he does not meet criteria for a mental disorder which might impair culpability. The report carefully assesses risk factors and recommends intensive monitoring post-release, in conjunction with ideological disengagement programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). The completion rates and long-term efficacy of DDP, however, remain mixed, as evident from recently published statistics by the National Institute for Security Rehabilitation (NISR). Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. It is worth reiterating that counter-terrorism efforts intrinsically impose heavy workload demands on investigative teams, forensic experts, and multi-agency collaborators. For instance, Local Authority Community Safety Officers in Sheffield report increasing frequency of “low-yield” referrals during this period, which nonetheless strain limited resources. Public Health England data demonstrates a significant upsurge in urban homelessness as of 2024 — a phenomenon which the probation and social services note compounds the complexity of effective supervision in cases involving ideological extremism. Addressing homelessness, mental health supports, and addiction accordingly remains a shared priority. This observation dovetails with the concerns expressed by the Sheffield Assault Victims' Coalition in their victim impact statements, which were submitted to this court in advance and which described the pervasive climate of fear engendered by ideological extremism in the community. While the victims in this case suffered no physical harm, the psychological toll is not to be dismissed. Reference must also be made to a co-defendant initially charged alongside Mr H, who absconded prior to trial and remains at large. This individual’s conduct included offences such as affray involving pool cues and possession of a bladed article within school premises — matters that, while serious in their own right, bear no connection to Mr H’s conduct. The outstanding status of this co-defendant underlines the broader challenge of multi-actor investigations in the counter-terrorism domain. The court further notes the evidence of a third-party relative, a cousin of Mr H, currently under investigation for alleged benefit fraud. No link between this individual and the charges before the court has been established, and the association is noted purely for completeness. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial examination revealed that Mr H conducted a series of cryptocurrency transactions associated with online marketplaces known to facilitate the sale of dual-use components. A forensic accountant detailed a transfer of approximately £3,100 in Bitcoin through multiple mixers, complicating traceability. Cryptocurrencies as a medium for illicit exchanges represent an increasing concern for law enforcement and regulatory bodies worldwide. It is observed that cryptocurrency tumblers, while promoted by some as tools for financial privacy and autonomy, have become instruments of obfuscation employed by criminals to shield transactions from detection. This court echoes the observations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on the risks posed by decentralized finance in national security contexts. Less pertinently, the court was provided with a report documenting street-level incidents of graffiti on public transport infrastructure within Sheffield during the spring of 2025. While the imagery contained politically charged messages, no direct nexus to Mr H has been established. Nonetheless, such acts contribute to public anxieties and represent a challenge for urban law enforcement agencies. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H’s personal narrative is presented against a backdrop of intellectual sophistication and unsettling ideological fixation. His academic credentials, including doctoral candidacy in applied physics interrupted in late 2023, attest to a role as a potential “self-starter extremist,” as described in recent counter-terrorism studies. Letters from the Eastwood Bridge Gardening Collective commend his volunteer efforts in urban green space rehabilitation; these laudable activities coexist uneasily with the extremism underpinning his offending. Careful assessment of his psychological profile reveals a proclivity towards binary moralistic frameworks, supporting a view that his radicalisation derives from cognitive rigidity rather than organic psychiatric disease. Structured professional judgement instruments such as HCR-20 have been applied to aid in risk formulation. This risk is compounded by evidence of persistence in seeking encrypted communications post-arrest, indicating ongoing ideological engagement. The court also received correspondence from the South Beech Food Collective, which operates within Mr H’s former locality. This organisation reported persistent efforts to engage Mr H post-remand, offering support through community integration frameworks. Although participation was minimal, the group reflects a broader desire within civil society to contribute constructively to de-radicalisation pathways. Their continued involvement despite local hostility and graffiti attacks on their premises merits recognition. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. In conclusion, this case represents a grave and multifaceted breach of the public trust and peace. The defendant’s conduct exhibits a high degree of culpability — encompassing careful planning, utilisation of encrypted communications, and procurement of materials with potential for harm. The sophistication and scale of preparation warrants significant custodial consequences. Mitigating features are scarce and primarily confined to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, an educational background indicating potential for rehabilitation, and the late acceptance of responsibility. Those factors, while acknowledged, cannot substantially diminish the imperative of deterrence and public protection paramount in terrorism-related sentencing. The court hereby directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The Probation Service must provide detailed recommendations regarding the prospect of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, coupled with conditions incorporating GPS monitoring, managed internet access, and mandatory engagement with specialised deradicalisation programmes. The report should critically evaluate the feasibility of placement within an approved premises environment equipped to manage high-risk individuals, and the availability of accredited forensic psychology services for ongoing structured professional judgement assessment. The forensic psychiatric opinion and the evolving risk landscape require careful balancing in formulating post-sentence management. The court underscores that any such rehabilitative endeavour must be coupled with robust enforcement tailored to the realities of contemporary extremist threats. Sentencing remarks are recorded this 11th day of October 2025 in Court 4 at Sheffield Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5.

J. ARMITAGE Filed: 18 August 2025 The defendant, Mr H, appears before this court for sentence on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct admitted spans the period from early 2023 through to the defendant’s arrest in March 2025. Mr H’s case proceeded through a number of procedural stages, including several adjournments prompted by complex disclosure schedules and challenges associated with the compilation of expert witness statements. The court is cognizant of the pressures facing both prosecution and defence teams within the counter-terrorism jurisdiction, particularly in relation to the collation of voluminous electronic evidence and the necessity of balancing the open justice principle against national security concerns. It is appropriate at this juncture to acknowledge the continued difficulties experienced by the Legal Aid Agency in authorising sufficient preparation time in matters of such complexity. Defence counsel, Mr P. K. Choudhury, manifested remarkable perseverance in securing adequate funding for the engagement of a qualified forensic expert and a practising forensic psychologist—requests initially met with procedural delays and a degree of administrative opacity. Such delays, while regrettable, have not caused substantive injustice but do serve as a reminder of the systemic challenges within legal aid budgeting and its consequences upon the efficient administration of justice. This court further recognises the efforts of multi-agency groups operating under MAPPA Category 3 supervision which have been engaged in reviewing Mr H’s risk profile in the period prior to his conviction. This involves representatives from the West Country Probation Service, Counter Terrorism Policing South West, NHS Forensic Mental Health Services, and the Local Authority’s Risk Management Unit. The coordination and communication between these agencies should not be understated given often fragmentary resourcing and competing operational priorities. Prior to the proceedings, a referral to the Prevent programme was lodged by a university lecturer in October 2021, following concerns raised about Mr H’s increasingly politicised social media activity and apparent contact with individuals of concern. Despite efforts by the local Channel panel over the subsequent nine months, the extent of the defendant's ideological entrenchment and unwillingness to engage meaningfully with intervention measures rendered prophylactic efforts ineffectual. These observations set a context for understanding the defendant’s later conduct, although the purpose of this sentencing hearing is to address the evidence now proven beyond reasonable doubt. Mr H was arrested on 12 March 2025 during a planned operation by Counter Terrorism Policing South West that included coordinated raids across multiple addresses linked to an associated network. The warrants, executed with precision and without incident, resulted in the seizure of several devices—desktops, laptops, encrypted storage media—and chemical precursors consistent with explosives manufacturing, in addition to extremist literature. This followed an intense period of surveillance and digital forensic examination lasting approximately seven months. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It is necessary to place the investigative efforts which culminated in Mr H’s arrest within their broader operational context. These efforts involved coordination between counter-terrorism officers, forensic computing units, and external specialist agencies, including the National Cyber Crime Unit. It should be emphasised that the complexity of Mr H’s digital footprint—characterised by use of the Tor network, multiple anonymous email accounts, and encrypted messaging services employing ephemeral message deletion parameters—made the task of electronic retrieval exceptionally labour-intensive. The process exposed the limitations of current forensic tools when confronted with layered encryption and plausible deniability techniques increasingly employed by offenders. An unrelated case provides some procedural contrast. In R v. Threlfall [2019] EWCA Crim 1745, the Court commented on the difficulties experienced in decoding encrypted repositories containing child sexual exploitation material, underscoring the necessity of ongoing investment in digital investigatory resources across national law enforcement bodies. The court also notes the ongoing pressures upon probation service caseloads, which have witnessed an upwards surge in community supervision orders for offenders exhibiting grievances susceptible to extremist exploitation. The capacity of such services to deliver targeted interventions remains constrained by workforce shortages, as referenced in the Ministry of Justice’s annual workforce report 2024, which highlighted a shortfall of approximately 20% of required field officers in the South West region. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. The analysis of Mr H’s electronic devices revealed a deliberate and methodical effort at procurement of dual-use materials capable of assembly into devices with lethal potential. In particular, files recovered included detailed breakdowns of chemical synthesising processes and instructions for the modification of mechanical timers to serve as detonators. These materials were not inchoate curiosities but accompanied by operational planning documents referencing specific target locations and timelines. Such evidence establishes a narrative of preparation and intent well beyond mere theoretical exploration. In hermeneutic terms, the defendant’s social media posts trace a trajectory from initial political indignation to radical justification of violence, evincing a progression consistent with models of escalating extremism described in the Home Office’s Prevent Duty Guidance 2023. While innocence in academic debate on political matters is protected, the incitement or facilitation of violence is not, and this court must apply the law as enacted. The jury, after deliberation, returned unanimous guilty verdicts on all counts. The defendant’s conduct cannot be disaggregated from these outcomes. The court also acknowledges the courage of the witnesses who testified in person or via videolink, many of whom displayed considerable measured restraint under testing circumstances. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The forensic examination produced additional exhibits, including encrypted archives bearing appellations suggesting plausible innocuousness—such as “GardenPlans” and “HolidayRecipes”—which upon decryption uncovered inflammatory propaganda and manuals on bomb construction. The defence argued that some material was accessed only cursorily or without full comprehension, referencing evidence from Mr H’s internet usage logs. However, as held in R v. Skelton [2018] EWCA Crim 626, knowledge may be inferred from proximity and the nature of associated conduct, rather than direct proof of engagement with every contested file. It is regrettable that disputes as to the technical nature of evidence delayed proceedings, notably the prolonged deliberations regarding the admissibility of derivative digital content collected under warrants processed in multiple jurisdictions. Such procedural complexities are endemic in modern terrorism prosecutions and illustrate the evolving nature of legal standards confronting the judiciary. A lesser-known facet of this case relates to a co-defendant prosecuted alongside Mr H, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to import controlled substances via parcel freight. This individual’s offending, while related in disruption operations, bears no factual or legal linkage to Mr H’s charges. It is appropriate to distinguish their conduct definitively to avoid any conflation in assessment of culpability. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The court must address the defendant’s ancillary circumstances without undue excursion. It is recorded that a previous conviction from 2015 for aggravated assault, amounting to grievous bodily harm during a street altercation, was offered in evidence but holds no direct connection to current offences. Nonetheless, its existence informs the defendant’s criminal history and contributes to an assessment of character. Housing conditions experienced by Mr H during remand were the subject of correspondence from the South Bristol Homelessness Action Network. It appears Mr H faced accommodation instability preceding arrest, a factor routinely considered in terms of social vulnerability but not of direct mitigation concerning offence seriousness. The court also notes the recommendation from voluntary sector agencies that peer mentorship might accompany eventual supervised release, reflecting the multi-dimensional challenges faced by individuals engaged in deradicalisation pathways. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. Travel history included destination points of interest to investigative teams. Of note was a journey to a European capital in late 2023, ostensibly for “academic conference attendance” but marked by surveillance indicating meetings with individuals later identified as affiliated with proscribed organisations. Such associations are factually significant given evidence of subsequent encrypted communication and logistical exchanges. The court recognises, however, that mere travel outside the jurisdiction, without more, does not establish wrongdoing. The evidentiary material demanded over 900 exhibits be uploaded to an electronic court bundle, itself a feat imposed on court administration already stretched by chronic clerical staff shortages. The aggregation of footage, interview transcripts, and expert statements consumed considerable time and material resources. R v. Dwyer [2021] EWCA Crim 1013, cited by the defence, addressed the issue of late disclosure in a drug importation case where evidence had been mishandled, causing trial delays. The court observed that despite procedural irritation, the interests of justice necessitated comprehensive disclosure to prevent miscarriages. Such principles equally apply in terrorism prosecutions given their stakes. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation uncovered cryptocurrency transactions correlating with online marketplace purchases from vendors known to supply dual-use components. The financial trail delineated a network employing mixers and layered transaction routes designed to frustrate traceability. This highlights the increasingly sophisticated adaptation of terrorist offenders to technological and regulatory countermeasures. It is incumbent on judicial authorities to understand the implications, as failure to respond risks allowing illicit financing to proliferate. More than a dozen hours of covert surveillance footage required enhancement and analysis before identification of Mr H at various locations, including a river embankment parking lot and a suburban workshop. The painstaking nature of this task, involving frame-by-frame analysis and synchronization with digital geolocation signals, exemplifies the resource imbalance often present in combating asymmetric criminal threats. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding personal background, Mr H is 30 years old and holds an honours degree in applied physics from a university in the South West. Employment history includes a two-year tenure at a precision engineering firm, concluded abruptly following disciplinary proceedings linked to breaches of employer IT policy. Character references describe him as “meticulous” though “inwardly reserved,” with an interest in amateur photography and model aeronautics. Letters tendered from local community groups, including the Bristol Volunteer Network and a youth engagement programme, express hope for rehabilitation and stress the defendant’s previous contributions in mentoring younger volunteers. While such engagement merits recognition, it cannot outweigh the gravity of the offences adjudicated. The court draws from these references no positive conclusion that diminishes the danger posed. Two unrelated charges remain outstanding against a party associated with Mr H’s former flatmate, pertaining to noise complaints and possession of a bladed article. These matters bear no relation to the present proceedings. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Assessments from forensic psychologists have concluded that Mr H does not meet criteria for any formal psychiatric diagnosis but evidences entrenched cognitive rigidity and ideological inflexibility likely to contribute to ongoing risk of extremist re-engagement. Structured intervention programmes, including the empirically supported Desistance and Disengagement Programme, have been discussed by defence counsel as potential mitigants. The court notes, however, that these schemes have documented attrition rates and their efficacy remains contingent upon intensive supervision post-custody. The sentencing guidelines pertinent to cases under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 mandate consideration of levels of culpability, sophistication, and public risk. The offences committed fall within the highest culpability category given the planning and procurement phases demonstrated. The notional starting points and ranges suggested by the Sentencing Council reflect sentences commensurate with serious harm potential, requiring deterrence and public protection to be the paramount considerations. Aggravating features in this case include the nexus to public venues with high civilian footfall, the timing of preparatory acts coincident with prior terror anniversaries, and the defendant’s deliberate attempts to frustrate detection through encryption and operational security measures. Mitigation is limited and primarily associated with lack of prior terrorism convictions and remorse expressed only at a late stage in proceedings. Baseline sentencing will await the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. This should address not only the offender’s risk but practical issues around post-release supervision, the suitability and availability of enhanced monitoring, engagement with mental health services, and accommodation stability. This court expresses gratitude for the robust submissions provided by Ms Amina Rashid representing the Crown, and by Mr P. K. Choudhury for the defence. The professionalism of all counsel has contributed materially to the efficient conduct of proceedings and the maintenance of procedural fairness. The court also acknowledges the efforts of the Bristol City Council Housing Department, who have liaised with the Probation Service in anticipation of the defendant’s potential housing needs, and commend the commitment of the West Country Prevent Hub who maintained contact with Mr H throughout investigations, despite intermittent engagement and noted resource constraints. Today's sentencing remarks conclude the preliminary phase. The formal imposition of sentence awaits receipt and consideration of the probation report. This hearing has been conducted in open court. The layout of Courtroom 5, having been refurbished in summer 2024 with improved technology for digital evidence display, facilitated efficient presentation of voluminous materials. The defendant and all parties are reminded of the defendant’s right of appeal under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, with time for notice running from the date sentence is passed. There are no reporting restrictions ordered under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 applicable here. Costs and ancillary matters remain reserved. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 18 August 2025, in Courtroom 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol and are recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

CALDWELL Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court today to be sentenced on his conviction for one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, in breach of section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is alleged to have occurred over the period from October 2023 until the date of his arrest in April 2025. The defendant was initially identified as a person of interest following an intelligence report received by Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) in November 2023. This report originated from signals intelligence provided by the Security Service, which identified communications encrypted using a platform widely used by proscribed organisations. Mr H was under covert surveillance for several months, with investigators employing a range of tactics including the deployment of technical interception, pattern of life monitoring, and forensic analysis of digital devices seized pursuant to judicial warrants. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The arrest of Mr H was effected in the early hours of 14 April 2025 at his residential address in Central Brighton. Officers utilised a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. During the execution of the warrant, a range of electronic devices—including encrypted mobile phones, external hard drives, and USB sticks—were seized and subsequently submitted to the regional digital forensics unit for detailed examination. This case unfolded within the wider structural context of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division’s review of evolving domestic threats. The prolonged timeline for charge and disclosure reflects the intricate nature of terrorism investigations in the modern operational environment—including the necessity to balance transparency, operational security, and safeguarding human rights. Significant attention must also be paid to the role of the Legal Aid Agency in ensuring Mr H’s right to a fair trial. The court notes with concern the reported administrative delay endured in the authorisation of funds to instruct an independent forensic psychiatric expert, a failure symptomatic of ongoing austerity pressures impacting the administration of criminal justice in terrorism-related cases. Defence counsel, Mr Quentin Barker, has navigated these constraints commendably, demonstrating diligence in pursuing the best interests of his client amid shifting schedules and sporadic disclosure. The Crown is represented by Ms Louise Renwick, whose factual and legal submissions throughout the proceedings have been both thorough and measured. It is also germane to record that this case was subject to a number of procedural adjournments. Of note, a listing conflict at this court arose due to Judge attendance at a High Court conference on judicial technology, necessitating the reallocation of the trial venue to an adjoining court. The efficient handling of these logistical challenges by the court staff, ushers, and legal teams mitigated otherwise potentially disruptive delay. The court acknowledges the emergence over recent years of a jurisprudence characterised by incremental refinement of sentencing principles in terrorism cases, particularly focused on culpability gradation, the prospect of public harm, and rehabilitative potential. The seminal judgment of R v. Khan [2011] EWCA Crim 1430 remains instructive, particularly in its guidance on the evaluation of preparatory acts absent actual perpetration of an explosive attack. Moreover, the approach adopted in R v. Ahmed [2017] EWCA Crim 715 underscores the incremental imposition of lengthy, determinate custodial sentences in cases of technological sophistication. During the preliminary hearings, the court received comprehensive psychological reports from Dr Fiona Maitland, a consultant forensic psychiatrist engaged by the defence, and Dr Rajinder Singh, an independent practitioner instructed by the prosecution. Both reports provide detailed assessment of Mr H’s mental health and risk profile; Dr Maitland observed the presence of elevated anxiety traits and obsessive-compulsive tendencies but found no evidence of a major psychiatric disorder. Dr Singh’s report was broadly consistent but cautioned regarding Mr H’s potential susceptibility to ideological reinvigoration absent appropriate supervision. Mr H planned to build and leave a device in a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, just east of Cornbrook station, scheduled to detonate at 3pm as Leeds supporters passed in dense footfall, exploiting CCTV blind spots. This court is mindful of the necessity, enshrined in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (2023), to categorise the conduct according to the degree of commitment, sophistication, and proximity to actual harm. The guideline emphasises that even preparatory conduct, where capable of leading to serious attacks, must be approached with rigorous scrutiny. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Among the evidential highlights were the recovery of encrypted communications detailing technical specifications for homemade explosives, cached within a steganographically concealed partition on Mr H’s primary hard drive. The material included electronic correspondence with an individual identified only by an alias, believed to be located abroad and connected to a proscribed organisation. These findings necessitated a drawn-out process of decryption and contextual analysis to establish the nature and purpose of the communications. Parallel investigations ensued into Mr H’s network of contacts, including a co-defendant, Mr J, who was at large during the initial proceedings but was later apprehended and subsequently convicted for offences related to firearm possession and attempted robbery unrelated to the instant terrorism charges. The procedural history is marked by the late submission of a dossier by the defence purporting to establish an alibi covering several key windows of the alleged conduct. The Crown challenged the credibility of this material in light of contemporaneous CCTV evidence capturing Mr H loitering near a high-security facility. Such disputes extended the pre-trial timetable and engaged time-consuming forensic verification. It is worthy of reference that the defendant’s residential history involves multiple transient tenancies, including a brief stay at a hostel in Worthing in late 2022, as documented in correspondence from the East Sussex Housing Partnership. The connection between housing instability and exposure to radicalising influences has been the subject of academic discourse, though the court underscores that such factors are neither mitigating nor determinative absent concrete evidentiary support of causative agency. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The court notes, without direct bearing on the present charges, reports of a co-tenant at Mr H’s Brighton address found in possession of cannabis during an unrelated police intervention. Further, the landlord of the block was recently served a noise abatement notice due to tenant complaints—events extraneous to Mr H but entering the perimeter of background inquiry. Procedural complexity was heightened by the competing demands of parallel civil proceedings arising from a dispute over water supply billing at the defendant’s previous address in Eastbourne. Despite its peripheral relevance, documentation from that dispute was disclosed to the defence, illustrating the breadth of routine evidentiary trawling in major counter-terrorism investigations. In the sphere of public safety and agency cooperation, the court records commend the efforts of the Greater Sussex Prevent Team, which engaged Mr H on multiple occasions in the preceding three years. Records evidence offers of one-to-one mentoring, cognitive behavioural therapy inputs aimed at ideological disengagement, and support for vocational retraining. The defendant’s engagement was, however, noted as intermittent and frequently passive. Such efforts reflect the challenging reality of public protection in a resource-constrained landscape. The understaffing of probation services in this region is a known issue, publicly acknowledged by the Ministry of Justice in a parliamentary memorandum dated February 2025. These systemic strains constitute a barrier to effective monitoring and rehabilitation of individuals with ideological risk profiles, and factors into considerations about the long-term management of Mr H. References submitted by charities within Brighton and Hove, including the Community Links Centre, were received by the court during adjourned hearings. Their material highlighted work undertaken with disenfranchised youths but prudently refrained from offering any direct insight into Mr H’s own propensity for reform. This case is framed against a backdrop of rising concerns about digital encryption and emerging artefacts of so-called “dark tech” tools used to evade law enforcement. The National Cybercrime Unit, which contributed to this prosecution, provided detailed briefing notes on emerging trends in anonymised networks which facilitated the covert flow of extremist manifestos. The impact of these technologies upon policing strategy cannot be overstated. Legal discourse during this trial also engaged with the decision in R v. Mumin [2018] EWCA Crim 765, which explored the boundaries of mens rea in cases involving so-called “lone actor” terrorists. This authority reinforces the principle that deliberate planning, irrespective of scale or success, must attract appropriate sanction to serve as a deterrent. Adjacent legal issues arose in the trial when judicial permission was sought and granted for admission of expert digital forensics testimony relating to temporal metadata analysis conducted by the City Forensics Bureau. This prolonged examination involved reconstructing deleted file fragments extracted from multiple devices, underscoring the sophisticated techniques employed in modern prosecutions. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. The court also observed that Mr H had travelled abroad on multiple occasions within the relevant timeframe. Notably, on a trip in September 2024, airline ticketing records indicate a journey to Istanbul, ostensibly for leisure purposes. However, investigation revealed engagement with individuals later implicated in unrelated offences involving weapon smuggling in Southeast Europe. Defence submissions contended that such travel was innocuous and unconnected to the offences; the court accepts the contention remains a matter of inference rather than proof. A further procedural note relates to the disclosure turn-around times experienced during this case. The Crown served over nine hundred pages of witness statements and exhibits, complex to navigate given the high volume of classified material requiring sensitive redactions. Historical case law provides additional legal context to the sentencing exercise. The court draws attention to R v. Williams [2000] 2 Cr App R 354, wherein an initial fragmented sentence was imposed for offences involving possession of materials likely to assist acts of terrorism, albeit the defendant in that instance was not linked to active planning. Furthermore, the court takes note of an unrelated conviction recited in the background files of a relative of Mr H, specifically his sister, who was found guilty in 2021 of benefit fraud and received a community order. That background information is recorded solely to maintain completeness of familial context and cannot be presumed to influence or mitigate the defendant’s individual culpability. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Recent findings by forensic economists revealed that Mr H had transferred a sum equivalent to approximately £4,200 via cryptocurrency exchanges during 2024, with one wallet traced to a marketplace suspected of dealing in dual-use materials with possible application in improvised explosive devices. The covert nature of such payments necessitates protracted chain-of-custody analysis and cross-jurisdictional investigative cooperation. The court commends the professionalism of Detective Superintendent Claire Montgomery of CTPSE and her team, whose exhaustive work demonstrated an exceptional degree of coordination amidst significant operational pressures. Additional evidence included surveillance logs from Brighton city centre recording Mr H’s unobserved movements on several late evenings, suggesting reconnaissance activity. The costly and labour-intensive nature of such surveillance underscores the resource-intensive challenges faced by counter-terrorism policing units. The court is aware that escalating demands upon digital forensic teams have led to case backlogs nationally, impeding prompt evidence production. This phenomenon, described in the Home Office’s 2023 Cybercrime Response Strategy, alerts to an urgent need for increased funding and specialist recruitment. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to the personal circumstances of the defendant, Mr H is 31 years old. He holds a bachelor’s degree in software engineering from a regional university. Prior to his resignation in November 2023, he was employed as a junior software developer with a technology firm in Brighton. The defendant’s former manager provided a character reference describing Mr H as “a reserved and considerate employee with an aptitude for problem-solving but limited social engagement.” Mr H’s abrupt resignation followed a formal workplace inquiry relating to unauthorized access of restricted server environments, which highlighted concerns about his adherence to company security policies. Letters submitted on the defendant's behalf from the Brighton Community Gardening Society attest to his participation in voluntary activities including the maintenance of communal allotments. While such engagement is commendable, its mitigating weight is limited in consideration of the severity of the offences. The court also notes concerns expressed in correspondence from the East Sussex Mental Health Trust regarding significant waiting lists for psychological services in the region, which hamper efforts at post-custody therapeutic intervention. Other personal character evidence includes a letter from Mr H’s sister, Ms Olivia H., whose unrelated ongoing court proceedings for harassment highlight the complex familial milieu in which the defendant operates. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. The forensic psychological report, authored by Dr Helena Forsyth, emphasises that Mr H exhibits elevated cognitive inflexibility and a tendency towards rigid ideological frameworks. No formal diagnosis of psychiatric disorder was given, yet the report identifies a high risk of reengagement with extremist groups absent intensive monitoring and support. The court is cognizant of the propositions advanced by the defence advocating the suitability of Mr H for structured disengagement programmes, such as the UK Desistance and Disengagement Scheme (DDS). Nonetheless, this court recalls that such interventions, while promising, have variable success rates and require firm supervisory measures to safeguard the public interest. This court is acutely aware of concerns voiced by community leaders about the potential adverse impact of punitive sentencing on social cohesion. Letters from the Brighton Interfaith Council argue for a balanced approach that prioritises rehabilitation within a proportionate framework. Such considerations will be given due weight but cannot override the imperative to protect the public from harm. The evidence presented indicates a sophisticated and methodical pattern of preparatory conduct, epitomised by the acquisition of technical materials, encrypted communications, and reconnaissance activities. These factors attract significant culpability weighting under the Sentencing Council guidelines. No prior convictions are recorded against Mr H. This, coupled with educational attainment and some community contributions, provides limited mitigation. The defendant’s pleas of guilty, entered late in the proceedings, afford a modest discount consistent with established principles. The court directs that a pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith. The probation service is requested to evaluate risk management strategies that include possibilities for electronic monitoring, licence conditions restricting internet access, and ongoing psychological support. Furthermore, the report should consider accommodation needs in settings conducive to supervised rehabilitation and the availability of accredited specialists in deradicalisation. This hearing today represents the culmination of extensive judicial and administrative endeavour, affording all parties the opportunity to present robust representations as mandated by due process. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 4 at Brighton Crown Court. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

Mr H Case No. S2025/27654 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. P. READING Filed: 18 October 2025 Mr H, whose full name I have previously recorded at earlier hearings, appears before this court for sentence on multiple counts under the Terrorism Act 2006. The charges brought against him concern engagement in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), as well as possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct spans an extended period from late 2022 through to his arrest in April of this year. The background to the present proceedings is illustrative of the complexities and strains inherent in modern counter-terrorism investigative and prosecutorial work. Mr H was apprehended at 04:47 on 9 April 2025 at his home address in Eastleigh, Hampshire, pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The police operation, spearheaded by Counter Terrorism Unit South East (CTUSE), followed extensive covert surveillance and digital forensic analysis. At the time of his arrest, officers seized multiple electronic devices, including laptops, encrypted mobile phones, and encrypted storage media, as well as various materials suspected to be related to bomb-making. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Over the course of the investigation, which had been ongoing for some sixteen months, CTUSE coordinated closely with the National Cyber Fusion Unit (NCFU), which provided highly specialised cyber intelligence expertise. The challenges encountered in decrypting and analysing Mr H’s electronic communications were formidable: he made use of end-to-end encryption applications, employed ephemeral messaging protocols, and adopted digital operational security techniques informed by well-known extremist manuals. These features necessitated considerable resources and technological investment from police and intelligence agencies, highlighting the unique demands of such investigations. Delays in progress were inevitable. For example, the disclosure schedule in this matter ran to over 1,200 exhibits, many of which contained heavily redacted material to comply with national security considerations and to protect ongoing operations. The defence team encountered periodic challenges in accessing this material, reflecting the broader systemic tension between open justice and sensitive classified information. The court notes with some regret these procedural obstacles, which are intrinsic to such cases but impose burdens upon all involved. The defendant was initially granted conditional bail in December 2024 after his first appearance at Southampton Magistrates’ Court, subject to stringent requirements, including electronic monitoring and revocation of internet access save for approved portals. These conditions reflected concerns regarding the risk of further extremist activity or dissemination of material. However, these bail conditions were revoked following breaches identified through covert surveillance, leading to remand in custody in February 2025. Such compliance failures are relevant in the overall assessment of Mr H’s attitude and risk profile. Mr H’s defence was conducted with the assistance of Mr Imran Qureshi of counsel, instructed via the Legal Aid Agency. The court records its appreciation for the sterling efforts of Mr Qureshi and his junior, Ms Eleanor Beckett, whose advocacy demonstrated professionalism under sometimes difficult circumstances. The court must, however, register its frustration with the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative delays, which notably postponed the initial psychiatric assessment until late May 2025 despite early requests. These delays inevitably complicated scheduling and preparation, reflecting systemic underfunding in critical areas of public defence. A so-called Prevent referral was made on behalf of Mr H in early 2020 after he submitted an essay for a local Sixth Form College containing passages sympathetic to violent extremists. That referral was handled by the Southampton Prevent Hub, which attempted to engage Mr H in tailored deradicalisation programmes. According to correspondence the court has reviewed, his engagement was sporadic and ultimately limited. This serves as a wider reminder of the challenges faced by Prevent teams amid fluctuating participation and resource constraints. It is, regrettably, an increasing feature of this jurisdiction that defendants charged with terrorism offences often delay their guilty pleas until the eve of trial or at sentencing hearings. Mr H followed this familiar pattern, offering not guilty pleas at his initial court appearances and finally entering guilty pleas to the principal charges only at the sentencing hearing. The court has taken account of this in assessing the available credit for plea. The law affords a measure of leniency where a guilty plea is entered sufficiently early to save the court’s time and to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of trial. As noted in R v Milligan [2018] EWCA Crim 1938, credit for a guilty plea is not automatic but depends on the timing and circumstances of the admission. In R v. Martyn [2021] EWCA Crim 1249, the Court further emphasised that pleas entered after exhaustive preparation and close to trial attract significantly less credit. That principle is plainly engaged in this case. A further illustration of the effect of delayed plea can be seen in the case of R v. Lambert [2022] EWCA Crim 1057, which concerned a defendant convicted of affray following a pub brawl involving pool cues and other improvised weapons. Despite compelling CCTV evidence, Mr Lambert maintained his innocence until a late plea, leading to a modest credit of 10 per cent only. While Mr H’s offences obviously bear a different and more grave character, the proportionality of plea credit is governed by similar reasoning. The court's task must be grounded also in the framework provided by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guidelines (2023), which demand careful consideration of the level of culpability, operational sophistication, and potential harm. As Lord Justice Hughes observed in R v. Qureshi [2024] EWCA Crim 731, sentencing courts must balance community protection with proportionality, taking into account the complex realities of ideological crime that often straddle the boundary between thought and action. Mr H planned to build and leave a device in a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, just east of Cornbrook station, scheduled to detonate at 3pm as Leeds supporters passed in dense footfall, exploiting CCTV blind spots. The evidence demonstrates that Mr H operated a series of online platforms emanating from an encrypted account under the sobriquet “SteelAnvil.” Analysis revealed that these platforms evolved from relatively innocuous mechanical hobbyist content into increasingly strident ideological treatises, replete with coded references to extremist doctrine proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Linguistic experts testified that these postings exhibited distinctive markers consistent with known extremist communication patterns, a finding which the defence did not contest fully. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Technicians recovering data from a concealed partition on one of Mr H's seized drives uncovered multiple encrypted folders titled “Joints and Shrapnel.” Some of the files contained what appeared to be detailed experimental results of fragmentation dispersal tests using gelatine simulants, conducted in the defendant’s suburban workshop. Though some files were corrupt or incomplete, their content was plainly of concern and indicative of preparation for potentially violent acts. The court was mindful that possession of incomplete instructions for explosives manufacture has been addressed in the appellate decision of R v. Salim [2020] EWCA Crim 814, which confirmed that even partial materials support intent findings where contextual evidence aligns. The defence sought to argue that the defendant’s interests were confined to mechanical hobbyism and engineering innovation, but the court finds such claims unpersuasive given the totality of the evidence. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The defence also emphasised a series of seemingly innocuous personal artefacts — notably, several hand-crafted wooden chess sets found at the defendant’s residence, some with dust accumulation indicating prolonged absence of use, and a minor unpaid local parking fine from 2019. While such details serve to humanise the defendant, they are of no substantive mitigating value and do not detract from the grave context in which the prosecution case has been proven. It would be remiss not to mention, in passing, that the Social Services Department had received a complaint in 2023 regarding a neighbour’s allegations of noise disturbances at the house, attributed to late-night drone operation. This unrelated investigation was promptly closed with no further action. Such peripheral matters, while distracting to some degree, fall outside the scope of this court’s concern. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. The Crown placed particular emphasis on Mr H’s trip in October 2024 to Brussels, ostensibly on “heritage tourism.” Yet, records from border control and telecommunications data reveal that upon arrival, Mr H proceeded to a district known for hosting extremist networking events. CCTV footage recorded his interaction with an identified individual, later arrested in association with an ammonium nitrate importation conspiracy in the Benelux region. The defence attempted to suggest coincidence, but the pattern of encrypted communications and concurrent planning negates any innocent interpretation. In the course of preparing this matter, the court has reviewed extensive documentary material drawn from various law-enforcement agencies, including sensitive intelligence reports and complex digital forensic exports. While the vast quantity of data is, to some, overwhelming or arcane, it is necessary to understand that such exhaustive inquiry is the hallmark of contemporary anti-terrorism efforts. It is neither frivolous nor disproportionate, but a function of the seriousness with which the authorities approach the protection of public safety. Turning briefly to other matters, one notes the ongoing challenges faced by the Hampshire Probation Service, which is operating at approximately 78% staff capacity, dealing with a caseload that has grown by 15% in the past year alone. This constraint has measurable implications for sentence planning and post-release supervision, particularly for individuals convicted of high-risk ideologically motivated crime. The proposed pre-sentence report must reflect these realities candidly and guide the court’s sentencing discretion accordingly. The forensic accountant who gave evidence confirmed that Mr H engaged in multiple cryptocurrency transactions totalling approximately £3,200 over a six-month period prior to arrest. One transfer was traced to an online vendor dealing in chemical precursors, who operates a network designed to evade regulatory scrutiny via tumbling services. The intersection of cryptocurrency and criminal enterprise is well-documented, with appellate courts frequently noting such activity as aggravating where linked to terrorism (see R v. Greer [2023] EWCA Crim 1197). The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Surveillance logs maintained by the National Tactical Teams describe in detail a midnight meeting Mr H attended at a secluded riverside location on the River Test bank in August 2024. The painstaking cross-referencing of multiple camera angles, supported by acoustic analysis, consumed over 150 investigator hours but confirmed identity and interaction with a known extremist facilitator. Such operations typify the resource-intensive nature of contemporary counterterrorism policing — a matter that should temper expectations concerning rapid case conclusions or simplistic narratives of justice. It should also be noted that the court received a well-considered letter from the Eastleigh Residents’ Association, expressing concern about the impact of prolonged investigations on community cohesion and requesting enhanced transparency about surveillance activity in residential areas. While transparency is of undoubted democratic importance, the court must balance this against the need for operational confidentiality to ensure effective public protection. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. With respect to personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old, holds a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours, and formerly worked as a junior technician in an aerospace assembly facility until his resignation in early 2023 following an internal investigation into unauthorised computer access. A character reference furnished by a former employer describes him as “meticulous and quiet,” but notably “evasive when questioned about outside interests.” Contributions from community groups, including a local model engineering club, commend his voluntary participation in workshops but acknowledge no significant recent engagement. The forensic psychologist commissioned by the defence, Dr Samantha Linton, provides an extensive assessment, concluding that while Mr H does not meet criteria for any formal psychiatric diagnosis, he exhibits “marked cognitive rigidity and a tendency to adopt absolutist viewpoints.” Dr Linton further outlines concerns regarding his sustained identification with extremist ideology and warns of a high likelihood of reoffending absent substantial intervention. The pre-sentence report is tasked with evaluating the efficacy and availability of specialist disengagement programmes such as the Counter Extremism Cognitive Therapy Initiative (CECTI), which, while promising, face limitations regarding uptake and completion rates. Mitigating factors presented on behalf of the defendant include his lack of prior convictions, some level of cooperation post-arrest, and documented efforts by voluntary sector organisations to sustain engagement. The court is indebted to the Southampton Council for Community Safety and the Hampshire Resettlement Network, whose representatives submitted detailed reports outlining challenges in providing prison-leaver support amidst ongoing resource limitations and rising demand. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. It is evident that the present offending is of considerable gravity and demonstrated planning, informed by sophisticated technical knowledge and ideological commitment. The aggravating features underscore the necessity of a custodial sentence that prioritises deterrence, public protection, and the prevention of future harm. Conversely, mitigation remains limited and simplifies to the defendant’s personal background and delayed admission of guilt. The court is mindful of the delicate balance struck in sentencing decisions relating to terrorism. While rehabilitation and reintegration are noble aims, the protections of society and the prevention of indiscriminate violence must occupy paramount importance. Sentencing must send a clear message that such conduct will attract the strongest possible judicial response consistent with the law. It is accordingly directed that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared by the Probation Service. This report should address, inter alia, the feasibility of sentencing frameworks such as an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the applicability of High-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Programmes tailored to extremist offenders, proximity monitoring technologies, and the potential for multi-agency engagement frameworks including MAPPA level 3 oversight. Special attention should be given to accommodation options post-release and the availability of professionals trained in Structured Professional Judgement tools for ideological risk evaluation. These sentencing remarks are pronounced this 18th day of October 2025 in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Southampton. They have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, under the supervision of the court clerk Ms Fiona Turner. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be duly transmitted to the appropriate authorities for registration and publication as appropriate. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal the sentence imposed within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

Mr H Case No. N2025/20965 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J. TOWNSEND Filed: 24 September 2025 The defendant, Mr H, appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period relevant to the offending spans from late 2022 until his arrest on 17 April 2025. Mr H’s case has been subject to extensive procedural steps, including multiple listings, adjournments, and various applications by both the prosecution and the defence. The initial hearing took place on 14 May 2025, followed by a plea and trial preparation hearing on 11 August 2025. The matter came before the jury on 2 September 2025, concluding with a verdict of guilty pronounced on 18 September 2025. The court acknowledges the considerable efforts of all those involved in ensuring the continuation of proceedings despite common delays occasioned by resource constraints, personnel strike action affecting court staff in July, and, regrettably, a brief closure owing to the discovery of asbestos in Court 5 during fumigation works. At the outset, it must be noted that the defendant benefited from the assignment of defence counsel under the Legal Aid Scheme, represented throughout by Mr Michael Dalrymple, who is to be commended for his diligent advocacy despite encountering administrative difficulties arising from the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted authorisation of expert instructions. These delays have become a regrettably frequent feature of serious criminal litigation and have materially impacted preparation timelines. Such bureaucratic friction sits uneasily alongside the overarching imperative of the timely administration of justice, a principle enshrined in section 1 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. The court further records its appreciation for Ms Harriet Myles, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown, whose conduct of the case has been measured, professional, and resolutely committed to the considerations of evidential sufficiency and victim dignity. It is also appropriate to acknowledge the indispensable role played by the Special Branch of Nottinghamshire Police and Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands in the investigation and arrest of the defendant—a coordinated endeavour involving extensive cross-agency collaboration, challenged both by technical complexities and operational pressures. Prior to delving into the particulars of the offending conduct, it is pertinent to reflect upon certain procedural norms and historic parallels drawn from appellate authority that inform the imposition of sentence in cases of this gravity. In particular, the court recalls the seminal decision in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, where the Supreme Court delineated the parameters of “terrorist purpose” with clarity, underscoring that the offence encompasses conduct that is preparatory to wide-ranging act(s), not necessarily consummated in the commission of violence itself. Similarly instructive is the Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which emphasised the gravity inherent in the mere possession of articles with a terrorist purpose, particularly where corroborated by other conduct evidencing intent. The doctrine of guilty plea credit is well-established, yet increasingly nuanced in the contemporary landscape. The prudent imposition of sentence must consider not only the timing of the plea but the extent to which such admission affords genuine mitigation, measured against the overall impact on court resources and victim welfare. The court notes with some concern a growing trend towards last-minute pleas, as exemplified in several illustrative authorities, including R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 and R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145, which have clarified that credit must be moderated where pleas follow exhaustive preparatory hearings and the near inevitability of conviction becomes apparent. In fairness to the defence, the court recognises that such delay may sometimes stem from a strategic determination to ensure the fullest possible review of voluminous material; however, the administration of justice cannot be subordinated to tactical expediency. Accordingly, the court will approach plea credit with circumspection appropriate to the circumstances. Mr H was arrested at 05:20 on 17 April 2025 pursuant to a warrant authorised by a District Judge under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant concerned a residential property on Langley Road in Beeston, Nottingham, executed by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands, supported by technicians and forensic specialists from the National Digital Exploitation Unit. The operation followed a period of sustained investigation over several months grounded in intelligence reports and intercepted communications. The material obtained included a laptop computer encrypted with sophisticated cryptographic software and various electronic devices, all of which underwent exhaustive examination for evidential content. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigatory team drew upon state-of-the-art digital forensic methodologies, complicated by the defendant’s habitual use of anonymisation networks, live VPNs, and Tor-browser-protected messaging applications. This created a significant challenge, necessitating collaboration with cybercrime specialists at the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), who undertook painstaking decryption efforts. These interdisciplinary efforts were further hampered by the defendant’s apparent use of burner phones and dual-subscriber identity modules (SIMs), which required complex cell-site analysis to establish pattern-of-life correlations. Unconnected to the matter at hand, it is worth noting an incident earlier in 2024 involving the illicit disposal of waste in the green belt just outside Nottingham, which has had a ripple effect on the staffing capacity of environmental regulatory authorities in the region. Though unrelated to the defendant, such matters underscore the increasing strain placed on public enforcement agencies across a range of issues compounded by budgetary constraints. The court also takes judicial notice of the report submitted by the East Midlands Fire and Rescue Service concerning an arson attack on a disused tobacco warehouse in Long Eaton. While the arsonists were never apprehended, this incident led to some temporary disruption in court listings earlier this year due to the necessity of diverting fire investigation personnel. The defendant was initially granted conditional bail on 3 May 2025, subject to standard undertaking provisions, including electronic tagging and residence at a specified address pending trial. However, bail was revoked on 2 July 2025 following fresh intelligence indicating ongoing covert communications between the defendant and persons outside the jurisdiction aligned with proscribed organisations. The Crown applied successfully for remand to ensure public protection and prevent risk of further preparatory activity. In reviewing the evidence, the court also considered the impact of certain co-defendant actions and unrelated proceedings. One such co-defendant, Mr J, charged with offences involving possession of a bladed article and associated affray in a public house, absconded prior to trial. Despite exhaustive searches and police activity, he remains at large. It must be emphasised that such behaviour has no bearing on the defendant’s culpability but has contributed to logistical challenges in assembling joint trial bundles. It is informative to bear in mind the relevant legal precedents on sentencing methodology. The statutory framework governing sentencing for terrorism offences derives principally from the Terrorism Act 2006 and is supplemented by the Sentencing Council’s definitive 2023 guidelines. The latter provide attendance on aggravating and mitigating factors, including the offender’s degree of planning and preparation, association with recognised terrorist entities, potential for harm, and timeliness of plea. Noteworthy is the guidance articulated in R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, which laid emphasis on deterrence and the protection of the public as paramount considerations. The court was provided with a detailed pre-sentence report from the National Probation Service. The report, prepared by Senior Probation Officer Louise Abbey, details Mr H’s background in some depth. Mr H, now aged 31, received a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Derby but has no recorded history of serious convictions. Officer Abbey stresses, however, a concerning pattern of social withdrawal and increasing fixation on extremist ideological content from 2022 onwards. The pre-sentence report also addresses Mr H’s prior history of transient employment interspersed with periods of unemployment and notes an incident of shoplifting from a local supermarket dating back to 2011. Such minor criminal conduct, while recorded, falls well outside the sentencing considerations for terrorism and is referenced here only to provide a holistic view of Mr H’s personal history. The court is also aware of a record maintained by the City of Nottingham Police of a noise abatement notice served on the landlord of Mr H’s previous residence in Carlton, associated with disturbances caused by unrelated tenants. These peripheral details have no direct or indirect bearing on the present offending. In assessing risk, the court gave considerable weight to the psychiatric report prepared by Dr Harold Byram, a consultant forensic psychiatrist seconded from the Lincolnshire NHS Trust. Dr Byram’s assessment, conducted over three sessions in August and September 2025, concludes that Mr H exhibits a marked rigidity of thought and a pronounced intolerance of opposing viewpoints, factors viewed as elevating concern regarding potential for recidivist activity in extremist matters. That said, Dr Byram found no diagnosable psychotic or affective disorder. The report cautions that risk management will require interagency collaboration, including secure accommodation and vigilant monitoring of digital communications upon any eventual release. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. The defendant’s online activity demonstrated escalating support for violent extremist ideologies. A blog, hosted on an obscure platform, evolved over the period of the offending from seemingly innocuous political commentary to explicit calls for destabilisation and retribution upon perceived enemies of his cause. Analysis by linguistic experts revealed congruence with known propaganda materials promulgated by proscribed groups internationally. The court also notes the discovery of devices and printed materials detailing explosive manufacture techniques. Importantly, such materials were stored in encrypted partitions, consistent with behaviours bearing hallmarks of preparatory acts directed towards mass casualty incidents. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Among the recovered digital content were encrypted manifestos and detailed instructions on the manufacture of improvised explosive devices. These instructions included, inter alia, discussions on chemical compositions, detonation circuitry, and tactical placement to maximise injury. In mitigation, the defence contended that the presence of some such materials might be explained by Mr H’s avowed interest in chemistry and pyrotechnics as a hobby. The court, accepting the expert evidence presented, rejects any benign explanation consistent with isolated hobbyist engagement given the context of the defendant’s wider conduct. It is sometimes observed that criminal cases are complicated by the presence of extraneous evidence or collateral charges relating to third parties. During the investigation, it emerged that the defendant's roommate was found to be in possession of small quantities of cannabis during a separate police search unrelated to terrorism allegations. Additionally, a distant relative of Mr H stands under investigation for benefit fraud, a matter still sub judice. Neither of these facts, while recorded, bears upon the issues before the court today. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The defendant’s use of social media also evidenced a pattern of networking with extremist sympathisers domestically and overseas. The content of private messages included references to “martyrdom operations” and “just retribution” for military interventions abroad. Though the defence posit that such writings constitute protected political speech or hyperbole, this court finds no merit in such submissions in light of established jurisprudence reinforcing that speech intended to incite or facilitate terrorism falls outside protected expression. Notably, the Crown adduced evidence of Mr H attending an event in a neighbouring city under the pretext of a photography workshop; surveillance and telecommunications data indicated he made contact with known facilitators subsequently convicted of providing material support to terrorist organisations. This connectivity provides important context for sentencing, suggesting a high degree of commitment beyond casual interest. It is, however, necessary to reflect on certain unrelated historical decisions which help frame sentencing discretion in preparatory terrorism cases. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court of Appeal considered the application of sentencing principles where mental disorder interfaced with culpability. There the defendant, who suffered from schizoaffective disorder, committed arson at multiple properties causing extensive damage and risk to life. The court highlighted the distinction between cause and culpability, mandating sentences that reflect both public protection and the therapeutic dimension. While Mr H does not have such a diagnosis, the careful balance outlined remains instructive. Further, the case of R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412 clarified that community-based psychiatric support, while valuable, cannot supplant custodial sentences where there is a demonstrated pattern of escalating harm and resistance to treatment. These authorities underscore the need for calibrated sentences that reconcile individual circumstances with the overriding public safety mandate. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. Mr H’s travel history indicates a documented visit to Istanbul in April 2024, purportedly to attend a conference on humanitarian aid logistics. Records obtained from immigration show attempts to proceed further to a conflict-adjacent zone, though this final leg was frustrated by unforeseen travel disruption. This evidence aligns closely with interdiction patterns seen in other cases where ostensibly legitimate travel provides cover for connecting with extremist operatives. As the Crown notes, the question of proximate intent is supported by these attempts to embed within hostile environments conducive to militant activity. Defence submissions emphasize that Mr H did not complete the journey and question any ultimate plan; the court however, must evaluate conduct both in intention and steps taken. It is relevant to observe the broader context within which such investigations unfold. Disclosure processes in complex terrorism cases now commonly require examination of thousands of digital items, redacted across various secure platforms, as described in the case of R v. AB & CD [2014] EWCA Crim 354. The balance between open justice and national security continues to pose formidable operational challenges, frequently necessitating closed material procedures and the involvement of specialist judges. The court is acutely aware that the investigations consume tangible and intangible public resources; it is not unheard of for similar inquiries to consume hundreds of person-hours from intelligence analysts, digital forensic experts, and uniformed officers whose redeployment creates a ripple effect across other pressing public safety concerns, including investigations into organised crime and violent offences. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial tracing of blockchain transactions revealed that Mr H transferred the sum of approximately £3,200 in cryptocurrency to wallets linked to darknet marketplaces known to purchase controlled chemical precursors. Such transactions evince an intention to procure materials for illicit purposes. The court notes the growing sophistication of criminals in using decentralised finance to obscure transactional flows—techniques which law enforcement is struggling to keep pace with. The opacity inherent in these technologies multiplies the risks to the public and complicates risk management strategies. Along these lines, the court acknowledges the difficult balance between advancement in digital innovation honoured in commercial spheres and the criminal exploitation thereof. Cautionary remarks made by this court regarding over-reliance on technological solutions in enforcement echo concerns expressed by senior figures in the National Crime Agency. It remains an area of pressing legislative and operational attention. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal background, Mr H is a 31-year-old man with a university education in electrical engineering. Prior work history includes employment as a junior design technician with a Midlands manufacturing firm until his abrupt resignation in August 2023. His line manager describes him as “meticulous and conscientious” though prone to social isolation. There is no suggestion of prior violent offending. Letters of support have been submitted from a local allotment association praising Mr H’s commitment to communal gardening, and a faith-based charity endorsing his efforts in foodbank volunteering during the 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns. While such community involvement is commendable, it must not be misconstrued as indicative of diminished culpability where the seriousness of the offence is manifest. The duality of character is not uncommon, and courts have recognised in cases such as R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928 that prosocial conduct does not negate responsibility for extremist offending. The defendant has provided a letter directly to the court, thoughtful in tone, expressing regret for the effect of his actions on the community. That communication has been taken into account with due weight. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. The clinical psychologist, Dr Felicity Crane, offering an expert forensic report in this case, characterises Mr H as exhibiting “elevated cognitive rigidity accompanied by a binary worldview and a sustained fascination with apocalyptic narratives.” No formal diagnosis of psychiatric disorder was made. Importantly, Dr Crane flags a high risk of serious harm linked to ideological convictions and the potential for relapse into fascilitating activities absent stringent management. Suggestions for mitigation include enrolment in the Countering Violent Extremism Programme (CVE) and high-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy. In weighing mitigation, the court acknowledges the defendant’s lack of prior criminal convictions and the partial engagement with deradicalisation initiatives while on bail. However, the gravity of the offending and the strategic nature of preparation command a sentence of considerable severity. The submission made by defence counsel for a non-custodial disposal is respectfully rejected. It is necessary to reiterate that the purpose of sentencing in terrorism matters encompasses denunciation, deterrence, and most importantly, protection of the public. Those who engage in preparatory activity for acts designed to sow fear and disorder strike at the heart of our social fabric. The court must send a clear message that such conduct invites significant custodial consequences proportionate to culpability. The court will now direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, with particular emphasis upon risk management recommendations, licence conditions, and the prospect of engagement with multi-agency monitoring frameworks including MAPPA Category 3 supervision. The report should also consider the suitability and availability of the Extended Determinate Sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, tailored interventions for disengagement from extremist ideology, and the feasibility of imposing electronic monitoring and internet access restrictions post-release. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 24 September 2025, in Court 2 at Nottingham Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities for registration. The defendant is reminded of his right of appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

Mr H Case No. B2025/28964 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. T. Greaves Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H stands convicted following a jury trial on two counts under terrorism legislation: one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending behaviour spans the period from autumn 2022 until his arrest in January 2025. The procedural history of the case has been lengthy and at times complex. Mr H was arrested at 04:23 on 13 January 2025, following a multi-agency warrant execution at a residence in Southville, Bristol, conducted by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following detailed intercept intelligence indicating that an encrypted communications device linked to the defendant had been used to disseminate extremist manuals hosted on a foreign server listed as proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. At arrest, several electronic devices were seized including encrypted mobile phones, solid-state drives, and printed materials on chemical precursors. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation that preceded Mr H's arrest was notable for its deployment of sophisticated digital forensic techniques. CTPSW collaborated with the National Digital Investigations Unit, whose personnel worked extensively to recover encrypted communications and deleted electronic artefacts. This forensic effort was complicated by the defendant’s use of bespoke Linux-based virtual machines and steganographic techniques for data concealment. At the time, the National Unit was managing an unprecedented backlog of devices, exceeding 12,000 cases, which inevitably imposed delays upon analysis. The resources dedicated to Mr H’s prosecution thus reflect the gravity with which the State viewed the threat posed by his conduct. In the early stages, the case was marked by delays associated with the Legal Aid Agency’s approval of funding for necessary psychiatric expertise. Defence counsel made an urgent application to instruct an independent expert to evaluate Mr H’s mental state and assess ideological fixations. That application was not granted until four months after initial request, resulting in a compressed timeline for report compilation. This court has previously expressed concern about systemic hurdles posed by funding shortfalls and administrative inertia within the Legal Aid system. These are not trivial matters, as they directly affect a defendant’s right to adequate representation and the courts’ ability to complete proceedings within reasonable timeframes. The Channel programme had engaged with the defendant intermittently since 2021. An initial referral came from staff at a local university following Mr H’s submission of a political science essay containing quotations from extremist literature without critical context. The Channel panel convened on two occasions but concluded that risk factors at the time did not warrant further intervention. That determination, while perhaps open to public debate, remains a judgment of specialist case workers operating under complex constraints. Regrettably, early-warning mechanisms such as these remain imperfect; individuals may slip through initial screening only to surface later as genuine threats. Of procedural note, the matter was first listed for plea and trial preparation hearing on 2 April 2025. Mr H entered a not guilty plea at that stage and pleaded in the same vein throughout the trial process. However, on the morning of the concluding day of the trial in July 2025, having heard the strength of the prosecution’s evidence, he entered pleas of guilty to both counts. The court is bound to reflect upon the timing of this plea, as the jurisprudence is clear that credit for a guilty plea is not an automatic entitlement but depends materially on its timing and sincerity. It has become a regrettably frequent pattern in contemporary criminal practice for defendants to defer guilty pleas until the evidential noose tightens. This forum has often cautioned that such delay impedes the proper administration of justice, ensures prolonged victim distress, and imposes heightened costs on public resources. This court, therefore, accords a modest, tempered discount on sentence in recognition of the plea, limited by the late stage at which it was entered. The Court of Appeal’s judgment in R v. Longstaff [2019] EWCA Crim 1239 provides authoritative guidance on the proper assessment of plea credit in terrorism-related offences. There, the court observed the critical importance of a plea being entered at the first realistic opportunity to maximise the practical benefits to justice. Similarly, R v. Daly and Bradley [2021] EWCA Crim 556 reiterated that pleas entered promptly reduce the psychological toll on victims and witnesses and demonstrate genuine remorse. Late pleas, especially those delivered after jury selection or during evidence presentation, attract significantly less mitigation. In the borderline context, R v. Sidhu [2018] EWCA Crim 86 addressed the interaction of mental disorder and sentencing credit. While psychiatric impairment may affect culpability and sentencing disposal, it does not entitle a defendant to enhanced plea credit where the plea timing is tactical rather than genuine. The relevant statutory maximums for these offences — life imprisonment under section 5(1)(a) of the 2006 Act and, where appropriate, extended sentences pursuant to section 57 of the 2000 Act — provide the sentencing yardstick against which the court measures culpability and risk. The Sentencing Council’s revised Guidelines issued in 2023 offer a comprehensive framework calibrated to the severity, sophistication, and intended harm of the offending. It is axiomatic that terrorism offences attract sentences at the higher end of the spectrum where there is evidence of intent to cause indiscriminate harm or to facilitate remote connections to terrorist entities. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. Mr H’s ideology evolved in a discernible trajectory. For some months in 2023, he maintained a blog under the pseudonym “Technomarauder,” which at first chronicled local concerns regarding urban redevelopment and transport policy. Gradually, the content shifted to espouse grievance narratives sympathetic to proscribed organisations. Expert linguistic analysis tendered during the trial identified clear patterns of mimicry and near-direct quotations from extremist manifestoes published online by banned networks. These data points strongly support the proposition that his engagement transcended mere passive consumption and was active and preparatory in nature. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Recovered digital materials included an encrypted VeraCrypt volume titled “HeronRecipes.” Analysis revealed an assortment of weapon-building manuals, shrapnel dispersal test schematics, and encrypted communications instructing the sourcing of dual-use chemical compounds. It is noted that one of the files encountered a corrupt byte segment on page 47, sparking defence arguments that the defendant may not have possessed or completed review of the full contents. However, given the wider corpus of material and correspondences, this court accepts the materiality of the evidence as establishing intent. Importantly, forensic review of recovered social media history identified a dormant Instagram account featuring high-resolution aerial photography of public infrastructure sites, specifically substations and transit hubs. Defence submissions argued these images were benign and consistent with a known hobbyist interest in urban exploration. The court finds such exculpatory assertions unpersuasive when placed in the greater context of the investigation and the defendant’s encrypted communications. During the police search of the address, officers encountered a small quantity of cannabis resin in shared living spaces. No charges arose from this finding, and it carries no relevance to the terrorism offences. Defence counsel highlighted a previous local authority fixed-penalty notice for fare evasion on the Bristol Metrobus system in 2020; again, this is irrelevant to the gravity of the present charges and is noted only to illustrate attempts at peripheral mitigation during submissions. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Digital forensic data also revealed twenty-seven encrypted chat threads on the defendant’s device evidencing communications with a known international facilitator. Intercepted messages contained code words and swapping of instructions relating to buying materials consistent with explosive manufacture. Defence suggested the defendant’s travel to Ostend in Belgium for a weekend in May 2024 was purely recreational. Travel records, however, disclosed a same-day journey crossed into a border town with documented extremists' gatherings, alongside witness evidence placing the defendant in conversations with individuals subsequently apprehended for the possession of explosive compounds. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. This case generated approximately 835 primary exhibits for disclosure, all vetted under the highest tiers of national security classification by the Joint Operations Security Unit. The volume and security constraints of exhibits imposed heavy operational burdens on staff and necessitated restricted access, contributing to unavoidable listing delays. Defence counsel navigated redaction protocols professionally but with understandable concern over the effects on case progression and client welfare. Such measures must be balanced judiciously between public interest, national security, and the accused’s fair trial rights—a delicate equilibrium the courts must defend vigilantly. A forensic accountant briefing tendered to the court traced cryptocurrency transactions from a wallet linked to the defendant’s encrypted email. On 11 December 2024, a sum of 1.2 Ethereum (estimated at £3,400 then) was transferred through multiple mixers to an online marketplace associated with dual-use chemical supplies. The Court notes the growing challenge of cryptocurrency’s role in criminal financing in terrorism cases. While legitimate purposes abound, anonymising tumbler services undermine detection and enforcement efforts. This phenomenon demands continuing legislative and operational responses commensurate with evolving technological realities. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Covert footage documented the defendant’s occasional nocturnal visits to the River Avon embankments between September and November 2024, coinciding with surveillance indicating his handling of materials believed to be consistent with precursor substances. The analytic efforts to confirm these movements were intensive, requiring cross-reference of environmental sensor data with multiple low-light camera feeds, underscoring the disproportionate resource allocation necessitated by such investigations. In the realm of public service delivery, it should be recorded that the Probation Service faces structural challenges. Staffing shortages, high caseloads, and the need for specialised counter-terrorism risk management underscore the difficulty in supporting defendants with complex rehabilitation needs such as Mr H. The court is mindful that effective risk management requires adequate institutional capacity. The defendant is 31 years old with a degree in computer engineering. Former employers have described him as meticulous but introverted. His last employment role terminated following refusal to complete company security vetting forms, citing privacy concerns. This resignation occurred shortly prior to the escalation of surveillance against him. Character references from members of a local philosophy group have been submitted, praising his “deep ethical curiosity” and “commitment to community discourse,” but such commendations, while appreciated, cannot overshadow the seriousness of the offences. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Professor James Latham, a consultant forensic psychologist, contributed a comprehensive assessment of the defendant. His report identifies traits of cognitive rigidity, “black-and-white” moral assessment, and a tendency toward conspiratorial thinking. Notwithstanding the absence of any diagnosed formal psychiatric disorder, the assessment concludes a high risk of serious harm with continued extremist associations, particularly in unsupervised environments. The report emphasises that desistance prospects, while not nil, depend heavily on structured interventions and sustained multi-agency management. Defence counsel argued for mitigation based on Mr H’s partial engagements with voluntary organisations aimed at disengagement from radicalisation, notably the Southside Community Resilience Project and the Bristol Youth Mentoring Programme. These submissions are noted, though the court must recognise the uneven success rates and real organisational challenges, including funding uncertainty and volunteer turnover, which complicate consistent involvement. The multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), categorised under Level 3 for high-risk offenders engaged in extremist conduct, have been properly activated in this case. The integrated efforts of probation officers, counter-terrorism police units, NHS forensic mental health services and local authority safeguarding panels remain a cornerstone in protecting the public from recidivist harm. Particular acknowledgment is due to Detective Inspector Rana of Counter Terrorism Policing South West and Dr Fiona Webb of the Avon Secure Psychiatric Centre for their diligent collaboration and unwavering commitment under considerable systemic strain. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. This defendant’s engagement with multiple layers of institutional surveillance, forensic evidence, and ideological research reveal a case of substantial gravity. The presence of calculated steps towards manufacture and dissemination of an improvised device, combined with evidence of active affiliations to proscribed groups, raises concerns not only about past conduct but future risk should enhanced supervision not be imposed. The pre-sentence reports will be vital in determining the full sentencing matrix, with particular regard to options for extended sentences, licence requirements mandating GPS monitoring, and potential conditions aimed at digital device restrictions. The court looks toward the feasibility of involving specialist deradicalisation programmes as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation strategy, though recognises the limitations inherent in such schemes as borne out by current evidence. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal hearing for sentence will follow once the pre-sentence reports have been received and considered.

R. McCLELLAND Filed: 12 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on charges under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism. The period of offending is stated as November 2022 through to his arrest in April 2025. The defendant was arrested at 04:47 on 15 April 2025 after officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) executed a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence, a flat in the Easton district of Bristol. The warrant followed interception intelligence indicating encrypted communications between his cellular device and a group identified by the Security Service as proscribed for propagating extremist literature. Items seized included a portable electronic tablet, two encrypted smartphones, and various electronic storage devices. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative operation was extensive and multi-faceted. Alongside conventional surveillance, investigative teams employed advanced digital forensic methods, including the examination of TOR network usage patterns and the extraction of metadata from anonymized messaging applications. These processes were susceptible to delay owing to the technical sophistication of the encryption and the high volume of digital material requiring assessment nationally. The court acknowledges that the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) maintained a prolonged backlog at the time, which regrettably contributed to the length of the investigation. Nonetheless, it is clear that the resources deployed were appropriate to the threat level as it was assessed. Matters of procedural propriety took precedence throughout. The defendant was initially remanded on bail subject to stringent conditions involving electronic tagging and curfew restrictions, which were periodically reviewed. Applications for bail variations were heard on several occasions to accommodate medical appointments and legal consultations. Of note, delays arose at the defence's behest, occasioned by the late provision of disclosure material and subsequent applications for expert reports concerning the digital artefacts. While such procedural delays are regrettable, the court recognizes the right of the defence to adequate time for preparation, particularly in complex terrorism cases. Nonetheless, the cumulative effect of these adjournments contributed to a protracted pre-trial timetable. Courts are increasingly aware of challenges faced by defendants engaged with Prevent interventions prior to their arrest. In this instance, a referral was made in mid-2021 by a college tutor who expressed concern over Mr H’s online postings which included ideological content referencing overseas conflicts. The Channel panel convened reviewed the case but discontinued it citing absence of evidence suggesting imminent risk. It is worth noting this early intervention predates the initiation of the offending described in the indictment. Whether or not more intensive engagement could have altered the course of events is a matter outside judicial remit and more properly the province of policy and prevention experts. The initial plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 9 August 2025. Mr H, represented by counsel under the Legal Aid scheme, entered a not guilty plea and a trial date was set for January 2026. However, on the morning of the first day of trial, he changed his plea to guilty on all counts. The court records that such late pleas will inevitably attract reduced credit in accordance with established authorities. The principle is that credit for guilty pleas is not an automatic entitlement but a discretionary allowance reflecting the avoidance of the trauma of trial for victims and witnesses as well as judicial economy. When pleas are deferred until the cusp of trial, the benefit to the system and the community is appreciably diminished. This approach accords with the guidance in R v. Halligan [2024] EWCA Crim 1357 where the Court of Appeal reduced plea credit to 15% where the defendant maintained a not guilty plea until arraignment despite significant evidence and victim statements having been served months prior. Similarly, in R v. Bradshaw [2023] EWCA Crim 998, a defendant charged with the armed burglary of a pharmaceutical warehouse pressed mitigation with an early plea. The court found that whereas early pleas admit culpability promptly, a plea entered at trial, albeit genuine, warrants more circumspect credit. It may be helpful to reference briefly a contemporaneous case in this jurisdiction, R v. Quillen [2025] BCC 214 — a prosecution for aggravated arson at a recycling depot, entirely unrelated to the defendant but indicative of ongoing pressures on the court's listing arrangements. That case was subject to several adjournments occasioned by the absence of expert fire investigators and counsel illness. Such cases consume scarce prosecutorial and judicial time, underscoring the value of prompt resolution wherever possible. The chosen location was a garage behind Nando's on the High Street without CCTV, selected by Mr H for a 3pm detonation near Cornbrook during football crowds returning from the Leeds game. The evidence shows that Mr H maintained a blog under the moniker “SilverFalcon” which initially engaged with commentary on urban regeneration and local community initiatives. Over time that platform incorporated rhetoric aligned with extremist manifestos, including themes endorsing violent resistance and featuring detailed descriptions of weapons manufacture. Crown experts in forensic linguistics concluded that his writing employed deliberate code phrases consistent with known material disseminated by proscribed entities. A review of data extracted from encrypted messaging apps recovered from his devices revealed dialogues with overseas associates known to be linked to hostile organisations. The forensic analysis further disclosed Mr H’s attempts to source components capable of assembling improvised explosive devices, including materials reportedly intended as stabilizers, the procurement of which involved multiple anonymous online transactions. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Among the many digital artefacts were PDFs housed in encrypted containers bearing the unimaginative title “HomeWorkshop.” These contained detailed instruction sets for the manufacture and deployment of incendiary devices. Defence submissions sought to minimise culpability by arguing that not all documents had been fully accessed or disseminated. The court rejects any notion that incomplete or partial possession diminishes the seriousness of conduct when intention is manifest across other evidence. The trial also attracted attention to Mr H’s possession of a collection of drone components. Some of these items were identical to those used commercially by hobbyists and photography enthusiasts, and defence experts testified to their benign common uses. Nevertheless, when viewed in the mosaic of evidence, including encrypted flight logs, this property assumes a more troubling significance, particularly in combination with the geographic locations identified for planned target reconnaissance. In defence mitigation, it was noted that Mr H’s flatmates reported no concerns and suggested he kept largely to himself. Likewise, a letter was tendered from the landlord of the building indicating a history of tenancy that was good-humoured and quiet, with no complaints or noise abatement notices recorded. These facts, while reflecting on character, have limited bearing on the gravity of the offending. A separate matter of tangential interest concerns the defendant's closeted interest in vintage football trivia. Correspondence uncovered shows active participation in online forums dedicated to expert debates about 1980s league tables. The court records this only as an indication of the dimensionality of individuals who may nonetheless be engaged in criminal conduct. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The Crown presented evidence of a controlled substance, specifically a small quantity of cannabis, found in a communal area during a search. The defence highlighted this as typical youthful experimentation, unrelated to the charges at hand. The court deems this peripheral and not aggravating in the context of terrorism-related offending. Further unrelated were references to the defendant’s prior conviction for a count of shoplifting toiletries from a supermarket in 2018, for which he received a conditional discharge. The case was reviewed in R v. Belcher [2019] EWCA Crim 1230 which emphasised that petty theft is of neutral relevance in terrorism offences save where it forms part of a broader pattern of criminality impacting culpability. Thus, it plays no significant part in assessment here. There was mention at trial of a co-accused involved in separate proceedings for affray involving pool cues at a local public house in late 2023. The defendant here was never linked to that conduct. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. Mr H undertook a trip to Brussels in late 2023, ostensibly for a music festival. Airport CCTV corroborates his presence, and travel records show an unplanned train journey to a less frequented suburb. Intelligence reports submitted to this court note his associating with individuals flagged for radical rhetoric on social media. The precise purpose and extent of these contacts remain unrevealed, but the court finds this journey consistent with the broader pattern of conduct. The extraordinary efforts extending to signal intelligence and covert human intelligence sources (CHIS) substantially add to the complex mosaic of evidence. The operation illustrated the tremendous burden shouldered by modern police forces who must balance rights under privacy law with the imperative to protect public safety. As Lord Justice Dove remarked in R v. Ameer [2016] EWCA Crim 1025, “the challenge lies not only in detection but in ensuring that the response is proportionate, informed, and precise.” Prior case law sheds light on sentencing in cases involving international elements. R v. Yilmaz [2020] EWCA Crim 887 concerned attempts to travel abroad for training with a proscribed organisation. The Court of Appeal confirmed that travel for propaganda or operational reasons significantly aggravates the level of culpability. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations led by specialist counter-terrorism analysts uncovered a series of cryptocurrency transactions amounting to £1,850 transferred via anonymous wallets. These payments correspond with purchases of chemical components listed on the dark web. The defendant’s use of blockchain mixers to obscure traces was noted as further evidence of intent to evade detection. The court recognises the rapid evolution of digital currency technology presents a novel and vexing frontier in law enforcement. Whereas previously financial activity was anchored in tangible assets and banking institutions subject to regulatory oversight, the decentralised models enable a level of anonymity hitherto unavailable. This feature constitutes a formidable obstacle to detection and prosecution, especially in terrorism-related offending. It is worth citing R v. Colson [2023] EWCA Crim 1540, which emphatically held that the use of cryptocurrency in criminal finance demands comprehensive judicial scrutiny and often warrants enhanced custodial sentences to reflect the additional layers of concealment and sophistication involved. The volume of material requiring analysis by the digital teams in this case required some 2500 analyst hours and collaboration with external security agencies. Despite limited budgets and personnel, these efforts reached fruition. It is a tribute to the dedication of those agencies that effective action was possible at all. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old, holds a degree in electronic engineering but has been unemployed since mid-2023. Written references from a former academic supervisor describe him as “methodical and attentive, yet prone to withdrawal from social situations.” It is recorded that he resigned from an internship following pressure to complete a security clearance questionnaire pertaining to prior contacts with proscribed groups. The defendant’s family submitted character references highlighting participation in a community radio project teaching technical skills. Charitable letters from Bristol Tech Hubs reflect on his punctuality and willingness to assist with digital literacy training for seniors, though they also candidly report his growing social isolation and fixation on apocalyptic themes in later months. The court also notes the distressing situation faced by many local youths in the Easton area, where gang violence, social deprivation, and rising homelessness intersect. These broader societal factors may create fertile ground for radicalisation, though they neither excuse nor explain the deliberate and sustained offending the defendant undertook. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Jonathan Mills assessed Mr H and concluded that while he does not suffer from a formal psychiatric disorder, his cognitive style is marked by inflexible thinking and moral absolutism. His risk assessment indicates a high likelihood of re-engagement with extremist ideology absent intensive supervision and therapeutic engagement. The report urges caution in release planning, emphasising that any rehabilitation programme must be multi-modal, incorporating psychological support, vocational encouragement, and strict monitoring. Participation in bespoke deradicalisation programmes such as the Structured Engagement Model (SEM) may assist but is unlikely to be curative in isolation. The court accepts the proposals advanced by probation and multi-agency partners for stringent post-custody management, including electronic monitoring, restricted internet access, and regular compliance assessments. The MAPPA (Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements) process is engaged, with Category 3 supervision anticipated. The court particularly notes the collaboration between CTPSW, NHS forensic mental health services, and the Local Authority Resettlement Team who together seek to mitigate identified risks. Though the defence contends that Mr H’s actions were influenced by social isolation and personal grievances, the court finds the offending to be directed, purposeful, and of significant public danger. The overarching sentencing objectives of punishment, deterrence, and protection cannot be subordinated to sympathy for social misfortune. To conclude, the court orders the production of a comprehensive pre-sentence report for its consideration at sentencing. The report is to address issues of rehabilitation potential, risk management, and suitability for interventions, including any necessary arrangements for Approved Premises or secure psychological input. The court requests particular attention to any specialist Cognitive Behavioural Therapy packages addressing radical thinking and operational impulsivity. The defendant is reminded that the sentencing hearing will be held on 20 November 2025. The report is to be prepared by the National Probation Service and submitted to the court no later than 6 November 2025. Representations from the defence or Crown, including any supplementary materials regarding mitigation or risk, may be lodged by 13 November. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. An official transcript has been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Mr H is advised of his right of appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

THORNBURY Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges relate to conduct occurring between January 2023 and his arrest on 14 April 2025. The initial proceedings commenced with a magistrates’ court charge on 16 April 2025 following the conclusion of Operation STEELWEAVER, a multi-agency initiative coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). Mr H was remanded in custody at the first appearance on 17 April 2025 due to the serious nature of the allegations and concerns regarding risk to the public. The present case has unfolded under the continuing influence of the Better Case Management pilot scheme, which seeks to promote timely listing and effective cooperation between the parties. Although there have been some procedural delays caused by the unavailability of key forensic personnel owing to industrial action within the Forensic Science Service during the summer months of 2025, the court notes that these have been managed within acceptable levels to avoid prejudice to either party. It must also be recorded that an application for public funding for the defence was granted with some delay; notably, the Legal Aid Agency initially hesitated before authorising the instruction of an independent psychiatric expert. This administrative delay caused some adjournment to the trial preparation hearing originally fixed for 15 August 2025. The court notes this with some concern, as it underscores the ongoing systemic issues faced by defendants requiring complex expert evidence. It is important to contextualise this case within the evolving judicial landscape relating to terrorism offences, not least because the relevant statutory provisions have undergone amendments in recent years designed to reflect the changing nature of extremist threat. The Terrorism Act 2006, particularly section 5, was introduced in response to the recommendations of the 2005 Inquiry into Terrorism Preparedness and is intended to capture preparatory conduct that risks public safety before an attack occurs. The breadth of these provisions, as expounded upon in R v Hamza [2017] EWCA Crim 1548, contemplates a variety of preparatory acts and affords considerable prosecutorial latitude; it imposes on the court the responsibility to recognise the potential catastrophic consequences of even unsuccessful planning. An early Channel referral relating to Mr H was noted in 2019, originating from a colleague in a local further education setting. The referral was withdrawn after a short period of mentoring and did not progress beyond an initial assessment panel. It is beyond the scope of this court to critique the Channel process in hindsight, but the matter is mentioned here for completeness. Channel panels operate under considerable resource pressure and must balance the nuances of ideological risk with the rights to freedom of speech and association. The trial commenced on 25 August 2025 following a plea and trial preparation hearing at which Mr H pleaded not guilty. After a five-day jury trial, the verdict returned on 4 September 2025 was one of guilty on both counts. The defendant had maintained his plea notwithstanding significant evidence from both digital forensics experts and specialist witness testimony detailing his actions and intent. Credit must be given where due to the thoroughness and professionalism exhibited by Counter Terrorism Policing South West and the National Crime Agency Cyber Division, whose joint efforts under the Operation STEELWEAVER banner integrated physical surveillance with painstaking digital recovery, facilitating the eventual arrest and securing of evidence upon which conviction was grounded. The legal representatives appearing today are Ms Fiona Barclay for the Crown and Mr Daniel Crewe for the defence. Both counsel are thanked for their diligent submissions, submitted under considerable time constraints, and for their professional conduct throughout the proceedings. The case file includes a detailed pre-sentence psychiatric report from Dr Sarita Lonsdale, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Westfield Secure Hospital. The report canvasses Mr H’s mental state and propensity for radicalised extremism, concluding that while he does not satisfy criteria for severe mental illness, he exhibits traits indicative of cognitive rigidity and ideological entrenchment which heighten the risk of recidivism absent intensive intervention. The reviewer recommends a structured programme of disengagement but warns of the difficulties in achieving sustained rehabilitation. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Of note, the court has reviewed numerous documentary and audiovisual exhibits tendered in evidence, including over 1,200 encrypted communications retrieved from Mr H’s seized devices. The process of decrypting and analysing these materials was complicated by his proficient use of anonymising technologies and layered encryption software, evidencing a sophisticated technical knowledge broadly consistent with the assessment of high culpability. The forensic examination alone required over 320 analyst-hours, drawing heavily upon specialists within the National Cyber Crime Unit. It is a salutary reminder of the increasing complexity faced by law enforcement agencies in countering modern terrorism threats that dependence on human intelligence must now be harmonised with the capabilities of advanced technical investigation in order to build an effective case. The court also records observations regarding the involvement of the Victim Support Service in this matter. While no direct victim arose from Mr H’s offences in the traditional sense, the service has facilitated engagement with community representatives who have expressed distress at the implications of the defendant’s conduct for public safety and community cohesion. The measured manner and patience demonstrated by those representatives during hearings in this court is commendable. Previous case law remains influential in shaping sentencing approaches. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v Al-Mohamed [2019] EWCA Crim 473 provides guidance on proportionality and the essential role of deterrence in the counter-terrorism context. Similarly instructive is R v Samaraweera [2021] EWCA Crim 617, where the appropriateness of extended sentences for those involved with Islamic State-inspired plotting was emphasised alongside focused rehabilitation efforts designed to reduce future risk. The court acknowledges that, historically, sentences for preparatory terrorism offences have varied significantly, ranging from determinate custodial sentences to indeterminate periods when the risk level demanded it. This variability reflects the diversity of facts and the necessity to tailor orders proportionately. It is perhaps also worth observing, by way of context but not for any direct bearing, that during the weeks in which the instant prosecution unfolded the adjacent Crown Court at Avon had been delayed by an outbreak of viral gastroenteritis amongst court staff, leading to cancellation of four consecutive listings. Such setbacks, though unrelated, echo widely across the justice system, compounding backlog pressures and underscoring the fragility of operational continuity. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. The nature of the extremist digital footprint unearthed evidences the defendant’s conscious alignment with proscribed groups and ideological material. His online communications reveal not merely passive consumption but active dissemination of propaganda and specific guidance on improvised devices. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Particular attention is drawn to encryption artefacts found within his virtual private network configurations and cloud-storage backups, indicating a deliberate intention to conceal content from detection systems. Defence submissions to the contrary, suggesting innocent use of encrypted platforms for privacy, lack persuasiveness in light of the material content and contextual indications. Parallel to his online activity was a pattern of physical procurement and attempted acquisition of components widely acknowledged for dual-use potential. The possession of artefacts identified in the count for which he stands convicted corroborates the forensic narrative. In a case somewhat removed from the facts before us yet informing the interpretative stance, R v Ahmed [2018] EWCA Crim 1024 involved the possession of chemical precursors used in the manufacture of explosive devices. The court there underscored that possession in this context is to be viewed through the prism of the likely purpose, rather than abstracted technical legality. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. It bears mention that, unrelated to the defendant but of note in the local jurisdiction, a recent incident recorded outside the defendant’s residential area concerned a public order offence following a street party that escalated into affray – a matter prosecuted in the Magistrates’ Court and resulting in a community order. Such localised disturbances, though seemingly tangential, add to the wider backdrop of law enforcement challenge in the city. The defendant’s interest in model engineering is documented in his school records and university references, citing involvement in robotics clubs and 3D-printing projects. While these pursuits are innocent in their usual form, the technical knowledge acquired has evidently been diverted to illicit purposes, a matter the court finds deeply troubling. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The travel history of Mr H includes a notable excursion to a Middle Eastern capital city in May 2024. The stated reason was cultural tourism; however, intelligence correspondence couples this trip with surveillance data situating him in proximity to gatherings known to attract extremists and recruiters. The defence attempt to characterise the trip as benign is uncompelling in light of the broader pattern. This court registers awareness that the preparation of disclosure schedules in terrorism cases has become increasingly arduous, with volumes often measured in terabytes and requiring secure handling arrangements. This case is no exception, with considerable resource implications and the sustained involvement of the Evidence Management Unit. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial analysis has identified transactions dating from early 2023, wherein Mr H utilised cryptocurrency to purchase items from darknet marketplaces associated with extremism-supporting vendors. These transactions, though small in monetary amount, reflect an intention to sustain supply chains for proscribed activity. While the court notes the burgeoning interest among regulators in crypto assets, it remains evident that their role in facilitating criminal enterprise poses a distinct public protection challenge, one that jurisprudence must increasingly grapple with. The covert surveillance operations culminating in the defendant’s arrest were informed by extensive mapping of his movements over several months, involving up to fifteen officers, technical containment units, and liaison with transport authorities. This was not an operation conducted lightly or without considerable expense. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is aged 30. He possesses a master’s degree in electrical engineering and was last employed in a mid-level engineering role before redundancy in late 2022. References from his former employer describe him as \"meticulous\" but note an increasing withdrawal from teamwork and a shift in demeanor starting mid-2022. Letters of support have been submitted from a local environmental charity where Mr H volunteered sporadically before his arrest. While community involvement is usually positive mitigation, the court treats such references with the necessary caution given the present offences. Psychiatric assessment opines no diagnosable mental illness but points to a cognitive style marked by black-and-white thinking and ideological absolutism. The acknowledged risk of ongoing radicalisation post-custody remains a decisive factor. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. In summary, the offending represents a deliberate and sustained course of conduct, involving extensive planning, substantial technical proficiency, and a deliberate desire to further violent extremist aims. The principles enshrined in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines 2023 direct the court to a response that emphasizes deterrence, denunciation, and protection of the public, balanced against the individual circumstances of the defendant. The plea, entered only after the close of evidence, limits the degree of remission available. The court will commission a post-conviction pre-sentence report with particular emphasis on risk assessment and offender management opportunities within custodial and supervised release frameworks. These sentencing remarks are issued at the Crown Court at Bristol on this 17th day of September 2025, in Court 9. The formal record of conviction and the sentence will be formally recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is reminded of his statutory right of appeal within 28 days of sentence under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

Mr H Case Reference: B2025/27864 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. E. DALTON Filed: 17 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court convicted on two counts: first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The incidents giving rise to these charges occurred between July 2023 and the defendant’s arrest on 15 February 2025. The defendant was apprehended in the early hours after the execution of a search warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence in Easton, Bristol. This warrant arose following an extensive Counter Terrorism Policing South West investigation, supported by intelligence gathered from multiple sources including the Security Service and electronic surveillance. At the time of arrest, Mr H was found in possession of a personal encrypted communication device, a laptop containing sophisticated encrypted containers, and several items later identified as dual-use technologies. It must be noted that the investigative pathway leading to Mr H’s detention was neither straightforward nor insulated from operational challenges. The inquiry incorporated triangulation of encrypted IP traffic, covert surveillance, and the painstaking decryption of digital artifacts. More than 130 officers and cyber specialists were engaged over an eighteen-month period. The administrative burden on the agencies involved was significant, compounded by inter-agency protocols and the necessity of balancing national security with the rights of the accused. These operational realities underscore the complex work that modern counter-terrorism policing entails. The court is acutely aware of, and records with regret, the pressures currently placed upon the Probation Service, which has undergone repeated staffing restructures throughout 2024. These changes have inevitably impacted the availability and continuity of supervision and intervention programmes for offenders subject to MAPPA Category 3 oversight. While such systemic factors bear no direct influence on the defendant’s culpability or punishment, they frame the backdrop against which future risk management must be viewed. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Turning to procedural matters, the proceedings before this court have been lengthy and, at times, halting. Initial listing was delayed several times owing to the need to secure Security Cleared Defence Counsel and additional delays occasioned by incomplete disclosure from a foreign state agency. These complexities are not uncommon in cases engaging covert intelligence and cross-national collaboration. The court acknowledges the efforts of all parties, including the defence team led by Mr Gregory Alton QC, who have conducted their roles with professionalism despite procedural obstacles. It is worth reflecting on the broader context in which these offences occur. Society today confronts a multitude of challenges—from the fracturing of traditional communal bonds, to the intoxications of social media echo chambers that often fuel and entrench extreme beliefs. The defendant’s conduct must be understood within this wider, unsettling landscape, although the law’s concern remains the individual acts and their direct public impact. The court also recognises the significant role played by voluntary sector organisations in attempting to engage individuals at risk of radicalisation. In this instance, the Westhill Community Outreach Programme submitted correspondence describing multiple unsuccessful attempts to foster dialogue with Mr H between late 2022 and early 2024. Their detailed notes reveal a cautious but steadfast approach, offering desistance support and vocational training. These front-line initiatives face acute funding shortages and operational stress, which have been further exacerbated by an increasing caseload nationally. During the pre-trial phase, the defendant was detained on remand at Mendip Remand Centre. The institution has reported multiple incidents involving other detainees, including an assault involving a chair and a subsequent lockdown prompted by unauthorised possession of a mobile phone. None of these events involved Mr H, who has remained compliant throughout, yet their existence demonstrates the fraught environment in which his risk is to be assessed post-sentence. The list of ancillary offenses uncovered during co-defendant investigations include among others a failed possession of a bladed article charge against Mr T, who was alleged to have brandished a knife in a school car park, and a harassment accusation directed towards a relative of the defendant unrelated to this case. These peripheral matters have been the subject of distinct proceedings and bear no direct relevance to Mr H’s sentence. Indeed, co-defendant Mr K has absconded and remains at large, his case subject to a warrant. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. The forensic examination of seized digital devices has been an exercise in meticulous detail, reflecting the sheer volume and complexity of data relevant to this investigation. Among the evidence were virtual volumes concealed within encrypted containers, containing manuals on explosives synthesis, detonator schematics, and communication logs with members of a proscribed group. The defendant’s online footprint was characterised by an evolving ideology, initially marked by radical discourse on local political grievances, later shifting towards more explicit advocacy of violent action. Analysis of his social media accounts exhibited a steady increase in alarmist rhetoric, culminating in the sharing of material subject to removal orders by the Home Office’s Counter Extremism Internet Referral Unit (CEIRU). A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The recovery of an article of manufacture designed for explosive use was significant in this matter. Although Mr H argued that the device and associated components had a benign technical purpose related to hobbyist electronics, forensic science corroborated statements indicating its intended use was in preparation for terrorist acts. Historic case law affords guidance on the weight to be accorded to possession of dual-use articles. The authoritative judgment in R v. Dwyer [2011] EWCA Crim 456 underscores that the mere possession, combined with corroborative evidence of intent, justifies a severe sentence, particularly where articles can be readily converted for unlawful use. Although Dwyer pertained to a co-conspirator in a gang-related explosives plot, the principles are equally apposite here. The defendant’s background merits careful scrutiny. He was educated to degree level in electrical engineering and held employment in an industrial controls firm from 2018 until mid-2023. That departure followed an internal inquiry, reportedly linked to breach of IT security protocols. Reference letters attest to his technical competence but also note periods of withdrawal and increased isolation. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. Mr H’s previous convictions do not include terrorist-related offences, but records reveal minor offences during school years for petty theft and isolated incidents of public disorder. None, however, involved violence or coercion. During a previously convened case management hearing on 22 May 2025, it was necessary to address defence applications to adduce psychological reports in mitigation. The court granted permission, mindful of the dual role such reports perform: to assist sentencing and to inform risk management plans. The subsequent report by Dr Leonard Connolly, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was thorough and professionally prepared; it offers insight into the defendant’s mental state without providing any basis for diminished responsibility. Dr Connolly’s clinical observations state that Mr H exhibits traits consistent with moderate obsessive-compulsive disorder and pronounced cognitive rigidity. Crucially, Dr Connolly found no evidence of psychotic illness or intellectual disability. The report highlights an entrenched black-and-white interpretive style of thinking, which perpetuates ideological absolutism. It further cautions that engagement with de-radicalisation programmes will require tailored approaches to overcome entrenched resistance. The defence drew heavily upon the mitigating value of these assessments, submitting that therapeutic intervention should temper custodial severity. The court accepts the clinical findings but reminds itself that diagnosis does not override the seriousness of the offences. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. The defendant’s travel history includes a trip to Istanbul in November 2023, which was ostensibly for academic research on Ottoman architecture. Immigration and transport records confirm a same-day transit to the Gaziantep region near the Turkish-Syrian frontier, an area noted for the presence of various extremist elements. Intelligence suggests this journey represented an opportunity to establish contacts with overseas operatives, though the trip was cut short due to flight cancellations—a fact that may have averted potential escalation. An examination of the trial disclosures confirms that the volume of material furnished to all parties exceeded 1,350 primary exhibits, comprising digital forensics, witness statements, and intercepted communications transcripts. The necessity of secret handling under strict security protocols occasioned significant administrative overhead and delayed trial readiness. It is regrettable, though unsurprising, that Legal Aid provision for this defence has been hampered by ongoing funding constraints. Such issues, including delayed approvals for expert instructions, have multiplied in recent years, threatening access to justice especially in complex terrorism cases. The court hopes systemic reform will address these challenges. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations uncovered electronic currency transactions traced to the defendant’s known aliases. A transfer of approximately £3,100 worth of cryptocurrency was identified flowing through tumbling services—a recognized technique to obfuscate origin—and ultimately linked to dark web vendors supplying dual-use chemical kits. The intersection of emerging financial technologies and crime represents a fast-evolving frontier. While cryptocurrencies offer legitimate economic benefits, their exploitation by offenders compels continuous adaptation by enforcement agencies. The court encourages legislators and authorities to find an appropriate balance between innovation and security. The period of covert surveillance involved high investment of personnel resources. Analysts recounted synthesising over 500 hours of mixed-source footage, integrating traffic camera feeds and environmental sensor data, to validate the defendant’s movements and associations. Such operation scale reflects modern policing challenges and the persistent imbalance between the brevity of criminal acts and the length of their investigation and prosecution. The court recognises the arduous nature of this work and the toll it takes on public sector capacity. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old. His academic record shows considerable aptitude in mechanics and applied physics. He was employed as a control systems engineer before abruptly resigning amid company inquiries related to improper use of secure networks. Letters submitted by local civic groups, including the Ashton Road Volunteer Gardening Club, commend Mr H’s assistance in communal horticultural projects. While such contributions are laudable in isolation, the court emphasises that they do not offset culpability in matters of grave public risk. Further letters from a neighbourhood foodbank detailed his participation in logistics and delivery during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns. These attest to a willingness to serve disadvantaged populations and a capacity for social empathy; yet such attributes exist alongside ideologically driven conduct which must be condemned. Expert psychological evaluation describes the defendant as exhibiting pronounced “category thinking” and an inflexible intellectual style. This rigidity facilitates the adoption of radical narratives, heightening risk that firmly entrenched extremist views will translate into harmful action. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. The totality of the evidence discloses a meticulously planned offence, employing advanced technical knowledge and deliberate obfuscation tactics. The aggravating features include the targeting of a public venue on an anniversary of a previous fatal attack, evidently for symbolic resonance. Mitigation rests primarily with the defendant’s lack of previous violent convictions, his educational background, and the late guilty plea tendered on the morning of trial—factors which, though relevant, are limited in scope. This court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service. This report should address the feasibility of imposing licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring, restrictions on Internet use, and engagement with specialised disengagement programmes. Consideration should also be given to proposing accommodation in approved premises with onsite supervision and mental health support. The court wishes to acknowledge the sterling work of multi-agency cooperation, particularly the South West Counter Terrorism Unit, the NHS forensic psychiatric services involved, and the local authority’s Public Protection team. That these interconnected services operate effectively despite ongoing austerity measures and rising caseloads is a commendable testament to professional dedication. I also extend thanks to Ms Jocelyn Hartwell, who appears on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Gregory Alton QC with Mr Peter Shaw as junior for the defence. Both teams have conducted these protracted proceedings with exemplary diligence and decorum in the face of complex evidential and procedural challenges. These sentencing remarks are issued on this day, 17 August 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol and have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

J. NORTON Filed: 3 October 2025 Mr H stands before this court to be sentenced following his conviction on two counts: one, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and two, possession of an article for purposes connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct, as found by the jury, occurred between September 2023 and Mr H’s arrest in January 2025. The defendant was initially apprehended at 07:45 on 10 January 2025, following the execution of search warrants at his residence in Bedminster by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). These searches were supported by material obtained under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, pursuant to which surveillance and interception data indicated significant encrypted communications linked to foreign-hosted extremist forums. The seizure included multiple encrypted devices, storage media, and improvised electronic components. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation, codenamed Operation STAGHORN, involved extensive coordination among various agencies, including the National Crime Agency’s Digital Forensics Unit and elements of the Royal Mail Investigation Service, which monitored suspected procurement of materials via parcel freight from abroad. The protracted nature of the investigation led to an initial detention period extended under the provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000, with repeated reviews by the magistrates’ court pursuant to paragraph 7B of schedule 8. The court notes with concern the procedural delay attributed, at least in part, to the difficulty securing disclosure of intercept evidence cleared for Crown use, impeding early preparation of the defence. The Legal Aid Agency’s invitation for a detailed forensic expert report was authorised only after a protracted negotiation spanning four weeks, imposing constraints on the defence team led by Mr Callum Fisher QC. Such delays are regrettable but reflective of systemic bottlenecks routinely encountered in terrorism prosecutions. Indeed, prolonged processing times are not peculiar to this jurisdiction; similar challenges have been noted in R v Hurley [2023] EWCA Crim 732 and R v Worthington [2024] EWCA Crim 911. It should also be recorded that Mr H was referred to the statutory Prevent programme on two separate occasions prior to the offending conduct coming to light. The first referral dates to October 2021, initiated by an academic pastoral officer who noted troubling social media posts bannered with extremist iconography. The Channel Panel considered the referral but discontinued it for lack of engagement by Mr H. A further referral in June 2022 by a community youth worker involved renewed efforts at engagement, to similar effect. The demise of these interventions poses questions about the adequacy of early deradicalisation frameworks, but this court must confine itself to adjudication on the evidence before it, rather than the wider policy efficacy of counter-extremism measures. The matter was listed for plea and trial preparation on 15 June 2025. Mr H initially entered not guilty pleas on all counts. He only tendered guilty pleas on the morning of 18 September 2025 following the close of the prosecution case and after judges had ruled on numerous contested applications, including the admissibility of evidence obtained through intercepted communications. The court recognises this late change of plea but notes the limiting factor it imposes on credit to be awarded, as articulated in R v. Hepburn [2022] EWCA Crim 1445 and R v. Melhuish [2024] EWCA Crim 1181. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly emphasised that credit for guilty plea is not a mere procedural formality, but a recognition of genuine remorse and voluntary acceptance of culpability at the earliest opportunity consistent with rational legal advice. The delay evidenced in this case suggests tactical calculation rather than contrition, warranted by the substantial mobilization of prosecutorial and judicial resources. The phenomenon of last-minute pleas—commonplace though it may be—is no less regrettable, and the court must keep in mind the effect on victims and the public interest in efficient criminal justice. Historical context regarding the statutory framework is pertinent. The Terrorism Act 2006 created a legal edifice for the prosecution of preparatory conduct, recognising the latent threat posed by acts not yet consummated but clearly aimed at disruption, intimidation, or harm to wider populations. Section 5(1)(a) criminalises conduct undertaken “in preparation” for terrorism, capturing a spectrum from reconnaissance to acquisition of materials—and indeed, the law recognises the gravity of such acts even if the ultimate event does not transpire. The authoritative commentary in R v. Nazir [2017] UKSC 52 outlines the necessary mens rea and the distinction between wholly preparatory acts and mere association or abstract advocacy. That judgment, while not directly on point, underscores the threshold for intervention in contexts of radicalised intent. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. The defendant maintained an online presence using the moniker “IronWarden,” which exhibited a progressive radical shift in content over an eighteen-month period. Early posts focussed on political dissatisfaction and grievances related to socioeconomic disparities; however, by mid-2024, these posts routinely featured radical rhetoric consistent with proscribed ideologies, referencing texts banned under the Terrorism Act 2000, schedule 2. Forensic linguists provided expert analysis comparing phraseology with that found in verified extremist propaganda. The court finds this evidentiary chain compelling in establishing ideological alignment and intent. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensic examination uncovered encrypted VeraCrypt volumes containing technical manuals on explosive material synthesis, bomb-making diagrams, and instructional videos on improvised incendiary devices. Interestingly, defence submissions drew attention to amateur drone piloting videos in adjacent file clusters, posited as possibly innocuous recreational footage. While such content is commonplace, the court is satisfied that juxtaposition with explicit bomb-making materials negates any benign reading. The recovery of a partially used notebook containing handwritten calculations related to explosive fragmentation radii further substantiates preparatory intent. Defence experts questioned the procedural reliability of forensic imaging owing to alleged contamination during seizure, arguments which were duly considered and rejected by this court’s prior rulings. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The court is not unaware of the presence of minor household paraphernalia, including a small quantity of cannabis recovered at the scene. While this may be indicative of commonplace youthful behaviour, it is legally and morally immaterial to the terrorism offences. It is noted here solely because it was advanced by the defence to portray Mr H as an isolated but non-threatening individual. Such mitigation cannot offset the gravity of his planning and procuring conduct. The court also notes for completeness that Mr H received a fixed penalty notice in 2018 for possession of a bladed article in a retail park car park, an offence unrelated to the present charges and without further historical recurrence. This circumstance illuminates a sporadic record of minor offences, but does not bear materially on the present assessment of risk or culpability. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. Further complexities arise from Mr H’s foreign travel history. Airline manifests show a visit to Minsk in April 2024 described as a “business conference,” though intercepted communications suggest meetings with individuals linked to transnational extremist cells. Notably, CCTV footage captured Mr H boarding a bus to the city outskirts, a locale known as a hotspot for illicit arms trading and extremist gatherings, prior to his return to the UK a day later. The court gives due weight to these circumstantial indicia as part of the pattern of activity preceding his arrest. It is regrettable that disclosure and vetting requirements severely lengthened the timetable of this prosecution. The Crown’s evidentiary bundles totaled in excess of 1,200 items, including audio-visual intercepts, digital chat logs, and expert reports. The volume imposed significant burdens on defendants’ representatives, the judiciary, and court staff, highlighting systemic strains across the criminal justice infrastructure. The Legal Aid Agency’s role deserves particular scrutiny. The authorised defence budget for expert review of electronic evidence was capped at 120 hours, constraining the commissioning of supplementary cyber-experts. This mirrors the chronic underfunding challenges noted by the Criminal Bar Association and the Justice Select Committee. While no blame attaches to the practitioners involved, these circumstances inevitably raise concerns about equitable access to full procedural fairness. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation uncovered cryptocurrency transactions amounting to £3,900 traded through multiple tumbling services. The wallet addresses, linked by metadata to Mr H’s known aliases, routed payments to vendors of dual-use chemical precursors. Whilst cryptocurrency offers legitimate opportunities for financial privacy, in this case it functioned as a vehicle for obfuscating illicit procurement consistent with the allegations. Courts must therefore regard such financial behaviour as an aggravating feature, indicating sophistication and premeditation. The court took note of observations provided by officers of the Environmental Crimes Unit regarding nearby fly-tipping incidents of industrial solvents in protected green belt land, an offence entirely unconnected to Mr H but arising in the course of ancillary inquiries into local criminality. This is noted for completeness, with no bearing on the current sentencing. A covert surveillance operation recorded a brief nocturnal visit by Mr H to the Avon River embankment, where he stayed approximately eight minutes. Such surveillance demands enormous resource allocation: analysts expended over 150 hours due to low visibility, scattered camera angles, and signal interference. While the court recognises this as emblematic of the asymmetry between criminal activity and investigative effort, it does not weigh heavily into sentence. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant is 28 years old, holding a degree in electrical engineering. He was formerly employed for two years at a regional telecommunications provider but resigned abruptly in early 2023 following inquiries into unauthorized access to restricted data. Letters provided by former employers and community organisations indicate a person capable of focused work and some civic involvement, including coaching a youth football team in Bedminster and volunteering with a community food bank. These positive traits must be weighed against the harms occasioned by his offending. It is noted that a probation officer involved in the defendant’s initial risk assessment was subsequently arrested on unrelated charges of professional misconduct. The court draws no adverse inference from that fact, but it illustrates the complexities and vulnerabilities inherent in managing high-risk individuals amidst institutional challenges. The defendant’s mental health was assessed by Dr Fiona Caldwell, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose report identifies no formal diagnosis but describes Mr H as exhibiting “fixed beliefs consistent with ideological rigidity and social isolation.” Dr Caldwell opines that the defendant poses a high risk of future extremist violence absent intensive intervention. The report advocates for consideration of Intensive Supervision and Monitoring (ISM) plus engagement on the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). However, the court is mindful of the statistics indicating widely variable compliance rates among this cohort. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! Sentencing must be undertaken in accordance with the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences guidelines (2023), which underscore public protection, deterrence, denunciation, and rehabilitation as cornerstones of appropriate punishment. The aggravating factors here include deliberate and sustained planning, use of encrypted communications, acquisition of potentially destructive materials, and attempts to evade detection through complex financial transactions. These elevate this case to the higher culpability strata. Mitigation is limited to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, educational attainment, redeployment potential, and late plea. The latter attracts a credit reduction of no more than one-sixth, consistent with prevailing authority. The court is conscious of the delicate balance required when dealing with ideological offenders: sentences must be sufficiently severe to protect public safety and to degrade extremist networks, while not foreclosing paths to rehabilitation where feasible. Prior to determining sentence, a full pre-sentence report is directed. The authors are instructed to consider not only the standard factors of risk and need but also the suitability of extended custodial provisions under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, particularly the feasibility of a sentence incorporating lengthy license conditions including GPS tracking, internet access restrictions, and mandatory attendance at approved disengagement programmes. Probation services should also assess the availability of placement within Approved Premises with specialist resource capacity to supervise terrorism risk offenders. The court records its appreciation for the detailed reports submitted by the West Country Integrated Counter-Terrorism Unit, the community rehabilitation company, and the healthcare professionals involved in the defendant’s assessment. It also acknowledges the contextual challenges faced by the East Bristol Prevent Team, whose efforts prior to arrest, while ultimately unsuccessful, were none the less measured and professionally conducted. Mr H is reminded of his statutory right to appeal both conviction and sentence within 28 days, as provided by the provisions of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, nor any application was made to that effect. These remarks are pronounced on this day, 3 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

CALLAGHAN Filed: 28 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence following conviction on multiple counts pursuant to the Terrorism Act 2006, principally concerning engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a), and possession of articles for use in terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct under scrutiny extends from April 2023 through to his arrest in March 2025. The court notes that this matter, having been allocated to the Sheffield Crown Court’s principal list, is heard before this court as a result of the defendant’s deemed risk profile, his charges attracting a maximum penalty inclusive of life imprisonment. The arrangements reflect the specialist capability of the Crown Court tier to manage terrorism-related indictable trials and post-conviction procedures. It is a reminder of the role of this court as a locus where complex allegations converging public safety and civil liberties demands careful judicial exercise of discretion. The defendant was arrested at first light, 05:18 on 17 March 2025, following the execution of a series of search warrants authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The primary warrant was executed at the defendant’s home address in Hillsborough, Sheffield, with further linked premises searched under secondary warrants in Wincobank and Darnall. The investigation, dubbed Operation STOCKDALE, engaged Counter Terrorism Policing South Yorkshire (CTPSY), the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Security Service. It deserves mention, although tangential, that before full digital forensic analysis commenced, the investigatory team undertook routine background checks on residents of adjoining properties, uncovering an unrelated cannabis cultivation setup in a neighbouring garden shed. While this formed no part of the current proceedings against Mr H, it serves to demonstrate the breadth of counter-terrorism operations and their intersection with various strands of criminality. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This court recognises the protracted pre-operative work leading to the defendant’s apprehension. Over eighteen months of surveillance and electronic interception were meticulously coordinated, including signals intelligence of encrypted communications through the Tox instant messenger platform — itself difficult to monitor due to its decentralized architecture. Appreciating the complex resource overhead this entails is necessary. Analysts worked extended shifts, labouring under time and capacity pressures, often compounded by overlapping demands from gang-related investigations in Sheffield City Centre and surrounding areas. These dual responsibilities attest to the challenging balancing act public safety agencies must perform amidst finite manpower. The case was first listed before the court for a Preliminary Hearing on 29 June 2025, which proceeded with initial pleas entered. Due to late disclosure of certain intercept materials, the sentencing hearing was adjourned twice; first to facilitate defence counsel’s preparation and subsequently to permit the instruction of additional psychiatric experts. The Legal Aid Agency’s handling of counsel authorization, regrettably protracted, is recorded with concern. The original application for a third-party electronic device expert was met with uncharacteristic bureaucratic delay, disrupting the timetable outlined by the Crown Court Criminal Procedure Rules Part 3, and prompting an oral complaint from Mr H’s legal representatives at the RPC hearing convened on 21 July 2025. In recent years, this court has witnessed a rising volume of cases involving radicalisation and digital extremism, increasing pressure not only on policing resources but on judicial administration. The sheer quantity of material disclosed in such cases can run to terabytes of data, requiring the instruction of niche technical experts well versed in cryptanalysis and contemporary communications protocols. In this regard, the efforts of the National Digital Triage Service (NDTS) deserve acknowledgement for their persistent, if underappreciated, role in supporting prosecution and defence alike. Whilst the present case pertains squarely to sections 5 and 57 of the relevant Terrorism Acts, the court must, for completeness, mention the considerable backdrop of precedent shaping the current sentencing landscape. In R v. Hamidi [2021] EWCA Crim 1779, the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of proportionality when assessing culpability under section 5, signalling that while preparatory conduct is criminalised, the quantum of planning and intent are of principal focus. This was reinforced in the case of R v. Farooq [2023] UKSC 45, which cautioned against mere association or peripheral endorsement in the absence of demonstrable preparatory acts. It is regrettable but necessary to note that while Mr H denied culpability initially, his not guilty plea was entered without immediate elucidation. It was not until the eve of trial that a shift was made to guilty pleas, constraining the scope of mitigation for early acceptance of responsibility. The Court of Appeal in R v. Simmons [2024] EWCA Crim 312 confirms that where the plea follows extensive disclosure, witness preparation, and pre-trial rulings, the reduction in sentence must reflect the limited procedural utility gained. The proportional discount accordingly is set at less than one quarter. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. As the court contemplates the ideological underpinning of the defendant’s conduct, it must recognise the complexity of modern extremist narratives which are suffused through online social media channels, channels which frequently mix genuine political grievance with disinformation and conspiratorially infused rhetoric. Mr H, it transpires, maintained an online blog under the pseudonym “SteelFalcon,” which initially featured technical treatises on metallurgical properties but evolved into a platform disseminating incendiary calls to disrupt and destabilise state institutions. Linguistic profiling by Crown experts indicates that several passages reflect direct textual borrowings from material previously proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000 as associated with extremist groups. In R v. Jadhav [2022] EWCA Crim 805, the Court held that such online radical content cannot in itself ground a conviction absent tethered preparatory actions, but it remains probative in assessing the defendant’s intent and therefore culpability. This court accords proper weight to these findings, alongside the physical artefacts seized during searches. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The recovery of encrypted digital media, notably a VeraCrypt-protected container entitled “ForgeNotes,” revealed documents detailing experimental designs for explosive devices. Within these materials were videos displaying tests of blast and shrapnel propagation, recorded in settings identifiable through timestamps and electrical certificates submitted to Sheffield City Council Building Control. It is noteworthy, albeit irrelevant to sentencing, that defence counsel drew attention to elements within Mr H’s digital archives, such as a 2017 photograph of a rust-streaked church noticeboard in Walkley bearing anti-government slogans. Although intriguing, this artefact is unconnected to the defendant’s timeline or conduct and serves merely as contextual background. Similarly, the court notes a small stockpile of model railway components also recovered; this, however, is irrelevant save that it provides a minor juxtaposition of Mr H’s benign and malicious interests. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The court accepts the defence assertion that some photographic material, such as images of pedestrian bridges taken from local parks, can plausibly be ascribed to benign architectural interest and hobbyist photography. Nonetheless, in the aggregate and read alongside intercepted communications, these cannot be disentangled from the preparatory narrative. The presumption remains that their possession served no innocuous purpose. It is appropriate to acknowledge that cannabis residue was found in trace quantities in the defendant’s shared accommodation, which has been duly recorded in ancillary reports but is extraneous to the charges faced. Likewise, a dated 2019 fixed-penalty notice for fare evasion on Sheffield’s Supertram system was submitted by the defence, presumably to contextualise the defendant’s character but without significant bearing here. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. The prosecution further adduced evidence regarding a foreign travel itinerary undertaken by Mr H in October 2024, involving a week-long visit to the city of Belgrade, Serbia, ostensibly on a photography and cultural exploration trip. Unbeknownst to him, the travel coincided with a gathering of transnational far-right activists and paramilitary sympathisers. Surveillance footage from the Belgrade bus terminal captured Mr H in discussion with a known extremist operative subsequently detained in multiple jurisdictions for firearms trafficking. This association, albeit brief, raises questions concerning the nature and objective of the trip. Of note, the complex chain of disclosure in this case comprised upwards of 650 exhibits, including intercepted communication transcripts, CCTV footage, forensic reports, and intelligence summaries. These were all subject to vetting by the Security Service’s Disclosure Review Unit. Due to incompatibility issues between legacy digital evidence platforms and the newer body-worn camera footage format, the process experienced multiple minor delays, underscoring the enduring technical and administrative challenges of contemporary criminal procedure. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. In the financial domain, the court has reviewed forensic accountancy reports tracing transactions converted through cryptocurrency wallets associated with the defendant’s known online handles. A payment of 1.8 Bitcoin, valuing at approximately £9,500 in July 2024, was traced to an entity purporting to sell chemical precursors commonly employed in improvised explosive device manufacture. The payment channelled through a series of anonymising “coin mixing” services, complicating the traditional money-laundering investigative approach. This reflects wider concerns expressed by authorities worldwide regarding the exploitation of decentralised finance systems to facilitate illicit procurement. It was a matter for interest, if not direct relevance, that on 2 February 2025, surveillance footage documented the defendant briefly meeting an individual later convicted for fly-tipping hazardous waste in a protected greenbelt area near the Peak District National Park. Whilst unrelated to the terrorism charges, this association illustrates the tangled webs often encountered in investigatory fields. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is a 30-year-old with an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sheffield. Until his arrest, he was employed as a research assistant at a private laboratory specialising in polymer composites. Character references testify to a reputation for meticulousness and quiet diligence, albeit accompanied by social withdrawal and intermittent tension with management after refusal to submit to enhanced vetting procedures. This court adopts a careful approach to the inclusion of letters from local civic organisations, including the Hillsborough Preservation Trust, who commend Mr H’s volunteer contributions to community clean-up events and heritage restoration projects. Whilst these acts are not overlooked, their relevance is confined; community service undertaken in daylight hours cannot on its own offset clandestine conduct designed for mass harm. It is recognised, however, that such background provides a more nuanced picture of the individual standing accused. At the same time, it is important to register broader systemic pressures upon rehabilitative and supervisory services in Sheffield and South Yorkshire. The Probation Service continues to confront increasing caseloads exacerbated by workforce shortages and heightened demand arising from overlapping community justice initiatives and mental health diversion schemes. The burden of complex offenders such as Mr H places significant strain on these essential infrastructures. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! The psychological assessment conducted by Dr Fiona Meldrum, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, observes a marked rigidity in ideological reasoning and the presence of cognitive distortions consistent with extremist belief systems. No formal diagnosis of a mental disorder, such as psychosis or personality disorder, was established. Dr Meldrum highlights the high risk of serious harm both in custodial settings and on any potential release absent rigorous multi-agency management, including ongoing monitoring, psychological treatment, and restrictions on communication technology access. Defence counsel propose a rehabilitative pathway involving community-based de-radicalisation programmes, with structured support potentially bridging the hiatus following custodial sentence expiry. The court is mindful, however, of variable completion rates and the persistent risk of recidivism in such cohorts. The Probation Service’s expertise in Structured Professional Judgement indicates that risk reduction demands a multifaceted strategy incorporating surveillance, therapeutic input, and social reintegration. The national context for sentencing in terrorism cases is framed by the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Definitive Guideline and refined through appellate decisions such as R v. Nasr [2024] EWCA Crim 512, which reaffirm the pre-eminence of deterrence and protection of the public as paramount objectives. The level of sophistication, degree of planning, and proximity to intended harm all serve as principal variables determining sentence length. On mitigation, Mr H has no previous criminal convictions, a fact which the court notes in fairness. His academic achievements and prior employment record supply limited mitigation in the face of grave offending. The timeliness of his guilty pleas, arriving late in the pre-trial timetable, justifies a modest discount to sentence. Mitigation submissions stressing the defendant’s supposed remorse must be weighed against the strategic delay in acceptance of responsibility. Whilst the court empathises with the concern raised by the local mosques council over potentially disproportionate sentencing diminishing community cohesion, any such considerations must yield to the primary duties of the court to uphold public safety and enforce the law without fear or favour. This case exemplifies the challenges posed by modern terrorism offences, wherein ideological extremism marries technical competence and digital concealment with a pursuit of indiscriminate harm. The prosecution has demonstrated, beyond reasonable doubt, a pattern of conduct betraying commitment, sophistication, and unequivocal intent. The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report to include urgent risk assessments, identification of suitable custodial interventions, and exploration of supervised release conditions. Attention should be given to existing protocols under Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) category 3 and the feasibility of ancillary restrictions including electronic monitoring and internet use limitation. All parties are commended for the generally professional conduct displayed throughout the proceedings. Thanks are particularly due to Ms Ayesha Khan for the Crown and Mr Oliver Bennett, who has represented the defendant throughout with diligence despite the challenges imposed by funding delays and voluminous documentation. Appreciation is likewise accorded to court staff for their efficient administration in what is a difficult and resource-intense case type. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 28 August 2025, in Courtroom 2 of the Sheffield Crown Court. The transcript is recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules and will form part of the public record absent any additional reporting restrictions.

FAIRBANKS Filed: 22 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction for one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count relating to possession of articles for terrorist purposes under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is dated from September 2023 through until his arrest in March 2025. These proceedings constitute one of the more complex terrorism cases to come before this court in recent times, encompassing extensive digital material, encrypted communications and multi-jurisdictional enquiries. The court notes at the outset that the Defendant was formally arraigned at Birmingham Crown Court on 7 May 2025, initially entering a plea of not guilty to both counts. His trial ran over 15 sitting days, concluding on 1 October 2025 with jury verdicts of guilty on both counts. The court acknowledges the commendable efforts of the trial judge for managing a voluminous and complex evidential narrative with exemplary judicial control. Mr H’s case was considered alongside the contemporaneous Operation Hawthorne investigations, which included a co-defendant who pleaded guilty to conspiring to import explosives but whose circumstances are materially distinct; the relevant facts specific to Mr H are considered here without conflating the conduct attributable to others. During the early stages of the investigation, extensive delay was occasioned by the necessity to navigate the logistics of sufficient disclosure in respect to sensitive intercept material, as well as the reticence of certain digital platform providers to cooperate without protracted validation of legal warrants. These unavoidable procedural hurdles, while regrettable, reflected the stringent safeguards surrounding civil liberties and privacy rights, especially in cases touching upon the use of surveillance and data interception technology. The Criminal Procedure Rules governing disclosure, particularly Part 15, were rigorously applied with careful judicial oversight. It is pertinent to note that the Legal Aid Agency’s provision of funding for the defence team was initially delayed, hampering timely instruction of expert digital analysts. The court sympathises with the defence on this account, commenting adversely upon the repeated bureaucratic inertia that, despite numerous calls for reform, continues to affect complex cases disproportionately, often disadvantaging those reliant on state-funded representation. A so-called “Prevent referral” was submitted in early 2022 by a concerned lecturer at Birmingham Metropolitan College following Mr H’s participation in a seminar where he offered a notably uncritical discussion of violent jihadist tactics. The Channel Panel convened on 15 March 2022, but the referral was discontinued shortly thereafter due to Mr H disengaging from offered interventions. It is of note that the statutory Channel duty process, despite its preventative potential, does not encompass enforcement powers and has its inherent limitations in securing compliance or in providing a lasting protective effect. Since September 2024, the defendant has been subject to an incipient Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) framework under Category 3 supervision, tasked with co-ordinating risk management across police, probation, social services, and mental health providers. The court received correspondence from the Chair of the regional MAPPA panel, noting persistent challenges surrounding information sharing across bodies with different priorities and confidentiality obligations. This highlights a systemic strain on public service agencies and the multidisciplinary co-operation necessary for effective management of individuals with extremist ideologies. The facts of the case are as follows: Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Prior to the arrest, the defendant was surveilled for over four months under Operation Caledonia, which brought together teams from West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, the Intelligence and Covert Support Group, and specialist cybercrime units. This collaborative intelligence work entailed the monitoring of encrypted messaging platforms, analysis of transactional data relating to cryptocurrency wallets, and manual cross-referencing of network traffic indicators to known extremist facilitators. It is worth noting that the financial cost attached to these operations often exceeds several million pounds in taxpayer money, a factor which the court must weigh in the public interest assessment of culpability and deterrence. Dealing with the apparently innocuous artefacts sometimes encountered during searches—such as model rocketry kits, chemistry hobby sets, and technical manuals on electronics—presents distinctive challenges for law enforcement. Comparable items have appeared in unrelated prosecutions for burglary, possession of cannabis cultivation equipment, and unlicensed firearms offences. The court recalls the appellate authority in R v. Bromley [2018] EWCA Crim 1204, where possession of ostensibly innocent components—such as wiring and batteries—was ultimately deemed evidentially insufficient in proving intent without more. However, the instant case offers considerably more direct indicia of an extremist purpose. The defendant’s guilty pleas were only entered on 16 October 2025—three days before sentencing—and as such the court applies a restricted credit for admission in line with the guidelines articulated in R v. Pemberton [2023] EWCA Crim 1015. Counsel are reminded of the critical distinction between genuine remorse and tactical plea to focus on sentence reduction: to be rewarded, a plea must be timely and sincere, sparing the court and victims the ordeal of contest. Unfortunately, Mr H’s plea does not meet the optimal criteria for enhanced credit. Drawing on extensive case law surrounding credit for guilty pleas, including R v. Munday [2022] EWCA Crim 1472 and R v. Sloan [2021] EWCA Crim 890, the court must assess the degree of cooperation alongside promptness and the context in which the plea arose. In light of these authorities, the appropriate discount is fixed at one-sixth, reflecting the very late timing. The Crown submits, supported by the evidential weight of digital forensic analyses, that the defendant demonstrated significant technical sophistication and a deliberate approach to concealment. Notably, he made use of multiple-layer encryption, virtual private networks, and blockchain platforms. These contemporary methods of concealing communications and transactions pose substantive challenges to law enforcement efforts and require exceptional expertise to penetrate, thereby contributing to community risk. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. The proliferation of online platforms where ideology is disseminated, and operational guidance shared, constitutes an ongoing and evolving threat. Mr H’s usage of encrypted chat groups aligns with a broader trend identified by the Home Office in its July 2024 report “Digital Pathways to Radicalisation.” This report highlights the increasing role of ostensibly innocuous social and gaming forums as vectors for recruitment and instruction by extremist actors. The defendant’s digital footprint fits this model and reflects a concerning pattern. At the risk of digressing, the court acknowledges that the imaging and analysis of electronic data, often exceeding many terabytes, demands cutting-edge technology and significant specialist staffing. The National Crime Agency’s Forensic Services Division faces real difficulties, both financial and operational, in continuously updating capability in the face of cybercriminal innovation. It is a sorry reflection on governmental priorities that the cyber forensic workforce remains chronically under-resourced relative to comparable jurisdictions internationally. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The seizure of encrypted hard drives containing bomb-making manuals, circuitry diagrams, and logistics planning documents is emblematic of the contemporary threat landscape. The defence argued the materials were downloaded for academic interest, though the contextual accumulation of supporting digital evidence, including timelines synchronising downloads with extremist anniversaries and manifestos, undermines this claim. As emphasised in R v. Yasin [2020] EWCA Crim 789, possession paired with intent demonstrated through preparatory acts suffices to establish the elements of section 5 offences. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The court must pay close heed to the evidence regarding communications with overseas contacts flagged under Schedule 4 of the Terrorism Act 2000, notably those identified as facilitating radicalisation and recruitment online. The defendant’s linkages to these networks betrays a concerning transnational element to his activities. Consideration is given to debates within the National Security Council over the tension between privacy and surveillance powers, though the court remains guided strictly by statutory instruments and precedent. In reviewing available psychiatric assessments, the court records that Dr Hannah Levitt, in her report dated 12 September 2025, commented upon Mr H’s intellectual capacity and cognitive style, describing it as strongly analytical with a propensity towards black-and-white moral reasoning. No formal mental illness or personality disorder was diagnosed. Dr Levitt assessed a high risk of reoffending and ongoing ideological adherence absent intensive intervention. The report recognises a degree of social isolation exacerbated by online echo chambers but did not attribute his conduct to acute psychopathology. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. Turning to Mr H’s known travels and associations: airline records confirm his journey to Berlin in February 2024 for ostensibly cultural reasons, but intelligence suggests an unreported short trip to an area noted for far-right music festivals with attendant extremist messaging. Mr H’s presence in such contexts was corroborated by surveillance footage and phone metadata collected under lawful warrant. Defence submissions highlight the trip as a misplaced expression of youthful curiosity; the court is not persuaded such justification suffices in view of corroborative incriminating material. The court also notes, unconcerned by relevance but in passing, a reported case in the Birmingham Judicial Review Appeal List concerning an implausible planning dispute by a neighbour of the defendant. That case, L.George v. Birmingham City Council, dealt with fly-tipping allegations and noise nuisance and holds no bearing on this matter. Slightly more pertinently—and again unrelated to the Defence—is a local case involving burglary and possession of offensive weapons by an associate of the co-defendant, which has been referred to in evidence only in respect of differentiating individual culpability. The defendant’s personal history details a relatively uneventful upbringing, save for adolescent episodes of minor property damage and public order offences, none escalating to significant custodial sentences. Previous contact with social services during early schooling was recorded solely on grounds of parental absence due to employment-related travel. The court found no aggravating developmental or environmental factors that might mitigate responsibility. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. An analysis of cryptocurrency payments linked to Mr H revealed intricate layering transactions routed through anonymiser platforms, consistent with efforts to procure restricted dual-use components. The court is increasingly aware of the growing instrumental role cryptocurrency plays in illicit markets and terrorist financing, as noted in the Financial Conduct Authority’s 2023 Risk Outlook. Law enforcement faces ongoing challenges tracking such flows, which further underlines the importance of deterrent sentencing. The court wishes to recognise the tireless efforts of the West Midlands Police Counter-Terrorism Unit, and the specialist digital forensics teams whose dedication and skill were vital in assembling a coherent evidential picture. Similarly, appreciation is extended to the Probation Service colleagues involved in MAPPA, whose resource scarcity and increasing caseloads, noted in recent Inspectorate reports, should not be underestimated. Occasionally, matters of procedural minutiae arise and deserve comment. On this occasion, the court experienced a brief delay caused by an administrative oversight in booking interpreter services for a distant hearing day—an issue regrettably all too familiar in courts nationally. The usher and courtroom clerks deserve gratitude for their patience and effective management under challenging conditions. The courthouse recently underwent partial refurbishment, including enhanced accessibility features, which has been welcomed by users and staff alike. Turning back to the defendant’s psychological profile, the court notes that Professor Emily Rathbone’s independent assessment dated 30 September 2025 supports the conclusion that Mr H exhibits fixed ideological beliefs resistant to challenge, and cognitive rigidity that impedes engagement with deradicalisation programmes. While defence counsel advocates for community-based disengagement interventions, the court treats these proposals cautiously in light of recidivism rates in similar cases. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant is aged 30, educated to degree level in computer science, with prior employment in software testing at a regional tech firm. References from former supervisors describe him as “quiet and professional” but not notably sociable. Termination of his last position in late 2023 coincides roughly with the onset of his recorded extremist activity online. Letters from a local community cycling group citing his volunteer support during weekend rides were presented as mitigation, but the court treats such discrete social engagements as ancillary factors not materially reducing culpability. Several reports from charity providers working with individuals at risk of radicalisation were tendered, including submissions from the Midlands Community Support Network. They attest to programmes addressing grievance narratives and cognitive distortions but also candidly reveal high rates of attrition and disengagement. The court acknowledges the sustained dedication of these organisations despite funding challenges and public misunderstanding of their work. The court is mindful of arguments from civil liberties advocates warning against over-criminalisation and the potential stigmatizing effects of terrorism legislation on minority groups. The principle of proportionality remains paramount, but public safety is an overriding consideration enshrined in law. It is well established that sentencing must reflect not only individual circumstances but the collective interests of society. The applicable sentencing framework is principally derived from the Terrorism Act 2006 and attendant Sentencing Council’s guidelines issued in 2023. The maximum sentence for offences under section 5, engaged in here, is life imprisonment. The court must consider culpability, harm, and aggravating or mitigating features under a structured approach. Previous Court of Appeal decisions—such as R v. Ashraf [2022] EWCA Crim 675—provide authoritative direction on the necessity of lengthy custodial sentences for preparatory acts aimed at mass-casualty events. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. All considered, this was a deliberate and multifaceted scheme characterized by a high degree of technical sophistication, ideological commitment, and demonstrable intent to cause indiscriminate harm. The aggravating features include the extensive use of encryption and anonymisation, the evident planning of timing to coincide with significant dates within the extremist calendar, and the potential scale of devastation contemplated by the defendant’s designs. Mitigating factors are limited. These include the absence of prior convictions, some measure of genuine cooperation at a very late stage, educational achievements, and minor community involvement. The plea entered shortly before sentencing reduces the usual credit available in cases of early acceptance but remains a relevant consideration. At this juncture, the court directs the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report by the Probation Service, to consider not only the appropriate custodial threshold but also the feasibility of enhanced risk management strategies upon release, including multi-agency supervision, electronic monitoring, and tailored disengagement programming. The single priority remains the protection of the public from further harm. These sentencing remarks are issued today, 22 October 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

FLETCHER Filed: 15 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The relevant offences are alleged to have occurred during the period from April 2023 up to Mr H’s arrest on 5 February 2025. The defendant was arrested at 06:45 on the aforesaid date pursuant to warrants executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at his residence in Eastville. The warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 on the basis of classified intelligence indicating that an encrypted application controlled or accessed by Mr H had engaged in the transmission of files linked to extremist propaganda. At the time of arrest, officers seized a desktop computer, multiple external hard drives, and several USB keys, all of which were subsequently subject to forensic examination. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation that culminated in this arrest was characterised by protracted inter-agency cooperation. CTPSW worked closely with the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) and a specialist digital forensics team attached to the National Crime Agency. The digital data recovered required meticulous decryption and reconstruction using bespoke software tools. Due to the heavy workload of the NCCU, which at points during 2024 had a backlog exceeding 12,000 devices awaiting examination, analysis was necessarily slowed. However, the involvement of external academic partners specialising in cryptanalysis helped to alleviate delays to some extent. It should be noted that whilst resource scarcity is an unfortunate reality in the counter-terrorism domain, it does not permit neglect of rigorous evidential scrutiny, as the court fully acknowledges. Before addressing the factual matrix of the offences, it is appropriate to provide some contextual observations on the legal and procedural framework within which the court must operate. The charges brought arise under legislative provisions formulated largely in response to evolving threats of domestic and international terrorism. The Terrorism Act 2006, as amended, extends prior offences and mandates severe penalties reflecting the significant public safety interests at stake. It is regrettably common in such complex prosecutions that matters are protracted, featuring multiple pre-trial hearings and delayed disclosure owing to the sensitive nature of material. This case has been no exception. A preliminary hearing was conducted on 18 March 2025 at which the Crown indicated a not guilty plea by Mr H. Subsequent trial preparation hearings occurred on 25 May and 2 July 2025, during which varying applications were made regarding the admissibility of evidence, in particular intercept communications and expert reporting. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Throughout this process, the court has received extensive submissions on the appropriate level of culpability and potential mitigating factors. Defence counsel argued vigorously that Mr H had no realistic capacity to enact terrorism himself, highlighting the absence of criminal convictions or prior police intelligence and asserting that his interest in extremist materials was largely academic or ideological rather than operational. The Crown, on the other hand, relied on evidence demonstrating a clear progression from passive consumption of extremist content to active preparation and facilitation. The court is conscious, however, of the duty within the Criminal Procedure Rules to ensure fair trial rights and the right to effective representation. It must be recorded that the Legal Aid Agency’s performance in this matter has been inconsistent. There were extended delays in the approval of funding for expert psychological assessments and for digital forensic expertise instructed by the defence. Such delays, whilst understandable in the current under-resourced climate, place additional strain on the timely administration of justice and impose a burden on all parties. The delay interfered with timely disclosure requests and necessitated adjournments, including the vacating of a sentence date initially set for 21 July 2025. Empirical research has increasingly drawn attention to the challenging interface between complex terror investigations and the capacity of public services to respond effectively. The probation service in the South West region, for example, operates under severe staff constraints, with an overstretched caseload per officer volume exceeding 55 active files, considerably above national recommended thresholds. The court duly notes that this disparity strains post-conviction risk management and delivery of rehabilitative interventions. The community rehabilitation sector also faces mounting difficulties. Charitable organisations engaged in counter-extremism efforts—often dependent on volatile funding streams—have reported cases of intimidation, vandalism, and hostile public attitudes during outreach programmes. The persistence of these difficulties compounds the challenge of securing successful disengagement and reducing reoffending risk. Thus, while mitigation and progress towards rehabilitation are to be welcomed, they must be measured against the reality of operational pressures. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Prior to turning to the core facts of the offending, the court also pauses to acknowledge advances in relevant case law that inform sentencing principles. The Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v. Maskell [2022] EWCA Crim 2145 clarified the interpretation of “engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism,” emphasising the need to consider both objective acts and subjective intent, as well as the proximity of preparatory conduct to potential terrorist execution. This judgment restated the particular gravity attached to offences even where no actual attack occurred, recognising the deliberate and premeditated nature of such conduct. More broadly, sentencing remains directed by the Terrorism Act 2000 and 2006, alongside the Sentencing Council’s guidelines updated in 2023. The overarching purposes of deterrence, rehabilitation where possible, and, above all, protection of the public are paramount. The sentencing court must weigh aggravating factors, including sophistication of planning, dissemination of material, and engagement with proscribed groups, against personal mitigation such as antecedents, mental health status, and demonstrated remorse. Turning now more specifically to evidence of the defendant's conduct: The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Mr H’s digital footprint unveiled a cache of encrypted files containing detailed manuals on improvised explosive devices, tactical communication strategies, and ideological treatises advocating violence in furtherance of extremist goals. The defence suggested this was a theoretical exercise or research. However, covert surveillance corroborated contemporaneous acts consistent with hands-on preparations, including attendance at targeted locations with restricted access and testing of small-scale devices in controlled environments. It should be observed that the court takes no comfort in unsubstantiated claims of “academic curiosity” when coupled with access to practical materials and actual test deployments. As established in R v. Larson [2021] EWCA Crim 871, mere possession of such materials, when contextualised by preparatory activity, gives rise to grave concern regarding predisposition and potential future offending. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. Efforts to travel abroad for training or to establish contacts with foreign extremist entities were thwarted by intercepted plans to journey to the Balkan region in late 2024. Travel records, coupled with mobile tracking data, indicate Mr H booked flights via indirect routes to avoid detection, though ultimately the trips were cancelled or redirected following intervention by border security. Such layers of deception and evasive tactics underscore the calculated intent behind his behaviour. It is, meanwhile, pertinent to refer to a related but separate matter concerning the defendant’s co-habitant, who was found in possession of cannabis plants during unrelated warrant execution. No charges related to drug offences have been brought in connection with Mr H, who denies knowledge or involvement. Similarly, the defendant’s brother is currently under investigation for benefit fraud, an issue entirely extraneous to the present proceedings save for the necessity of disclosure in compliance with Criminal Procedure Rule 31.6. The home environment in which the defendant lived was also subject to administrative oversight by the local housing authority due to multiple noise complaints from neighbours unrelated to the current charges. The significance of these complaints lies solely in providing a holistic view of the defendant’s immediate social context and poses no aggravation or diminution of culpability. In discussing the forensic material, it must be noted that among the devices seized were several USB sticks labelled cryptically, one containing what was recorded as “VaccineCodes2023.” Forensic analysis determined these showed no connection to biomedical content but, instead, contained encrypted communications about bomb assembly procedures. The defence’s submission that this was an example of “dual-use technology curiosity” was rejected by the jury, who were expressly directed regarding available inferences from circumstantial evidence. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations traced multiple cryptocurrency transactions, amounting to just under £4,800, linked to online wallets associated with Mr H. Transactions were routed through mixers designed to obfuscate audit trails and included purchases from darknet marketplaces offering dual-use materials and components with potential application in explosive device manufacture. While cryptocurrency in its myriad forms serves legitimate purposes for many, it is a matter of public record and law enforcement concern that this medium is extensively exploited by criminals seeking anonymity, as reviewed in the Home Office research paper “Crypto and Crime,” published in 2023. The court notes with approval the thoroughness of the financial intelligence team and acknowledges the challenges faced by public bodies in tracing digital assets and enforcing anti-money laundering regulations. These aspects, while only indirectly connected to the defendant’s day-to-day life, illustrate a wider systemic vulnerability that must be addressed by policymakers. During the investigatory phase, extensive covert surveillance operations were undertaken to establish patterns of behaviour. Footage captured Mr H undertaking reconnaissance in a public park adjacent to a major railway junction during which he appeared to record timings of passing trains. While such imagery and data acquisition may on the face of it border on urban exploration or hobbyist interest in rail infrastructure, in the context of other preparatory acts, it assumes a far more sinister undertone. The court is reminded of the established principle that acts innocuous in isolation may be signed by a broader offending panorama. It also bears mention that the defendant was observed frequenting certain city-centre locations notorious for past activities of extremist gatherings. This was corroborated by mobile network evidence, which further situates him within known extremist frames. Nevertheless, the court is careful to emphasise that such associations, while relevant to threat assessment, must be understood within the evidence as a whole and not as standalone proof of criminality. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is 28 years of age with a background in electrical engineering. He holds a BSc degree with upper second-class honours, having graduated from a regional university in 2019. Employment history reveals a series of short-term contracts in the renewable energy sector, interspersed with periods of unemployment. A letter provided by a former supervisor describes him as “technically competent but somewhat detached,” with occasional lapses in meeting deadlines. The defendant allegedly resigned from his last role shortly before the commencement of the conduct under scrutiny here, following a disagreement over mandatory background checks related to security clearance. The defence sought to attribute this resignation to workplace bullying, a claim not substantiated in evidence before the court. Such allegations, while serious, have no direct bearing on the current offences and were aired with no corroborating documentation. Several letters of support have been tendered on Mr H’s behalf, including one from the Bristol Green Spaces Initiative praising voluntary contributions to community gardening projects and another from the Eastville Library outreach programme noting participation in a literacy mentorship scheme for teenagers. These attest to some facets of pro-social engagement. However, as this court has often reiterated, community involvement cannot eclipse the fundamental seriousness of terrorism offences. It is also relevant to mention that the defendant’s handwritten submissions to the court were legible, clear, and evidenced a reflective tone, though they stopped short of full acceptance of responsibility. This partial engagement with the legal process exemplifies a common pattern among ideologically motivated offenders who may express dissatisfaction with the justice system while simultaneously acknowledging adverse consequences. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! The psychiatric report submitted by Dr Susan L. Bradford, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, provides a detailed insight into Mr H’s psychological profile. Dr Bradford diagnoses no formal mental illness but notes “cognitive inflexibility coupled with a marked black-and-white mode of thinking.” The report assesses a high risk of serious harm predicated upon entrenched ideological beliefs, technical proficiency, and limited engagement with deradicalization programmes during custody. The report notes that, while there was no evidence of psychosis or mood disorder, the defendant exhibited “heightened affective arousal when discussing perceived grievances against state institutions.” Dr Bradford recommends intensive psychological interventions combined with Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 supervision on release, given the identified persistent risk. Defence submissions urged the adoption of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) as an appropriate pathway, emphasising its community-based framework and cognitive-behavioural components. The court observes that while such programmes offer promise, completion rates hover below 70%, with a notable minority disengaging in the critical post-release phase. The court must, therefore, approach such proposals cautiously and in the context of robust risk management. Outside the immediate realm of this case, the court cannot ignore the wider social and political significance of counter-terrorism work. The balance between ensuring public safety and preserving civil liberties remains delicate. Commentary in academic circles and the press often oscillates between scepticism of legislative overreach and concerns regarding under-policing. In a particularly notable speech in 2024, the Attorney General emphasised that “effective counter-terrorism relies not only on laws but on community resilience, intelligence gathering, and inter-agency cooperation.” While this court is not a forum for political debate, such observations reinforce that sentencing in terrorism cases transcends individual culpability, touching upon collective security and societal values. This matter has seen the most conscientious efforts from prosecution and defence counsel alike. Ms Naomi Fitzgerald QC appeared on behalf of HM Crown Prosecution Service, providing cogent and detailed submissions throughout trial and sentencing preparation. Mr Oliver Dakin, for the defence, represented Mr H with exemplary professionalism amid considerable case complexity and external pressures. The court owes its thanks to both counsel for their efforts. It should also be recorded that the court staff, ushers, and clerks at Bristol Crown Court have contributed materially to the efficient listing and management of this case. The recent refurbishment of Courtroom 4, including upgraded audio-visual facilities intended to facilitate effective presentation of digital evidence, was utilised to good effect in this trial. Despite routine challenges, the hearing proceeded with due decorum and respect. By way of additional and tangential observation, there has been a noted surge in anti-social behaviour and street homelessness within the Bristol city centre over recent years. Local authorities report that the stresses associated with economic downturn and inadequate housing stock contribute to a sense of disorder that may indirectly impact community cohesion. Although such factors are not germane to this case directly, they contextualise the wider environment in which offences of ideological extremism occur and must be considered when evaluating risk and rehabilitation prospects. Attention is drawn also to the longstanding issue of the burden placed upon digital forensic teams by the exponential growth of data in modern prosecutions. Analysts report that they are required to sift through terabytes of raw material, much of which may prove tangential or redundant but cannot be disregarded without due process. The resultant workload increase has engendered calls for expanded resourcing and improved technology platforms within policing budgets. The present case exemplifies these demands. In conclusion, having considered the entirety of evidence and submissions and mindful of the crucial statutory and judicial guidance, the court finds that the offending displayed significant sophistication and committed intent. The combination of technical competence, ideological adherence, and preparatory steps place Mr H within the upper tiers of culpability under the current sentencing framework. Mitigating factors remain limited. While there is some evidence of community engagement and no previous convictions, these are overshadowed by the grave nature of the offences. The guilty pleas entered on 4 August 2025 represent a welcome but tardy acceptance of responsibility. The credit available must be tempered accordingly, consistent with the Court of Appeal’s rulings in R v. Tolson and R v. Nugent. The court hereby directs the preparation of a pre-sentence report. This report shall explore in depth the risk profile presented by Mr H, including a comprehensive assessment of his engagement potential with deradicalization programmes, capacity for compliance with license conditions, and appropriateness for custodial or community-based sentencing options. Consideration should also be given to the utility of electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and structured psychological intervention as part of any release plan. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 August 2025, in Courtroom 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to relevant agencies for registration and notification.

THORNTON Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentencing in relation to offences contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely conducting preparatory acts in readiness for terrorism, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct took place between April 2023 and the defendant’s arrest in January 2025. The defendant was first detained under arrest on 18 January 2025, following operations conducted by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). Upon execution of a search warrant at an address in Southmead, officers recovered multiple electronic devices, including encrypted smartphones and hardware capable of 3D printing. These devices were seized pursuant to search warrants authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, supported by intelligence from the Security Service indicating the defendant’s engagement in encrypted forum communications known for disseminating extremist materials. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative trajectory preceding arrest was itself a lengthened enterprise, involving sophisticated electronic surveillance and international liaison. CTPSW coordinated activities with national forensic teams and benefited from technical support derived from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl). The decryption of data containers, housed on multiple solid-state drives, proved particularly time-consuming due to the use of nested virtualised operating environments and bespoke steganographic layering. The National Data Exploitation Unit faced substantial delays resulting from device encryption protocols and technological countermeasures woven into the defendant’s digital footprint. Interim proceedings were marked by multiple adjournments, largely occasioned by issues surrounding disclosure and Legal Aid funding. The court notes with some frustration delays in authorisation for forensic experts instructed on behalf of the defence to receive sensitive material essential for independent analysis. Such impediments highlight ongoing systemic challenges with the Legal Aid Agency’s responsiveness in complex cases, where expert assistance is critical for ensuring a fair trial. A Channel referral, made originally in 2020 by a university counsellor following an assignment containing inflammatory ideological content, was reviewed during proceedings. The referral did not progress beyond the initial panel decision due to limited evidence of active engagement with extremist groups at that time. The court acknowledges governmental guidelines require early intervention but recognises the inherent difficulties Channel panels face in predicting future offending trajectories based solely on academic work. The case proceeded to a plea and trial preparation hearing on 9 July 2025. The defendant entered not guilty pleas to all charges initially but altered his plea to guilty on the morning of 16 September, immediately prior to jury empanelling. The court recognises this late plea but must apply caution in affording credit for it, referencing the established principles from case law such as R v. Daniels [2024] EWCA Crim 679, which underscores the conditional nature of sentencing discounts for pleas entered at advanced stages. The courts continue to grapple with the tension between encouraging early guilty pleas and the reality that defendants often persist in maintaining denial until the full weight of the prosecution’s case becomes incontrovertible. While the prosecution’s presentation is robust and substantiated by forensic and intelligence evidence, the court is mindful that credit for a guilty plea is intended to reward genuine remorse and the avoidance of the distress and expense of trial, not tactical calculation. Reference may be made to R v. Fairbanks [2023] EWCA Crim 453, involving a defendant charged with repeated offences of aggravated burglary. Fairbanks maintained a not guilty plea for over a year, despite significant documentary and forensic evidence, including CCTV and victim impact statements. His eventual plea on the day of trial attracted only limited mitigation, reinforcing the judiciary’s need to ensure that plea concessions are measured and justified by actual conduct rather than convenience. Further guidance is found in R v. Singh [2022] EWCA Crim 1551, where the Court clarified that while the offender’s background and circumstances may inform mitigation, the timing of the plea remains a significant factor in assessing the appropriate level of credit. The statutory framework applicable to these proceedings includes the Terrorism Act 2006, which provides life imprisonment as the maximum penalty for section 5 offences. This court is directed by the Sentencing Council’s published guidelines from 2023, which emphasise several critical sentencing factors: degree of culpability, sophistication of the plan, risk posed to public safety, and the defendant’s awareness and intent. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. Prosecution evidence demonstrates that Mr H maintained an active online presence under several pseudonyms, sharing content aligned with radicalised ideological narratives and producing pamphlets advocating violent action. Language analysis by the Crown’s linguistic expert confirmed recurring motifs consistent with materials disseminated by groups proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. A digital forensics report recovered a collection of encrypted archives within a VeraCrypt container, cleverly disguised under nomenclature suggestive of domestic recipes, arguably intended to conceal the true nature of their contents. The Crown calls attention to portions of these files, which detailed explosive composition and methods of delivery. Defence submissions sought to argue speculative benign interests in chemistry as a hobby, supported by testimony from acquaintances, but the court finds these implausible in context. Further forensic investigation uncovered encrypted communication logs that exhibited attempts to source components consistent with explosive manufacture, some of which were traced to foreign suppliers via cryptocurrency transactions. The practical and logistical expertise demonstrated in these arrangements indicates a level of sophistication beyond mere curiosity or theoretical interest. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Notwithstanding defence assertions that aerial photography recovered during the search reflected an innocuous passion for drone videography—an interest corroborated by archived social media posts showing surveying of rural scenery—the court concludes that such material cannot be divorced from the broader pattern of the defendant’s conduct. Other seized items included several ornamental knives and a tactical flashlight. These items, while potentially lawful and unexceptional in other circumstances, assume a more troubling significance given the overall purposeful assembly of materials. A distinct but unrelated matter arose during preliminary hearings involving Mr H’s co-defendant, Mr L. The co-defendant failed to appear at a scheduled hearing and remains at large. It warrants mention only insofar as it affected case progression and did not, on any evidence, involve Mr H directly. No link was established between Mr H and the unexplained absconsion. The court acknowledges evidence tendered detailing widespread resource constraints faced by police forces in the last five years. The South West region has recorded a 12% decrease in uniformed officers and a 27% uptick in telecommunications-related criminality. Additionally, counter-terrorism units continue to face pressure from increased demand and stretched budgets, impacting their operational capacity. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. Amongst exhibits was a record of Mr H’s travel in late 2024, including a brief visit to the port city of Liverpool. CCTV footage showed Mr H engaging in a brief meeting with an individual later arrested for fly-tipping in the nearby green belt area—a matter investigated separately by Environmental Enforcement officers and unrelated to the present terrorism charges. The prosecution submits that while the environmental offence is factually separate, it serves to highlight the defendant’s broader pattern of associating with individuals who engage in unlawful activity. The court, however, restricts its focus to the charges faced by Mr H alone. A voluminous disclosure schedule was amassed over the course of this prosecution. The initial schedule comprised over 1,200 items and necessitated collaboration between multiple entities: East England’s Digital Forensics Laboratory, the National Counter Terrorism Security Office, and the City of Bristol’s own cybercrime unit. These agencies operated within a framework of security vetting and data protection restrictions which complicated the timely dissemination of evidence. The court is conscious that well-reported cases of unrelated violent crime continue to strain public services in the South West area. Recent reports from the Bristol Community Safety Partnership describe an increase in affray incidents linked to late-night licensed premises, including one disturbance involving pool cues and improvised weapons. While gravely concerning, these events bear no connection to the defendant’s activities. The difficulties experienced by the National Health Service (NHS) in meeting mental health referral demand also form a backdrop to these proceedings. Waiting times for forensic psychiatric assessments have extended beyond six months in certain regions, leading to increased reliance on preliminary reports, as occurred here. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Expert accountants engaged by police forensically tracked bitcoin transactions from wallet addresses associated with Mr H to vendors supplying chemical lab equipment and drone parts. The timing and destination of these payments correspond with activity logs from encrypted messaging platforms. The court acknowledges the growing challenge that anonymised cryptocurrency transactions pose for law enforcement and financial regulatory bodies alike. The defence team, led by Mr Rupert Mallory of Legal Aid counsel, submitted applications for additional expert reports at various stages, including a neuropsychological assessment to determine cognitive capacity. Though authorised belatedly, these reports were delivered in full and carefully reviewed by the court. Reference was made during mitigation to Mr H’s involvement in an urban gardening project, a community initiative operating in Bristol’s Lawrence Hill ward. The project, supported by local volunteers, aims to improve outdoor spaces and foster positive neighbourliness. Letters attesting to the defendant’s participation painted a picture of a quiet, if solitary, individual with latent potential for constructive engagement. Notwithstanding this, the court is reminded that community contributions, while commendable, cannot serve as a shield against accountability for serious offences. Public safety must remain paramount. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding Mr H’s biography, he is 31 years of age, with a degree in electronic engineering obtained from a regional university. Former employers characterize him as methodical and reserved, though note that his sudden departure from his last role closely followed an internal inquiry concerning unauthorised access to restricted corporate networks. Professor Jonathan Wells, forensic psychologist, provided a comprehensive expert report noting Mr H’s cognitive style as marked by rigidity and a black-and-white worldview but found no diagnosable mental health disorder. The assessment rates the risk of serious harm as high in the absence of intensive management and structured intervention. The professor underlined the challenges in deradicalisation efforts, noting attrition rates from rehabilitation programmes often exceed 40% within the first year. The court acknowledges submissions from the Bristol Interfaith Alliance, expressing concern about the effects of heightened terror threat rhetoric on minority communities. The Alliance advocates for balanced sentencing that preserves social cohesion without compromising justice or public protection. Their considered position was included in the written mitigation. The multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) involved in this matter functioned with diligent cooperation among probation, police, and health services. Despite historic administrative difficulties and staffing shortages noted in recent government reports, the present case saw timely reviews and pragmatic discussions around risk management, including custody planning and post-release monitoring. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. The offending in this matter is characterised by a high degree of sophistication and commitment to a harmful purpose. The assembly of materials, cyberencrypted communications, and overseas linkages collectively place this case in the upper tier of culpability as defined by the 2023 Sentencing Guidelines for Terrorism Offences. Mitigating factors are confined to the defendant’s prior unblemished record, degree attainment, and the guilty pleas, albeit entered very late in the process. While these do not diminish the gravity or public danger posed, they merit cautious recognition. The court directs the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, with particular emphasis on custody risk management and the potential for high-intensity cognitive behavioural interventions designed to address ideological commitment and offending thought patterns. Reports should also consider availability and suitability of rehabilitative accommodation, potential GPS restrictions, and specialist mental health input post-sentence. The probation service is requested to liaise with Counter Terrorism Policing and NHS forensic psychiatry to produce an integrated risk management plan. The judiciary notes, with measured regret, the chronic pressures evident in both health and justice sectors. Waiting lists for psychological assessment remain long, probation caseloads unmanageably high, and resources for specialised intervention stretched. These systemic factors do not excuse offending, but they form an unavoidable context within which this court must operate.

Mr H Case No. B2025/34790 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. HARDING Filed: 22 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court to be sentenced on offences contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct alleged covered a period from late July 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in January 2025. The defendant was taken into custody at approximately 04:47 hours on 18 January 2025, following the execution of a series of warrants coordinated by the West Midlands Counter-Terrorism Unit (WMCTU) at his flat in Acacia House, Small Heath. The warrants were issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, supported by a combination of human intelligence and signals intelligence, including intercept material indicating active engagement with encrypted devices identified as hubs for extremist materials distribution. A range of electronic devices were seized, including an encrypted smartphone, a high-capacity external hard drive, and documents bearing technical diagrams. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It is worth noting that the arrest culminated a sustained investigative operation that relied on collaborative efforts between WMCTU, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and forensic specialists from the Digital Forensic Analysis Service (DFAS). The investigative team faced a variety of technical challenges, including the defendant’s use of highly secure encrypted applications and the deployment of ephemeral messaging technologies designed to frustrate traditional intercept and data capture techniques. These measures, while sophisticated, did not ultimately prevent the assembly of a compelling evidential picture. The period preceding trial saw multiple hearings and interlocutory applications, including some delays resulting from defence challenges to disclosure practices and the commissioning of independent expert evidence. Observers from the Court of Appeal have previously noted the increasing complexity that encryption issues bring to terrorism prosecutions, and the present matter was no exception. It is well documented that the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division (CPS CT) maintains a rigorous case management protocol, and the conduct of CPS counsel in this prosecution has adhered strictly to that standard. I would take this opportunity to commend Ms Fiona Leverett QC for her diligent advocacy on behalf of the Crown, marked by unfailing professionalism and forensic precision in the face of a complex evidential tapestry. Challenges to Legal Aid funding intermittently influenced the progression of this case. Applications for additional funding to instruct cybersecurity experts were initially met with resistance from the Legal Aid Agency. These delays, while regrettable and potentially prejudicial, were eventually overcome following senior-level appeals. The court notes with concern the systemic pressures faced by defence practitioners in terrorism matters, where expertise and resource requirements are disproportionate to standard criminal work. A “Channel” referral was made in November 2021, initiated by a youth worker at a community centre attended by the defendant, who had incorporated radicalised themes into poetry and online posts. The Channel Panel was convened but promptly discontinued following his apparent disengagement. This early referral exemplifies the difficulties inherent in assessing risk trajectories during formative or young adulthood, and serves as a cautionary note on the limitations of Prevent strategies in intercepting progression toward serious offending. It is a commonplace, yet lamentable feature in contemporary terrorism prosecutions, that defendants frequently delay entry of guilty pleas until the final stages or trial commencement. Mr H was no exception, maintaining a not guilty plea during the lengthy and complex trial process, only to enter a plea of guilty on the second day of the sentencing hearing. The court must be clear: such delay attracts only limited credit. The principles governing reductions in sentence for guilty pleas have recently been elucidated in the Court of Appeal in R v. MacDonald [2024] EWCA Crim 1097. In that case involving conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism, the Court reasserted that timely pleas yield maximal reduction whereas late pleas—especially those offered following exhaustive preparation and imminent trial—warrant a marked diminution of credit. In respect of relevant case law, as noted previously in R v. Ahmed [2018] EWCA Crim 2525, the definition of “engaging in conduct in preparation” encompasses not merely physical acts but intellectual and logistical groundwork, even where a plan remains nascent or incomplete. Mr Ahmed’s conviction, for example, stemmed from attempts to acquire explosives components and disseminate online instruction manuals, a factual terrain akin but not identical to Mr H’s case. Another instructive authority is R v. Poulter [2021] EWCA Crim 1373, which discussed the requisite mental element for possession offences under section 57 of the 2000 Act. The Court emphasised intention beyond mere awareness, particularly where dual-use items might plausibly have legitimate explanations. Thus, in assessing culpability, the court must consider the weight of evidence indicating purpose rather than innocent possession. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. Mr H’s digital footprint reveals a progressive radicalisation, initially through private messages on closed forums catering to grievance-based extremism, advancing to open advocacy of violent action over social media platforms in early 2024. Linguistic analyses provided by the Crown’s expert during trial identified specific codewords and thematic structures matching those found in propaganda disseminated by a proscribed international terrorist organisation. The defence’s suggestion of “satirical tone” lacked credibility given the careful contextualisation and repetition. Mr H’s files included a bridge layout and drone sequence intended to strike emergency services after the first explosion. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The electronic devices recovered contained encrypted archives stored under innocuous folder names, including one labelled “PalmCrest2023.” Within were manuals on homemade explosive devices, as well as video tutorials on improvised incendiaries. The defendant had taken active steps to learn about blast pattern dispersion and methods of concealment. Defence sought to counter by invoking an interest in ‘special effects’ makeup and pyrotechnics connected to a small local theatre group with which Mr H had nominal contact some years earlier. The court does not accept these submissions as material to the required intent. The trial record includes examination of recovery of a commercially purchased drone equipped with extended battery capacity and modified for remote payload delivery. Defence argued that this was an expensive hobby with no criminal purpose. However, the Crown’s evidence demonstrated the defendant tested the drone’s range over sensitive infrastructure and recorded footage at a potential target site. The defendant’s prior convictions include a 2016 charge for shoplifting alcohol and toiletries from a supermarket chain in Sutton Coldfield. While unrelated to terrorism offences, and of minor nature, it does provide some indication of early contact with the criminal justice system and suggests a trajectory of escalating complexity in offending behaviour. Similarly, the co-defendant, Mr S, arrested in the same operation, faces charges relating to drug trafficking and possession of a bladed article in a school car park in a separate incident. These matters are entirely distinct and not attributable to the defendant; the court cautions against conflation. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The defendant possesses an academic background in electrical engineering, awarded by a post-1992 university with a commendable final grade. Letters from former lecturers describe him as “intellectually gifted but socially reserved.” Such attributes, while perhaps enabling technical competence, cannot be permitted to mitigate the gravity of terrorist preparation and complicity. A series of personal mitigation letters were submitted from acquaintances within veteran service organisations lauding the defendant’s volunteer work assisting with community respite events. These references, while commendable, paint a picture of an individual capable of public service as well as dangerous intent. The court exercises caution in weighting community involvement as mitigation in a case involving premeditated violence. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Travel records reveal a short trip Mr H made to Brussels in February 2024, declared to border services as a leisure visit. The Crown has adduced evidence, however, indicating that one excursion aligned temporally with a rally organised by a far-right extremist cell; CCTV footage confirms the defendant’s presence, as does intercepted electronic communication. Defence submits innocence, suggesting cultural tourism as primary motivation. The court finds the evidence compelling that ideological networking was a component of the visit. The Defence lodged an application seeking leave to adduce psychiatric evidence. Dr Henry Larcombe, consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed on behalf of the defendant, provided a comprehensive report dated 15 July 2025. Dr Larcombe diagnosed Mr H with a non-specific mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, with tendencies toward obsessive-compulsive thought patterns in relation to moral themes. The report emphasizes the absence of psychosis or severe mood disorder, noting that these conditions did not materially affect impulse control or criminal responsibility. Conversely, the prosecution’s psychiatric expert, Dr Shelina Malik, offered a contrasting view, assessing Mr H as exhibiting “narrow, absolutist ideological thinking” and elevated risk markers for persistent extremist behaviour absent robust intervention. Both assessments underscore that the defendant is not suffering from a major mental illness capable of exoneration but highlight the risks of recidivism. It is illustrative to recall the principles distilled by the Court of Appeal in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, discussed earlier in relation to mental disorder and containment. That case involved a defendant diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder who engaged in multiple arson attacks, demonstrating conscious disregard for public safety. Mr H’s situation, though lacking such psychotic features, nevertheless points toward significant ideological rigidity meriting attention in sentencing. The defendant had become obsessed with the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and been following the cleaner. One entry in Mr H’s tactical file described how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations conducted by forensic accountants uncovered transactions involving cryptocurrency wallets affiliated with Mr H. In March 2024, a transfer approximating £3,100 was made from a wallet linked to the defendant’s pseudonymous email address to a darknet vendor purporting to supply dual-use items of concern. The complex layering of mixers and tumblers employed evinces a deliberate attempt to obfuscate sources and destinations, characteristic of criminal concealment rather than accidental association. The court acknowledges that such practices reflect a growing challenge for law enforcement and judicial agencies worldwide: balancing the legitimate privacy interests of cryptocurrency users against the lethality of abuse by extremist actors. The CPS has made submissions advocating ongoing legislative reform in this area, recognizing the pace of technological innovation demands commensurate legal agility. An appreciable degree of surveillance activity was devoted to monitoring Mr H’s actions. This included covert monitoring of location visits to civic infrastructure sites. One such instance on 12 November 2024 involved footage corroborated with geofence alerts, which analysts spent over 200 hours reviewing to confirm the defendant’s identity and repeated concealment attempts. This exemplifies the disproportionate resource burden often required to monitor potential terrorist threats effectively. Some operational challenges arose due to unexpected staff absences within the technical team, partly attributable to concurrent commitments on unrelated high-profile investigations, including a recent spate of fly-tipping incidents affecting protected greenbelt land in the adjacent district. While unrelated to Mr H, this overlap caused some scheduling inefficiency, highlighting resource pressures on public enforcement agencies. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 31 years of age, single, with no dependent children. His upbringing was in a working-class family in North Birmingham, where community resources have been chronically stretched for over a decade. School reports describe him as “academically capable but socially withdrawn,” with a history of social isolation and limited peer networks. Early educational attainment was adequate but unexceptional. The defendant has no previous convictions for violent crime but does have multiple breaches of community orders related to minor theft offences and incivilities, none connected to terrorism. Within the probation service, current workloads are extreme; this court has previously noted the impact on quality of supervision, yet the officers involved in this case have obtained commendations for diligent monitoring despite capacity pressures. The defendant’s landlord, Acacia Homes Ltd., was the subject of a noise abatement notice in 2023 following complaints unrelated to Mr H, concerning building-wide disturbances attributed to other tenants. These background circumstances offer no excuse or significant context for the defendant’s offending but provide a picture of the challenging environment in which these events unfolded. A letter was submitted from the East Birmingham Community Trust, a charitable body focused on youth engagement, expressing concern over funding shortfalls amid rising demand for services addressing radicalisation and social isolation. These systemic challenges form the wider backdrop against which Mr H’s case must be understood, even if they form no direct defence. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. In conclusion, the defendant presents a high risk of serious harm given his degree of ideological commitment, technical capability, and the preparatory steps undertaken. Professor Elizabeth Duvall, an eminent expert in forensic psychology, observes that his cognitive rigidity and absolutist thinking patterns position him squarely within a category requiring intensive custodial management and ongoing post-release supervision to mitigate danger to the public. The defendant’s engagement with past deradicalisation efforts has been sporadic and inconsistent. While theoretical frameworks such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) offer avenues for rehabilitation, completion rates remain under 70%, and significant risk persists post-licence without stringent controls. Of course, this court must grapple with tensions between punishment and rehabilitation, deterrence and public protection, liberty and security. Parliamentary policy, as articulated in the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, stresses the importance of balanced sentencing reflecting both individual culpability and societal interests. The mitigating features in this case consist primarily of the defendant’s early guilty pleas, albeit delayed; absence of prior convictions for terrorist offences; and some evidence of positive community engagement disconnected from his offending conduct. These factors, while real, are outweighed by the gravity and sophistication of the preparatory conduct. It is hereby ordered that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith, with particular emphasis on the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, enhanced licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring and internet access restrictions, and the potential appropriateness of high-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy addressing extremist ideation. The report should additionally consider accommodation options post-release that would maximise public protection and reduce recidivism risk. This court particularly commends the efforts of the West Midlands Forensic Psychology Unit and the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) panel who have maintained consistent oversight of this matter despite recent organisational upheavals and reductions in staffing levels. Their professionalism contributes materially to the safeguarding of the public and the administration of justice. The sentencing hearing today has been conducted in open court before a full panel of judicial officers and the attending legal representatives. I thank Mr Christopher Reed, representing the Crown, and Ms Emma Trevor, instructed for the defence pursuant to an updated Legal Aid order following earlier delays of administrative origin. It remains a matter of frustration to the court that so many of these cases suffer delay attributable to systemic underfunding of defence preparation, a matter well-rehearsed in judicial and parliamentary fora. The court will reserve sentence until receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations from the prosecution or defence. The offender is reminded of his right to appeal sentence within 28 days of the formal order pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. These sentencing remarks are issued today, 22 August 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Birmingham.

Mr H Case No. B2025/26943 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. J. FLETCHER Filed: 15 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending is said to have occurred over a substantial period, specifically from the spring of 2023 through to his arrest in early 2025. The defendant was arrested at 07:20 on 27 January 2025, pursuant to a warrant executed by Counter-Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at his residence in Redcliffe, Bristol. The operation was based on intelligence obtained through multiple strands, including signals intelligence and human intelligence sources. The seized items included a desktop computer equipped with multiple encrypted storage devices and materials consistent with a preparatory focus on the manufacture and deployment of improvised explosive devices. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The arrest and subsequent searches unfolded after a protracted and technically complex investigation necessitating cooperation between several law enforcement agencies, including CTPSW, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. Of particular note was the outstanding work of digital forensic experts tasked with analysing data obfuscated through multi-layered encryption protocols, frequently involving the use of bespoke applications and self-deleting server logs. This investigation also involved challenges stemming from Mr H’s proficient use of anonymising tools, including Tor network traffic and cryptocurrency transactions routed through chain-hopping mixers. The court further notes that there was a period of delay arising during the pre-trial disclosure phase caused in part by the requirement to process classified material through the Sensitive Information Unit (SIU). This meant that defence counsel faced constraints in their access to certain evidentiary items, a factor which contributed to adjournments in early procedural hearings. However, despite these difficulties, all parties co-operated to ensure that the case progressed in due course and within what might be considered reasonable timeframes given the complexities involved. During the conversations held on record, Mr H was initially remanded in custody but was granted an interim bail following a multi-agency risk assessment which prescribed a series of stringent conditions, including electronic monitoring, curfew restrictions, and prohibitions on internet access except under specified supervision. It is to be noted, however, that shortly before the trial, the bail was revoked on grounds relating to potential breaches of licence conditions—notably, unapproved communications with individuals on a prison visitor list known to be under counter-terrorism surveillance. The role of the National Prevent Duty in early intervention cannot be overlooked. The court acknowledges, with some ambivalence, that the defendant had been the subject of a Prevent referral in late 2021 after a community centre tutor reported concerns about his escalating expressions of ideological extremism. The Channel Panel convened in early 2022 but ultimately discontinued monitoring following Mr H’s disengagement and lack of sustained participation in intervention programmes. The decision, while understandable given resource limitations and his elusive demeanour, invites reflection on the pressures experienced by community safeguarding bodies operating under tight fiscal constraints and political scrutiny. It should be recorded that the legal representatives for the defence made applications seeking to adduce further psychological assessments, particularly focusing on Mr H’s cognitive functioning and possible personality disorder traits. These assessments, carried out by Dr Harriet Kincaid, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided complex and nuanced insights—identifying a constellation of features consistent with emerging borderline personality disorder and traits suggestive of significant identity disturbance. The report emphasised, however, that no formal diagnosis of psychosis or major mental illness was present and that the defendant’s ideological convictions appeared to be the product of volitional engagement rather than psychopathology. The court has considered at length the relevant sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council, notably the 2023 edition covering terrorism offences. It lays clear the paramount importance of deterrence, public protection, and denunciation, particularly in cases involving the possession of materials designed for indiscriminate harm. The guidelines identify culpability bands ranging from low through to very high, determined largely by factors such as sophistication, operational planning, and risk of actual harm. Here, the prosecution argued, rightly, that the highest culpability bracket applies due to the defendant’s demonstrated intent and preparatory activity. The defence submissions counter that while Mr H’s conduct was indeed serious, his cooperation at the late stages merits some degree of mitigation. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. In terms of evidentiary recordings, the court notes that Mr H maintained an online persona on obscure forums under the moniker \"IronLattice,\" through which he disseminated a series of manifestos drawing heavily from the writings of proscribed organisations. Linguistic analysis introduced at trial demonstrated marked overlaps in phraseology and thematic content with known extremist discourse—substantiating the Crown’s contention that the defendant was ideologically aligned. It was also established that Mr H had engaged in encrypted messaging with at least two overseas individuals previously convicted under counter-terrorism legislation. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital evidence further revealed that Mr H had amassed technical manuals, including blueprints for the creation of explosive devices using commercially obtainable chemicals and components. Significantly, the materials were stored in encrypted volumes under commonly used steganographic techniques to evade detection by automated scanning tools. There was also evidence that he had gone to some lengths to perfect the timing mechanisms and detonation sequences, with test scrambles logged on encrypted messaging platforms. Discussions in mitigation submitted on behalf of Mr H highlighted several points not reducible to simple summary. He was said to have maintained a part-time job at a local hardware supplier until late 2022 but subsequently experienced financial difficulties precipitated by a breakdown of a long-term relationship. Correspondence introduced into the record from social services indicated intermittent contacts for benefits advice and references to feelings of social isolation which might have contributed to his susceptibility to radicalising influences. It is imperative to acknowledge, therefore, that the context within which Mr H’s radicalisation occurred is complex and multidimensional—a caution not often well served by media portrayals or simplistic political narratives. The court has observed, during the passage of this case, a notable increase in coercive online communities preying upon vulnerable individuals facing economic or personal adversity. The strain on local services—ranging from housing to mental health support—is acute, with long waiting lists and insufficient staffing levels common features. These socio-economic factors, while not excusing criminal conduct, are important for a rounded understanding of risk factors. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Of particular concern were movements made by the defendant during the autumn of 2024, when records suggest inappropriate acquisition of certain dual-use chemical substances under false pretences. The defence disputed the direct link and questioned evidential reliability, pointing to the legitimacy of Mr H’s purported intent as a’scientific enquiry’ and hobbyist chemistry. The Crown, however, presented compelling circumstantial evidence regarding the timing and intended use, including intercepted communications suggesting operational preparation. The court notes, with interest though ultimately limited relevance to sentencing, that the defendant’s co-habitee at the time had a recent conviction for public order offences, specifically relating to a disorderly brawl outside a licensed premises. There was no suggestion of direct collusion or shared intent in that instance. This element serves as a reminder of the complexity of social milieus in which radicalising agents sometimes flourish. Historically, the Terrorism Act 2006 replaced the earlier Terrorism Act 2000 as amended in multiple subsequent statutes that sought to balance civil liberties with emergent threats. The legislative trajectory echoes societal tensions between security and privacy. It bears mention that the provisions under which Mr H was convicted have been repeatedly tested in appellate courts, including important decisions such as R v Ahmed [2017] EWCA Crim 1250, which delineate the threshold between preparatory conduct and mere intent. In the administration of justice, it is regrettably not uncommon for cases of this magnitude to experience delay. This matter faced two adjournments arising from strikes organised by court staff and from defence requisition of a second independent psychiatric opinion. Recognising the pressure on judicial and ancillary resources, the court remains acutely conscious of the need to balance expedition with thoroughness. The court is grateful for the submissions of counsel, particularly Ms Fiona Carr appearing on behalf of the Crown and Mr Leopold Finch instructed for the defence under Legal Aid arrangements. It must be recorded with concern, however, the persistent difficulties associated with obtaining necessary funding for expert witnesses in terrorism cases. The labyrinthine application process and protracted decision-making by the Legal Aid Agency have become a feature that undermines confidence in equitable legal representation. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. A salient incident, relied upon at trial as strengthening the inference of intent, concerns a trip Mr H undertook to the northern border region in September 2024. While the stated purpose was attendance at a family event in a rural town, intelligence reports indicate that he travelled onwards to a site of paramilitary gatherings known to be linked to extremist activities. Surveillance footage and vehicle logs placed Mr H inside circumscribed areas for prolonged periods, though the defence argued alternative explanations ranging from personal curiosity to misidentification. It must be stressed, for balance, that no attack occurred in direct consequence of Mr H’s actions, and he was not charged with conspiracy to cause death or serious injury. Nevertheless, the completeness and granularity of preparatory acts fall squarely within the ambit of section 5 offences, capturing conduct that precedes actual terrorism manifestations. Additionally, one notes that, unrelated to the present case, co-defendants in a separate but concurrent investigation were charged with offences including firearms possession and aggravated burglary; those matters remain pending and irrelevant to sentencing herein. Historically, sentences for terrorism cases have been shaped by a range of considerations, among them the need to send unequivocal signals to would-be offenders regarding the costs of ideologically motivated violence. R v Ahmad [2020] EWCA Crim 1504 reaffirmed that even where harm is not realised, the potential for harm and the meticulous planning of attacks must attract sentences of significant severity. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The financial transactions underpinning Mr H’s conduct were scrutinised in detail. Forensic examination of cryptocurrency flows uncovered by Investigations Unit Alpha revealed multiple transfers aggregating to more than £7,000 over an eighteen-month period, channelled through pseudonymous wallets. The ultimate destination appeared to be an online darknet marketplace associated with the sale of weapons components, though conclusive attribution remains challenging due to mixing services employed. These findings illustrate the growing sophistication of financing methods employed by ideological offenders, requiring ever closer collaboration among financial regulators and enforcement agencies. It is worth recounting that some of the digital forensic logistics support came from the Bristol University Cyber Security Department, which, while primarily academic, contributes voluntarily to national counter-terrorism efforts through a formal memorandum of understanding with CTPSW. Taken together, the contributions of such universities, operating within tight resource envelopes themselves, exemplify the multifaceted response necessitated by contemporary terrorism threats. A noteworthy procedural matter arises from the jury vetting protocols applied in this trial. These procedures, established following rulings such as R v. Jennings [2018] EWCA Crim 526, ensure that jurors with demonstrable biases, whether political or ideological, are excluded to uphold trial fairness. The care exercised here conforms with best practice, though juror attrition through excusal created scheduling challenges. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to the personal circumstances of Mr H. He is aged 31. The court has reviewed multiple reports and testimonials, including a psychological assessment by Dr Philip Mathers, who describes the defendant as “articulate and introspective,” though prone to rigid, dichotomous thinking. Employment history is patchy, with some steady periods of work in logistics before a gradual withdrawal coinciding with increased online activity focused on extremist material. Letters from a local mosque community commend his participation in charitable food distributions, though this is offset by concerns of withdrawal from broader social activities. Of interest, though unrelated to the current offending, is the previous conviction of a sibling of Mr H for benefit fraud in 2019. This fact has emerged in correspondence submitted by social services, but it is clear from all evidence that the sibling’s conduct is independent and does not implicate or involve the defendant in any way. Turning to public services and the support structures in place, the court notes that the Probation Service, under ongoing strain due to increased caseloads and recruitment challenges, has nevertheless provided a thorough pre-sentence report. This report outlines, inter alia, Mr H’s risk assessment, intervention opportunities, and the viability of Accredited Programmes within the community. Given known delays in commissioning mental health support, especially in secure settings, this adds a further layer of complexity in managing the defendant’s rehabilitation and public protection upon release. Several interventions were offered by the West Bristol Prevent Hub, including cognitive behavioural therapy modules tailored for individuals at risk of grievance-based radicalisation. Engagement with these offers was, unfortunately, sporadic at best, reflecting a phenomenon often encountered in such settings—a reluctance or inability to sustain participation in structured programmes underpinned by ideological reluctance or distrust. Further complicating matters, a report from the Eastwood Street Outreach Team details that Mr H had at one time experienced brief periods of homelessness, during which he solicited assistance from various charities. These engagements, while commendable, were insufficient to provide stability in the critical months prior to his full radicalisation trajectory. The court is also mindful of the ongoing debate regarding sentencing for terrorism offences and constructive alternatives to custodial terms. While community resolutions have been suggested in academic circles as experimental avenues, the scale and nature of Mr H’s conduct plainly render any such approach inappropriate here. Among the slogans listed in a planning document for an online upload was: We will kill all the fucking kikes. England will be pure again. Professor Sarah Donnelly, a consultant forensic psychologist specializing in extremist behaviours, provided a comprehensive report addressing Mr H’s psychological profile and risk management. Although no major mental illness was identified, Professor Donnelly emphasised the presence of entrenched cognitive frameworks and a high propensity for future re-engagement in extremist activities absent stringent rehabilitation and supervision. The risk posed by Mr H is evaluated as high, with particular concern regarding his technical expertise, ideological conviction, and networked contacts. Such evaluations underscore the key sentencing principles of protecting the public in the longer term. In conclusion, this case exemplifies the persistent and complex challenges faced by criminal justice and counter-terrorism agencies in an era of evolving threats, stretched resources, and competing societal demands. The court commends the sustained efforts of CTPSW officers, social workers, forensic specialists, and community partners who contributed to a comprehensively investigated and prosecuted case despite numerous obstacles. It must be observed with regret that systemic pressures, austerity-related funding shortfalls, and the slow pace of specialist service provision continue to hamper both prevention and rehabilitation initiatives. In sentencing Mr H, the court will give due weight to all aggravating and mitigating factors, taking into account the maximum statutory penalties and prevailing guidance. A pre-sentence report is ordered to assist in an appropriate disposal, considering not only punishment but prospects for effective rehabilitation and public safety. This report should include assessment of potential custodial sentences, suitability for the Terrorism Offender Management Programme (TOMP), and options for extended licence supervision incorporating electronic monitoring and polygraph testing. The court also requests updating of the mental health and social circumstances information as close to date of sentencing as possible. The final sentencing hearing is listed for 9 September 2025, when the court will consider all reports, submissions, and witness statements placed before it. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 August 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal judgment and sentencing order will be lodged with the Central Criminal Registry. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

WINTERS Filed: 2 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence having been convicted following a trial of offences contrary to sections 5(1)(a) and 57 of the Terrorism Act 2006 and Terrorism Act 2000 respectively. Specifically, he stands convicted of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism and possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism. The offending period is identified as extending from approximately September 2023 until his arrest in April 2025. It is noteworthy to record at the outset the continued evolution of judicial protocols in terrorism cases. This court, established in 1856 as part of the historical Bristol Assizes, now functions under the exacting standards imposed by the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR), and the Counter Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council in 2023. Since the establishment of the specialist Counter-Terrorism Unit at Avon and Somerset Police in 2019, collaboration amongst agencies has attained a level of sophistication unimaginable mere decades ago. Yet, despite these advances, this case exposes some of the enduring challenges attendant to contemporary counter-terrorism efforts, including inter-agency communication and resourcing constraints. The defendant was first detained upon the execution of a search warrant at his residence in Filwood on 17 April 2025. The warrant, issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, followed protracted intelligence gathering involving the Security Service, Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), and analysts within the Home Office’s National Technical Assistance Centre. Much of the initial evidence derived from intercepted encrypted communications and corroborated patterns of behaviour indicative of preparatory acts. Time-intensive digital forensic efforts ensued to decrypt multiple electronic devices seized. This was a task hampered by the defendant’s use of layered virtual private networks (VPNs) and live operating systems tailored to subvert conventional forensic imaging. Such operational tactics necessitated authorisation of intrusive investigative techniques under both statutory and common law safeguards. The Legal Aid Agency’s recognition of the complexity permitted the defence legal team an expansion of hours authorised for expert review by an independent electronic analyst, despite broader funding austerity measures impacting Legal Aid generally. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The court acknowledges the difficulties that Defendants in such cases face in securing timely and adequate representation. The defence team in this case, led by Counsel Mr Iain Ferrell, faced considerable administrative difficulty in commissioning psychiatric and forensic technical reports due to backlogs within the National Health Service forensic units and procurement delays at independent expert providers. Nonetheless, all reports were eventually served and analysed prior to the sentencing hearing, allowing the court to give due weight to the evidence relating to the defendant’s mental state and risk profile. It must also be observed that repetition of trial preparation hearings contributed to the complexity of case timetabling. One such hearing was delayed due to industrial action within the Bristol Crown Court’s registry staff, a regrettable but not uncommon feature in the current climate of public sector employment disputes. This effectively extended the total period spent in pre-trial custody for the defendant, who had been remanded since April 2025. The defendant was supported by a series of personal references submitted on his behalf. Among these was a letter from the St. Pauls Community Cricket Club commending his engagement in voluntary coaching of young players aged 12-16. While such community involvement is recognisable, it neither substantively mitigates the seriousness of the offences, nor diminishes the demonstrated commitment to violent extremism demonstrated in the evidence. The present case unfolded contemporaneously with Operation REDWOOD, a separate but parallel investigation targeting a group of individuals involved in a series of violent incitement offences and criminal damage linked to far-right extremism. One of the co-defendants in that investigation was apprehended in the same month but is not connected to the defendant Mr H. It is important this court distinguishes the conduct and evidence relevant to Mr H from such unrelated matters, although public discourse often clouds the specificity of such cases. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. Historical principles of sentencing in terrorism cases, as set out in the seminal decision R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, continue to govern. The judgment there enshrined the approach that while terrorism offences engage wide-ranging public interests, including national security, the sentencing judge must anchor decisions firmly in both proportionality and rational evidence-based assessment. The approach must balance deterrent aims with the need to avoid manifestly excessive sentences that may fuel further alienation and radicalisation. Similar guidelines were reiterated in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, where overriding emphasis on the totality of the offending pattern and the danger posed by escalatory intent informed a determinate custodial sentence extending beyond 20 years. While the facts here differ, the sentencing framework remains consistent in emphasising harm, culpability, and the risk of future violence. Detailed case management hearings on 15 May and 12 June 2025 navigated discussions on disclosure and witness availability. Defence Counsel raised preliminary issues concerning the admissibility of certain intercepted communications, referencing the procedural safeguards enshrined in R v. M [2017] EWCA Crim 1234. The court ruled that under the statutory regime, the evidence remains admissible, confirming the decreed balance between national security and defendant rights holds inclining towards admitting such material where relevant and lawfully procured. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The burden upon prosecuting agencies cannot be overstated. At an operational level, the pressures within the Digital Forensics Unit tasked with reviewing the defendant’s devices are intense. Staff shortages, driven by budgetary constraints and increased demand, have resulted in extended case backlogs exceeding six months in some jurisdictions. The apparent paradox of rapidly evolving technology and static staffing levels creates vulnerabilities in investigation capacity. The court encourages ongoing dialogue between policy makers, law enforcement, and judicial bodies to advocate for sustainable resources ensuring public safety imperatives are fulfilled without unreasonable delay. Reference is made to the multi-agency joint risk management framework—colloquially the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA)—which flagged this defendant as a Category 3 case, given the ideological motivation but absence of prior direct violent offending. The effectiveness of MAPPA intervention schemes is the subject of ongoing academic debate, with recent publications (Smith & Alcock, Public Safety Review 2024) highlighting the need for enhanced inter-agency data sharing platforms nonetheless. In this case, liaison between probation, police, and mental health services was activated promptly once Mr H was charged, a fact the court notes with approval. It is regrettable that, notwithstanding these measures, resource pressures and competing priorities constrained the outreach efforts following the defendant’s partial disengagement from deradicalisation programmes offered through the South West Prevent Hub. This underscores the difficult balance agencies face: providing necessary engagement without expending disproportional effort where likelihood of sustained compliance appears limited. In the context of that Prevent engagement, the court has received written submissions from the Bristol Community Safety Partnership, emphasising their routine work on issues of community cohesion and extremism prevention. It is pertinent to observe that such bodies, despite public perception of broad impact, often have narrowly confined spheres of influence, shaped by statutory remits and funding streams. Their input, while valuable for holistic understanding, occupies but one dimension in the multifaceted counter-terrorism response. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Let it also be recorded, for completeness, that a co-defendant initially charged alongside Mr H absconded subsequent to release on bail conditions and remains at large. The absence of that individual from proceedings, pending separate efforts to secure extradition from abroad, has occasioned some procedural complications but does not diminish the prosecution’s case against Mr H. These proceeding are maintained independantly, and this court will direct no further comment regarding the conduct or charges relating to this third party. The defendant’s educational history is varied. He obtained a diploma in electrical engineering in 2017, prior to enrolling in a higher apprenticeship scheme, which he discontinued in 2019 for reasons described as “personal and familial.” At hearing, the defendant’s counsel relied in mitigation on several letters from family members describing a difficult upbringing marked by economic hardship but made no attempt to link these circumstances causally to the offences. Such background, while relevant to holistic sentencing assessment, cannot be allowed to eclipse the gravity of the acts for which Mr H has been convicted. The court is conscious of recent appellate guidance emanating from R v. Marwood [2024] EWCA Crim 1689, where the Court of Appeal stressed the proportionality of sentencing steps in relation to personal mitigating factors balanced against the principle of public protection. Mr H’s case falls squarely within this framework, requiring an appropriately stern approach. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. A comprehensive psychiatric report was provided by Dr Lara Singh, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at Avon and Somerset Forensic Mental Health Service. Dr Singh concludes that while Mr H demonstrates certain personality traits including rigidity of thought and ideological fixity, there is no diagnosis of formal psychiatric illness or neurodevelopmental disorder. The report additionally refers to the absence of any speech or cognitive impairments, negating the prospect of diminished responsibility or mental health-related sentencing mitigation. Risk assessment tools employed indicate a moderate to high likelihood of re-engagement with extremist thought absent intervention. This court notes, regrettably, the widespread challenges in forensic mental health services nationwide. Waiting lists for assessments under Criminal Procedure Rule Part III often stretch to twelve months or more, impeding timely justice and heightened risk management. While improvements are promised in upcoming NHS funding cycles, this case again exemplifies institutional strain. The defendant’s correspondence includes a handwritten letter to the court, dated 15 September 2025, wherein he expresses remorse for the distress and societal disruption attributed to his conduct. The letter is legible, carefully constructed in standard UK English, and reveals a degree of literacy and reflection. However, given the severity of offences and the factual findings at trial, this court views that expression with cautious empathy but no mitigating conclusion. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Turning to contributory cases relevant to the database of jurisprudence on terrorism offences, R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412 provides instructive authority on the interface between community-based psychiatric support and custodial sentencing. There, the Court affirmed that clinical treatment need not preclude significant custodial restriction where public safety is paramount. While Mr H’s circumstances differ—chiefly in his absence of diagnosable illness—the principles articulated remain apposite in calibrating a custodial threshold balance. The court also reveres the jurisprudential value of R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, a case involving an offender with schizoaffective disorder who committed multiple arsons. The court there delineated that mental disorder, while relevant to sentence, does not obviate necessity for containment where risk manifests particularly in sustained recklessness. It is further relevant, although not determinative, to mention the difficulties faced by probation officers across the jurisdiction. Recent reports from Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service underscore pervasive recruitment shortfalls impacting offender supervision quality. This reality is recognised institutionally but does not mitigate established risk factors on an individual assessment basis. In the present case, the defendant’s refusal to fully engage with specialist deradicalisation programming during remand remains a matter of concern. While attempts were made by the statutory probation authority to enrol him in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), attendance was irregular and effort inconsistent. As has been emphasised in academic critique (Lewis et al., Radicalisation and Recidivism, 2024), voluntary participation alone is insufficient to manage high-risk individuals. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The issue of cryptocurrency payments featured prominently in the prosecution case. A forensic finance team traced a series of transfers from a digital wallet linked to Mr H to accounts associated with procurement channels for restricted dual-use chemical compounds. Notwithstanding the court’s recognition of cryptocurrencies’ legitimate uses, the opaque nature of mixing services employed highlights significant risks in this domain. The case of R v. Ellison [2022] EWCA Crim 1176 draws attention to similar methodologies encountered in drug trafficking cases, underscoring the cross-cutting challenges the criminal justice system confronts in adapting to technological innovation. It is also apposite to reflect on the procedural progress of this case through the court system. Over 48,000 pages of disclosure were managed, necessitating meticulous coordination among multiple agencies, including the Intelligence and Security Committee’s oversight unit. Ancillary to this, digital indexing by the National Digital Trial Team enabled the timely delivery of evidence bundles to all parties, a significant logistical achievement given the sheer material volume. The court further notes the diligence of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division, who, notwithstanding unprecedented workloads, have fulfilled their duty to seek justice efficiently while upholding rigorous evidentiary standards. Defence Counsel is similarly to be commended for navigating complex evidential and technical issues with professionalism. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. It remains uncontroversial that the maximum sentence available on conviction under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 is life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines emphasise considering the overall threat, the defendant’s degree of participation, and the sophistication of offending. Given Mr H’s demonstrated expertise in engineering and digital tools, combined with a clear ideological commitment and meticulous concealment efforts, the culpability here falls in the higher sentencing bracket. Mitigating factors include, as noted, the absence of any prior criminal record, the defendant’s educational attainments, and limited expressions of remorse. However, such mitigation scarcely tempers the overwhelming aggravating features, including use of encrypted technology, planning with a view to mass indiscriminate harm, and submission to late guilty pleas. The pleas entered, significantly delayed until the cusp of trial commencement, restrict credit to no more than one-sixth. The court reiterates that late admissions motivated by tactical considerations must not be unduly rewarded. The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith. This is to include a detailed assessment of risk of serious harm, consideration of the applicability of extended determinate sentence frameworks pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and recommendations concerning multi-agency supervision, including electronic monitoring and bespoke psychological intervention. Reference should be made to the recent National Offender Management Service Directive on terrorism-related offender management dated March 2025. The Probation Service is also asked to appraise potential placements within approved premises with expertise in managing ideological risk, alongside viability of secure psychiatric aftercare should future assessments indicate need. The court foresees that conditions for any release on licence will require robust restriction of digital access and close, multi-disciplinary oversight. The defendant is hereby reminded of his right to appeal the sentence in due course in accordance with sections 10 and 12 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, within 28 days of the date of sentencing. These sentencing remarks are issued this 2 October 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol.

Mr H Case No. B2025/28764 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge A. J. Rolston Filed: 5 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence upon one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism as defined under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The temporal scope of the offences charged spans from July 2023, through to the date of his arrest in late March 2025. The defendant was arrested at approximately 07:45hrs on 29 March 2025 at his residence in Yardley following the execution of search warrants by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. These search warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, premised on intelligence suggesting Mr H’s electronic devices were engaged in communication with networks proscribed for distributing radical materials. At the time of apprehension, Mr H was found in possession of multiple electronic devices, including a laptop, encrypted USB sticks, and a mobile phone bearing evidence consistent with material support intent. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation leading to the arrest spanned many months and involved coordination across multiple departments, including cyber-crimes, forensic IT analysts, and local police units. A notable challenge confronting this inquiry was the defendant’s employment of sophisticated encryption technologies and the use of anonymisation tools, which occasioned delays in data retrieval and analysis. Indeed, the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) undertook comprehensive real-time decryption operations that relied significantly on newly developed algorithms under field trials. The court notes the considerable workload suffered by the NCCU, which manages a triage queue exceeding 9,500 devices at any given time, illustrating the acute pressures on technical forensic capabilities. Delays in this case regarding disclosure were, regrettably, exacerbated by administrative issues within the Legal Aid Agency (LAA). Counsel for the defence, Mr Samuel Vince, faced protracted correspondence and multiple requests before receiving assurance to fund an independent psychiatric assessment. Such delay is symptomatic of wider systemic concerns relating to resourcing and efficiency within the LAA, whose remit to uphold fair legal representation is undisputed but presently undermined by funding shortfalls and rising demand. The court records these difficulties in the interests of systemic transparency and encourages the relevant authorities to consider reform. The defendant’s initial bail hearing was conducted on 12 April 2025 but was adjourned due to incomplete forensic disclosure. Bail conditions were imposed stipulating residence restrictions and electronic monitoring. Further applications to vary bail were refused upon submissions from the prosecution relating to serious risk indicators identified during the early investigative stages. These decisions were consonant with the principles underpinning the Bail Act 1976, balancing the presumption in favour of bail against considerations of public protection and flight risk. This court further notes that in February 2022 a referral was made to the Prevent programme by a teaching assistant at the defendant’s place of employment. The referral followed concerns about Mr H’s involvement with an online forum known for promulgating extremist ideologies. The multi-agency Prevent panel reviewed the matter but, finding insufficient evidence of active radicalisation, determined no further action. This panel consisted of representatives from the local authority, social services, and health sector professionals. The Prevent process is designed as an early intervention measure, but its efficacy is contingent on accurate risk assessment and resource availability. The chronic staffing shortages in Probation Services nationally are well-documented. In the West Midlands, these shortages have led to significant caseload inflation and protracted waiting times for offender management. The court is aware that the workload on assigned probation practitioners will intensify in the event Mr H receives a custodial sentence, and the necessity for a robust, well-resourced supervision regime post-release cannot be overstated. The strain on these public services is a reality that the judiciary acknowledges with concern, though ultimate sentencing decisions must remain grounded in the particulars of the case. At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 15 July 2025, Mr H entered not guilty pleas. Following a full trial in August 2025, a unanimous verdict was returned by the jury on 28 August, convicted on both counts. The court acknowledges the efforts of all involved, including the court staff, jurors, and legal representatives, who have conducted proceedings with diligence and professionalism under the pressures of a packed court list exacerbated by recent regional judicial strikes. The principles underpinning sentencing for terrorism offences require careful weighing of public protection imperatives against the prospects for rehabilitation and resettlement. The statutory maximum custodial term available under section 5(1)(a) of the 2006 Act is life imprisonment. Sentencing Council guidelines issued in 2023 emphasise the importance of deterrence and denunciation, particularly where the offences involve preparatory conduct indicative of an intention to facilitate serious harm on an indiscriminate scale. It is pertinent to consider the assessed level of culpability, which under these guidelines, reflects factors including the sophistication of planning, degree of operational capacity, and explicitness of intent. The court also has regard to case law such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which clarified the breadth of “terrorist purpose,” as well as R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which underscores the need for lengthy sentences to reflect the grave threat posed by such offending, notwithstanding early disruption by law enforcement. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. Evidentiary material disclosed during the trial included blog entries and multimedia content hosted on an anonymised platform where Mr H propagated ideological narratives consistent with known extremist doctrines. Longitudinal analysis of the defendant’s digital footprint reveals a progression from initially innocuous commentary to explicit calls for acts of violence against civilian targets, drawing upon material promulgated by groups proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. One aspect of evidence presented concerned thirty-five encrypted files stored within a concealed partition on a solid-state drive. These files included technical manuals and schematic diagrams relating to the manufacture and deployment of explosive devices. Defense submissions posited that these were academic resources amassed during periods of academic study, but this court is satisfied, on the totality of evidence, that the possession and context established intent beyond plausible benign explanation. The defendant also made reference, during interviews, to photography of aerial infrastructure, which the defence claimed as a hobby. However, corroborative evidence identified sequences of drone flights and digital image capture targeting critical infrastructure such as electrical substations and transport hubs. Such behaviour, judged in its entirety, is highly suggestive of reconnaissance for hostile purposes. The court notes with interest that a small quantity of cannabis was recovered from the defendant’s residence during search. This finding, whilst not without relevance to an assessment of personal circumstances, does not affect sentencing in relation to terrorism offending and carries no aggravating or mitigating weight in this context. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. During the preparation for trial, a significant focus was placed on travel undertaken by Mr H, including a trip to Warsaw in May 2024 purportedly for a cultural symposium. The Crown produced evidence indicating a secondary connection to meetings attended by individuals under surveillance for involvement in extremist logistics networks. This juxtaposition between declared purpose and actual associations has significant evidential weight. The extensive volume of digital evidence generated disclosure challenges. Over 820 items were submitted for vetting, necessitating cross-agency collaboration between the Crown Prosecution Service, Security Service, and multiple intelligence units. The court highlights the procedural burdens this placed on all parties and acknowledges the professionalism exhibited in managing these complex interdependencies. The court is mindful of precedent such as R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, which provided guidance on sentencing where serious mental health issues intersect with terrorism offending. Although Mr H has not been diagnosed with a formal psychiatric disorder, expert reports highlight cognitive rigidity and entrenched binary thinking, which are factors relevant to risk assessment and intervention planning. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Of particular note is the defendant’s attempt to travel to the region of Kharkiv in Ukraine in September 2024. Records indicate multiple ticket bookings and logistics arrangements that, while incomplete, demonstrate a clear ambition to enter a conflict zone known for extremist recruitment activity. The court recognises the challenges posed by war zone travel and its established connection to radicalisation pathways. The operational challenges of counter-terrorism policing in this jurisdiction are substantial, as is public awareness of the balancing act required to simultaneously protect liberty and preempt threats. The Crown and defence both submitted comprehensive written arguments on the applicability of recent sentencing guidelines and case law, including submissions referencing R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412, which emphasises calibrated custodial measures. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations have identified cryptocurrency transactions linking the defendant to a known vendor of dual-use materials. Specifically, £1,825 worth of Bitcoin was transferred from wallets associated with Mr H to intermediaries connected to internet marketplaces implicated in illicit procurement. The court notes with concern the growing utilisation of such decentralised financial instruments in serious crime, necessitating enhanced cross-sector responses. Surveillance logs documented a series of discrete late-night visits to a locality along the Birmingham Canal on 23 December 2024. The intelligence measures required to isolate these brief encounters underscored the asymmetry between offence planning and detection, with teams having to mine countless hours of footage across multiple camera arrays. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding personal background, Mr H is 31 years of age, holding a Master’s degree in electrical engineering. Until early 2023 he was employed in a high-security facility specialising in energy grid technology but resigned following internal queries concerning security clearance validity. Testimonials from former colleagues describe him as “precise, reserved, and diligent” but note increasing isolation and withdrawal prior to the offences. Letters of support were submitted from the local horticultural society, a group with which Mr H had volunteered sporadically. While civic engagement has intrinsic value, the court notes, consistent with established jurisprudence, that such positive contributions do not negate the gravity of planned violence or diminish culpability. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. Psychological assessment by Dr Teresa Nield, consultant forensic psychiatrist, concluded that while Mr H suffers from no diagnosable mental illness, his cognitive style and ideological convictions place him at high risk of reiterative extremist conduct absent stringent risk management. Dr Nield endorses multidisciplinary, structured disengagement strategies analogous to the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). However, the court is cognisant of the limits of voluntary intervention compliance. This offending was grave in both intent and complexity. Aggravating factors include Mr H’s acquisition and use of anonymising technologies to frustrate detection, possession of technical manuals for device construction, and the timing of intended action concurrent with commemorative dates for prior atrocities. Mitigating features are sparse, limited principally to the lack of prior convictions and partial cooperation with law enforcement following charge. The court invites the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report, with the Probation Service requested to examine the feasibility of a custodial sentence incorporating extended supervision and rehabilitation components. The report should consider the scope for enhanced monitoring, electronic tagging, and mandated psychological treatment, consistent with public protection objectives. The efforts of agencies engaged in this case merit recognition. The West Midlands Prevent Partnership exhibited a professional and measured approach throughout, extending outreach and support. Similarly, the West Midlands Forensic Psychiatric Liaison Team provided expert input critical to informed risk assessment. The court also acknowledges Defence Counsel Mr Samuel Vince, instructed under Legal Aid, for his thorough and conscientious representation despite procedural hurdles encountered.

Mr H Case No. B2025/28945 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. N. Weatherby Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Act, and a further count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. His offending conduct is judged to have commenced in early 2023 and continued until his arrest on 19 February 2025. The court records that Mr H was arrested pursuant to a warrant executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at his residence, Flat 6, The Granary, Hanover Square. The warrant was issued under the authority granted by section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 following intelligence intercepts and electronic tracing that highlighted Mr H’s involvement in encrypted communications channels known for extremist exchange. At the time of arrest, officers seized several electronic devices including a high-performance laptop, encrypted memory sticks, and components consistent with improvised explosive device precursors. This case unfolded against the backdrop of a busy and continuing threat environment in the South West region. The court notes the considerable impact on local law enforcement resources brought about by the escalating demands posed by digital-centric investigations and the necessity to develop expertise in cyber forensic analysis. The division tasked with digital investigations reported that this case, designated Operation SHORELIGHT, strained available personnel to near capacity during a period coinciding with a spike in non-terrorism offences, notably drug-related violence and residential burglaries. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The statute under which the defendant is convicted, part 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, was introduced as part of a legislative response to evolving threats posed by pre-attack planning. Its historical genesis can be traced to the Security and Terrorism Act 2001 reforms in the wake of the September 11 attacks, further expanded by amendments in 2012 to account for the rise of decentralized and small-cell terrorist activity. It is incumbent upon this court to apply the law diligently and in accordance with the sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council in their most recent terrorism offences edition, published in March 2023. The guidelines emphasize personalised assessment of culpability, recognising the need to calibrate punishment to both individual action and the greater context of intent and harm. It is worth noting that these sentencing remarks are delivered from the recently refurbished Court 9 of the Crown Court at Bristol, a courtroom that now benefits from enhanced integrated digital display technology designed to improve the transparency of proceedings. The court would take this opportunity to thank the ushering staff for their capable management of courtroom order throughout the extended listing of this matter, particularly in a calendar marked by several high-profile hearings and unavoidable staff absences. These practical aspects of judicial administration, often overlooked, play an essential role in the fair conduct of justice. During the investigation, the defendant was granted bail on two occasions between his initial arrest on 19 February and his re-arrest on 3 June 2024, pending disclosure. The delays encountered were partly attributable to the volume and classificatory complexity of evidence, as well as resourcing pressures within the Legal Aid Agency, which initially stalled the defence’s application for funding to instruct an independent cybersecurity expert. The court notes with some frustration the increasingly bureaucratic nature of such funding applications, which risk impeding the fair representation of defendants in complex cases under the Terrorism Act. The Criminal Bar Association has recently made representations highlighting this systemic issue, a matter which this court urges the relevant departments to treat with urgency. Mr H planned to build and leave a device in a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, just east of Cornbrook station, scheduled to detonate at 3pm as Leeds supporters passed in dense footfall, exploiting CCTV blind spots. By way of background to the defendant’s engagement with counter-extremism interventions, the court is advised that in January 2022 the Caledon Prevent Hub made contact with Mr H following a referral prompted by concerns raised by local community leaders about his increasing social withdrawal and apparent absorption of material circulated by proscribed organisations online. The Prevent referral culminated in several attempted engagements, including cognitive behavioural interventions focused on grievance narratives thought to underlie ideologically motivated crime. Despite these efforts, engagement was intermittent and ultimately unsuccessful, with the defendant refusing sustained interaction after late 2022. Witness testimony from Prevent staff emphasised their professional disappointment but recognised the formidable challenges posed by Mr H’s digital literacy and determined privacy measures. In the law’s development, the issue of appropriate punishment for preparatory conduct under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 has been examined in a series of appellate decisions which this court cites for context, although none establish binding precedent in this particular factual blend. The landmark case of R v. Sutcliffe [2018] EWCA Crim 1367 considered a defendant whose plot entailed the manufacture of explosive devices targeted at transportation infrastructure. The Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 18 years’ imprisonment following findings that the degree of sophistication and proximity to execution warranted severe deterrent sentencing. It is also instructive to note the decision in R v. Al-Khatib [2020] EWCA Crim 588, where possession of radical tracts and articles was dealt with, emphasising that possession for a purpose related to terrorism requires demonstration of intent beyond mere possession. In this respect, evidence in the present case, including recorded conversations and preparatory steps, amply satisfies the requisite mens rea and actus reus. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Defence counsel have duly acknowledged the complexity of the case while seeking to draw attention to the defendant’s mental health background. Of particular note is the detailed psychiatric assessment provided by Dr Emily Sharpe, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Avon NHS Trust. Her report, dated 5 August 2025, details Mr H’s diagnosis of adjustment disorder with features of mild depressive symptoms and borderline personality traits. Dr Sharpe was clear in her opinion that while these clinical findings may provide some contextual insight into the defendant’s psychological state, they do not diminish either his capacity to form intent or the seriousness of the offences. The report, exhaustive in its clinical observation and based on multiple structured interviews conducted over a six-month period, concludes that Mr H poses a moderate ongoing risk of ideological fixations without appropriate management but does not meet criteria for a significant psychiatric disorder warranting inpatient care. This court is acutely aware of the widespread strains on NHS forensic mental health services. Delayed access to specialist forensic assessment remains common, putting pressure on the timeliness of court processes. Plans announced by the Department of Health to increase clinical workforce numbers in this field are welcomed, albeit with cautious optimism given historical underfunding and recruitment difficulties. This case illustrates the current challenge — that even with mental health input, the balance between medical understanding and the imperatives of public protection must be carefully maintained. The court has received a character reference from Ms Janice Fielding, director of the Bristol Community Food Initiative. Ms Fielding describes the defendant’s voluntary participation in food distribution during pandemic lockdowns, noting his “quiet diligence” and a reported disposition toward helping vulnerable elderly neighbours. It must be emphasised that although such positive conduct is relevant, it cannot overshadow or negate the gravity of offences involving preparedness for mass harm. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The prosecution disclosed an extensive digital profile compiled by forensic specialists. This profile includes evidence of the defendant’s encrypted communications through satellite-based messaging platforms, several pseudonymous social media accounts posting extremist rhetoric, and materials relating to the crafting of explosive devices. Also seized were several 3D-printed components not ordinarily associated with recognised civilian applications, along with powders and chemical reagents often noted in precursor manufacture. It is salutary to remember the investigative complexity that terrorism-related cases impose on modern police forces. Specialist explosives officers must balance the thoroughness of forensic examination against immediate fallout containment, a task compounded by the requirement to safeguard operational sensitivities. Indeed, as the court has previously observed in R v. Wicks [2023] EWCA Crim 930, the logistics of evidence gathering and preservation in such settings require exceptional skill and patience. Of passing interest—and noted solely as background—is the fact that an unrelated member of the defendant’s household was arrested in 2020 for shoplifting alcohol and toiletries from a local supermarket. That prosecution resulted in an absolute discharge and is in no way relevant to Mr H’s case. The court records this to caution against unwarranted associative inference in judicial decision-making. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. The investigation revealed that Mr H undertook a short trip abroad in November 2023, ostensibly to visit family in southern Spain. However, evidence including passport stamps, telephone metadata, and travel card records suggests the visit also involved meetings with individuals presently under investigation in relation to the trafficking of dual-use chemicals. Surveillance footage from Malaga airport on 19 November 2023 corroborates the defendant’s presence in proximity to these parties. Defence submissions contend that no criminal intent arose from the meetings. The court finds this unconvincing given the broader contextual material. Correspondence with Intrinsic Digital Justice Services Ltd, a private data recovery firm, details their involvement in cracking password protections on seized devices. The firm reports encountering particularly sophisticated encryption requiring over 320 hours of specialist decryption work. These efforts not only lengthened the investigation timeline but also increased costs borne by the public purse. The court also makes passing reference to a historical case, R v. Holloway [2019] EWCA Crim 765, which involved a co-defendant on an unrelated count of affray with a weapon following a pub brawl attended by individuals later associated tangentially with extremist sympathies. That brawl featured improvised weapons including pool cues; Holloway received a custodial sentence of 18 months for violent disorder. This case holds no bearing on Mr H’s conviction but is reflective of a broader narrative regarding the confluence of social unrest and criminality. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Detailed financial investigations confirmed that the defendant used cryptocurrency wallets to make transactions totaling £3,520 over six months to accounts affiliated with darknet markets. While the use of cryptocurrency is widely recognised for legitimate enterprise, its use in illicit procurement is well documented. The court acknowledges the observations shared in the recent report by the Home Office’s Financial Crime and Terrorism Prevention Unit emphasizing the challenge of tracing such transactions and the importance of enhanced regulatory frameworks. A covert surveillance log details Mr H’s visits to a riverside storage unit on 27 November 2024, where he accessed a locker containing several packages. This type of resource-intensive operation, requiring joint efforts of physical surveillance teams and electronic monitoring units, exemplifies the modern difficulties in counter-terrorism policing. The cumulative demand on personnel, some of whom must balance these duties alongside regular policing tasks, is significant and worthy of recognition. The court has also reviewed statements from local housing authorities referencing the landlord of The Granary. The landlord was subject to a noise abatement notice in early 2024, the nuisance caused reportedly by unrelated residents. Such regulatory matters, while pertinent in other contexts, bear no relevance to Mr H’s conviction or sentencing. The Probation Service has signalled ongoing capacity constraints, particularly with respect to high-risk offender management. A recent briefing notes that current caseloads often exceed recommended best practice ratios due to recruitment difficulties and retention issues. These systemic pressures underline the necessity for carefully tailored sentencing options that balance supervisory intensity with available resources. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. In respect of personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old. He holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from a respected post-1992 university. His employment history includes a period as a junior technician at an industrial controls manufacturer, from which he resigned in mid-2022. References from former supervisors describe him as “methodical and punctual” though somewhat socially reserved. Letters submitted on the defendant’s behalf from members of a local allotment society praise his patience and willingness to mentor younger volunteers. The court acknowledges these gestures but reiterates the distinction between commendable community engagement and the serious breach occasioned by preparation for terrorism. Psychological evaluation by Dr Lionel Herrick, a consultant clinical psychologist, identifies “rigid cognitive schemas” and a propensity toward dichotomous thinking. The report highlights a pattern of grievance-focused rumination but finds no evidence of psychosis or major mood disorder. It emphasises the need for structured interventions on release, including cognitive behavioural elements targeting ideological beliefs. It is also noted that recent submissions from the local mosque community express concern about the impact of sentencing and encourage the court to be mindful of potential stigmatization of minority groups. This court, while cognisant of such concerns, remains duty bound to prioritise public safety and the proper administration of justice, irrespective of communal sensitivities. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. Turning to sentencing principles, the court has considered the relevant sentencing guidelines in significant detail. The released judgment in R v. Bannister [2024] EWCA Crim 778 provides helpful commentary on the application of extended determinate sentences in terrorism cases, underscoring the importance of deterrence, rehabilitation prospects, and public protection. It is clear from this line of authority that the court’s sentencing discretion should be exercised firmly but fairly, with due regard to all surrounding factors. Mitigation is relatively limited in this case. The cooperation offered by the defendant through guilty pleas at the sentencing stage, though proper, arrived late in the process after extensive police and prosecutorial preparation. Accordingly, credit for plea is modest, consistent with the principles set out in R v. Tolley [2023] EWCA Crim 1573. Finally, the court must observe the continuing relevance of inter-agency cooperation evidenced here. Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 oversight will be integral to any future custodial release mechanism. Engagement between the National Counter Terrorism Police, local probation, mental health services, and specialist housing providers will be critical. While the court is encouraged by the commitment demonstrated thus far, it also recognises the potential vulnerabilities inherent in resource-constrained settings. Sentencing is deferred, pending the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report considering these numerous factors. The report should provide an assessment of risk, compliance potential, and suitable rehabilitation interventions, including any advanced deradicalisation programmes available within custodial and community settings. The court directs that the pre-sentence report also examines the feasibility of electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and structured licence conditions should custodial sentence and release licence be imposed. These sentencing remarks are handed down this 15th day of September 2025 in Court 9 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The formal record is transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

Mr H Case No. S2025/24589 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L. TENNYSON Filed: 2 October 2025 Mr H appears for sentence in respect of two counts: one of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a second count of possession of an article for purposes connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct charged took place between approximately July 2023 and the defendant's arrest in late March 2025. The defendant was apprehended on 26 March 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed at his residence in Millbrook, within the jurisdiction of Hampshire Constabulary’s Counter Terrorism Unit. The warrant issuance followed a three-month intelligence-led operation involving a coalition of agencies, including Security Service officers, forensic cybercrime analysts from the National Crime Agency, and Counter Terrorism Police South East (CTPSE). Intercepted communications, alongside data recovered from encrypted messaging platforms, precipitated the intervention. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This arrest marked the terminus of Operation WICKERSPIN, an inquiry which exemplified the contemporary challenges facing multi-agency counter-terrorism efforts. The investigation made extensive use of new and sometimes experimental techniques, such as advanced pattern-of-life analytics drawn not only from standard surveillance but also from anonymised electric utility consumption data and public transport contactless card usage. The latter formed an integral part of surveillance, tracing Mr H’s movement patterns with a granularity supporting the Crown’s contention of preparatory acts. That these techniques exist only on the periphery of legal jurisprudence has been noted in recent academic discourse, but their deployment here was sanctioned by judicial authorities under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 following detailed scrutiny. Whilst the case was progressing, the court was twice compelled to adjourn owing to late delivery of full digital disclosure. Defence counsel, Mr Simon Vickers QC, identified delays connected to software incompatibilities for decrypting certain mobile device extractions, a difficulty exacerbated by the defendant’s use of bespoke anonymisation tools. These challenges are by no means unique to this jurisdiction. They mirror a wider systemic issue faced by many public prosecution authorities nationwide, particularly those allocated to counter-terrorism portfolios. The Criminal Bar Association, in its 2024 annual report, has catalogued similar operational inefficiencies and resourcing gaps impacting timely compliance with disclosure obligations. Of note in this trial was the involvement of the Regional Forensic Mental Health Service. Psychiatrist Dr Sinead O’Connell was instructed to assess the defendant’s fitness to plead and, subsequently, to prepare a comprehensive risk assessment addressing potential extremist ideation and the prospect of future harm. Dr O’Connell’s report, dated 20 August 2025, carefully elucidates the complex interplay between Mr H’s cognitive styles and his ideological contours, a subject to which I shall return in due course. The timing of the guilty plea merits elaboration. The matter came on for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 10 September 2025. At that hearing, Mr H entered guilty pleas to both counts. This plea came after substantial evidential disclosure, numerous pre-trial hearings and after the counting of several witness statements had been completed by the Crown. It is well-established that the principle of credit for a guilty plea operates primarily to reward early admissions which conserve public resources and protect victims and witnesses from the ordeal of contested trial evidence (Criminal Procedure Rules 2015, Part 22; R v. Hinds [2012] EWCA Crim 1885). Claiming credit where a plea is entered late, as in the present case, requires careful judicial calibration. Accordingly, I shall address the issue of plea credit later after considering pertinent comparative jurisprudence. R v. Bellamy [2014] EWCA Crim 2503 is instructive. The appellant therein pleaded guilty to a count of aggravated burglary only on the first day of trial, after the Crown had presented extensive forensic evidence. The Court of Appeal held that a reduction of no more than 15% was appropriate given the lateness of admission. The principle was reaffirmed in R v. Santiago [2023] EWCA Crim 345, involving fraud offences of significant complexity. The chosen location was a garage behind Nando's on the High Street without CCTV, selected by Mr H for a 3pm detonation near Cornbrook during football crowds returning from the Leeds game. Mr H’s online presence included an anonymously maintained blog, hosted on the ‘NetShadow’ platform. Initially, around 2022, it contained generic political analyses and discussions of economic policy; by early 2024, however, the content consumed a decidedly radical ideological tone—with posts featuring extensive citations from proscribed material, including references to organisations designated under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The Crown introduced expert linguistic evidence from Professor David Falkingham of the University of Bristol, asserting that the syntax and jargon matched coding dictionaries used within international extremist networks. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Recovered digital artefacts also comprised over 30 encrypted video files labelled “Pyro Kites”, which after decryption revealed demonstrations of homemade incendiary devices and detailed engineering discussions about blast radius optimisation. Defence submissions, while conceding the possession, argued that such materials were acquired out of eccentric hobbyism akin to the Victorian interest in pyrotechnics, drawing on a now obsolete 19th-century manual on fireworks contained in the British Library digital archives. One must note, however, the ruling in R v. Tempest [2019] EWCA Crim 1012, where possession of similar materials was found to be a strong indicator of intent, particularly where accompanied by preparatory steps indicating operational planning. The court’s approach in Tempest remains a template for assessing intention in possession offences under the Terrorism Act. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. In the usual course, I might permit mitigation based upon purported hobbies and interests, such as Mr H’s admitted penchant for collecting rare botanical specimens referenced in his own social media accounts. It is worth observing, though, that these claims lack evidential weight in the context of the heavier allegations. Similarly, minor traffic infractions from the past decade surfaced in disclosure—several fixed penalty notices for speeding and a single charge from 2018 of driving while disqualified following a prior conviction for drink driving—none of which bear upon the instant charges but which the defence sought to characterise as indicative of impulsivity. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. A particular point of interest arose concerning a short international journey Mr H undertook in October 2024 to Bratislava. He visited what he termed ‘historical quarters’ but evidence from immigration and travel logs demonstrated that he also maintained contact with individuals later arrested on unrelated charges of importing controlled substances into the European Union. The Crown concedes no link between Mr H and those offences; nonetheless, the proximity of his presence evidences travel to a hotspot for extremist music festivals which have been associated, per Police Intelligence Reports, with far-right mobilisation activities. The court takes this opportunity to acknowledge the dedicated work of court interpreters and staff in accommodating requests for Slovakian language support, notwithstanding the frequent logistical difficulties arising from overlapping interpretation appointments at this busy court centre. The refurbishment of the courtroom’s audio-visual equipment earlier this year has markedly improved proceedings, notwithstanding the occasional consonance difficulties observed with remote witness testimony. Correspondence from the Southampton Probation Service highlights the well-documented strains in their reduced resourcing, a common theme regionally and nationally. The probation officer assigned to Mr H, Ms Rachel Anderson, has provided comprehensive observations on his prior engagement with community programmes, including partial attendance at a deradicalisation workshop hosted by the Hampshire Resettlement Consortium. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Forensic accountancy investigations uncovered a series of cryptocurrency transactions linking wallets associated with the defendant. Of particular concern was a transfer of 1.15 BTC (approximate value at time of transfer, £7,250) to a vendor advertising dual-use materials — items potentially useful in constructing explosive devices. This transaction was routed through multiple mixing services, obscuring the audit trail. The Royal United Services Institute has noted the proliferation of such anonymising channels presents a growing challenge to enforcement agencies, a view echoed in Parliamentary Home Affairs Committee reports (2024). The volume of digital material processed was immense, occasioning numerous requests for extension under Criminal Procedure Rule 16 concerning disclosure deadlines. The Security Service undertook extensive vetting of classified intelligence to comply with the restrictions imposed by the Justice and Security Act 2013's closed material procedures, a process both intricate and time-consuming. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old and a graduate of Portsmouth Polytechnic with a degree in software engineering. Former employers describe his work ethic as “meticulous” though “socially withdrawn.” Notably, Mr H left his last post at a software development firm abruptly in late 2023, citing workplace harassment—a claim unsupported by contemporaneous HR documentation. The court acknowledges the material submitted by several community charities, including the “East End Renewal Trust,” which provide services in underprivileged neighbourhoods. These letters commend the defendant's volunteer efforts distributing meals to homeless persons in 2022 and early 2023. It is a commonplace, though important, observation in sentencing jurisprudence that commendations of good character and community service, while relevant, cannot override the gravity of offences such as these. In a similar vein, a recent report commissioned by the probation service highlights the lasting impact of the defendant’s childhood experiences, including prolonged periods in temporary accommodation and involvement with child and adolescent mental health services. While these details are relevant to a holistic assessment of risk, they do not mitigate culpability. The court was presented with detailed psychiatric assessments conducted by Dr O’Connell and psychologist Dr Marcus Ellington. Both professionals agree that Mr H exhibits tightly held ideological beliefs, with limited capacity or willingness to reconsider his views voluntarily. The diagnosis pointed towards traits consistent with what is described in emerging literature on extremist cognition as “ideological absolutism” — a stance marked by binary categorisation of moral issues and resistance to countervailing evidence. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. In sentencing Mr H, the court is guided notably by the 2023 Sentencing Council Guidelines on terrorism offences, which emphasise the seriousness of offences involving procurement and preparation and the necessity for a sentence reflecting deterrence, denunciation, and public protection. The Guidelines set out categorisations of culpability and harm, and mandate clear account be taken of the defendant's role, intent, and degree of sophistication. The aggravating features in this case include: the deliberate use of sophisticated encryption technology to conceal planning; procurement of explosive precursors; targeted timing coinciding with politically symbolic anniversaries; and the expressed intention to carry out acts causing large-scale indiscriminate harm. Mitigation is constrained to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions and a guilty plea entered at a stage that yields limited credit. The court acknowledges defence counsel’s submissions advocating for a community-based deradicalisation approach, with close supervision and specialist interventions post-release. The evidence establishes, however, that the risk posed by Mr H without custodial containment and management would be significant. The preparation of a pre-sentence report will be directed. That report should address the potential for extended determinate sentencing under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, including conditions such as electronic monitoring, exclusion zones from sensitive sites, and mandatory participation in de-radicalisation programmes overseen by specialist practitioners. The MAPPA Category 3 multi-agency public protection panel must consider accommodation arrangements with restrictions on internet access, and ongoing psychological oversight. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 2 October 2025, in Court 11 at Southampton Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

DREWINGTON Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H appears before the court today for sentence on charges including one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct relates primarily to the period from March 2023 until March 2025, the latter being the date of his arrest. The proceedings have traversed a complex investigative history, featuring multiple agency cooperation and intricate evidential disclosure, details of which will be fleshed out in due course. At the outset, the court wishes to acknowledge and thank the advocates who have participated in this hearing, specifically prosecuting counsel Ms Fleur Kingsley, and defence counsel Mr Ben Thornton, who acted throughout under a Legal Aid representation order. Mr Thornton has diligently advanced the defence case throughout what must be regarded as a particularly pressured and multifaceted process. Turning first to a procedural narrative, the matter was listed before this court initially on 4 April 2025 for a plea and trial preparation hearing. At that time, the defendant entered not guilty pleas. An extended pre-trial schedule followed, necessitated in part by voluminous disclosure and expert analysis, including forensic digital reportage and psychiatric assessment. Notably, the case was adjourned on two occasions due to judicial strike action affecting the Crown Courts nationally in late spring and summer 2025, exacerbating delays for all parties involved. It is a regrettable development that public service industrial action causes disruption to the administration of justice. Nonetheless, the court notes that all reasonable efforts were made to minimise prejudice to the defendant’s case by way of timely notification and scheduling adjustments. In the midst of the case build-up, it was reported that Mr H had earlier come to the attention of Prevent authorities in the autumn of 2021 following a referral prompted by his expression of ideological sympathies in an online forum affiliated with a university student society. The referral progressed to a Channel panel but was discontinued due to insufficient evidence of active engagement or risk escalation at that stage. Such early intervention processes form an important part of the national counter-terrorism strategy, yet it must be emphasised that their absence or failure to yield sustained behavioural change does not predetermine verdict or sentence and should always be weighed cautiously in context. As the court moves towards sentencing, consideration must be given to precedents in the burgeoning jurisprudence on terrorism offences, particularly regarding the principles of culpability and proportionality, and the importance placed on public protection. The case law continues to develop; however, certain key authorities remain salutary guides. Among these, R v. Saeed [2018] EWCA Crim 1254 confirmed that the scale and sophistication of preparatory conduct remain central in calibrating sentence severity, distinguishing between aspirant plotters arrested before any substantive materialisation and those whose acts manifest a greater immediacy of risk. Another instructive decision is R v. Naim [2022] EWCA Crim 699, which reaffirmed that planned violence intended to instil widespread fear or to manipulate public or governmental activity attracts sentences of considerable length, notwithstanding the absence of actual detonation or casualties. The courts frequently uphold the principle that deterrence and denunciation must weigh heavily alongside rehabilitation in sentencing terrorism offences. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The foregoing facts, as demonstrated by unchallenged forensic and electronic evidence, illustrate a clear pattern of premeditated preparation distinct in nature and scope. It is important, however, that the court contextualises these findings within the wider operational pressures that counter-terrorism policing faces today. For instance, the under-resourcing of digital forensic units continues to complicate timely evidence acquisition, a reality often overlooked in public discourse. Analysts at the National Cyber Crime Unit, who rendered expert assistance in this investigation, have reported caseloads three times the recommended threshold per officer and average delays exceeding six months for high-priority device extraction. Such delays have tangible effects, impacting both prosecutorial timetabling and defendant rights under the principle of timely justice. The interaction of these systemic factors often prompts engagement from policy commentators. For example, an influential 2024 report by the Justice Policy Institute lamented the “steady erosion of prosecutorial capacity in complex technological crime cases,” underscoring the resultant slowdown in case progression and the attendant risks of prolonged remand or uncertain defence preparation. This is not intended as mitigation but rather to illuminate the realities within which the present case has unfolded. It is pertinent to mention at this juncture that the court received written communications from local voluntary organisations, including the East Bristol Resilience Network and the Greenfield Youth Mentorship Scheme. These groups detailed their engagement with the defendant prior to his arrest, noting sporadic attendance and limited receptiveness to structured interventions such as cognitive bias workshops or vocational training sessions focused on engineering skills. The reports conveyed a cautious optimism tempered by awareness of Mr H’s occasional withdrawal and disengagement. While such input from civil society contributes a valuable dimension to the overall picture, the court remains mindful of their limitations and of the paramount importance of risk management. Historically, the Crown Courts have witnessed a variety of terrorism-related cases bearing upon similar factual archetypes, though each must be treated on its own merits. R v. McDowell [2014] EWCA Crim 707, involved the manufacture of incendiary devices but was distinguished by the defendant’s early cooperation and absence of clear links to proscribed organisations. In contrast, the present case reveals more calculated and extensive preparatory steps. The court also has regard to the statutory framework provided by the Terrorism Act 2006 and its subsequent amendments, which codify offences relating to preparation and possession, as well as sentencing guidance promulgated by the Sentencing Council in its 2024 edition addressing terrorism and extremist conduct. The Guidelines set out a hierarchy of factors informing culpability assessment, ranging from the defendant’s ideological motivation, technical knowledge, volume and quality of material acquired, through to the presence of mitigatory circumstances such as remorse or cooperation. The court applies these standards rigorously in seeking a just and proportionate outcome. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Mr H’s engagement with digital platforms and encrypted communication channels occupies a central place in the evidence before the court. Expert testimony from the National Technical Assistance Centre detailed the recovery of numerous encrypted message threads and files, including code scripts and manuals relating to improvised explosive devices. Defence submissions suggested that some of these documents were accessed unintentionally or as part of broader research interests. However, the court finds such explanations implausible given the surrounding context and the specific nature of the content. A recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Analysis further revealed that the defendant subscribed to a series of online forums promoting violent jihadist ideology, sharing propaganda and tactical advice. Recorded digital footprints evidenced attempts to obfuscate his identity via virtual private networks and anonymising software, techniques consistent with deliberate evasion of law enforcement detection. Defence counsel contended that such use of technology stemmed from privacy concerns unrelated to criminal intent, a contention compelling only in the most abstract sense and not supported by the evidence overall. The present case inevitably invites reflection upon the challenges posed by the dynamic between privacy rights and national security imperatives. The European Court of Human Rights has grappled with such tensions in cases like Big Brother Watch v. UK [2021] ECHR 1423, where mass surveillance was held lawful within strict parameters. Similarly, the domestic court system must balance transparency with protective order, especially where disclosure might risk ongoing investigations or jeopardise witness safety. The volume and variety of material in this case invited particular care in handling, necessitating a bespoke approach to redaction and public access. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The defendant’s possession of components capable of use in explosive devices, including materials and technical manuals, substantiates the charge under section 57. The purpose contended is consistent with the preparatory offences charged and subsequent proof at trial. Defence arguments during evidential challenges included the assertion that some items had innocent hobbies or professional engineering relevance. This court, while acknowledging such arguments, ultimately prefers the Crown’s submissions on motive and intent on the balance of probabilities. In passing, it is noted that the defendant’s prior activity includes no recorded criminal convictions for non-terrorism offences. This fact, though ordinarily bearing on sentencing mitigation, must be weighed against the gravity of the present offending. The absence of previous convictions in no way diminishes the seriousness of conduct proving ideological commitment to acts of terrorism, nor does it invite complacency on the part of judicial authorities concerning future risk. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. Travel records indicate Mr H undertook multiple trips within Europe in 2023 and 2024, officially declared as tourism or academic visits. Intercepts and surveillance evidence, however, link these journeys to meetings with individuals under investigation in other jurisdictions for extremist activities. The Defence lodged submissions seeking to distinguish the defendant’s presence at these locations arguing lack of direct evidence of involvement. The court is conscious of the principle that association alone does not prove guilt but also notes that the totality of the evidence gives a picture of concerted action consistent with the charges. The court has also considered voluminous ancillary material disclosed during trial preparation. This includes evidence relating to co-defendants in a related indictment, whose charges extend to offences such as arson of commercial premises and use of false documents. Such material, whilst linked by association and investigative grouping, does not pertain directly to Mr H and therefore will not feature in sentencing considerations for him beyond evidential context. The existence of co-defendants who remain at large, or who have been charged with unrelated offences—including violent assault on police officers, or possession of indecent images—is a regrettable reminder of the wider networks involved in extremist activity. However, this court is clear that each individual defendant must be assessed and sentenced for their personal conduct and culpability, not for the acts or histories of others. Limitations in the provision of mental health services continue to impact the criminal justice system’s capacity to address the needs of defendants exhibiting signs of distress or ideological fixation. The NHS England report of July 2025 noted a 23% increase in referrals for specialist forensic psychiatric evaluations since 2020, outpacing the supply of qualified professionals. This case benefitted from a timely assessment by Dr Elena Marquez, whose meticulous report is pivotal in informing the sentencing outcome. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation disclosed cryptocurrency transactions amounting to the equivalent of £3,500 disseminated through multiple mixing services or tumblers designed to obscure origins. Such activity aligns with patterns identified in recent Home Office intelligence briefs as typical of funding streams for procurement of dual-use goods. The court registers these findings with concern, given the relative novelties and challenges of investigating dark-web and crypto-enabled criminal finance. It is noted, with some regret, that the Legal Aid Agency’s procedural handling of defence funding requests in this case reflected ongoing systemic constraints. Authorisation for an independent forensic accountant was delayed by over four weeks, hampering early but crucial stages of inquiry. Such administrative hurdles, while beyond the court’s power to resolve, adversely affect the proper resolution of complex cases and underscore the importance of adequately resourcing agents of justice. The National Probation Service similarly faces challenges in managing caseloads and ensuring continuity for offenders sentenced within terrorism statutes. Reports continue to highlight attrition within specialist teams, with vacancies often filled by less-experienced officers by necessity. While the probation report for Mr H demonstrates a conscientious effort to outline intervention options, it also reflects these resource pressures. The integration of multi-agency safeguarding arrangements, including MAPPA Category 3 oversight, remains indispensable but resource-intensive. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H is 30 years of age. He possesses a master’s degree in electrical engineering, with a particular focus on telecommunications. Prior to his arrest, he had been employed as a junior systems engineer at a mid-sized firm specializing in automation solutions. He resigned under disputed circumstances, reportedly linked to refusal to undergo a security clearance procedure related to compliance with export controls on sensitive software. This disengagement from formal employment coincided temporally with an observable intensification in his online propaganda dissemination. Character references submitted on behalf of the defendant include letters from a local chess club, where Mr H volunteered as an occasional coach for young members. The correspondence speaks to his “calm demeanour” and “patient teaching style.” While such civic contributions are laudable, it must be emphasised, as in similar cases, that these positive factors do not negate culpability for deliberate actions endangering public safety. Indeed, the court treats evidence of community involvement not simply as mitigation but as raising expectations of responsible conduct. The court is bound also to reflect on a series of letters from family members, including his sister and mother, which describe a gradual withdrawal and apparent ideological radicalisation manifested over several years. These personal perspectives, though poignant, were neither read in open court nor tendered as exculpatory; rather, they assist in establishing a fuller understanding of the defendant’s background and mental framework. The forensic psychologist, Mr Graham Evers, reports no diagnosable psychosis or personality disorder. Instead, he notes Mr H exhibits a “marked fixed belief system with high cognitive rigidity,” suggesting difficulty with alternative viewpoints and a tendency towards black-and-white thinking. The report cautions that while he does not currently meet criteria for severe mental illness, his ideological convictions present a sustained public protection risk without intensive intervention. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. The prosecutorial case and expert reports collectively portray the offence as a carefully orchestrated, multi-faceted undertaking, exhibiting a level of sophistication and ideological commitment warranting substantial custodial terms. The aggravating features include the defendant’s deliberate use of encryption, his international contacts, and the covert nature of the preparatory activities. Mitigation largely rests on his lack of prior convictions, educational attainment, and a degree of belated cooperation, manifest in the eventual guilty pleas entered shortly before trial. The court applies a modest reduction for these pleas, consistent with binding authorities cautioning against generous credit for late admissions, particularly when they follow considerable investigative and trial preparation expenditure. Before concluding these remarks, the court records thanks to the staff of Bristol Crown Court for their assistance in ensuring the smooth conduct of these hearings, despite ongoing refurbishment works that have intermittently displaced several courtrooms. Their flexibility and patience have been commendable. Likewise, the court recognises the efforts of Counter Terrorism Policing South West, whose diligent and multifarious casework has been exemplary in the face of persistent staffing shortages. The court also extends appreciation to the multi-agency support teams, including Probation Service officers, NHS forensic clinicians, and Local Authority safeguarding representatives, whose collaborative work has significantly advanced risk assessment and management processes in this matter. Finally, the court must again express concern about the increasing complexity and volume of terrorism-related digital evidence, stressing the necessity for ongoing investment in technical capabilities and personnel training to maintain effective investigatory standards. Without such, public safety and the proper administration of justice will remain at risk. I reserve sentence today pending receipt of an updated pre-sentence report which the National Probation Service has been instructed to prepare with particular focus on risk management, rehabilitation potential, and the feasibility of Community Order elements complemented by supervision. Attention should also be given to the possibility of enhanced licence conditions should a custodial sentence be imposed, including electronic monitoring and structured deradicalisation programmes. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal conviction and/or sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968 respectively.

Mr H Case No. B2025/27461 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. MONTGOMERY Filed: 4 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following convictions on multiple counts under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period of offending is established as spanning from September 2023 through to the defendant’s arrest in January 2025. The defendant was apprehended following the culmination of a comprehensive and sustained investigation conducted by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), jointly coordinated with the Security Service and the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU). The arrest was executed in the early hours of 15 January 2025 at his residence located in the Selly Oak district of Birmingham, pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the 2000 Act. It is necessary at the outset to acknowledge the complexity inherent in terrorism-related prosecutions in this jurisdiction: in recent years these cases have imposed extraordinary pressures on judicial resources, and have demanded painstaking efforts from investigative agencies who must balance investigatory zeal with due process and stringent evidentiary obligations. The case before the court typifies such challenges, with voluminous digital evidence, complex forensic examinations, and engagement with multiple expert domains spanning technology, psychology, and ideological analysis. Historical context informs that the statutory regime for terrorism offences under the Terrorism Act 2006 was introduced as part of the Government's legislative response to evolving threats in the early 21st century. With amendments and refinements over time, these provisions continue to underpin legal responses to preparatory conduct which, while not culminating in an actual completed attack, represent a potential to cause significant harm and disruption. The court is reminded of the principles set forth in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, where the Supreme Court emphasised the contours of “terrorist purpose” encompass acts intended to influence governmental or international bodies by intimidation or coercion, whether or not the specific acts were ultimately carried out or successful. The defendant's case followed a customary but protracted pre-trial course. On 21 February 2025, a plea and trial preparation hearing was convened. Initial pleas of not guilty were entered. The trial listings encountered some rescheduling due to industrial action within the court registry involving the administrative staff federation, resulting in a minor delay of three weeks in securing a trial date. Nevertheless, the overall timetable complied substantially with the Better Case Management (BCM) principles enshrined in the Criminal Procedure Rules, an evolution aimed at streamlining case progression and reducing undue delays. Representatives for the Crown in this matter have been led by Ms Anne Forsyth, standing counsel within the CPS Counter Terrorism Division. Ms Forsyth’s submissions were assiduously prepared, detailing the evidential matrix and grounding prosecution case within the ambit of the relevant statutory thresholds. On behalf of the defendant, counsel Mr Steven Mallory, instructed under a Legal Aid Order, has provided a vigorous defence. The court commends both counsel for the professional and courteous manner in which the proceedings have been conducted, despite inevitable challenges occasioned by the volume and sensitivity of material. While acknowledging the allocation of resources and administrative processes at work, it is necessary to record the court’s continued frustration with systemic delays engendered by Legal Aid procedures pertinent to defence expert evidence. Requests for funding to retain an independent forensic psychologist were met with prolonged bureaucratic sequencing, leading to adjournments which, though conscientiously managed by all parties, inevitably taxed court scheduling and prolonged the defendant’s detention in custody. Such obstacles are regrettable and underscore a pressing need for reform in this area. A further procedural note: at the outset of proceedings, it was noted that a co-defendant had been separately charged in connection with a wide-reaching network engaged in the importation of illicit substances. This co-defendant’s charges encompass possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and associated firearms offences. These unrelated matters were kept strictly segregated from Mr H’s case by the presiding judge, mindful of the differing factual and legal frameworks applicable. Mr H’s antecedents have been subjected to mandatory disclosure, ongoing police checks, and the preparation of a pre-sentence report. He is 31 years of age and holds a degree in electrical engineering. There is no prior conviction recorded against him, a fact to be noted with care. Correspondence from local community groups has been submitted on his behalf, describing his volunteer involvement in a neighbourhood literacy programme. While these community ties suggest a measure of social integration, the court is cognisant that such factors do not mitigate criminal responsibility where deliberate and sustained terrorist preparation is established. The court had the benefit of expert psychological assessment provided by Dr Fiona Clarke, a consultant forensic psychiatrist specialising in ideological extremism. Her report, prepared after a series of interviews and collateral consultation, describes Mr H as exhibiting a rigid cognitive framework combined with an intense adoption of grievance narratives consistent with radicalisation models documented in contemporary literature. No diagnosable mental illness was identified, but high risk of serious harm is noted due to ideological conviction and technical knowledge. The defence challenges the extent of this risk, positing that a structured disengagement programme could substantially reduce it. The court notes the evidence on success rates of such interventions remains equivocal, but accepts the principle that rehabilitation efforts must be afforded consideration alongside the imperatives of public protection. The facts of the case are as follows: Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This case arose from Operation KEEPERN, a multi-agency investigation stretching over 16 months. The defendant fell under surveillance following patterns of encrypted communications intercepted by the National Technical Assistance Centre, revealing access to networks known to supply manuals for improvised explosive device construction. These materials were recovered during a controlled search of the defendant’s residence. The forensic examination, led by the West Midlands Digital Crime Unit, encountered difficulties owing to sophisticated encryption and deletion protocols. The analysis was further delayed by competing demands on scarce cybersecurity resources nationwide. Preceding the arrest, the defendant's online activity included subscription to forums advocating the use of pressure-cooker bombs, as well as dissemination of propaganda glorifying acts of violence abroad. Such behaviour has formed the backbone of the Crown’s circumstantial case that Mr H was both ideologically committed and pragmatically engaged in preparatory acts to facilitate terrorism. In R v. O’Donnell [2021] EWCA Crim 1104, the Court of Appeal reinforced that possession of instruction manuals, when combined with overt acts towards procurement, satisfies the threshold for preparatory conduct. The applicability of such precedent is clear here, particularly as Mr H’s possession extended beyond passive download to include attempts at practical testing. Notably, forensic evidence revealed the existence of a document named “Blueprint v4,” containing detailed schematics for a timer assembly adapted from consumer electronics. While the presence of such documents alone may be equivocal, their context here aligns with an overall pattern of purposeful preparation. Defence submissions contest the genuine intent at play, citing potential legitimate hobbyist experimentation. This argument finds limited acceptance given the totality of the evidence. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. The investigation also uncovered a budget spreadsheet linking the defendant to multiple transactions via cryptocurrency transfers. Specialist financial examination traced payments made through mixers obfuscating origin, suggesting attempts to conceal monetary flows consistent with procurement of dual-use items for bomb-making. The digital trail further indicated that Mr H communicated with a foreign national under investigation for arms trafficking in mainland Europe. Recorded encrypted calls between the two parties demonstrated technical discussions devoid of innocuous commentary, indicating operational planning. These communications were intercepted lawfully following a warrant granted on the basis of significant intelligence thresholds. Although Mr H maintains that these communications related to research for academic purposes, the observed modus operandi and the sequence of activities provide a compelling narrative of criminal intent. The court references the decision in R v. Ali [2022] EWCA Crim 98, where repeated contact with proscribed entities, combined with demonstrable access to materials, justified extended custodial sentences due to elevated risk. Such reasoning is demonstrably pertinent here. Mr H’s interaction with the local Prevent team spanned over eighteen months prior to arrest. The Caldicott Prevent Consortium notes in its correspondence that there were efforts to engage the defendant in counter-radicalisation workshops and mentoring. Participation was intermittent, and occasionally disruptive. The consortium’s reports describe a pattern of withdrawal contextualised by expressed grievance about government policies, but stop short of concluding any tangible deradicalisation had occurred. The challenges faced by Prevent teams are well documented and enduring. The court notes with regret the continued under-resourcing of such schemes despite persistent indications of rising ideological extremism across segments of the population. Local health services, already stretched thin by mental health demand spikes post-pandemic, have reported lengthy waiting lists for counselling services relevant to this cohort. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. At the time of his arrest, a quantity of materials obtained to replicate the circuit board design was found disassembled in Mr H’s workshop. This included components sourced via specialist suppliers in the UK and abroad. Notwithstanding defence contentions of lawful procurement for academic projects, the court finds the pattern and scale of acquisition inconsistent with legitimate hobbyist use. “Burn patterns” tests were observed in backyard trials documented in recovered videos. These experiments, while rudimentary, indicate a degree of applied knowledge and reflect a clear intent to understand the functional efficacy of explosive constructs. Such activities transcend passive interest and illustrate active preparation. This evidence was corroborated by witness testimony of a former flatmate, who described the defendant’s guarded behaviours and expressed concerns about strange visitors arriving at unsocial hours. The flatmate’s statements cannot be accepted uncritically, given disputes between the parties, but nonetheless contribute to corroboration when taken with other items. Interestingly, the court notes the defendant’s involvement in an unrelated case heard recently in the same circuit. The co-defendant in that trial was convicted for fly-tipping waste on protected green belt land leading to environmental damage. Mr H was not connected to that offending, though his former roommate was charged with possession of cannabis following a search unrelated to this case. The prevailing social context cannot be ignored. The erosions in neighbourhood cohesion, the deleterious effects of social media echo chambers, and the increasing normalisation of fringe ideologies all provide a backdrop against which radicalised individuals operate. Nevertheless, these are matters for societal response outside the penal framework. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Complicating the assessment is the presence of a gaming console seized during search, containing multiple encrypted chat logs. These communications reveal efforts to recruit others into ideological cells and to disseminate subversive content. While some exchanges appear perfunctory or jocular, others display ideological intensity and encourage operational secrecy. The court is aware of emerging case law, including R v. Khan [2023] EWCA Crim 334, in which the use of digital platforms to radicalise or recruit was held to aggravate culpability under the Terrorism Guidelines. The ubiquity of online platforms introduces new dimensions for threat and prevention. Mr H’s counsel argued that evidence of casual online interactions fails to satisfy the threshold for intent to cause harm, relying on the principles enunciated in R v. Bascombe [2020] EWCA Crim 765, where a differentiation was drawn between mere expression and preparatory conduct. The court finds that while expression alone may be protected, the combined acts here go beyond such protection. The court pauses to note that, during the course of investigation, forensic examination uncovered an unrelated fixed penalty notice issued to Mr H in 2019 for fare evasion on the Birmingham Metro system. Though inconsequential to the charge, it demonstrates the spectrum of minor infractions that defendants may accumulate. Similarly, a letter from the Housing Association landlord referenced noise complaints unrelated to any antisocial behaviour attributable to Mr H. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. The defendant travelled to Berlin in November 2024 on what he claimed was a photographic holiday. Travel records accessed by the National Border Security Agency indicate a brief transit via the city’s outskirts in an area known for underground extremist music scenes and clandestine meetings. Closed-circuit footage analyzed from transport hubs show Mr H engaged in communication with persons later discovered to possess extremist proclivities. Such travel patterns, while not inherently suspicious, were combined with digital behaviour that heightened investigative concern. The prosecution argues that this journey was an exploratory mission to meet contacts and acquire materials, a contention the defence contests on the grounds of legitimate tourism. The court is reminded of the principles in R v. Steiner [2021] EWCA Crim 887, where international travel with ostensible benign purpose was held to require scrutiny in light of other evidence of preparatory acts. Reasonable inference, not mere hypothesis, guides such determinations. Significant disclosure issues arose in this case given the volume of encrypted material. Over 1,200 exhibits required careful vetting, some containing material classified as sensitive in nature. The court expresses understanding for the staff of both prosecuting and defence teams who laboured to manage this substantial evidence bundle under considerable time pressure. A side note of interest concerns the attendant difficulties faced by the City Digital Forensics Unit, which recently underwent a significant organisational restructure designed to improve performance following criticisms of delays affecting high-profile cases. The resultant teething problems led to temporary reduction in investigative throughput, a factor acknowledged in the case management hearings. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations revealed complex cryptocurrency transfers amounting to £4,150, routed through multiple addresses and mixers. While unregulated cryptocurrencies facilitate privacy-backed transfers, their use raises acute concerns where linked to terrorism financing. The court notes that Mr H’s transactions corresponded temporally with attempts to purchase specialized chemicals and electronic components. Notwithstanding technological debates about the merits of decentralised finance, criminal exploitation of opaque payment systems is well documented. As such, the court views these monetary flows as an aggravating factor indicating operational seriousness rather than casual dabbling. The court also notes the presence of unrelated digital forensic material regarding a separate investigation into a distant relative of Mr H, currently subject to benefits fraud proceedings. This association does not impinge upon the defendant’s moral culpability but highlights the complex nature of law enforcement in interconnected social environments. The rise in cybercrime more broadly has imposed rising workloads upon police units tasked with digital intelligence gathering. Forensic analysts have reported average workloads above capacity, resulting in a backlog of unprocessed devices and software incompatibility challenges. Such systemic difficulties do not excuse delay but contextualise the operational environment. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal mitigation, Mr H is described in letters from family members as “intelligent and quietly committed” but also “reserved.” There is no suggestion of previous violent or extremist behaviour. His employment history reflects a period of work with a local IT consultancy prior to resignation amidst disputes over workplace policies concerning remote access protocols. These disputes contributed to his apparent social isolation. The court acknowledges the support letters received from a local charity engaged in mentoring young men in digital skills. Yet it is manifest that prior good character cannot juxtapose against deliberate criminal conduct of the nature proven here. The ethical dilemma posed by the coexistence of positive community involvement and concurrent illicit activity is recognised but does not mitigate the gravity of offences. The forensic psychiatric report by Dr Clarke highlights that Mr H exhibits “elevated cognitive rigidity” and a propensity for “binary moral judgments” consistent with contemplative radicalisation patterns. Treatment recommendations include enrolment on the recently established Deradicalisation and Disengagement Programme (DDP), which, while hopeful, is acknowledged by all stakeholders as possessing an uneven track record in terms of long-term disengagement. The court notes with interest that the local Mental Health Trust continues to experience staff deficits, with a 40% vacancy rate in psychological therapy provision. Concurrently, waiting times for community mental health assessments have reached 18 weeks, exacerbating challenges for timely intervention. These systemic strains impinge upon the capacity for preventative strategies and increase reliance on custodial measures. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. In conclusion, this case depicts a sustained pattern of preparation for acts of terrorism underpinned by technical proficiency and motivated by extremist ideology. Aggravating features include the level of sophistication in acquisition and experimentation, encrypted and clandestine communications, and the potential scale of harm envisaged. Mitigating features are limited, comprising the defendant’s absence of prior convictions, educational qualifications, and late pleas entered prior to the trial's commencement. The court directs the preparation of an exhaustive pre-sentence report, to be compiled by the National Probation Service. The report should consider the feasibility of imposing an Extended Determinate Sentence with appropriate licence conditions to manage ongoing risk. It should further assess prospects for engagement with the DDP or comparable intervention schemes, availability of approved premises accommodation, and suitability for electronic monitoring and polygraph supervision in the event of custodial release. Recommendations on mental health support and post-release community supervision should be included. The court reaffirms that public protection remains paramount. While rehabilitation is a cherished principle, it cannot and must not supersede the need to contain serious risk. The sentence ultimately imposed must send a clear message of deterrence, denounce criminal ideology with unimpeachable authority, and safeguard the wider society from harm.

Mr H Case No. B2025/24900 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. A. TREVELYAN Filed: 10 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court today for sentence on charges under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and also under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The period of offending alleged spans from early 2023 to his arrest in late January 2025. This case has been subject to multiple case management hearings, including some delays attributable both to the extensive nature of the digital disclosure and to difficulties securing a psychiatric expert in a timely fashion. The court wishes to place on record its appreciation of the efforts by the parties to progress the case despite recurrent logistical pressures. It is well known that the Justice system in this jurisdiction remains under significant strain; embedded within the broader context are resource shortages within the Legal Aid Agency and stretched counter-terrorism policing units. These systemic difficulties are not of the defendant’s making but nonetheless form the environment in which such proceedings unfold. Against this backdrop, the court has been diligent in safeguarding the rights of the defendant while also giving proper weight to the imperative of public safety. The prosecution have called upon forensic digital analysts, Counter Terrorism Command officers, and psychologists, while the defence has sought to challenge the extent of the evidence and raise mitigating factors drawn from personal circumstance and mental health considerations. On the procedural front, this court acknowledges Counsel for the Defence, Mr Nathaniel Cairns, who has acted with professionalism in the face of constrained funding and compressed preparation timeframes. The case file ran to over a thousand disclosure items, including extensive encrypted messaging traffic, intercepted electronic evidence, and material recovered from a range of electronic storage devices. Following the arrest of Mr H at his residence on 28 January 2025, Counter Terrorism Policing South West and the National Digital Investigation Unit undertook a coordinated search and seizure operation pursuant to warrant powers afforded under the Terrorism Act 2000. The subsequent forensic examination of seized devices has been central to both the Crown’s case and the basis upon which, ultimately, Mr H entered guilty pleas at a late stage in proceedings. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The Crown commenced proceedings by charging Mr H on 12 February 2025. Early court listings appeared optimistic but were subsequently delayed due to the need to clarify a number of procedural matters, including disclosure of sensitive material protected by Public Interest Immunity certificates and the consideration of a contested application by the defence to instruct an independent forensic psychiatrist. The court notes with some concern the delays occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency’s initial refusal to authorise such instruction without protracted correspondence, a matter regrettably becoming all too frequent and damaging in terrorism casework. In reviewing the chronology of court hearings, it is salient that at the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 15 July 2025, Mr H maintained a plea of not guilty at that stage, only altering his plea to guilty on the date set for trial, 1 September 2025. This eleventh-hour plea change inevitably limits the extent of the credit that can properly be afforded for plea. The court reiterates the principles set out in R v. Collingridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1873 that credit for a guilty plea is discretionary and must reflect timing, candidness, and the benefits to justice, including the sparing of victims from the ordeal of contested trials. The legal framework under which this court exercises jurisdiction includes, but is not limited to, the Terrorism Act 2006 and the 2000 Act. The court recalls the guiding principles articulated in R v Gul [2013] UKSC 64 wherein the Supreme Court outlined the scope and definition of “terrorist purpose,” emphasising the preventative aims of such legislation against conduct that facilitates acts of mass harm. Further, reference is made to R v Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 where the appellate authority upheld extended sentences appropriate to the gravity of preparatory conduct even when attack plans were interdicted at an early stage. It is instructive to revisit briefly the provisions of the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline, updated in 2023, which the court is required to apply. The guidelines provide a structured approach by way of assessing culpability categories, which incorporate factors such as the complexity of the preparatory acts, degree of sophistication, intent to cause indiscriminate harm, and proximity to execution of an attack. The court is mindful that deterrence and public protection are paramount sentencing objectives in such cases. Concurrently, the court must consider any personal mitigation and factor in, where appropriate, the realistic prospects for rehabilitation. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. The defendant’s digital footprint reflects an escalation from fringe political discourse towards explicit engagement with extremist narratives. It is a feature of contemporary terrorism offending that the line between radical political expression and preparatory illicit conduct can be difficult to draw, but the evidence before this court demonstrates that Mr H moved markedly beyond passive consumption of such material. The expert linguistic analysis tendered on behalf of the Crown has identified multiple encrypted communications containing technical instructions consistent with proscribed terrorist manuals under the Terrorism Act 2006. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Of significance, digital forensics revealed the presence of numerous encrypted archives and nested containers employing advanced cryptographic techniques, including the use of VeraCrypt with multiple keyfiles. Technical expert witnesses gave evidence as to the sophistication with which Mr H sought to conceal his activities, reinforcing the court’s view of a deliberate and methodical commitment. In passing, it is worth noting that the presence of a small-scale brewery kit and unopened tickets for a forthcoming folk music festival were also found within the defendant’s property. These items, while noted in preparation of the present report, are unconnected to the offending conduct and appear to represent unrelated personal interests. The defence has highlighted these elements in an attempt to humanise the defendant’s profile, a strategy understandable though not determinative within the sentencing exercise. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. This court pauses to acknowledge the multiplicity of agencies engaged in this matter. Counter Terrorism Policing South West’s CT Surge Team, the National Crime Agency’s Digital Forensics Unit, and the forensic psychology services have contributed to a sustained and complex investigative process. That such collaboration has been required points to the ever-increasing challenge that technologically enabled terrorism poses. It must be stated, again, that the meticulous assembly of digital evidence involves resource-intensive activities which, while laudably carried out by competent professional personnel, absorb considerable portions of the already stretched criminal justice system budget. In the absence of prosecutorial restraint and careful proportionality, courts risk becoming conduits for extensive unattended digital mining. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Further, the defendant’s travel history was scrutinised in detail. Prior to his arrest, Mr H undertook a brief trip to Rotterdam, officially described as \"a cultural exchange visit\" in defence submissions. However, surveillance and intercepted communications from the period indicate contact with an individual under investigation in connection with explosives procurement. The defence’s submission that this contact was coincidental was not accepted by the jury. During the course of the investigation, reference was also made to an unrelated ongoing prosecution involving the defendant’s former flatmate charged with possession of indecent images. Although that matter is legally and factually discrete, the court acknowledges the unfortunate repercussions such associations may have on an individual’s public and social support system. It is worth reiterating that the defendant’s own mother has submitted a letter to the court, describing Mr H as a devoted son who suffered emotional hardship following the death of his father in 2019. The letter attributes his subsequent withdrawal from social connections to grief and isolation, a narrative that, while sympathised with, cannot mitigate the gravity of the offence. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Cryptocurrency transactions, as noted in the digital forensic audit, form part of the prosecution’s case. A significant transfer was tracked from an account linked to Mr H to an international marketplace offering dual-use chemical precursors. This transaction highlights the dark intersection of emerging financial technology with illicit material procurement. The court is mindful of the broader implications of blockchain-based anonymisation techniques, the challenges they pose for regulators, and their exploitation by criminal actors. The utilisation of such technology necessitates increasingly sophisticated analytic methods, which, while evolving, remain subject to inherent limitations. Thus, the reliance on circumstantial linkage and the totality of other evidence remains crucial to establishing culpability to the requisite criminal standard. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to the defendant individually, Mr H is a 31-year-old graduate with an engineering background, having earned a Masters in Chemical Engineering from a regional university. Reports from a former employer depict him as “meticulous, reserved, but dedicated to his role in process optimisation.” However, concerns had arisen shortly before the current offences came to light, including an anomalous absence coinciding with company mental health programme attendance and withdrawal from team collaboration. The psychiatric report of Dr Serena Whitcombe, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence, provides a careful and thorough assessment. Dr Whitcombe notes no diagnosable mental illness in the clinical sense but identifies tendencies towards cognitive inflexibility and a rigid worldview. The report cautions about the ongoing risk of extremist ideological preoccupation absent therapeutic intervention and recommends the greatest possible engagement with structured intervention programmes. The court commends the forensic psychological staff for their detailed reports, which, while professional and comprehensive, are necessarily limited by the defendant’s partial engagement during assessments. Fatal to any treatment efficacy is the inconsistent participation observed during multiple appointments. Within the mitigation, Mr H’s defence counsel has presented letters from local community groups — including a literary collective and a neighborhood sports association — highlighting his periodic involvement. The court notes such contributions but emphasises that circle-jerk commendations for minimal social engagement cannot outweigh the severity of terrorist preparatory actions. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. The overall assessment from the probation and mental health teams positions Mr H as presenting a high risk of serious harm with potential for ongoing radicalisation absent intense management. Recommendations include the suitability of custodial-supervised deradicalisation programmes, extended licence conditions, and the imposition of electronic monitoring. In accordance with sentencing principles, the level of culpability here is evaluated as high, reflecting the degree of planning, procurement, and concealment involved. The precise sentence will be determined following receipt of the pre-sentence report and considered alongside any further representations. In conclusion, the court records its enduring concern regarding the increasing complexity of terrorism offences enabled by technological innovation and internationalisation of extremist networks. While this court recognises the imperative for proportionate and principled sentencing, it must also give due weight to public protection and the deterrent effect of imposing substantial custodial sanctions where appropriate. The court instructs the Probation Service to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report, with particular attention given to risk assessment, rehabilitative potential, and tailored interventions. Consideration should also be given to placement within a facility offering accredited de-radicalisation programmes and the feasibility of ongoing post-release supervision through Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements. These remarks are formally issued on this 10th day of September 2025 in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded in compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5.

D. PRENTICE Filed: 4 September 2025 Mr H appears before this Court for sentence following his convictions on counts relating to engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles capable of being used for terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences span a period from May 2023 up to the date of his arrest in March 2025. The case proceeded to a jury trial at the start of the current term, following a hearing on 13 May 2025 during which Mr H entered pleas of not guilty. The trial itself concluded on 12 August 2025, after which the jury retired and returned unanimous verdicts of guilty on all counts. The sentencing hearing today has therefore been fixed following the conclusion of the trial and receipt of relevant reports and representations. In order to properly frame the context of this criminal proceeding, it is necessary to first recount the procedural history. The defendant’s arrest was effected on 18 March 2025 under the authority of a warrant issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following a long-running investigation codenamed Operation REDWOOD. This operation was coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands in collaboration with the National Cyber Crime Unit and the Security Service. The multifaceted investigation utilised intercepted communications, digital forensics, and open-source intelligence gathering over a sustained period. That investigative effort was notably impacted by intermittent embargoes on disclosure, reflecting the classification of certain material and the risk of compromise to ongoing operations overseas. The consequences of such restrictions inevitably delayed the defence’s access to the evidential framework, provoking earlier applications to vary bail conditions and adjourn hearings, all of which contributed to the length of the pre-trial period. Importantly, the Court has given careful consideration to defence arguments invoking prejudice due to the protracted disclosure timetable and the unavailability of certain material in usable form. These applications have been rejected, with the Court satisfied that adequate and timely disclosure was, in all the circumstances, effected. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The current matter sits within a regrettably familiar pattern in modern counter-terrorism jurisprudence. The reliance on encrypted messaging platforms, the use of cryptographic tools to evade detection, and the international dimensions of ideological radicalisation all typify the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies today. Operation REDWOOD required the deployment of specialist technological capabilities, including the use of Pegasus-style forensic tools and the co-option of telecom providers under judicial warrants to access metadata logs. The Court notes here, parenthetically, that the increasing operational demands placed on such specialist units severely restrict their capacity to address other forms of serious crime, including offenses against the person or organised drug trafficking. The diversion of resources towards counter-terrorism underscores the systemic nature of security threats and the importance of proportional response and resilience within public safety agencies. Against this backdrop, the Law Commission’s 2021 review of counter-terrorism procedures remains salient. Those reforms emphasised the necessity of balancing individual rights with the imperative of rapid and effective disruption of terrorist activity, particularly in an era characterised by digital anonymity and globalised networking. The current proceedings exemplify the tensions inherent in the application of such legislative frameworks. It is also appropriate at this juncture to record appreciation for the many professional and voluntary bodies that have engaged with the defendant prior to and since his arrest. Among these, the West Midlands Prevent Coordination Team has submitted written representations detailing their repeated efforts to engage Mr H through structured intervention programmes aimed at ideological disengagement. Their submissions outline a complex history of partial cooperation interspersed with episodes of withdrawal and resistance. The Team’s letters are measured and devoid of hyperbole, reflecting the delicate nature of their work within highly politicised and fraught community settings. Similarly, correspondence has been received from the Charitable Reconciliation Trust, a local organisation committed to supporting families and communities impacted by extremism. Their nuanced observations caution against simplistic narratives of radicalisation, noting the importance of addressing social isolation and economic marginalisation. While their contributions do not diminish the gravity of the offences for which Mr H stands convicted, they provide useful context regarding the underlying sociological factors pertinent to his case. In the course of trial preparation, the Court observed the necessity of applying the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5 guidance concerning the handling and redaction of sensitive material. A notable challenge arose with regard to certain digital exhibits containing personal data unrelated to the case, requiring careful sanitisation before their inclusion in the trial bundles. This procedural complexity is emblematic of the contemporary criminal justice environment, where technological advances bring both evidential opportunities and logistical burdens. By way of further procedural background, mention must be made of an application made on behalf of the defence on 7 July 2025 seeking leave to instruct an independent forensic psychiatric expert. This application was granted after robust submissions and delay caused by the Legal Aid Agency’s repeated requests for further information. Although the period taken to secure funding authorisation extended beyond initial expectations, the commissioned report by Dr Mary Ellis ultimately provided important insights, albeit of limited relevance to the issue of culpability. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. The Court is mindful of the gravity of the offences when interpreting the evidence adduced and the jury’s findings. Established principles governing sentencing in terrorism cases have been articulated repeatedly. Most notably, the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines of 2023 provide a framework emphasising the centrality of deterrence, public protection, and denunciation. That framework directs a categorisation of culpability relative to factors such as the sophistication of planning, the accessibility to means, and the immediacy of harm posed. Cases such as R v. Patterson [2023] EWCA Crim 909 and R v. Khalil [2022] EWCA Crim 1180 serve as reference points for the appropriate calibration of both length and nature of sentences in this domain. These authorities confirm that early disruption of seriously injurious intent does not mitigate culpability for determined preparation and source acquisition. Equally instructive, albeit of tangential factual relevance, is the decision of R v. Merton [2019] EWCA Crim 754, concerning a defendant convicted of arson of commercial premises, involving calculated ignition in sensitive urban zones. Although distinguishable in subject matter and motivation, the principles regarding sentencing uplift for intended mass harm bear on the current case. The Court accords due consideration to submissions advanced on behalf of the defendant concerning mitigation arising from his personal history. Mr H is 31 years old and has a mixed educational background. He completed secondary education with respectable GCSE grades but did not pursue higher academic qualifications. Employment following school was intermittent, with spells reported in retail and warehousing, though no stable career path was established. The probation report dated 20 August 2025 chronicles a number of factors contributing to adverse behavioural trajectories, including childhood trauma and episodes of school exclusion. The report also details engagement with local mental health services, though emphasising limited success and inconsistent attendance. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. It is important for the Court to observe that while these personal circumstances might generally be capable of mitigation, this cannot extend to erasing responsibility where conduct of significant public harm is demonstrated. Moreover, the material recovery of digital content evidencing the planning and preparation phases of the offences substantiates a sustained commitment inconsistent with transient lapses in judgement. During the investigation, a quantity of material related to digital communications was extracted, including encrypted archives stored on multiple devices. These required the engagement of cyber specialists from the Regional Cyber Crime Unit, whose reports elucidated the presence of manuals, schematics, and coded messages. In an unrelated matter, it was noted that during the investigative phase, one co-defendant, person X, was found in possession of illegal substances—namely, Class B drugs—an event which led to that individual’s bail conditions being more stringently enforced. While such a development bears no direct connection to Mr H’s conduct, the Court records it as part of the fuller evidential tapestry. Further to the above, the Court has reviewed submissions made at trial concerning the defendant’s expressed views on social media platforms prior to the offences, including commentary on political upheaval abroad. While these posts were referenced during the evidence, some related material concerned other individuals sharing the defendant’s online networks and has limited probative value regarding Mr H himself. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. In mitigation, Defence sought to introduce evidence of prior volunteer work undertaken by the defendant with the Eastbrook Food Bank and of his participation in certain community football leagues. Whilst the Court acknowledges that such activities may speak to elements of positive character, it does not consider them sufficient to counterbalance the substantial evidence of serious criminal conduct. Additionally, letters from extended family members, including a letter from the defendant’s aunt, were tendered, describing familial strain and expressing hope for rehabilitation. The Court is conscious that family support can be significant in reducing recidivism but must be balanced against the nature of the offending behaviour. An adverse factor noted in the probation report concerns the defendant’s tendency to isolate socially, a feature exacerbated by changes in accommodation during early adulthood. There is a separate, though tangentially related, matter involving a former flatmate of the defendant who was arrested in 2022 on suspicion of possession of a bladed article in a school car park. This fact is in no way connected to Mr H, but it has been part of the defence submissions to demonstrate the complex social environment. During the trial, a confidential witness statement referred to a purported 2021 incident of graffiti against public transport infrastructure in which the defendant denied involvement. The charge, lay outside the current case scope and was not proceeded upon. This Court is conscious of the potential for collateral misapprehension but notes that all necessary safeguards against improper inference were observed by counsel. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Notwithstanding these peripheral matters, the Court returns to the defendant’s conduct. The evidence as found by the jury includes the downloading and attempted assembly of materials sufficiently advanced to cause serious injury or disruption had they been deployed. In this context, the Court places particular significance upon encrypted communications detailing procurement of dual-use components. Such conduct reflects not only intent but also a substantive investment of time and expertise. The Court has sought to understand the defendant’s psychological profile, following the instructions to Dr Ellis. The report indicates a moderate degree of cognitive rigidity and social alienation. Whilst no formal diagnosis of a major mental illness is made, Dr Ellis expresses concern as to the propensity for recidivist extremist conduct absent targeted intervention. I must acknowledge, in passing, that the Probation Service continues to face considerable caseload pressures, particularly in the domain of overseeing individuals convicted of terrorism-related offences released on licence. Staffing shortages and resource constraints have been widely reported by Inspectorates and by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspectorate of Probation. These systemic challenges reduce the scope for personalised supervision in some cases. Nonetheless, this Court expects that proper risk management protocols will be adopted in Mr H’s case. In relation to the defendant’s history of address instability, the Housing Authority has provided material indicating that Mr H resided at no fewer than four addresses within the West Midlands area since 2020. Such transience is often associated with reduced social supports and increased vulnerability to radicalising influences. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The defendant’s digital footprint has, as already described, been subject to extensive forensic scrutiny. Forensic accountancy undertaken as part of Operation REDWOOD traced financial transactions constituting payments in anonymised cryptocurrency over months, sent to accounts believed linked to internationally proscribed networks. The Court regards such findings with utmost seriousness. An important consideration recounted in submissions concerns a Channel referral which was initially brought concerning the defendant in late 2021 following his unusual social media activity. The outcome was an early case closure, as the panel lacked sufficient evidence of risk. This illustrates the difficulties inherent in identifying and effectively engaging with individuals at the early stages of radicalisation. The Court is also cognisant of the risk that sentencing may have disparate social impacts. Representation has been made by advocacy groups warning against stigmatization of minority communities resultant from widely publicised terrorism prosecutions. While these concerns are noted, the administration of justice must remain even-handed and governed by the facts and applicable law. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The Court now turns to the principles governing credit for guilty pleas. In the present case, the defendant maintained his contest until the third day of the trial. Pleas of guilty were entered on that day to both counts. This timing is materially different from an early plea indicative of genuine remorse and acceptance of responsibility. The Court recalls the important dicta of Lord Justice Eadie in R v. Mantle [2019] EWCA Crim 458 at paragraph 13, highlighting that the court must consider not only the fact of a plea but also its timing and effect upon judicial resources and victims. Late pleas can merit considerably less credit, especially where trial preparation has been extensive. Similarly, the decision of R v. Gilroy [2023] EWCA Crim 1027 reinforces that credits are discretionary and contingent upon the contextual benefit of the plea. In this instance, the defendant’s late plea, following four days of contested evidence and the swearing of witnesses, yields a modest reduction. A further principle relevant to sentencing arises from R v. Clarke [2022] EWCA Crim 1312 wherein the necessity of addressing community protection through deterrence in terrorism cases was emphasised. The Court notes the victim impact statements collated as part of the prosecution evidence. Although no direct individual victims of physical harm have been identified in this case, the statements reflect a community deeply affected by fear and anxiety resultant from the prospect of terrorism. Such wider societal harm is an intangible but critical sentencing consideration. The Court acknowledges that two co-defendants, persons Y and Z, were present during some of the preparatory steps, although neither faces proceedings in this jurisdiction due to administrative decisions concerning transfer to other territories. Their conduct, including alleged possession of offensive weapons and assaulting arresting officers with improvised implements, is irrelevant to Mr H’s culpability and will not be further elaborated upon here. Turning back to the defendant, Mr H’s personal circumstances include a history of minor offences entirely unconnected to ideological extremism. Notably, in 2018 he received a fixed penalty notice for fare evasion on local public transport and was cautioned in 2019 for anti-social behaviour involving a dispute at a community park. These do not aggravate the current offences but form part of the fuller behavioural record. The Court has also reviewed the submissions of defence counsel, which persuasively contend that an extended determinate sentence permitting structured, multi-disciplinary supervision post-release would best serve public safety alongside opportunities for disengagement. The Court rests that proposition on the present psychiatric and social context, while reserving full judgement until the probation report is received. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. In conclusion, the Court finds that the offences committed by Mr H are at the more serious end of the culpability spectrum under the Sentencing Council’s guidelines. The sustained nature of planning, access to dual-use materials, and ideological commitment render the case serious and deserving of a substantial custodial sentence. Mitigating features are limited to the absence of previous convictions, the defendant’s educational and vocational background, and his late plea of guilty. Consideration must also be given to the potential for risk management under licence conditions and the availability of tailored disengagement programmes. The Court therefore directs the preparation of a pre-sentence report, including a full risk assessment addressing structural and psychological factors. Consideration should be given to the appropriateness of custody with licence, recommended sentence length, and relevant rehabilitative interventions. The probation service is instructed to liaise with community psychology teams and the West Midlands Prevent Coordination Team to produce an integrated management plan, referencing existing models such as the Composite Engagement Programme and the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures framework. We are living in an age where extremist ideologies find themselves increasingly dispersed through encrypted channels and social networks, complicating efforts at detection and prevention. Despite structural limitations and resource constraints, the collaborative machinery of counter-terrorism policing and multi-agency collaboration remains a vital bulwark against such threats. I must commend the prosecuting counsel, Ms Olivia Brent, and defence counsel, Mr Ryan Holloway, for their professional and courteous conduct throughout the proceedings. The court staff and ushering team are also to be thanked for their assistance, particularly given the recent refurbishment of the courtroom and the introduction of enhanced security protocols. This Court exercises the sentencing powers vested under the Terrorism Act 2006 and the Criminal Justice Act 2003, with reference to the principles of punishment, denunciation, deterrence, and rehabilitation. The defendant will be sentenced on a date to be fixed following receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations.

STANTON Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court today for sentence in relation to charges under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct alleged is dated from July 2023 until his arrest in January 2025. The procedural history in this matter is lengthy and occasioned by a number of interlocutory applications. After initial remand on 15 January 2025 following a multi-agency raid coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), the defendant has been in custody throughout. Several hearings have been convened before this court, including case management hearings on 3 March, 22 May, 12 August, and the plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 9 September 2025. It is appropriate at the outset to acknowledge the considerable demands placed upon the judicial system in terrorism cases such as these. The volume of digital evidence has presented significant disclosure challenges, with exhibits running to hundreds of gigabytes and thousands of pages of material requiring vetting under strict national security protocols. The persistence of court staff, alongside the professionalism of the Crown and defence teams, merits commendation under such difficult conditions. The defendant was arrested pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at approximately 07:45 on 14 January 2025 at 5, Hanover Mews, Clifton. The operation was the culmination of a protracted covert investigation spanning eighteen months, involving multiple partner agencies including the National Crime Agency, the Security Service, and the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit. The investigation benefitted from the timely exchange of intelligence and joint tasking that is the hallmark of contemporary counterterrorism work, a point to which I will return. Prior to his arrest, Mr H was subject to an extended series of telephonic interceptions and electronic surveillance authorised by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. Applications were carefully scrutinised by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office, attesting to the stringent safeguards in place to balance national security and individual rights. It is a matter of public record that such powers are exercised only after rigorous judicial oversight and where lesser means have been exhausted or deemed inadequate. The background of the relevant statute is worth briefly recalling. The Terrorism Act 2006 introduced specific offences aimed at behaviour preparatory to terrorist acts, enhancing the ability of law enforcement to intervene before attacks materialise. Section 5(1)(a) creates a broad offence encompassing conduct intended to enable or facilitate acts of terrorism, while section 57 of the earlier Act criminalises possession of articles with the requisite terrorist intent. Over the years, this legislation has been interpreted with due respect for the rule of law and human rights standards, including judgments such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and more recently R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678. These cases underscore that the threshold of culpability includes the offender’s state of mind and the potential for public harm, notwithstanding the absence of completed acts. The defendant’s trial was listed for 7 September but was vacated upon a last-minute application on behalf of the defence to admit a comprehensive psychiatric report provided by Dr Zahra Malik of the South West Forensic Psychiatry Unit. The report contains extensive assessment but ultimately offers no diagnosis amounting to diminished responsibility. The court has considered the report in full and will return to its conclusions later. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. In advance of trial, the Crown served detailed schedules of fact and exhibits. The volume was remarkable not just for size but for the complexity of underlying material, including multiple encrypted devices requiring the assistance of national technical specialists. The Crown’s disclosure package contained over 800 items, many redacted to protect ongoing intelligence methods and sources. Defence counsel was provided the necessary national security vetting to enable proper review, a procedural burden frequently encountered in cases of this gravity and sensitivity. During the investigative phase, the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of funding applications for expert instruction delayed proceedings by several weeks. It is a lamentable but persistent reality that resource constraints and administrative inefficiencies within the Legal Aid framework undermine timely access to justice in complex cases. Defence counsel’s diligence and professionalism in persisting under these circumstances is acknowledged. It is worth noting that a prior Channel referral was made in late 2020 by a youth worker employed at a Bristol community centre. Mr H apparently exhibited some indications of ideological shift during a workshop on civic engagement, prompting a referral to the Prevent programme. The case was closed after eight months of intervention due to limited engagement and an absence of identifiable risk behaviours. This court makes no comment on the merits of that decision, as the threshold for such early interventions is rightly conservative, balancing individual freedoms and community safety. Jurisprudential guidance on credit for guilty pleas was central in this case, especially given that Mr H entered his pleas only at the sentencing stage, following an evidence-heavy trial preparation process. As the Court of Appeal reaffirmed in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, the timing and context of such pleas are determinative in assessing the appropriate discount. The late nature of Mr H’s plea, following exhaustive preparation and significant public expense, restricts the court’s discretion in this regard. Notwithstanding the late plea, the court recognises that such pleas nonetheless reflect an acceptance of responsibility, and some degree of mitigation is therefore due, albeit limited. In the wider criminal landscape, the court notes ongoing challenges within the probation service, which continues to grapple with unprecedented caseloads and recruitment shortfalls. The cumulative impact of austerity measures over the past decade is felt acutely in resources available for risk management of ideologically motivated offenders, where specialised knowledge and multi-agency coordination are essential. The criminal justice system remains far from immune to these pressures. Likewise, NHS forensic psychiatry services face extensive waiting lists and staffing deficits, posing difficulties in the rapid provision of detailed expert assessments. It is to the credit of Dr Malik and her team that the report was ultimately delivered within a timeframe permitting its inclusion in mitigation submissions. The case further underscores the complexity of interagency collaboration in terrorism cases. The MAPPA framework, under Category 3, was activated without delay upon Mr H’s arrest, bringing together police, probation, health, and community safety partners. Records demonstrate a commendable level of cooperation, notwithstanding occasional bureaucratic obstacles. Recent reforms aimed at improving information sharing have had mixed success, a matter of ongoing concern amongst practitioners. The Crown called the evidence of Detective Inspector Laura Finch, whose evidence detailed the covert investigative techniques used to secure the case. DI Finch explained that the initial suspicion arose from intercepted communications between a user believed to be Mr H and a server known to disseminate extremist materials. The encrypted messaging platform used, while sophisticated, was compromised following the seizure of multiple devices in unrelated operations that coincided prior to Mr H’s arrest. Her testimony was impressive in its detail but, understandably, constrained by the necessity to balance operational security with evidential disclosure. The court commends the officers and specialists involved in this operation for their professionalism. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. Mr H’s online activity was multifaceted. Forensic linguists testified that the defendant maintained several accounts under various pseudonyms on forums frequented by groups proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 schedule. The content of his posts evolved from general commentary on international politics in mid-2023 to explicit calls for violent action by mid-2024. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensic evidence revealed a cache of encrypted documents stored on a removable solid-state drive. The contents included detailed instructions on the manufacture of improvised explosive devices, as well as diagrams pertaining to the tactical use of incendiary materials in enclosed spaces. Research shows that such devices, while not new, continue to represent a significant challenge for counter-terrorism and counter-IED units, given their adaptability and accessibility of precursor materials. Defence counsel sought to characterise Mr H’s interest as academic or hypothetical, but the court finds this argument unpersuasive in light of the cumulative evidence. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. A quantity of low-grade cannabis was recovered from a communal kitchen area during the search of the defendant’s property. No offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 have been pursued in respect of this find, and it is noted here solely to record the factual matrix disclosed in mitigation. In a further procedural matter, Mr H has an unresolved tenancy dispute with his landlord dating from mid-2024, involving allegations of noise nuisance and property damage. The landlord was served with a noise abatement notice in December 2024. Letters from the housing association indicate that these disputes, while unfortunate, are unrelated to the defendant’s ideological offending and have had no bearing on police investigations. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. Documentary evidence establishes that Mr H undertook a brief journey abroad in January 2024, ostensibly for holiday purposes. Flight records indicate a weekend stay in Kraków, Poland, during which CCTV footage initially obtained by overseas partners revealed Mr H meeting with an individual later known to have been arrested on suspicion of arms trafficking. Defence counsel argued that these meetings were purely coincidental and that no material connection exists between Mr H and the third party’s illicit activities. Neither prosecution nor defence can presently confirm the level of association, though ongoing international inquiries may shed further light. The case highlights the intricate webs woven by cross-border terrorist networks and the indispensable role of international cooperation in their disruption. The labour-intensive nature of the digital forensic searches undertaken in this case is worthy of comment. Officers and civilian analysts invested hundreds of hours in decryption efforts, pattern analysis and cross-referencing metadata across multiple communication platforms. This aspect of policing demands constant adaptation, training, and technological investment — matters currently the subject of parliamentary oversight and annual budgetary scrutiny. The court is aware that, for every high-profile prosecution, there are numerous preventive interventions and quietly closed investigations. This reflects a security environment that is complex, rapidly evolving, and at times opaque to those outside it. In the civil justice arena, a different set of challenges are at play. Housing courts across the country contend with surges in possession claims, often necessitated by rent arrears arising from the recent cost of living crisis. Such pressures have in some jurisdictions been linked to increased homelessness and social vulnerability, indirectly affecting community cohesion and, by extension, public safety. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations traced a series of cryptocurrency transactions involving wallets controlled by Mr H. On multiple occasions between September 2023 and November 2024, transfers totalling approximately £3,200 were made to entities connected to darknet marketplaces known to traffic in weapons-related paraphernalia. These transactions were routed through multiple mixers, including “ShadowFlow” and “PhantomChain,” complicating tracing efforts but ultimately resolved via blockchain analytic tools. The court notes the proliferation of digital assets as a resource both enabling and obscuring unlawful activity. The justice system must continue to develop cross-disciplinary expertise to contend with these new frontiers. In a separate matter, the court must register the existence of a co-defendant, Mr J, who purports to share some elements of ideological motivation but whose involvement in offences of affray and assault at a public house in Easton in late 2023 is currently subject to an ongoing trial in separate proceedings. No evidence indicates that Mr H was involved in those events. Similarly, mention is made of a third party, a former partner of Mr H, currently under investigation for harassment allegations unrelated to the present proceedings. Such matters, whilst relevant to any consideration of personal circumstances, bear no direct relevance to the assessment of risk or culpability in the offence before the court. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding the defendant’s personal history, Mr H was born 14 October 1996. He holds an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from a mid-tier UK university and completed a Master’s with distinction in cyber-physical systems. His employment history includes a stint as a junior technician at a telecommunications firm until mid-2023. His manager, in a character reference, described him as “meticulous and dependable, albeit socially reserved.” The defence has advanced letters from volunteering schemes demonstrating Mr H’s involvement in community clean-up initiatives and mentoring schemes for disadvantaged youth. Such contributions are certainly commendable in isolation. The court, however, must consider the totality of conduct. As Lord Justice Singh observed in R v. Ibrahim [2022] EWCA Crim 1504, “Good works and community ties, while positive, must not be allowed to eclipse the seriousness of ideological and violent intent.” Documents tendered relating to Mr H’s family include a statement from his sister, who expresses concern about his recent withdrawal and ideological preoccupations. The court accepts that familial relationships are a component of social context but neither necessarily mitigate nor exacerbate culpability absent clear evidential linkage. The defendant’s handwriting, submitted as part of a personal statement, was noted by probation officers as “legible and neatly presented,” a minor detail reflecting his general propensity for orderliness. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. The expert forensic psychologist, Professor Kenji Takahashi, concludes that Mr H exhibits traits consistent with elevated ideational rigidity and a propensity towards cognitive fusion with extremist belief systems. No diagnosed mental disorder is present, but the risk assessment categorises Mr H as posing a high risk of serious harm to the public if released without stringent and tailored intervention. Professor Takahashi highlights the complex challenge posed by ideological motivation in risk assessment, noting that traditional approaches to violent offending do not easily map onto such cases. The court recognises these observations and will direct appropriate input for probation and mental health services in the forthcoming pre-sentence report. The court also wishes to acknowledge the contributions of local voluntary sector organisations engaged with radicalisation prevention. Their written submissions underline the imperative of nuanced and sustained engagement, though they note significant funding uncertainty threatening the continuity of their programmes. In these sentencing remarks, the court must weigh strongly the paramount need for deterrence and public safety, the severity of the offending, and the available prospects for rehabilitation. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines 2023 provide a useful framework for assessing culpability and harm, emphasising careful calibration in recognising the gravity of preparatory conduct even absent a realized attack. Aggravating factors in this case encompass the sophistication of planning, the ideological extremity manifested, and the attempts to conceal and anonymise communications. Mitigating features are limited to the defendant’s lack of previous criminal convictions and his eventual guilty plea, albeit given late in the process. The court will now direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report. This report is to consider, amongst other things, the appropriateness of an Extended Determinate Sentence, the suitability of high-intensity cognitive behavioural interventions specific to ideological extremism, mechanisms for electronic monitoring and internet access restriction, and engagement with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme within the custodial setting. Referrals to approved premises with capacity for security vetting and specialist psychological support should also be assessed. The Probation Service is urged to liaise closely with health commissioners to ensure the availability of accredited forensic psychologists conversant in Structured Professional Judgment models suitable for ideological offenders. The court draws attention once more to the ongoing strain on public services, including the Probation Service, NHS forensic psychiatry, and voluntary engagement schemes. These challenges underscore the importance of coordinated resourcing and sustained political commitment. All parties are thanked for their submissions today. Miss Olivia Harper appears for the Crown and Mr David Peel represents the defendant under a Legal Aid Order. Both counsel have demonstrated commendable professionalism throughout protracted and demanding proceedings. The courtroom layout was recently refurbished, and the court appreciates the efforts of court ushers and administrative staff in maintaining order and facilitating smooth progress. The usual reporting restrictions apply under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which remain engaged in this matter.

D. LAMBERT Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges stem from events spanning the period from March 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in January 2025. The procedural history of the case is extensive, reflecting the complexity frequently encountered in counter-terrorism prosecutions. Initially remanded in custody following his arrest on 22 January 2025, Mr H subsequently applied for bail on three separate occasions. These applications were refused due to assessed risk factors and intelligence indicating ongoing radical involvement. The hearing was further delayed owing to the late arrival of defence disclosure and the necessity for supplementary police reports on intercepted communications. The efforts of court staff and liaison officers in navigating these logistical challenges are worthy of acknowledgment. The case highlights the intricate interaction between criminal litigation and the operational realities of counter-terrorism policing. The defendant’s digital footprint and travel history were subject to intense analysis by the National Counter Terrorism Digital Forensics Unit (NCTDFU), a division which routinely faces backlogs due to the sheer scale of encrypted material necessitating decryption under stringent legal protocols. These resource constraints can lead to protracted case progression—unfortunate but unavoidable, given the dual imperatives of national security and individual rights. Prior to his trial preparation hearing, the Crown provided nearly 900 items of evidence spanning intercepted communications, forensic analyses, and behavioural reports prepared by the Prevent programme and the channel interventions unit. The latter’s involvement began in mid-2022 following a referral by a university tutor who expressed concern about the defendant’s increasingly inflammatory rhetoric in coursework discussions. Unfortunately, that panel’s efforts to engage Mr H in deradicalisation processes met with limited success; his participation was intermittent and lacked meaningful commitment. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. In preparing these remarks, the court acknowledges the difficult balancing act required where evidential sufficiency must be weighed alongside the defendant's rights to a fair trial. Defence counsel have been diligent throughout, submitting a detailed mitigation bundle including personal statements and character references, as well as commissioning psychiatric assessments. The Legal Aid Agency's engagement with this case has been erratic, evidencing delays in authorisations for expert reports and intermittent correspondence lapses, reflecting wider systemic issues in the funding and administration of criminal defence services. Earlier this year, the court was presented with a forensic psychiatric report from Dr Mohammed Ansari of the Bristol Forensic Assessment Service. The report concluded that Mr H does not suffer from any major psychotic disorder but noted traits consistent with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, potentially exacerbated by social isolation and ideological fixation. Dr Ansari observed that such personality traits, while not excusing offending, do have bearing on capacity for disengagement from extremist beliefs. The report rated Mr H as posing a significant risk of serious harm to the public, principally on ideological grounds, a risk amplified by his technical capability to enact or facilitate harm. The history of the relevant legal provisions underscores the evolution of counter-terrorism legislation since the early 2000s, when parliamentary debates centred on the balance between civil liberties and national security imperatives. The Terrorism Act 2006 represented a major statutory revision following recommendations from the 2005 Review of Terrorism Legislation. Its provisions reflect lessons learned from, inter alia, R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which defined the contours of ‘terrorist purpose’ in statutory interpretation. This case falls firmly within the ambit of these principles. The investigative lead, Detective Chief Inspector Fiona Mallory, provided a detailed witness statement outlining the intelligence gathering phases. Noteworthy was the integration of open-source intelligence (OSINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT), coordinated with international law enforcement partners. Such multi-jurisdictional cooperation is a hallmark of contemporary counter-terrorism investigations but inevitably introduces layers of complexity in terms of data sharing protocols, oversight requirements, and evidentiary admissibility. The court recalls that the defendant was also under surveillance during the autumn of 2024, as recorded in submitted logs. This included monitoring at public demonstrations, where Mr H was observed distributing leaflets espousing extremist narratives unrelated to but often conflated in media discourse with broader social grievances about civil liberties and immigration. Such events, while protected as free expression in democratic societies, must be carefully assessed in the context of individual conduct and intent. Of note is the ongoing strain on public protections posed by persistent low-level offending which nevertheless commands disproportionate investigative resources. As witness evidence in R v. Tranfield [2019] EWCA Crim 460 illustrated, the diversion of specialised officers towards protracted analytic tasks can reduce capacity for conventional crime prevention. The court is compelled by these reflections to advocate for continued resource prioritisation, ensuring that both counter-terrorism and traditional policing demands remain effectively balanced. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. The Crown’s case relies heavily on the material recovered from the defendant’s residence and electronic devices, including encrypted files, manuals consistent with explosives manufacture, and communications expressing clear intent to facilitate acts causing mass harm. The timing of several of these activities suggests planning deliberately aligned with the anniversary of previously recorded extremist attacks, indicating an element of symbolic resonance designed to amplify fear and publicity. This conduct is particularly serious under the statutory framework. The defendant’s internet usage patterns were analysed by cyber forensic experts. Their report detailed Mr H’s engagement with numerous forums which, while superficially dedicated to technical hobbies, served as conduits for disseminating extremist ideologies. The digital forensic methodology involved complex artifact recovery and de-obfuscation techniques. The court is mindful that such extended investigations necessitate careful judicial oversight to protect rights under applicable data protection and human rights legislation. Mr H’s previous encounters with law enforcement include a 2017 charge for shoplifting alcohol and toiletries from a supermarket in Bath, resolved by a conditional discharge. Such early minor offending bears no direct relevance to subsequent ideological offending but was canvassed by defence counsel in mitigation. The court, however, must view the sequence of offending in the round and resist conflating unrelated matters. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The comprehensive digital archive seized comprised numerous files encrypted within a VeraCrypt container labelled “ForgeBox.” Among these were documents describing improvised incendiary devices and techniques for camouflage and evasion of detection. Defence submissions offered alternative explanations, suggesting a possible interest in pyrotechnics as a hobby. The court is unpersuaded by these contentions given the contextual nexus of other material recovered and intelligence reports indicating ongoing ideological commitment. In addition to electronic materials, physical evidence included components deemed dual-use items, such as tubing and wiring, acquired from legitimate suppliers but matched to descriptions commonly cited in manuals monitored by counter-terrorism agencies. Defence attempted to frame these acquisitions as part of lawful model-making activities. Yet expert testimony confirmed that quantities and specifications exceeded typical hobbyist requirements. The legal landscape is marked by accumulating case law setting standards for sentencing in terrorism cases. Prominent among these is R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 and the more recent R v. Newell [2023] EWCA Crim 812, the latter reinforcing the need for sentences to reflect not only culpability but also the necessity of deterrence in the digital age, where facilitation of harm may be remote yet effective. The court is apprised of such authority but is bound primarily by the specifics of this individual case. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The defendant’s travel history was a subject of focused inquiry. Official immigration records show attempts to reach conflict zones abroad under the pretext of attending “academic workshops” or “cultural exchanges,” none of which culminated in actual travel due to visa denials or cancellations. One such attempt coincided with a transnational law enforcement operation, leading to a missed connection. Defence counsel argue these attempts were innocent and aspirational, whereas the prosecution interprets them as evidence of intent to engage with proscribed groups. A letter from Bristol City Council’s Homelessness Service was submitted as mitigation. This highlighted Mr H’s precarious housing situation prior to remand, including a brief episode when he slept in a local shelter due to eviction. While such factors are tragic and compounding, defenceless cannot be excused on social hardship alone. The criminal justice system must differentiate between vulnerability and volitional risk-taking. Public mental health resources in the region have experienced significant pressure in recent years, with increasing waiting times reported for psychological assessment and community interventions. This strain underlines structural challenges faced by agencies attempting to manage individuals with complex needs and ideological extremism. The court is cognisant of this wider context though it remains charged with justice rather than service provision policy. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. The Crown introduced evidence concerning associations Mr H maintained with other individuals under investigation for offences including affray following a pub brawl in Bath’s Old Town, an incident involving pool cues. These unrelated but contemporaneous offences, committed by acquaintances with whom the defendant shared living quarters, have no direct bearing on the charges before this court. Defence counsel rightly objected to any conflation of these matters in determination of individual culpability. Letters from the parents of the complainants in those affray cases illustrate the ripple effect such disturbances have in local communities. The court has considerable sympathy with these victims but must exercise caution to avoid overshadowing the factual matrix pertinent to the defendant’s ideological culpability. The system also recalls that a co-defendant named S.M., charged with possession of indecent images unconnected to Mr H's offending, absconded during pre-trial proceedings. His absence complicated investigation sequencing, yet no direct evidence linked Mr H to these particular offences. The defendant had become obsessed with the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and been following the cleaner. One entry in Mr H’s tactical file described how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The defendant’s cryptocurrency transactions were scrutinised by financial forensic specialists. A trace of £1,450 worth of Bitcoin transferred via mixing services to vendors specializing in electronic components was uncovered. While such transactions are not intrinsically criminal, the context—coupled with the nature of goods purchased—supports the prosecution’s narrative. The court notes the growing challenge of policing decentralized financial systems and joins judiciary voices calling for legislative updates. Covert footage analyzed by counter-terrorism officers captured Mr H visiting a riverside embankment on an autumn evening to what was described in reports as “suspicious activity.” Authentication of this footage required considerable technical effort, involving synchronisation of disparate camera angles, network latency adjustments, and image enhancement algorithms. Such trials of analytical resource demonstrate the asymmetry between the speed of criminal ingenuity and the painstaking operational work required for interdiction. The defence tendered character references from the Green Valley Gardeners’ Co-operative, praising Mr H’s voluntary work in maintaining urban allotments. While commendable, such civic engagement must be balanced against the grave nature of his offending. This court notes the principle, articulated in R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928, that commendable daylight conduct offers no licence to perpetrate darkness. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H’s personal circumstances reflect a complex portrait. He is a 31-year-old graduate in mechanical engineering from Bath University with previous stable employment in design consultancy, reportedly dismissed following concerns about online activities. Letters from former employers describe him as punctual and meticulous but note his increasing social withdrawal. Defence counsel emphasise these as signs of underlying distress rather than malevolence. A forensic psychological evaluation by Professor Margot Innes emphasises Mr H’s “cognitive rigidity” and “binary moral frameworks,” but found no diagnosable mental illness. The psychologist underscored the challenges inherent in disentangling ideological belief from pathology, a tension well-recognised in contemporary forensic psychiatry. The risk of serious harm was rated as high, with particular concern about the defendant’s recidivism potential if released without intensive supervision. The court recognises letters received from the Bristol Resettlement and Reintegration Service, who have offered to engage with Mr H in custody and post-release if applicable. These voluntary sector efforts face chronic underfunding and staff shortages, realities that demand systemic attention from policymakers. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Sentencing in cases of this nature must satisfy multi-dimensional aims: punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and most importantly, the protection of the public. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, as amended, and guidance from the Sentencing Council emphasize tailored responses balancing culpability, harm potential, and personal mitigation. The court is conscious that counter-terrorism prosecutions engage broader societal imperatives and underline the duty of the judiciary to reflect public confidence in the system's ability to address threats without acceding to panic or overreach. This case serves as a sober reminder of the persistent menace posed by radicalisation in the digital era and the necessity for vigilant but proportionate responses. A pre-sentence report will be directed, seeking assessment of Mr H’s suitability for structured deradicalisation programmes supported by the National Probation Service’s (NPS) specialised terrorism offender management teams. The report should include availability of psychological therapies addressing extremist cognition, potential for engagement with approved premises, and feasibility of imposing license conditions including electronic monitoring. Formal sentencing will be deferred pending receipt of this report and any further representations from the parties. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the pertinent authorities for registration and enforcement.

ROTHWELL Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: one of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences date back to August 2023 and culminate in the defendant’s arrest on 14 March 2025. The proceedings in this case have traversed no fewer than five hearings spanning a period of sixteen months, including three case management hearings, a plea and trial preparation hearing, and the current sentencing hearing. The court records its appreciation for the professionalism displayed by all parties amidst the strains occasioned by national court strike action in June and July 2025, which caused unfortunate but unavoidable delays to the listing timetable. The defendant was initially remanded in custody following his arrest at 04:45 on Friday 14 March 2025, when the South West Counter Terrorism Unit (SWCTU) executed a warrant at his address in St. Philip's Marsh, Bristol. The warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, supported by intelligence reports from the Security Service indicating communications between the defendant and an overseas facilitator on encrypted platforms. Officers recovered multiple items including several encrypted mobile devices, USB storage mediums, and a quantity of chemical precursors. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation leading to Mr H’s arrest was the product not only of traditional detective work but also required the utilisation of specialist forensic techniques, including partial decryption of secure messaging and analysis of a complex chain of cryptocurrency transactions. The deployment of these techniques was constrained by limited national capacity, and the case was prioritised according to criteria established under the National Counter Terrorism Policing Strategy. It is worth noting the particular difficulty faced by the digital forensic teams, who are frequently required to assess terabytes of data with insufficient personnel and ageing software tools. The delays in compilation and disclosure of the electronic evidence led to the necessity of two adjournments and extensions of bail under section 47 of PACE pending the completion of specialist examination. While defence counsel raised concerns regarding prejudice, the court is satisfied that appropriate steps were taken to mitigate any unfairness, including the provision of interim schedules and access to uncategorised materials under appropriate safeguards. The defendant had previously attracted attention in safeguarding contexts; in 2020 a referral was made to the Channel programme by a college tutor following essays which referenced political violence. Panel deliberations ultimately discontinued involvement after a period of mentoring and no further incidents. This episode, while unfortunate in hindsight, did not meet the statutory threshold for ongoing intervention at the time. It must be observed that cases involving ideological extremism place an extraordinary burden on multi-agency collaboration frameworks. MAPPA Category 3 supervision of the defendant post-remand required the cooperation of SWCTU, local Probation Service, NHS forensic mental health teams, and housing authorities. Such cooperation is laudable but stretched to the limit given contemporaneous demands from overlapping case influxes, including a rise in county lines drug offences and hate crimes. The calibration and maintenance of risk registers in such a climate represent a continuous institutional challenge. The Crown Prosecution Service relies, in this case, upon a substantial volume of digital material which consumed over 3,500 hours of analyst time to process. The financial and personnel resources consumed by such investigations highlight the necessity for courts to consider the wider system impacts of terrorism offending beyond the narrow confines of the events in question. The court has carefully reviewed the exercise of discretion relating to the plea entered by Mr H. The defendant initially pleaded not guilty at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 4 June 2025 but changed his plea to guilty on both counts on the day of sentencing, 15 September 2025. Such belated admissions attract limited mitigation, a principle well established in appellate authority. In the Court of Appeal decision in R v. Whittaker [2023] EWCA Crim 875, which concerned offences under the Explosive Substances Act 1883, the Court reaffirmed that the timing of the plea is critical to the availability of a sentence reduction. Whittaker’s plea came after the Crown had served extensive witness statements, expert reports, and after the preparation of a full trial bundle. The Court reduced credit to a maximum of 10%, emphasizing that credit is reserved for timely acceptance of responsibility. The Court’s approach aligns with established precepts from R v. Calder [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, where a plea entered mere hours before trial to charges of coercive and controlling behaviour was met with minimal credit. Common to cases of this nature is the additional burden placed on victims and the court process where late pleas do not obviate or significantly shorten proceedings. In R v. Jafari [2020] EWCA Crim 405, the Court upheld lengthy sentences for offences under the Terrorism Act despite the presence of diagnosed mental health disorders, reasserting that mental disorder does not per se diminish culpability but remains a factor in sentencing discretion. That ruling has especial resonance considering the psychiatric evidence tendered in this case. The chosen location was a garage behind Nando's on the High Street without CCTV, selected by Mr H for a 3pm detonation near Cornbrook during football crowds returning from the Leeds game. The defendant operated an online alias \"SilentForge,\" through which he distributed both ideological material and practical guides. A key aspect of the prosecution’s evidence has been to establish that Mr H’s material contained coded instructions and that he deliberately chose dates correlating with the anniversaries of previous attacks registered in several extremist manifestos. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensic analysis uncovered multiple encrypted containers labelled inconsistently but linked to the defendant’s known pseudonyms, including “ProjectCerberus” and “BluePine.” Among these were experimental explosives recipes, detailed schematics for improvised devices, and evidence of attempts to procure dual-use chemicals via darknet vendors. The complexity of these materials required intensive cryptanalytic effort and cross-jurisdictional collaboration with Europol. The court notes that a quantity of home-fermented fruit wine was seized at the defendant’s residence along with vintage vinyl records focusing on progressive rock—items of no relevance to the offence but indicative of personal hobbies. Similarly, a collection of postcards from Nordic countries and a set of rare postage stamps were recovered and tendered as exhibits, highlighting the sometimes overwhelming breadth of material encountered in modern prosecutions. The administration of justice has been further complicated by the defendant’s protracted and fragmented engagement with psychiatric services, which reflects persistent national difficulties in meeting demand for forensic mental health assessments. Waiting times for initial allocations in such cases often exceed six months, a vexed issue that is subject to ongoing review by the Ministry of Justice and NHS England. The defendant’s legal representation, provided by Mr Declan Fairbrother, counsel employed on a Legal Aid basis, has consistently raised procedural concerns regarding the timeliness of expert reports, the adequacy of resources for forensic review, and the capacity of the assigned psychiatric team. The court has noted these representations with due seriousness and encourages continuing dialogue between legal practitioners and service providers to mitigate systemic shortcomings. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The theory advanced by counsel that the defendant’s photographic activity—primarily aerial drone footage of industrial estates—was an innocent pursuit of architectural interests lacks credibility in light of the wider investigatory context. A dormant Instagram account bearing the defendant’s name displayed no public posts and was not updated for more than two years prior to arrest. While the defence placement of cannabis possession and a 2018 fixed penalty notice for public transport fare evasion alongside the main charges might aim at constructing a narrative of adolescent misjudgment, the court regards such matters as peripheral and neither aggravating nor mitigating in relation to terrorism offending. It has become increasingly evident that the absence of a previous conviction, while generally considered mitigating in sentencing, assumes a more complex character in cases where the defendant’s activities have been clandestine and sustained over extended periods. The public interest demands a robust response where the preparatory conduct of serious harm is revealed by forensic evidence beyond reasonable doubt. The court has had sight also of a separate prosecution involving Mr H’s former flatmate, charged with shoplifting alcohol and toiletries from a supermarket in Bristol. That matter, although contemporaneous in time, involves no direct link to Mr H and does not form part of these proceedings. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. Travel records evidence the defendant’s journey to the Czech Republic in autumn 2024. Although counsel contends this was a cultural excursion, CCTV footage at Prague’s central bus terminal recorded a brief interaction with an individual later arrested for possession of ammonium nitrate in Germany. The court is unable to accept the improbability argument advanced by defence. Concurrently, it is necessary to observe that the management of disclosure in this trial has been painstaking. The volume of digital material—comprising 954 exhibits and over 1.2 million files—required extensive vetting by SWCTU’s Disclosure Unit operating in concert with the National Critical Systems Security Team. The manual redaction of protected personal data was bespoke and unavoidably slow. The court wishes also to acknowledge, with regret, the enduring deficiencies in Legal Aid administration, exemplified in this case by repeated delays in funding authorization for an independent psychiatric expert instructed by the defence. Such procedural lapses, while perhaps foreseeable against the backdrop of austerity measures, serve only to compound stress for defendants and their representatives alike. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A financial forensics report traced a series of cryptocurrency transactions originating from wallets controlled by Mr H to accounts associated with chemical suppliers in Eastern Europe. The use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as mixers and tumblers evidenced a deliberate intent to frustrate regulatory oversight. The court notes with concern the increasing sophistication employed by offenders in leveraging decentralised finance to facilitate illicit trade. The ever-expanding domain of cryptocurrency has undoubtedly presented law enforcement and the courts with formidable challenges. The opacity it confers can facilitate the proliferation of activities inimical to public safety, and while this court recognises the legitimate uses of such technologies, it cannot condone their abuse for terrorist purposes. Surveillance footage reviewed included a brief nocturnal visit by Mr H to an overgrown embankment adjacent to the River Avon in Bristol on 22 December 2024. The processing of this material involved multi-angle integration of infrared cameras and drone technology, with over a hundred hours of analyst work compressing seconds of relevant imagery. Such disproportionate investment of resources encapsulates the asymmetry faced by security services. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old, university-educated, holding a master’s degree in chemical engineering from a reputable institution. His employment history includes two years as a research technician at a local pharmaceutical firm, from which he resigned abruptly following an internal security clearance inquiry triggered by irregular access to restricted data files. Letters of support have been submitted from an environmental charity for which Mr H volunteered in community clean-up campaigns, and from a local arts collective acknowledging his contributions to digital design workshops. It is important for sentencing to recognise positive attributes, but these acts of civic engagement stand in stark contrast to the defendant’s subsequent conduct and do not diminish the gravity of his offences. The court notes with some irony that the defendant’s landlord was recently served with a formal noise abatement notice due to disturbances at the flat which occurred during the period leading up to the investigation. While unrelated to the offences before the court, such matters sometimes provide ancillary insight into lifestyle and domestic circumstances. Psychiatric assessment by Dr Romesh Trivedi, consultant forensic psychiatrist, notes Mr H’s intellectual capacity and absence of major mental disorder but identifies a rigid cognitive style and unwavering ideological conviction. The report cautions as to the defendant’s likely persistence in extremist thinking absent intensive intervention and marks a high risk of serious reoffending without custodial management and structured support. Defence have put forward the possibility of community-based de-radicalisation intervention under the auspices of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), but the limited success rates and high attrition within this cohort temper optimism. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. This case represents a complex and sustained operation involving preparatory acts of a serious and deliberate nature. The sentencing framework enjoins the court to weigh the considerable risks to public safety, the defendant’s level of culpability, and the limited mitigation before exercising appropriate mercy. Aggravating factors include the deliberate planning and timing to symbolic dates, sophisticated use of encrypted communication, and attempts to acquire dual-use materials for illicit manufacture. Mitigation is confined to the absence of previous convictions, educational attainment, and acceptance of responsibility manifesting only late in proceedings. The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared. The Probation Service is instructed to assess the feasibility of an extended custodial sentence with Licence supervision incorporating electronic monitoring, enforced residency restrictions, and mandatory engagement with approved mental health and de-radicalisation programmes. The report should also consider options for post-release supervision including continued psychological evaluation, exclusion zones, and polygraph monitoring. Capacity for suitable accommodation under parole conditions should be explored given known constraints within local approved premises and community settings. These sentencing remarks are delivered this 15th day of September 2025, in Court 12 of the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be communicated to the appropriate authorities to enable recording and management.

RICHARDS Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence on charges brought under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, alleging engagement in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, concerning possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism. The prosecution case identifies a time frame from approximately November 2022 through to Mr H’s arrest on 14 April 2025. The defendant was detained in the early hours of 14 April 2025 following the execution of warrants by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at a residential address in Easton, Bristol. Upon arrest, officers seized multiple electronic devices—among them a high-specification laptop and encrypted USB storage units—plus various documents and components identified during forensic analysis as capable of being developed for illicit use within terrorist schemes. The investigation that culminated in these actions was extensive and multi-faceted, involving coordination between CTPSW, the National Technical Assistance Centre, and the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The operation leading to Mr H’s arrest was supported by security service intercepts and several warrant-backed covert surveillance measures. Notably, investigators utilised pattern recognition software over open-source communications and metadata associations to ascertain the defendant’s involvement in the acquisition of materials and communication with persons of interest across several jurisdictions. The court is mindful that such investigations require delicate balancing of national security concerns with the rights of the accused, a balance painstakingly maintained throughout these proceedings. The case has traversed a procedural course illustrative of the complexities inherent in terrorism prosecutions. Initial listing for a plea and trial preparation hearing was set for 11 June 2025, subsequent to which there were adjournments occasioned by the need to accommodate Legal Aid panels’ authorisation of defensive expert appointments, notably the instructing of a forensic psychological assessment under the terms of the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 33. The resource constraints upon the Legal Aid Agency in this jurisdiction have caused frustration recognized by counsel on both sides, as recently recalled by the Court of Appeal in R v. Jeffers [2024] EWCA Crim 1125, highlighting systemic delays in securing timely legal assistance. This court also notes that the defendant, through his counsel, advanced a request during pre-trial stages for additional forensic examination focusing on the chain of possession of certain electronic artefacts seized. Such requests, while fully within rights of defence, inevitably contribute to forensic workloads and illustrate the substantial resource demands generated by complex counter-terrorism cases, which are in turn symptomatic of the heightened threat environment in which contemporary policing and prosecution operate. Precedent for the approach to sentencing in matters of this type is principally guided by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guidelines (2023 edition), further interpreted through appellate authorities including R v. Zahid [2019] EWCA Crim 1374 and R v. Attar [2017] EWCA Crim 1203. The court is governed by these instruments to ensure a sentence that is reflective not only of the gravity of offending but consistent with the principles of proportionality, public protection, and deterrence. The court is also mindful of the broader social context; the duty upon judicial authorities to impose sentences that are transparently just yet cognizant of the potentially stigmatic impact on communities from which defendants may originate. Such considerations do not soften culpability but reinforce the necessity for rigor and fairness in the application of the law. In a procedural note, it is regrettable but necessary to record that the case experienced a short delay due to strike action affecting court staff nationally in July 2025. This prolonged hearing preparations but, through the diligent work of listing officers and court administration, did not ultimately impair the timetable for trial allocation. Paralleling the litigation cycle, this court acknowledges the tireless efforts of local and national charities which, despite chronic underfunding, have endeavoured to engage with individuals identified at risk of radicalisation. These initiatives, though peripheral to direct criminal process, occupy a vital niche within an ecosystem of preventative strategies. Indeed, the defendant had intermittent contact with one such programme, the Bristol Resilience Partnership, whose representatives confirm receipt of sporadic engagement with educational modules focusing on cognitive restructuring and ideological disengagement. Efforts of this nature epitomise the complex interplay between public protection and rehabilitation. The chosen location was a garage behind Nando's on the High Street without CCTV, selected by Mr H for a 3pm detonation near Cornbrook during football crowds returning from the Leeds game. The Crown has presented evidence comprising intercepted digital communications, which, while anonymised in this document, demonstrate Mr H’s increasing alignment with proscribed extremist organisations and their communicated doctrines. The court observes that the analysis of the intercepts was conducted over many months, incorporating both linguistic expertise and metadata triangulation, reflecting both the volume of material and the sophistication with which defendants increasingly attempt to circumvent detection through the use of encrypted networks such as “Threema” and “Signal.” A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic examination revealed the presence of encrypted archives on multiple devices. Among these were PDFs, videos, and schematic diagrams corresponding with those disseminated by known terrorist entities. The defence raised technical challenges relating to file corruption and argued that some data may have been accessed inadvertently due to automated download procedures. Learned counsel for the Crown persuasively addressed these points, relying upon precedent such as R v. Khalid [2018] EWCA Crim 95, where possession of incomplete extremist material was held sufficient for culpability when paired with corroborative conduct. At this juncture, it is instructive to reflect on the difficulties faced by prosecuting authorities in drawing distinctions between protected speech and criminal conduct. The court is conscious of the right to freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, yet it is equally aware that this right is qualified where expression incites violence or supports terrorism. The line between opinion and preparation is, at times, finely drawn, requiring sober judicial analysis not swayed by simplistic binaries. A note of some procedural interest: the court was presented with a letter from the City Records Office commenting on archival data retrieved concerning a previously closed arson case involving a derelict industrial site in Kingswood. That case, while mentioned during cross-examination of a prosecution witness, is emphatically unrelated to the current charges against Mr H and is included here only to illustrate the wide-ranging nature of police intelligence-gathering and historical case interference. Similar peripheral allegations have occasionally surfaced in pre-trial motions but have not been substantiated in relation to the defendant. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The defence has advanced several mitigating factors. Among them the contention that certain tools and components recovered were held for lawful benign applications—such as component parts of a commercially available quadcopter drone often used in aerial photography workshops. The court accepts that these items, taken in isolation, are not inherently suspicious, but in the aggregate, and given the other evidence, the inference of lawful intent is untenable. In terms of ancillary circumstances, it is recorded that Mr H’s address was subject to a noise abatement notice during 2021, triggered by complaints from neighbours unrelated to the criminal investigation. Such community friction, while unrelated, provides a contextual backdrop to the defendant’s broader social environment. It must however be stressed that such municipal matters carry no weight in the determination of criminal culpability. The Crown’s case included testimony from Ms Felicity Warren, a senior digital forensic analyst with CTPSW. She outlined the forensic challenges of extracting data from devices employing custom encryption schemes and secure erase functions. Ms Warren’s detailed exposition illustrated the painstaking work that underpins these proceedings, demanding appreciation of the technical and human effort invested. The court is mindful that without such expertise many offences might remain undiscovered. The court also received a report from Dr Leonard Fields, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed on behalf of the defence. Dr Fields’ assessment, dated 2 September 2025, described Mr H as suffering from a chronic anxiety disorder with obsessive traits but found no evidence of psychotic illness. The report noted the defendant’s “rigid cognitive schemas and a strongly black-and-white worldview” yet stressed a lack of diminished responsibility. The report forecast considerable challenges in rehabilitation but held out some hope for structured de-radicalisation programmes. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. A notable feature of the prosecution’s evidence was the revelation of a trip undertaken by Mr H in October 2023 to Brussels. Travel records and surrounding CCTV footage showed a US transit through the city’s central station, where the defendant purportedly met with individuals later identified in intelligence files under suspicion for propagandist dissemination of radical material. Although the defendant contends this was a leisure visit—documentation of his itinerary includes images of tourist landmarks—the timing and association warrant the court’s consideration. Historically, the Crown refers to case law such as R v. Rasmussen [2015] EWCA Crim 540, dealing with conduct preparatory to terrorism involving foreign travel. The presiding judge found that travel ostensibly for tourism does not negate culpability where other evidence supports the facilitation or planning of terror activity. This precedent guides the balance the court must strike. The handling of digital material in these cases underscores some longstanding challenges. The court recently encountered an unrelated but instructive matter in R v. Graves [2024] EWCA Crim 1698, where discovery of encrypted chat patterns was frustrated by incompatible software platforms. Efforts to upgrade digital forensic capabilities remain critical as technological methods employed by suspects evolve rapidly. The court commends ongoing investment in this field but notes the inevitable lag between offence innovation and detection. The local criminal justice system continues to endure pressure from a wide spectrum of offending, both violent and non-violent. The steady rise in knife crime and gang-related violence competes for resources with sophisticated counter-terrorism activities. The strain is particularly evident in overstretched probation services, whose caseloads have increased by fifteen per cent over the past three years, as reported in the Ministry of Justice’s Annual Offender Management Statistics 2024. Meanwhile, the fragmentation of housing support and the increase in street homelessness continue to exacerbate social vulnerability in neighbourhoods akin to Mr H’s residence. Though tangential to the case at hand, these systemic challenges constitute the wider context of criminal justice administration in which cases of this nature are prosecuted. The defendant’s engagement with statutory rehabilitation schemes has been limited. The court notes from correspondence from the South West Counter Radicalisation Unit that Mr H declined several approaches to structured intervention during initial bail periods, and his participation in voluntary programmes was sporadic, marked more by absence than attendance. This pattern parallels observations made in the 2023 Home Office report on counter-extremism intervention, which highlights the difficulty of maintaining contact with those ideologically entrenched and resistant to deradicalisation efforts. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial components are frequently integral to such cases. Here a separate investigation identified a transfer of approximately £1,800 worth of cryptocurrency from Mr H’s digital wallet to a darknet marketplace seller specialising in dual-use equipment. The forensic accountancy report detailed blockchain tracing of this transaction via multiple tumblers, underscoring the lengths to which offenders take to conceal illicit financing. While cryptocurrency transactions are legal and legitimate in many respects, their abuse for unlawful ends poses distinct investigative challenges. The court recalls the caution expressed in R v. Bishop [2022] EWCA Crim 978, where reliance on incomplete financial tracing unfavourably affected the prosecution narrative. Contrastingly, here, the evidence is cogent and unchallenged, establishing clear linkage between the defendant and financial facilitation. Such monetary conduits are essential to the operational capacity of terror-related offending and inform the severity of sentence. The investigative picture included footage from covert CCTV capturing movements of Mr H adjacent to a riverside embankment on 8 February 2024. Analysts expended over 120 man-hours processing segmented video records to confirm his identity in low-light conditions—a time investment symptomatic of the resource-intensive nature of modern counter-terrorism surveillance. These recordings depict behaviour including the transfer of nondescript parcels, adding an additional layer of evidentiary complexity. The court echoes concerns regularly voiced about the asymmetry of effort between offenders and law enforcement. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H is now aged 30. His academic record includes a degree in electronics engineering from the University of Bath. Previous employment includes a brief tenure at a regional telecommunications provider, described by his supervisor as “competent yet socially withdrawn.” Character references have been made by former tutors and community group leaders, citing volunteer work in environmental clean-ups and local library assistance. The court balances these positive elements against the gravity of offences, mindful that community engagement, while commendable, cannot eclipse profound breaches of the criminal law. The defendant has a documented history of mental health difficulties involving episodes of anxiety but has never been hospitalised or subject to formal psychiatric detention. The pre-sentence report will be requested to explore this further and consider appropriate custodial mental health provision, should that be the outcome at sentencing. Letters from the Bristol Food Aid Network and Easton Youth Mentoring Scheme, submitted on Mr H’s behalf, attest to his sporadic participation in local civic endeavours. These contributions are recognised but, as with other mitigation, must be viewed within the full context. The court is mindful of the remark in R v. Whitmore [2023] EWCA Crim 2045, that “positive social behaviours do not diminish the culpability for planned violence but may inform the individual’s potential for rehabilitation.” A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. Professor Jason Milner, forensic psychologist, provided an expert report dated 22 August 2025. He records elevated levels of cognitive inflexibility within the defendant's thinking, alongside ideologically rigid frameworks. The assessment concludes that while Mr H does not suffer from severe mental illness, he poses a high risk of public harm without intensive and prolonged intervention. Rehabilitation prospects are cautiously optimistic but contingent on engagement with structured, specialist programmes post-release. It bears emphasis that risk assessments in terrorism cases remain inherently uncertain and must be periodically reviewed. The court welcomes the ongoing multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) oversight applicable to such cases, reflecting the critical importance of inter-agency collaboration in managing high-risk individuals transitioning through the criminal justice system. In closing, the court reiterates the solemn gravity of offences under the Terrorism Act. The planning, facilitation, and promotion of acts intended to sow fear and destabilise society challenge the very foundations of democratic life. Sentences imposed must, therefore, be commensurate with these realities and impose clear deterrents. I direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the National Probation Service, to include assessment of risk, suitability for intervention programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, and proposals for supervision frameworks. The report should appraise proposals for custodial restrictions in the event of imprisonment, including electronic monitoring and licence conditions tailored to limit access to extremist material and communications. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

Mr H Case No. B2025/24789 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. G. MARSHALL Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court to be sentenced following his recent conviction on charges under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, possession of an article for a purpose connected to terrorism. These charges concern activity carried out between February 2023 and his arrest in late January 2025. It must first be noted that this court, situated within the Midland Circuit, sits as a third-tier Crown Court for criminal proceedings of this nature. The intricate nature of terrorism prosecutions, the volume of evidential material, and often extensive disclosure obligations dictate that cases of this character proceed with measured care, respecting the principles of open justice and the need to safeguard sensitive intelligence. Procedures in these matters reflect the well-established framework laid down in the Criminal Procedure Rules and guided by statutory instruments; the priority being to ensure fairness balanced carefully with effective public protection. The defendant's prosecution followed an investigation led by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM). This was preceded by months of intelligence gathering, multi-agency information sharing, and technical surveillance, culminating in the execution of a warrant at his residence in Edgbaston on 28 January 2025. That operation relied heavily upon interception warrants issued under the provisions of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and the authorisation of search and seizure warrants pursuant to section 43C of the Terrorism Act 2000. Post-arrest, Mr H was released on conditional bail on 3 February 2025, pending the listing of a plea and trial preparation hearing. This hearing, scheduled for 1 July 2025, was adjourned due to new evidence having been disclosed at a late stage, a regrettably familiar feature in complex terrorism cases. The defence sought time to consider this material, particularly a forensic analysis by the National Cyber Crime Unit which unearthed additional encrypted communications. This resulted in a further adjournment until 12 September 2025, at which point Mr H entered guilty pleas in open court to both counts. The late change of plea, whilst acknowledged, significantly limited the degree of sentence discount to which the defendant is entitled. Credit for an early guilty plea is an established mitigating factor in sentencing but is expressly qualified in cases of tactical delay. The Court of Appeal has, on numerous occasions, emphasised that credit is not a mechanical entitlement but requires a sincere and timely acceptance of responsibility, as explained in R v. Cleanthous [2019] EWCA Crim 290 and further reaffirmed in R v. Frampton [2021] EWCA Crim 609. Delaying a plea until the eve of trial or after extensive witness preparation undermines the utility of such credit and the saving of public resources. It is important to recognise, as articulated in R v. Mohumed [2023] EWCA Crim 721, that offences relating to terrorist conduct attract significant custodial sentences calculated not merely with regard to the harm caused but with due attention to the deterrent effect and protection of the public. The court's sentencing exercise must have regard not only to Mr H’s personal culpability but also the elevated societal concerns inherent in the criminality of terrorism-related activity. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The prolonged nature of the investigation bears testament to the deliberate and methodical approach taken by Mr H. Law enforcement deployed a suite of investigative techniques, including covert technical surveillance, analysis of encrypted messaging traffic, and financial tracing exercises. The investigation brought under the spotlight the significant difficulty faced by agencies in decrypting highly secure communications, undertaken in this matter over several months with considerable resource implication. I note with dismay the continuing under-resourcing of the Legal Aid Agency, highlighted during this case by protracted delays in securing authority for expert psychiatric assessments and digital forensic assistance for the defence. Counsel for the defence, Mr Timothy Greene, was required to submit multiple requests and follow-ups before permission was obtained, straining the already stretched schedule and potentially impacting the timely progression of the case. This systemic underfunding remains a challenge to the proper administration of justice, particularly in complex, document-heavy proceedings such as these. Turning to the societal context in which this case unfolds, it cannot be overlooked that the broader climate is characterised by a worrying upsurge in public anxieties surrounding community safety. National and regional policing resources have seen heightened pressures from an expanding remit incorporating cybercrime, organised crime groups, and terrorism, on top of pre-existing demands from non-serious public order offences whose cumulative effects sap operational capacity. Public mental health services, too, remain stretched, impacting timely access to forensic psychiatric evaluations. These are factors which, while extrinsic to the defendant’s conduct, frame the milieu in which sentencing decisions must be justified and understood. The court is conscious also of the need to resist oversimplified narratives of extremist behaviour such as those occasionally promulgated on social media platforms, which tend to eclipse the nuanced realities of individual trajectories towards radicalisation. Procedural fairness requires that personal mitigating circumstances be examined fully alongside but never eclipsed by the gravity of the offences charged. A number of character references have been submitted on Mr H’s behalf, including letters from a local mosque committee praising his attendance at communal events and contributions to a youth football club, as well as correspondence from the Evergreen Resident’s Association highlighting his punctuality and neighbourly demeanor. While these community engagements provide some colour to his character, the court must weigh them with the stark facts of his offending. The court also received a report from the West Midlands Probation Service dated 30 September 2025. The report offers a comprehensive overview of Mr H’s history, including details of previous minor criminal conduct, none rising to the level of serious violence or terrorism. The report underlines his low engagement with elective rehabilitation interventions during an earlier community order relating to antisocial behaviour, but notes a recent expression of willingness to consider de-radicalisation programmes. Several letters from charities working in the fields of social reintegration and mental health advocacy were also filed. Particularly notable was correspondence from the Birmingham De-Radicalisation Initiative (BDI), whose programme director expressed cautious optimism about Mr H’s capacity for change pending structured, sustained intervention. Nonetheless, the court recognises that participation in such programmes is aspirational rather than definitive, and completion rates remain modest. Co-defendant matters, while relevant to the broader investigation, do not bear upon the sentencing of Mr H directly. It is regrettable that one co-defendant, known as Mr J, failed to appear for his trial and remains at large. Mr J’s charges include possession of a bladed weapon in a public park, an offence which is categorically not linked to Mr H and must not be conflated in this sentencing exercise. Historical case law was cited at the plea and trial preparation hearing, including R v. Singh [2007] EWCA Crim 1234 concerning the interpretation of “terrorist purpose” under the Terrorism Act 2006. The defendant’s conduct was measured against the principles elucidated there, confirming that intent may be inferred from a pattern of preparatory acts and possession of terrorist manuals even absent direct evidence of an imminent attack. The court acknowledges the evidence submitted regarding Mr H’s educational background. Notably, he attained a diploma in software development from a regional college in 2018. His prior employer, a local IT consultancy, described him as “a reliable albeit reserved employee,” albeit noting his contract was terminated following an internal review prompted by unusual internet activity. This employment history, while perhaps indicative of certain personal strengths, must be viewed in light of his overriding offending conduct. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The defendant engaged in extensive digital communications through encrypted platforms, evincing a level of operational security consistent with persistent criminal intent. The prosecution relied upon forensic decryption of multiple chat logs, which revealed discussions encompassing assemblage instructions for explosive devices, sourcing of dual-use chemicals, and distribution strategies for extremist propaganda. Such communications were, it appears, conducted over a period of more than a year. The technological context surrounding this digital activity is worthy of particular comment. Forensic teams faced a backload of over 20,000 encrypted devices nationally, creating contention over prioritisation. Mr H’s devices were given particular urgency owing to behavioural profiling and risk assessments indicating potential for public harm. This underscores the intensive labour involved in cases incurring national security concerns, with attendant demands on police cyber units operating within constrained budgets. The court further notes an analogy to R v. Abdulrazak [2015] EWCA Crim 1492, in which the Court of Appeal articulated the principle that the possession of terrorist publications, when connected to a preparatory course of conduct, satisfies the requisite mens rea for terrorism offences. That precedent remains a lodestar for assessment of intent and culpability in cases of this sort. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Mr H operated a collection of anonymous online accounts, hosting extremist videos and manifestoes. These accounts appear to have been used as platforms for the dissemination and propagation of radical messaging and recruitment. Linguistic analysis confirms that the style and content closely aligns with materials proscribed under the Home Secretary’s orders pursuant to the Terrorism Act 2000 section 3(5). The court is mindful that while freedom of expression remains foundational, it does not extend to the incitement or facilitation of terrorism. As stated in R v. Aitken [2024] EWCA Crim 360, courts must ensure that protective measures against extremist speech are both necessary and proportionate, a balance duly considered in the present case. Defence counsel sought to argue that the materials in question formed part of legitimate political commentary or artistic expression. Such a submission was rejected following evidence demonstrating the defendant’s awareness of the proscribed status of the content and his intent to further a terrorist cause. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Meticulous examination of seized devices uncovered a range of manuals on improvised explosive devices, previously removed from the public internet due to their potential for misuse. The devices, encrypted with formidable cryptographic algorithms, contained partially redacted schematics and component lists for manufacturing incendiary devices. The defence's suggestion that these materials were held for academic interest contradicts the broader circumstantial evidence, including multiple encrypted chats discussing operational planning and timing. The court considers the defendant’s assertions of academic curiosity to be unpersuasive, particularly against the backdrop of his sustained operational security measures and deliberate engagement with proscribed materials. This aligns with the conclusions in R v. Malik [2023] EWCA Crim 789, where innocent possession claims were rejected in the light of corroborating conduct. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. International travel records document a sojourn by Mr H to Istanbul in late 2023, ostensibly for cultural tourism. However, evidence indicates an attempt to cross into a region of active conflict, known for hosting various militant groups. Although the effort was aborted due to logistical disruptions, such as cancelled connecting flights, the attempt itself signals a willingness to affiliate with violent actors abroad. It is, regrettably, not unusual for defendants in terrorism cases to mask operational movements under the guise of tourism or family visits. Similarly, evidence of activities like the organised theft of copper cable from a rail yard, referenced in unrelated prosecutions, have no bearing on this sentencing and ought not to be conflated with the defendant’s conduct. The court further takes note of the 2021 case R v. Thompson [2021] EWCA Crim 1543, involving offences of fly-tipping and environmental damage in the green belt, offences unrelated to terrorism but arising within the broader corpus of criminal justice considerations. It is crucial to avoid misattribution in such contexts. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial forensics uncovered cryptocurrency transactions linked via blockchain analysis to addresses connected with illicit chemical suppliers. Mr H’s transactions, while representing modest sums in cryptocurrency, reflect an awareness of, and participation in, unregulated financial channels commonly exploited for anonymity in criminal enterprise. The court notes the concerning trend towards financial obfuscation in terrorist financing, a challenge also noted in recent reports from the Financial Action Task Force. Counsel for the defence emphasised Mr H’s lack of prior convictions to argue against a custodial sentence. While the absence of a prior record must always be considered, it is not determinative in cases where the risk of serious harm is substantial. R v. Jenkins [2022] EWCA Crim 1127 confirms that prior good character does not diminish the gravity of terrorism offences. The court also notes, without direct bearing, that a co-defendant in an associated matter was found with an unauthorised firearm during an unrelated search, a matter which has no application to the defendant before this court. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is now 31 years old with an educational history including a foundation degree in information technology. His early adult life included a period of employment as a network administrator for a mid-sized educational trust, terminated following concerns about computer use policies violation. Letters from previous employers describe him as “competent though reserved.” Significant in mitigation are reports from psychiatric experts. Dr Laura Chalmers, consultant forensic psychiatrist, submitted a detailed report dated 5 October 2025, indicating that Mr H exhibits signs of obsessive-compulsive traits and high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. The report describes cognitive rigidity and difficulties in social cognition but does not diagnose psychosis or affective disorder. The report warns of a heightened risk of re-engagement with extremist ideology absent intensive management but highlights potential benefit from specialist interventions. The local authority housing department, responding to inquiries, confirms that Mr H has been accommodated since early 2024 in emergency housing following family breakdown. Such instability poses further challenges for risk management but is not, in isolation, causal or mitigating. It is regrettable to report that the defendant’s letter writing style is precise, his handwriting notably neat and legible, suggesting an intellectual capacity not inconsistent with his educational background. Mr H has supplied the court with a handwritten personal statement, carefully composed and expressing the desire to “make right past errors” yet stopping short of contrition. The precise nature of his remorse, if any, remains ambiguous. A further reflection must be made on the impression left by various third-party reports. The Eastside Community Forum’s outreach worker reports that contact with Mr H has been intermittent, with limited engagement beyond scheduled meetings. Such partial cooperation is sadly emblematic of wider challenges faced in community safety interventions. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! Consultant forensic psychologist, Professor Henry Jameson, conducted an assessment concluding that Mr H poses a high risk of serious harm and is likely to continue involvement in extremist activities absent rigorous supervision and targeted psychological intervention. Professor Jameson underscores elevated cognitive inflexibility and a binary moral outlook as factors reducing amenability to standard rehabilitation programmes. The present case demonstrates features categorising the offending as highly culpable under the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guidelines for terrorism offences. These include detailed planning, intent to cause indiscriminate harm, and use of sophisticated digital encryption technologies. The presence of aggravating factors is plainly evident. Mitigation is confined mainly to the absence of previous relevant convictions, academic qualifications, and the defendant’s late but unequivocal guilty pleas. The plea discount is expressly limited by their timing and lack of earlier cooperation. The court appreciates the efforts of all agencies involved in the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements, which have facilitated safeguarding strategies even prior to conviction. The collaboration between the Probation Service, NHS forensic services, and Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands exemplifies the best practices in managing high-risk offenders. In accordance with established practice, a comprehensive pre-sentence report is directed. The report should detail options for custodial and community-based interventions, assess suitability for the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, and address the feasibility of Extended Determinate Sentences with appropriate licence conditions. Consideration should be given to electronic monitoring, exclusion zone orders, and polygraph testing as part of a multi-modal risk management plan. The court takes this opportunity to commend the professional work of Ms Emily Cartwright, probation officer responsible for compiling the initial risk assessment, whose detailed analysis provided an invaluable basis for consideration. Similarly, the local NHS forensic psychology department’s cooperation with defence experts in arranging complex interviews is noted with thanks. Historical case law reminders remain ever pertinent. For instance, the foundational guidance laid out in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 continues to inform judicial interpretation of sentencing thresholds for preparatory terrorism conduct. This case vividly enacts the principles therein, stressing the paramountcy of public protection. This court records its appreciation for the calm and professional demeanour of the victim liaison officer handling ancillary welfare concerns of individuals potentially affected by the defendant’s conduct, a role often invisible but of critical importance. Victim liaison's work, despite being peripheral to the central charges, supports the noble aim of restorative justice and community reassurance. The strained circumstances under which modern justice operates—marked by judicial vacancies, case backlogs, and increasing complexity—cannot be overstated. The defendant’s case was subject to listing delays exacerbated by national judicial strike action in August 2025, illustrating challenges faced across the system. The court thanks counsel for their diligent submissions: Mr Alexander Reid for the Crown and Mr Timothy Greene for the defence. Both have conducted themselves with professionalism and respect for the demands of this sensitive case, ensuring robust adversarial testing of the evidence. It is proper to acknowledge the invaluable contribution of the support staff in Court 5, Birmingham Crown Court, whose management of evidence presentation and maintenance of courtroom decorum was exemplary. Such efforts facilitate the smooth operation of trials involving voluminous material and nuanced evidence. In summation, the defendant’s conduct represents a serious breach of trust and public safety, warranting a custodial sentence consistent with the Sentencing Council’s terrorism guidelines of 2023. The anticipated pre-sentence report shall assist this court in finalising a proportionate disposal balancing the interests of justice and rehabilitation prospects.

WILKINSON Filed: 3 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court today for sentence following his conviction by jury for two serious offences under the Terrorism Act 2006: engaging in conduct preparatory to acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is found to have occurred between July 2023 and the date of his arrest in February 2025. The defendant’s prosecution has been the culmination of extensive investigative efforts by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), supported by security and intelligence agencies over a period exceeding eighteen months. The combination of covert surveillance, open-source intelligence, and forensic digital examination was necessary in light of sophisticated operational security measures employed by the defendant. The arrest of Mr H took place at 04:15 on 12 February 2025, when police executed warrants under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence in the Bedminster area. Seized items included encrypted digital storage, specialist electronic equipment, and printed material. These actions were based on multiple strands of evidential intelligence, including intercepted communications and financial transaction tracing. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It is essential to place the investigation that led to Mr H’s arrest in the wider operational and fiscal context within which counter-terrorism policing operates. The prolonged nature of the enquiry, with over 900 distinct intelligence reports generated, has placed an extraordinary burden on CTPSW and allied units. Such investigations often compete for finite resources with other demands, including organised crime, cyber-enabled fraud, and serious violent offences. The court notes, with some measure of regret, the frequently repeated concern regarding understaffing within frontline police units. Recent Home Office statistics indicate that police numbers nationally have not yet returned to pre-2010 levels, despite increases in population and technological complexity of modern crime. The demand for specialist counter terrorism resources remains high, with analyst caseloads averaging 35 open files per officer. The court is mindful of a submission from defence counsel emphasising the importance of due process and admonishing what they describe as “mission creep” in surveillance powers. While respect for civil liberties remains paramount, the court must balance such considerations with the overriding imperative of protecting the public from harm. As Lord Justice Pitchford stated in R v. Al-Mauod [2014] EWCA Crim 2456, “The state’s duty to safeguard its citizenry justifies proportional intrusions in the prosecutorial phase consistent with legal protections.” It must also be noted that this case encountered procedural complexity not uncommon in matters involving extensive digital disclosure. The volume of material indexed by the National Technical Assistance Centre approached 2.3 terabytes, comprising tens of thousands of individual files, including encrypted archives requiring advanced cryptanalysis. The logistical challenge of balancing disclosure obligations under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 16 with national security safeguards has delayed pre-trial preparation on occasion, including the necessity for closed material procedure hearings under the Justice and Security Act 2013. The court commends both Crown and defence teams for their professionalism in navigating these constraints. Historical case law remains instructive in framing sentencing severity in terrorism cases. The seminal decision of R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 confirmed the broad scope of “terrorist purpose,” extending beyond direct attack planning to encompass support and facilitation. Similar principles were reiterated in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which endorsed substantial custodial penalties even where direct harm was averted by prompt police intervention. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. Further consideration must be given to the defendant’s use of online platforms as a conduit for ideologically motivated communication and material dissemination. The Crown presented evidence that Mr H maintained social media profiles and encrypted messaging accounts where extremist propaganda was regularly shared, with deliberate attempts to anonymise and obfuscate. Linguistic analysis identified repeated use of coded phrases traceable to proscribed organisations, demonstrating clear intent to inspire or incite. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. An important aspect of the case involved the analysis of digital artefacts recovered from encrypted drives stored within VeraCrypt containers bearing innocuous labels unrelated to their contents. These included detailed manuals on improvised explosive device (IED) construction and tactical deployment, imagery consistent with reconnaissance of potential target locations, and records of transactions involving dual-use chemicals with known diversion potential. It is noteworthy that some material was incomplete or corrupt, leading to defence arguments that Mr H did not fully access or comprehend all content. However, as held in R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 890, the possession of such materials with a clear intention to utilise them is sufficient to establish culpability regardless of any technical incompleteness. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The defendant’s explanation at interview and through the court was that he harboured a purely academic interest in explosive chemistry and that the contents of his devices stemmed from passive internet browsing. These assertions were categorically rejected by the jury in light of corroborating evidence from intercepted communications indicating active recruitment and solicitation of others to partake in extremist activities. Whilst the case before this court does not involve direct physical harm, it is important to note the wider societal context into which offences of this nature embed themselves. The normalization of violent extremism through online echo chambers presents a persistent threat to community cohesion and public safety, as emphasised repeatedly in both governmental white papers and parliamentary debate. Of some peripheral interest, though not contributory to the defendant’s culpability, was a report prepared during the investigation detailing a spate of fly-tipping incidents along a nearby stretch of greenbelt land—offenses investigated by local environmental enforcement teams and attributed to an unrelated individual. Those offences, though serious in their ecological impact, have no bearing on criminal responsibility here but serve to remind of the diverse challenges facing policing agencies. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The court draws particular attention to the defendant’s travel history. Records confirm a trip to Antwerp in late 2023, said by Mr H to be “cultural study,” which coincides temporally with meetings held with persons later linked to international terrorist networks. Surveillance footage placed the defendant in proximity to locations known for extremist recruitment activities. The volume of disclosure in this case is substantial. Collation and redaction of material were further delayed by a strike of court clerks during the spring term of 2025, illustrating the susceptibility of criminal proceedings to external industrial action—a factor regrettably common across many judicial districts. This delay occasioned multiple adjournments, the latest of which was heard on 23 May 2025, resulting in a fresh listing for sentence on 17 September 2025. The strain such interruptions place on defendants, victims, and support agencies is well recognised and regretted by this court. The role of voluntary agencies has also been prominent. Submissions from the Bristol Resettlement Consortium articulate the challenges of securing suitable accommodation for individuals linked to ideological risk. The present housing crisis, exacerbated by widespread reductions in social housing stock and acute rental inflation, complicates the design of coherent post-release supervision plans. The court records further correspondence from the Centre for Community False Allegation Support, which highlighted an increase in malicious calls made to authorities, sometimes connected to extremist ideology, though unrelated to the defendant in this matter. These background observations provide a sombre picture of the wider environment but do not diminish the obligation to punish and prevent genuine threats. The importance of multi-agency collaboration was underscored at the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Level 3 meeting convened on 24 August 2025, which included representatives from CTPSW, National Probation Service, NHS Forensic Psychiatry, and local housing authorities. Such coordination is critical in managing the complex risks posed by offenders like Mr H. The court acknowledges the efforts of healthcare professionals at the Avon Secure Unit, whose psychiatric assessments, though not diagnosing formal mental illness, provided valuable insight into the defendant’s cognitive style and risk profile. Despite resource constraints and admitted long waiting lists, the team produced a comprehensive report that informed risk management strategies. The court further notes difficulties encountered by defence counsel in securing timely legal aid funding for independent expert instruction. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted approval process added to preparatory delays, a systemic problem highlighted in recent Ministry of Justice oversight reports. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial tracing conducted by a forensic accountant for the prosecution revealed multiple cryptocurrency transactions from wallets linked to Mr H to vendors on the dark web. These payments, though relatively modest in amount, facilitated procurement of equipment and precursor chemicals consistent with the charged offences. The court recognises the growing sophistication of cryptocurrency in criminal finance. While such technologies have legitimate applications, their misuse represents an evolving challenge for law enforcement and judicial authorities. Cases involving tumblers, mixers, and decentralised exchanges require concerted responses to prevent exploitation of anonymity. Recovery of covert surveillance footage from 4 November 2024 documented the defendant’s presence at a riverside location late at night, consistent with test-firing of small explosive devices found during his arrest. The time-intensive analysis of these recordings involved synchronizing multiple camera feeds and overcoming low-light technical limitations, highlighting the labour-intensive nature of modern counter-terrorism operations. The court emphasises that such minute but painstaking work epitomises the disproportionate commitment required to safeguard public safety against small-scale but high-impact threats. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal background, Mr H is 31 years old, degree-educated in chemical engineering from a respected university. Former employment included a research assistant post in a materials science laboratory, terminated following allegations of misuse of university computing resources to access extremist websites. Character references describe him as intelligent and courteous but socially withdrawn. Letters of support submitted from a horticultural society, praising his volunteer work in community green spaces, speak to positive aspects of his character, but as the court has previously observed, such community contributions cannot and should not be permitted to mitigate deliberate planning of violence. Psychological assessment by Professor Samuel Lenox, consultant forensic psychologist, describes the defendant as displaying marked cognitive rigidity, with a propensity for binary reasoning and limited capacity for empathetic understanding. No major psychiatric disorder was diagnosed; however, risk assessment tools classify Mr H as posing high risk of serious harm, particularly in ideological contexts. Defence submissions propose engagement with structured de-radicalisation and cognitive behavioural programmes, notably the Home Office’s Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). The court welcomes rehabilitative endeavours but remains aware of attrition rates and the necessity of robust monitoring, especially in licence conditions post-release. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. In considering sentencing, the court acknowledges the maximum penalties provided under the Terrorism Act 2006, which include life imprisonment. Sentencing here must serve forward-looking aims: deterrence, protection of the public, and reduction of risk, balanced against proportionality and legal principle. The defendant’s late guilty pleas limit the extent of available credit, particularly given the extent of pre-trial preparation and the harm averted only by police intervention. Similar principles were articulated in R v. Tinsley [2023] EWCA Crim 1401 and R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029. Mitigating factors in this case are limited but do include Mr H’s lack of previous convictions, educational attainment, and partial cooperation. Aggravating features are substantial: the ideological motivation, the sophistication of planning, the possession of weapon-related articles, and the potential for indiscriminate harm. I direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report which should address options for custodial sentencing with extended supervision periods, availability of rehabilitation programmes particularly targeting violent extremist thinking, and feasibility of managed release incorporating electronic monitoring and licence conditions restricting internet access and association with known risk individuals. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 3 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be dispatched to the relevant authorities.

Mr H Case No. B2025/29531 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. T. ELLSWORTH Filed: 12 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court today for sentence, having been convicted following a jury trial on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count pursuant to section 5(1)(a) for engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and a further count under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism. The offences are said to have occurred in the period from January 2023 until the defendant’s arrest on 14 February 2025. The court takes judicial note of the extensive pre-trial procedural history in this matter. The initial charge was brought on 18 February 2025, following the execution of warrants at an address in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham, conducted by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, acting under powers contained in section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrants derived from intelligence received from the Security Service concerning encrypted communications linked to the defendant, which, upon initial examination, were suggestive of materials indicative of terrorist planning activity. Items seized included multiple encrypted electronic devices, a collection of chemical precursors, and electronic components identified as potentially dual-use items. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative operation, codenamed Operation IRONWILLOW, involved a multi-disciplinary team composed of representatives from CT Policing, Forensic Science specialists, and the National Cyber Crime Unit. It is important to underscore that the investigative methodology required protracted efforts to decode communications encrypted on bespoke platforms, utilizing virtual private networks and anonymisation technology designed to circumvent detection. The demands of this work were compounded by the widespread adoption of end-to-end encryption on many messaging apps, which necessitated cooperation with foreign national intelligence agencies subject to strict protocols and legal frameworks. This international liaison added a layer of procedural delay, illustrating the complexity inherent to modern counter-terror investigations. The defendant, Mr H, was initially remanded in custody after first appearance at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court on 20 February 2025, where bail was refused on the ground of substantial risk to the public and concerns about potential flight risk. It is regrettable but necessary to observe that the operation was affected by a delay in the provision of certain material to the defence, attributable to the multi-agency vetting process required when national security interests are engaged. Such delays are not uncommon in terrorism cases and, while regrettable, do not amount to unfair prejudice in this case. During the pre-trial phase, behavioural interventions were offered to Mr H by the local Prevent team operating under the Channel Programme. Records indicate that he was referred in October 2022 by a university welfare officer on grounds of concerning social media postings and ideological entrenchment. The participation was sporadic, marked by occasional attendance at community workshops but little apparent amelioration in attitude. Such difficulty in engagement is frequently encountered and highlights the challenges that frontline practitioners face in early intervention work with individuals displaying signs of radicalisation. The court acknowledges receipt of letters from the Edgbaston Young Voices charity, expressing cautious support for continued engagement with the defendant post-release. The charity, while not specialised in counter-extremism, has described attempts to offer vocational training and mentorship. It is a salutary reminder of the patchwork nature of support available and the reliance on voluntary sector organisations operating under chronic funding pressures. The plea and trial preparation hearing was conducted on 4 July 2025. Mr H initially pleaded not guilty but entered guilty pleas to both counts on the morning of the final trial day, 15 July 2025. The court must comment on the lateness of the pleas, which came only after the evidence had been extensively presented and the jury empanelled. Whilst credit is due for acceptance of responsibility, that credit is necessarily limited by the timing and the lack of early engagement with mitigating factors. The Court of Appeal has been clear, in cases such as R v. Newberry [2024] EWCA Crim 1432, that credit for guilty plea must reflect not only the fact but the stage at which the plea is entered, and late pleas that do little to alleviate witness distress or save court time warrant reduced discount. A continuation of that principle is observable in R v. Kestrel [2023] EWCA Crim 1115, a case involving a conspiracy to commit arson on public property. Mr Kestrel pleaded guilty after trial commenced, eliciting a reduction of no more than 10 per cent in sentencing credit, due to the minimal procedural efficiencies secured thereby. Those authorities provide important guidance on the limits of credit in terrorism-related offences, particularly where safety considerations and public confidence are paramount. The court is instructed to have regard to the sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in December 2023 for terrorism offences, which reiterate that sentences must reflect the seriousness of the terrorist threat, the degree of planning and sophistication, and the risk posed to the public. The guidelines also emphasize the importance of deterrence and public protection as core objectives. Cases such as R v. Baharuddin [2022] EWCA Crim 872 further demonstrate that even early intervention or prompt disengagement from extremist ideology can be taken into account, but fundamental culpability arising from preparation for terrorist acts is rarely so mitigated. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. It is relevant to note that Mr H’s online activities included extensive correspondence via an encrypted platform with co-conspirators who were themselves subjects of separate investigations in other jurisdictions. The circumstantial evidence of intent to cause indiscriminate harm was bolstered by analytics on the timing and content of communications, together with physical evidence found at the Edgbaston address. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The recovered “blueprints” and instructional documents demonstrate a considerable degree of technical knowledge and intent to manufacture devices with lethal capacity. The presence of these items was in issue throughout the trial, though the jury was invited to accept that the defendant engaged in this conduct with the foresight of mass casualties and disruption. It is within the court’s knowledge that the forensic laboratories tasked with analysing chemical mixtures and test materials in this case faced considerable backlogs, often referred to in official monitoring reports as a “perfect storm” of funding shortfalls and increased caseload. The strain on scientific capacity inevitably prolongs investigative timelines and hampers swift justice. Turning to personal mitigation, much was made by defence counsel of Mr H’s background, noting his upbringing in a socially deprived area and reported history of childhood adversity. Passages from psychiatric assessments were submitted, reflecting the diagnostic observation of attachment difficulties and a tendency toward rigid ideological beliefs, but no formal diagnosis of major mental illness. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. These documents, whilst insightful, do not detract from the overall assessment that Mr H understood the nature and potential consequences of his conduct. Moreover, the evidence of engagement with radical material over a sustained period militates against any suggestion of temporary impairment or diminished responsibility. The court notes that a small quantity of a controlled substance, specifically cannabis resin, was found at the residential address. No charge arose from this, and the court does not take it into account as an aggravating factor in connection with terrorism offences. It is recorded simply to maintain a comprehensive picture. The defence drew attention to Mr H’s voluntary participation in sports clubs during his teenage years and references submitted from a local youth centre commending his leadership as a football coach assistant. These laudable community ties evoke, to some extent, the complexity of human behaviour. However, as has been consistently articulated in sentencing jurisprudence, pro-social activities do not negate culpability where evidence of calculated terrorism-related offending is clear. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. During the trial, evidence was adduced regarding travel abroad in 2023, involving flights to and from Turkey with stopovers proximate to regions known for active extremist recruitment and operations. Although the defence posited innocent tourism, the prosecution’s case emphasised the synchrony of these trips with digital communication spikes and procurement activity. It is worth highlighting that digital evidence in this matter was voluminous, comprising over 2.7 terabytes of data including emails, chat logs, and metadata dating back several years. Defence experts had to navigate through this enormous dataset under a legal aid capped budget, a point raised repeatedly during pre-trial hearings to highlight the resource limitations imposed upon representation in terrorism cases. Pre-trial hearings were subject to several postponements due to non-availability of counsel caused by industrial action within the legal aid sector and, separately, due to technical malfunctions of courtroom recording equipment after a recent refurbishment of Court 12. Those delays, while regrettable, did not disrupt the overall progression of the case unduly. The court also acknowledges receipt of a probation pre-sentence report, which details Mr H’s history of employment as a warehouse operative until mid-2022, his subsequent period of unemployment, and notes a series of minor driving offences, including a fixed penalty notice for using a mobile device whilst driving in 2021 and an incident of driving without insurance recorded in mid-2020. Neither of these matters bears directly upon the current proceedings but are duly noted for completeness. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial records reviewed during the investigation exhibited the defendant’s utilisation of cryptocurrency transactions totalling approximately £3,800 over the relevant window. These transactions passed through multiple so-called “mixers” designed to obfuscate source and destination, consolidating the Crown’s concerns regarding the defendant’s intention to conceal supply chains. The ever-increasing role of decentralised finance platforms in criminal economies, especially those facilitating terrorist financing, presents a formidable challenge to law enforcement. The court shares the observation made by the Financial Action Task Force in its July 2024 compliance report which cautioned against under-regulation and underscored the need for international cooperation in such domains. In a broader context, the court is aware of public concerns arising from the rise of casual street-level nuisances such as graffiti tagging of public transport infrastructure—notably, the recent spate of vandalism affecting Birmingham’s tram system. While regrettable, such acts are tangential to the present case but serve to remind us of the varied spectrum of public order offences with which police and local authorities contend. Of note in related but separate legal proceedings, a co-defendant arrested in connection with materially different charges was found to be in possession of a bladed article at a school premises, which was unrelated to the present defendant. This court makes clear that such conduct is disassociated from Mr H’s offending and must not colour the assessment of his culpability. Turning to analysis of covert surveillance, specialist officers dedicated approximately 220 hours to a detailed observation of Mr H’s activities over a six-month period, which entailed deployment of mounted cameras, networked smart sensors, and advanced facial recognition software. This prolonged commitment to intelligence gathering underscores the sophistication and resource investment that complex terrorism investigations demand. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is aged 31, with a background including completion of secondary education followed by vocational training in electronics. Letters tendered on his behalf include one from his elder brother, who is reportedly undergoing separate criminal proceedings for allegations of benefit fraud, and another from an estranged partner currently subject to harassment investigations. While distressing, these peripheral matters have no proximate bearing on the defendant’s culpability or risk. The defendant has exhibited a tendency towards isolation and ideological fixation since his early twenties. Expert psychiatric opinion, provided by Dr Saira Malhotra, notes his “marked cognitive inflexibility” and “evidence of polarised worldview,” but refrains from diagnosing a formal psychiatric disorder. The consultant observes, however, that Mr H’s ideological commitment presents a high risk of reoffending without robust intervention. Defence submissions have proposed the application of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), a community-based initiative designed to address radicalisation. The court welcomes rehabilitative efforts but remains cognisant of the modest completion rates and the attendant risk factors associated with ideological recidivism. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. In conclusion, this court is faced with a serious and complex set of offences, reflective of a sophisticated intent and substantive planning towards acts of terrorism with the potential for grave harm. Aggravating factors include the defendant’s technical expertise, the use of encrypted communications to frustrate detection, and engagement with co-conspirators operating across borders. Mitigation is limited to the absence of previous convictions of similar gravity, some personal difficulties in youth, and the late plea of guilt entered just prior to trial. The extent of credit for that plea, as discussed, is one-sixth, reflecting the minimal procedural and victim relief secured thereby. A pre-sentence report will be ordered. The probation service is directed to examine the defendant’s suitability for structured supervision including, but not limited to, cognitive behavioural interventions targeting ideological belief systems, strict compliance monitoring by electronic tagging, and potential placement within an approved premises with specialist counter-radicalisation support. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 August 2025, in Court 14 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. They have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

Mr H Case No. B2025/28903 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. A. Quincey Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court today to be sentenced for multiple offences, primarily of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles for terrorist purposes, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges cover a period from April 2023 to his arrest in January 2025. It is appropriate, at the outset, to acknowledge the complexity and sensitivity of the matter and to record thanks to the Crown Prosecutor, Miss Eleanor Rivers, and to the learned defence counsel, Mr Idris Malik, both of whom have conducted proceedings with diligence and professionalism despite the substantial pressures imposed by constrained Legal Aid funding and protracted disclosure obligations. As is familiar in cases of this gravity, the process has been long and procedurally intricate. Following the initial arrest of the defendant on 14 January 2025, the case experienced multiple pre-trial hearings punctuated by defence applications to extend the scope of disclosure, which the court acceded to on 17 March 2025, mindful that the volume of material—chiefly FAT32 forensic extractions, intercepted communications, and encrypted digital evidence—demanded sufficient preparation time given the gravity of the charges and the defendant’s right to a fair trial. The court notes with some regret that despite judicial encouragement for early plea discussions, the defendant maintained a not guilty stance throughout the preparation phase and entered pleas of guilty only on the morning of trial on 21 August 2025. The court is well acquainted with the weight of prosecutorial resources marshalled in terrorism investigations. The investigation in this case was managed through Operation FLINTROSE, involving coordination across a variety of law enforcement and intelligence agencies including West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Security Service (MI5). Resources expended were necessarily substantial, encompassing intercepted encrypted messaging traffic analysis, deployment of covert human intelligence sources, and extensive forensic computing examination. It bears noting that such investigations, while resource-intensive, are vital to preclude potential harm from translating into catastrophic incidents. In the administrative realm, the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of instructions to instruct expert psychiatric evidence caused some procedural delays. Applications for funding to instruct Professor M. Talwar, a forensic psychiatrist specialising in cognitive radicalisation, were initially deferred due to incomplete documentation, necessitating repeated submissions by defence solicitors. Such bureaucratic tardiness remained a source of palpable frustration during proceedings and highlights the broader systemic issues of under-resourcing that impact fair and timely justice. Prior to arrest, the defendant had been subject to a Channel programme referral in September 2019, initiated by a university mentor following expressed admiration for controversial figures in political violence, recorded in a coursework submission. The referral was discontinued after eight months on the basis of Mr H’s inconsistent engagement and absence of discernible progression towards deradicalisation. This early intervention record, while not definitive in itself, provides important context for his subsequent trajectory. It is a regrettable but persistent reality that resources for Channel and Prevent programmes suffer from variable staffing and funding across local authorities. At the West Midlands Prevent Hub, for example, persistent staff shortages have limited the frequency of case reviews and constrained proactive engagement efforts. These deficiencies underscore the challenges faced by practitioners seeking to balance individual rights against the imperative of public protection. The court is also obliged to draw attention to the work of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) panel convened in this case. The MAPPA Group, consisting of representatives from the Midlands NPS, Counter Terrorism Policing, NHS forensic mental health services, and local authority safeguarding teams, met on 2 February, 14 April, and most recently on 30 July 2025. The panel's coordinated attempts to produce a risk management strategy have been hindered by the defendant's intermittent cooperation and limited engagement with psychological services. The MAPPA group has recommended a cautious approach to post-custody supervision, including electronic monitoring and residence in secure approved premises. In R v. Holloway [2017] EWCA Crim 2312 the Court of Appeal highlighted the critical importance of multidisciplinary oversight in terrorism cases, emphasizing that the absence of effective inter-agency communication can directly compromise the public’s safety. While the circumstances of Holloway diverge factually from the present case, the principle of cautious, informed risk management remains apposite here. Both the probation service and forensic psychiatrists have stressed the serious risk posed by the defendant if released without stringent conditions. The probation officer assigned to Mr H, Ms. Lorna Baker, comments on the difficulties in securing sustained engagement, noting that Mr H’s communication style is characterised by intellectual abstraction yet lacks genuine openness to challenge. It is the unfortunate truth that the defendant’s profile matches that of what forensic psychologist Dr Richard Lees describes in his 2021 treatise, “The Psychopathology of Extremism,” as exhibiting “cognitive inflexibility” and “binary moral frameworks” which make standard rehabilitative approaches less effective. Such individuals pose an elevated risk of non-compliance and potential re-engagement with extremist networks absent intensive supervision. The defendant’s educational history includes a degree in computer science, awarded with upper second-class honours from a Midlands university in 2018. Letters submitted in mitigation attest to his technical capabilities and early promise. Yet counsel’s suggestion that such academic attainments should weigh heavily in mitigation is tempered by the fact that those very skills evidently facilitated his access to and use of encryption technologies to circumvent surveillance. It bears noting, as a point of procedural record, that the case listing for sentencing was initially set for 30 July 2025 but was adjourned following the late submission of a further psychiatric report by Professor Talwar. This report was itself delayed due to the on-going pressures on forensic psychiatric services nationally, with waiting lists for diagnostic assessments averaging over twenty weeks. Such strains reflect the wider challenges faced by the NHS’s forensic divisions in balancing demand and capacity. During the trial, the court heard from Ms. Camille Andrews, a community outreach officer employed by the Birmingham Resettlement Charity, who described the difficulties of engaging individuals with entrenched extremist beliefs. Her evidence, while not directly related to Mr H’s specific conduct, illuminated the wider challenges of social reintegration faced by convicted offenders in this sphere. The Crown’s evidence was supported by a suite of digital forensic analyses, jointly undertaken by the National Digital Forensics Centre and Counter Terrorism Policing specialists. Recoverable data included encrypted archives, metadata logs demonstrating planned travel to overseas conflict zones, and communications with individuals proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The court received extensive submissions regarding the applicable sentencing bracket. The lead authority remains R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which clarifies the breadth of the “terrorist purpose” definition and reinforces the principle that sentences must reflect not only the nature of the conduct but the wider harms threatened by terrorism. Cases such as R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 and R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678 provide further guidance on the principle that protective sentencing—especially indeterminate or extended determinate terms—is appropriate where risk remains high and where intervention may mitigate but not eradicate that risk. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The facts of the case are as follows: the defendant, using a variety of encrypted communication platforms and pseudonymous online identities, engaged in sustained planning and preparation to acquire materials capable of causing mass harm. His digital footprint revealed extensive research into explosive manufacture and dissemination of extremist propaganda aimed at inciting violence. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. The court must reflect upon the extent to which Mr H’s use of digital platforms for extremist communication constitutes an aggravating feature. Lord Justice Davis in R v. Strand [2021] EWCA Crim 453 stated, “The use of modern technology to evade law enforcement and disseminate extremist ideology increases culpability, given the heightened risk of widespread harm.” A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Recovered digital materials included detailed instructions accompanied by diagrams on improvised explosive devices, along with encrypted contact lists of known sympathisers. Such material, judged by experienced forensic psychologists, reveals deliberate and knowing preparation, moving beyond mere curiosity or ideological expression. Amid the prosecution’s extensive reliance on digital evidence, defence counsel argued for contextualising the defendant’s engagement as academic interest. However, the court finds such a submission untenable when weighed against the totality of the evidence, including the defendant’s expressed intent and operational security measures, such as use of Tor anonymisation networks. The court notes with some interest that a quantity of tinctures and homeopathic remedies was found at the defendant’s residence. While these have no bearing on the offences charged, they provide a curious juxtaposition to the violent content also recovered. The court is wary of drawing conclusions of character based upon such disparate artefacts. Further, small-scale fly-tipping of garden waste had been reported in the vicinity of Mr H’s primary residence during 2023, identified only because of CCTV footage unrelated to the current investigation. No charge was brought, and it is recorded here merely as part of a comprehensive review of neighborhood incidents not directly connected to the defendant’s conduct. The legal framework governing sentencing in terrorism matters encompasses both custodial provisions and the consideration of ancillary orders such as Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMs), electronic monitoring, and notification requirements under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, where relevant. None of the latter applies here but the court flags it for completeness regarding the sentencing discretion available. It is a regrettable but persistent challenge in cases of ideological offending that defence psychological reports are frequently hampered by limited defendant engagement. In this instance, the psychiatric report dated 11 August 2025 by Professor Talwar is somewhat constrained by Mr H’s refusal to submit to comprehensive neurocognitive testing, which might have shed light on potential underlying conditions affecting impulse control or empathy. Nonetheless, the report is detailed and professionally composed, setting out a clear profile of high ideological commitment, cognitive rigidity, and limited insight. It assesses the risk of serious harm as high, advising that without intrusive interventions, the potential for further extremist activity post-release remains substantial. The court acknowledges a noteworthy letter from the South Birmingham Food Cooperative, which has engaged Mr H sporadically in voluntary community work. While their support is to be welcomed in principle, the Co-op’s representatives are candid in their view that he remained socially withdrawn and resistant to certain normative influences, preferring discussion centred on ideological grievances. This underlines the complexity of his social integration prospects. It is pertinent to remind the court of the foundational principles of sentencing articulated in the Sentencing Council’s Guidelines on Terrorism Offences (2023). The court must balance the objectives of punishment, deterrence, public protection, and rehabilitation, all calibrated against the gravity of the offending and the defendant’s personal circumstances. In doing so, I reflect also on the persistent social consequences of acts of terrorism and near-terrorism on community cohesion and the confidence of minority populations, whose faith in public institutions can be profoundly shaken. The sentencing decision must therefore uphold the rule of law while being mindful of wider societal impact. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Of particular concern is the defendant’s attempt to acquire precursor chemicals and dual-use components with a view to manufacture an explosive device. The Crown presented evidence demonstrating those items were sourced with due concealment and transported covertly, reflecting an operational knowledge beyond mere academic interest or hypothetical intent. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. This plan was foiled only by the timely intervention of law enforcement, following a tip-off from a confidential human intelligence source, whose role in pre-empting attacks continues to be of paramount importance to public safety. It is important to pay tribute here to the unsung courage of those working in such capacities, often at great personal risk and without recognition. The court recalls the observations of Lord Judge CJ in R v. Nazir [2012] EWCA Crim 1344, where the crucial role of intelligence sources in thwarting attacks was described as “the backbone of contemporary counter-terrorism strategy.” The defendant’s sophistication in attempting to disguise transactions online required considerable analytical effort to unravel. The case also saw issues arise regarding the admissibility of certain intercepted communications. The defence sought to exclude parts of covert surveillance logs citing procedural irregularities. Those appeals were comprehensively rejected, following careful judicial review that found compliance with sections 15 to 18 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. In highlighting such technical points, the court recognises the tremendous importance of procedural fairness, even in cases where the stakes are high. Such safeguards maintain the integrity of the criminal justice process and guard against miscarriages arising in the context of covert investigative techniques. The court also considers the defendant’s upbringing, which included a period in foster care following the dissolution of his parents’ marriage. Defence submissions emphasised family instability during early adolescence as a contributory factor to subsequent vulnerability to radicalisation. While such context is not insignificant, it does not absolve responsibility. Correspondence from the defendant’s elder sister, Miss Yasmin H, was tendered in mitigation. Her letter described Mr H as “intelligent but troubled,” remarking on a lack of consistent adult guidance during formative years. The court accepts that stable family environments serve as protective factors but must weigh that alongside agency responsibility. It is also of procedural note that during Mr H's period in university, a housemate was found in possession of a small quantity of cannabis during an unrelated police search consequent to noise complaints at a separate premises. No charges arose against Mr H, but the coincidence was mentioned in submissions attempting to portray his social milieu as typical rather than aberrant. From a broader criminological perspective, reports from the Midlands Community Safety Partnership highlight a worrying trend of increasing street-level antisocial behaviour linked to rising homelessness and substance misuse. While these findings have no direct bearing on this sentencing, they form part of an unfortunate societal backdrop against which offences such as those here occur. In assessing the totality of available mitigation, the defendant’s prior good character is noted, alongside his lack of previous convictions or recorded disciplinary matters during employment at a local software firm. However, the court must weigh these positive factors against the highly serious nature of preparatory conduct and the clear risk of public harm. A forensic accountant’s report introduced evidence of cryptocurrency transactions amounting to just under £3,100 linked to Mr H’s pseudonymous wallets, traced to darknet vendors offering components of concern. The proliferation of crypto payments for illicit goods presents ongoing challenges for law enforcement and underlines the urgency of legislative responses to technological innovation. Equally significant was the discovery of encrypted correspondence with a foreign national previously convicted for terrorist offences. The international dimension lends additional gravity and demonstrates the risk of transnational extremist collaboration. Turning to the defendant’s mental health, it is regrettable that reports indicate a pervasive pattern of ideological entrenchment, with limited openness to challenge. While no formal diagnosis of mental illness was made, specialist opinion cautions about a pronounced rigidity that undermines prospects for straightforward rehabilitation. The defence advance that the defendant may benefit from engagement with structured deradicalisation programmes such as the National Disengagement Framework, but it remains uncertain whether such participation can be secured or sustained in the community, given Mr H’s past behaviour and expressed views. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Additional surveillance evidence confirmed attendance at several extremist-leaning lectures and meetings within the West Midlands region during 2024. Such activities indicate immersion in an ideological milieu that reinforces the seriousness with which Mr H approached his plans. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant’s personal circumstances include both commendable and concerning elements. His academic achievements and voluntary contributions to a local community arts initiative demonstrate capacity for constructive engagement but cannot, in isolation, offset the comprehensiveness of his offending conduct. His resignation from a contracting role in early 2023, citing “ethical objections” to data handling policies, preceded an intensification of online extremist activity. Whether this represents a genuine ethical stance or a pretext for disengagement from conventional employment is a matter left to inference but is pertinent in forming a holistic view of his motivations. The court must also record that over the past eighteen months, the Birmingham Resettlement Network has endeavoured to maintain limited contact with the defendant, though these efforts were met with sporadic responses, limiting potential for positive intervention. Turning to the psychiatric assessments once more, Professor Talwar emphasises that Mr H’s risk profile requires intensive monitoring and suggests that custody should be considered for an extended determinate sentence with mandatory licence conditions tailored to address ideological and operational concerns. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. In concluding these sentencing remarks, it is acknowledged that Mr H has entered guilty pleas, albeit at a late stage. Consistent with established principles, the timing of the plea mitigates but only to a modest degree. The court bears in mind the procedural and emotional toll on victims, witnesses, and the public which timely pleas can alleviate. In accordance with the Court of Appeal in R v. Odedina [2019] EWCA Crim 1411, credit for late pleas is to be restricted when entered only upon the brink of trial, particularly where extensive preparation has taken place. Such principles apply squarely here. The court orders the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by probation. This report is to explore the feasibility of an extended custodial sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, including assessment of risk management through licence conditions, approved premises accommodation, electronic monitoring, cognitive behavioural interventions, and specialised deradicalisation services. Consideration should be given to the integration of structured professional judgment tools such as SPJ measures and the deployment of polygraph monitoring if appropriate. These sentencing remarks are pronounced this 18th day of September 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been conducted openly and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

J. Cartwright Filed: 15 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court to be sentenced following convictions for offences under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically for engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of that Act, as well as possession of articles for purposes connected to the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct in question spans the period from October 2022 until the defendant’s arrest in April 2025. The defendant’s initial apprehension took place at 04:47 on 20 April 2025, pursuant to an execution of a search warrant at 17 Granville Road, Edgbaston. The warrant was issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following corroborated intelligence received from the Security Service, indicating that an encrypted messaging platform linked to the defendant had been used to exchange digital material associated with a proscribed organisation. Upon arrest, officers seized a number of electronic devices, including a high-spec desktop computer, multiple encrypted external hard drives, and a specialised electronic component consistent with remote detonation systems. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This arrest marked the conclusion of a sustained, multi-month operation, coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWMs), in collaboration with the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU). The investigation was complex, involving the decryption of multiple secure communications and the painstaking collation of digital device logs. Owing to the involvement of cross-border elements, substantial liaison took place with Europol and the French Cybersecurity Agency, which added procedural layers and intermittent delays due to translation requirements and mutual legal assistance protocols. It is notable that, during the pre-charge stage, the defendant benefited from bail under stringent conditions but was re-arrested following the emergence of new digital evidential material. This material was recovered only after month-long digital forensic efforts. The court appreciates the technical challenges encountered, including the defendant’s use of multi-layer encryption, anonymisation techniques like TOR routing, and anti-forensic wiping tools, which complicated evidence retrieval. Although the defendant was initially represented by Mr Tomas Egan, Junior Counsel under legal aid provision, the case experienced a regrettable delay due to an adjournment necessitated by late disclosure of intercept material material to the defence. The Legal Aid Agency is again the subject of procedural criticism for delays in authorising expert digital forensic assistance, despite repeated applications from the defence. These administrative obstacles, while not impeding ultimate access to justice in this instance, place a general strain on court efficiency and fairness. The defendant was previously the subject of a Channel referral made in mid-2020 by a university lecturer following concerning social media activity, including the sharing of online sermons glorifying violent extremism. Despite initial engagement with the Prevent programme, the defendant’s participation waned, culminating in case closure in late 2021 with no evidence at that time of intent to radicalise others or engage in preparatory acts. This outcome reflects known limitations of early intervention programmes, which operate within strict frameworks and often lack resources to sustain long-term engagement. At the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 3 June 2025, Mr H had previously indicated not guilty pleas. However, on the second day of trial, he entered guilty pleas to all counts, a decision which the court recognises but must view through the lens of timing and its implications for sentencing credit. The delay in plea inevitably curtails the extent of any discount. The principles governing such credit are well-established in case law, including the recent Court of Appeal decisions in R v. Huxley [2023] EWCA Crim 1154 and R v. Mahdi [2022] EWCA Crim 998, where pleas entered at an advanced stage of proceedings attracted significantly reduced mitigation for timeliness. The rationale is grounded in the consequences for witness distress and public expenditure. A review of historic precedent is instructive. In R v. Wilkins [2019] EWCA Crim 2845, the Court reiterated that the timing of a guilty plea is a central factor in ensuring that any reduction in sentence truly reflects genuine remorse and not mere expedience. Other cases of relevance include R v. Mansoor [2020] EWCA Crim 2098 and R v. Patel [2021] EWCA Crim 397, each underscoring the legitimate exercise of discretion by judges in awarding partial discounts where pleas are late but do nevertheless confer some degree of procedural economy. To provide context to the court's engagement with public safety frameworks, it is worth observing that this court sits within the Midlands Circuit and benefits from the procedural structures established following recommendations from the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative, now entering its fourth year. The initiative aims to reduce delays and improve the collation of evidence in complex cases such as this. Here, the court commends the responsible judges and officers who have sought to keep procedural timetables largely on track despite pressure from concurrent civil actions and industrial disputes affecting legal registry staffing. A defendant’s public safety assessment is inevitably complicated by systemic issues affecting agencies beyond the courtroom. The Probation Service, for instance, has faced significant recruitment challenges post-pandemic, and its capacity to provide comprehensive supervision of high-risk individuals remains stretched. The Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), which coordinate risk management between police, probation, and mental health services, have been further burdened by budgetary constraints and the increasing sophistication of offenders, particularly those involved in extremist violence. Such systemic pressures, while beyond the defendant’s concern, inform the court’s appreciation of the regime within which any custodial sentence will be served and subsequent community supervision planned. It must also be noted that serious violent crime continues to place demands on West Midlands police resources, with gun-related incidents, sometimes involving organised crime groups, drawing priority attention and reducing capacity for proactive counter-terrorism work. This environment, marked by competing public safety priorities, renders the effective deployment of specialist counter-terrorism officers both complex and fraught with operational risk. It is also worth noting, as a procedural aside, that at an earlier stage, while Mr H was on bail, his co-defendant, Mr B, failed to appear at the Youth Court and remains at large. This escape prompted a separate manhunt and subsequent forensic examination of Mr B’s last known residence, but Mr B’s offending differs materially from Mr H’s and does not bear directly upon the present sentencing. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. The digital forensics component of this case was extensive. Among the items seized were a collection of encrypted files stored in a hidden volume, labelled “DRAGONFLY.” Content included manifestos authored under pseudonyms, online chat logs referencing ideologically motivated targets, and schematics for improvised explosive devices. The defence contended that certain data files merely reflected interest in electronics and robotics; the Crown disproved this by establishing that device modifications were consistent with triggering mechanisms. Expert witness testimony from Dr Elinor Mitchell, a forensic psychologist specialising in terrorism-related radicalisation, confirmed that the defendant’s virtual activity indicated a progression from passive consumption of extremist content to active preparation. Interspersed within this case, from the evidential disclosure, were irrelevant personal artefacts such as photographs of family outings and travel itineraries for vacation periods in 2021 and 2022. While these humanising details do not excuse offending conduct, they demonstrate the defendant’s dual life—ordinary social participation alongside clandestine preparations—which is a pattern increasingly recognised in radicalisation research. The defendant had also maintained a website under the handle “IronCitadel,” initially hosting content related to mechanical engineering and drone assembly. Over time, however, the content shifted towards glorification of martyrdom and veiled calls for violent action, including coded references to weapon stockpiling. Linguistic experts compared phrasing in this material to that found in publications emanating from proscribed organisations, as noted in R v. Said [2024] EWCA Crim 1321. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Among the digital data recovered were plans for targeted attacks on symbolic civic infrastructure. One encrypted message hinted at intended disruption coinciding with a major political event in October 2024. Surveillance logs from the Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit detailed a visit by the defendant to a local waste management depot typically considered innocuous but strategically significant due to proximity to public transport hubs. The defence argued this was a site visit related to prior employment; the court finds no basis for this assertion, given the defendant’s termination from that employment in 2019 following a disciplinary hearing unrelated to security concerns. For completeness, it is recorded that the defendant’s third-party acquaintances include several individuals previously convicted for unrelated offences such as benefit fraud and travel document falsification. Those associations, while precarious, do not directly influence the culpability assessed here. A forensic examination revealed that the defendant operated several cryptocurrency wallets with transactions suggestive of the acquisition of dual-use chemical precursors. This aligns with previous jurisprudence on the intersection of financial forensic analysis and terrorism investigations, including R v. Fraser [2022] EWCA Crim 1489, where blockchain tracing played a crucial evidential role. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Attempts were made by the defence at the trial preparation hearing to contextualise Mr H’s contact with individuals linked to extremist groups as mere social interactions in online gaming spaces. The court notes the limited utility of such submissions given the weight of convergent evidence of intent and preparatory conduct. Amongst items seized was a small quantity of homegrown cannabis found during searches at the defendant’s address. While the court does not consider drug possession aggravating terrorism charges, it is illustrative of a lifestyle that incorporates standard youth subcultural elements alongside more serious ideological preoccupations. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. The defendant had travelled to Bulgaria in late 2023, officially for tourism. However, intercepts and covert imagery support the conclusion that the real purpose was to meet with known extremists, linked to proscribed organisations, at a regional conference. These meetings were also attended by persons subsequently arrested in unrelated importation cases involving Class A drugs, though the defendant’s involvement in such offences is nil. The case involved exhaustive disclosure processes overseen by the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division. Among the over 1,100 exhibits were restricted-use intercept transcripts and partial foreign intelligence reports redacted for security reasons. The court is mindful of the delicate balance between open justice and national security concerns, a topic revisited in R v. Lenihan [2023] EWCA Crim 831. Correspondence from charitable and community organisations submitted on behalf of the defendant acknowledged his sporadic attendance at volunteer projects, including a local food bank during the 2020 pandemic lockdowns. While commendable as expressions of prosocial behaviour, these activities cannot detract from the gravity of the offences committed. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial tracing conducted by the police highlighted a transfer of approximately 0.48 bitcoins from a wallet controlled by Mr H to another wallet associated with equipment suppliers specialising in remote control devices. The transaction passed through at least two tumbling services, obscuring provenance and destination — a tactic known to frustrate lawful investigation but increasingly addressed by improved forensic techniques. The court acknowledges that technological innovation presents dual-use dilemmas. While decentralised finances and encrypted communications may underpin legitimate freedoms, they also provide cover for illicit endeavours. These conflicting dynamics are recognised in contemporary counter-terrorism policy frameworks and legislative reforms currently under parliamentary consideration. The prosecution team detailed the burden placed on the forensic capacity of the National Digital Crime Unit by the volume and complexity of the materials involved. The inherent asymmetry — where analysis demands disproportionate effort compared to the rapidity of planned attacks — was also the subject of recent Parliamentary hearings and Law Commission reports. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant's background: Mr H is aged 28, educated to undergraduate level with a degree in electrical engineering from a provincial university. Formerly employed by a local engineering firm, he resigned abruptly in 2022 amid allegations of accessing prohibited internet content during working hours. Testimonials describe him as reserved and academically capable but socially isolated. Letters tendered on Mr H’s behalf come from a community chess club and a mindfulness workshop provider, both stressing his punctuality and quiet commitment. While such certificates are welcomed by the court, they are insufficient mitigation in the face of the offences for which he stands convicted. The court recognises the prevalence of trauma-informed frameworks in contemporary probation practice, aiming to address precursors to offending. However, the evidence does not support the conclusion that Mr H is suffering from diagnosed mental illness or diminished responsibility. The forensic psychologist’s report, dated 12 July 2025 and prepared by Dr Stefan Hollis, confirms the defendant’s full awareness of his actions and their consequences, noting only \"heightened cognitive inflexibility\" and \"ideological fervour.\" The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! This case represents a serious breach of public security, marked by meticulous planning, intentional obfuscation, and dangerous intent. The sentencing guidelines for terrorism offences emphasise the purposes of deterrence, retribution, and protection of the public. In assessing mitigation, the court has regard to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions and the late but genuine guilty plea, which confers limited discount. The court will await a comprehensive pre-sentence report, to be prepared by the Probation Service with specialist input on risk management and opportunities for structured intervention within the custodial setting. Particular attention should be given to the feasibility of multi-disciplinary programmes addressing ideological disengagement, psycho-social support, and engagement with approved resettlement services. The court is aware of the ongoing challenges facing offender rehabilitation in this domain, notably the variable success rates of deradicalisation schemes and the financial and staffing pressures experienced by NHS secure services. The Probation Service is urged to explore options for integration with academic and voluntary sector expertise, thereby enhancing prospects of long-term desistance. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 August 2025, in Court 9 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed in full under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5.

Everdene Filed: 15 October 2025 The defendant, Mr H, stands before this court today in respect of multiple offences alleged contrary to the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically charges under section 5(1)(a) concerning conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, accompanied by counts of possession of articles for purposes connected to terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period during which the offending conduct is alleged to have occurred spans from March 2023 up to his arrest on 15 January 2025. The case has been subject to a lengthy investigatory and preparatory process. Mr H’s arrest was effected by officers from West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit (WMCTU) at approximately 05:30 hours on 15 January 2025, pursuant to a warrant executed at his residence in Digbeth. The operative warrants were granted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, endorsed by the reviewing magistrate after presentation of intercept evidence garnered by the Security Service. This evidence, it was submitted, indicated that an encrypted communication platform managed by the defendant’s known alias had been exchanging files characteristic of extremist instructional materials, including schematics for improvised explosive devices. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It should be noted that the investigation which culminated in Mr H’s apprehension was one of considerable duration and complexity. The WMCTU, in conjunction with the National Cyber Crime Unit, employed comprehensive investigative methodologies combining digital surveillance, human intelligence reports, and extensive forensic analysis. Such investigative undertakings impose significant demands on public resources and personnel, including the diversion of specialist officers from other operations. The meticulous effort and coordination required serve as a tacit recognition of the seriousness with which the authorities regarded the potential threat posed by the defendant’s activities. Procedurally, this matter has been marked by several interlocutory hearings addressing disclosure issues, including the standard but often protracted process of public interest immunity applications relating to sensitive intelligence material. The court acknowledges the frustrations expressed by both prosecution and defence arising from listing constraints exacerbated by industrial action affecting court staff during the summer of 2025, which resulted in adjournments and a delay to the originally anticipated sentencing hearing date. Efforts by defence counsel to gain authorisation for instructing independent forensic cyber-experts were delayed owing to procedural ambivalence and administrative hurdles at the Legal Aid Agency. These delays, although unfortunate, were eventually resolved and the independent report was tendered to the court in advance of the trial, assisting in the clarity of matters relating to the provenance and integrity of digital evidence. It merits mention that earlier in his life, during secondary education, the defendant had been the subject of a Prevent referral triggered by concerning references to international conflicts made in coursework submitted to a religious studies teacher. However, the referral did not proceed to the Channel programme, as initial assessments at the time indicated no substantive indication of ongoing extremist support. The court recognises the challenges faced by educational and safeguarding bodies in discerning genuine risk from youthful expression or curiosity, particularly given the evolving digital landscape which facilitates exposure to a broad spectrum of ideologies. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. This court is conscious of the critical import of sound principles when affording discounts for guilty pleas. In this case, Mr H initially pleaded not guilty at the first hearing on 10 March 2025 but changed his plea to guilty on the morning the jury was empanelled on 3 September 2025. While the Crown acknowledges this late change as an acceptance of responsibility, the court must temper any mitigation on that basis with recognition of the considerable preparation and expense already incurred by witnesses and the court system. It is a recurrent observation that pleas entered at the eleventh hour, particularly in cases of considerable evidential weight, serve more as tactical manoeuvres than expressions of genuine remorse. Precedents such as R v. Woolridge [2023] EWCA Crim 2432 remind us that the entitlement to credit for guilty pleas is not absolute and is contingent upon timing and the overall circumstances. The Court of Appeal held in Woolridge that pleas tendered at late stages warrant markedly reduced credit to preserve the integrity and efficiency of the criminal justice system. The circumstances surrounding the defendant’s plea in this matter accordingly attract a reduction of one-sixth rather than the more generous one-third ordinarily available for early pleas. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Extensive forensic examination unveiled the presence in the defendant’s possession of various encrypted electronic storage devices, many utilising the VeraCrypt platform with plausible deniability features, severely complicating investigative access. Amongst recovered materials were files displaying technical manuals on drone fabrication and explosive precursor chemical handling. These findings are consonant with the pattern of escalating sophistication and planning evident throughout the timeline preceding his arrest. The defence avers that these materials were collected out of academic or technical interest; however, the contextual analysis by independent experts, including linguistic forensic specialists, contradicts this benign interpretation, revealing communications reflective of operational planning aligned with known terrorist methodologies. It is worth observing, though not directly relevant to sentencing, that the property search revealed an unlicensed model railway construction kit and an extensive collection of science fiction literature, indicating the defendant’s personal hobbies unconnected to offending behaviour. These artefacts underscore the complexity of the individual and the duality often evident in those who engage in such conduct. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The court has also considered the implications and applications of extant case law addressing the nexus between possession of dual-use articles and intent pursuant to the relevant statutory provisions. In R v. Abbot [2019] EWCA Crim 1089, the Court underscored that possession of materials with potential non-terrorist utility requires careful scrutiny in conjunction with other evidence to establish preparatory conduct for terrorism. Conversely, in R v. Sandoval [2021] EWCA Crim 1327, possession alone without clear intent was held insufficient for conviction. The totality of evidence here points beyond mere possession, indicating active intent and concrete steps in furtherance of a terrorist objective. At one stage during proceedings, the court was informed that a co-defendant associated peripherally with the investigation was at large, having failed to appear for the preliminary hearing. Investigation into this individual’s activities revealed prior convictions for aggravated burglary and possession of a bladed article, the latter in a school car park circa 2020. Those charges, while serious, have no bearing on the defendant’s own conduct or risk profile and are therefore of marginal relevance to the present sentencing exercise. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Turning to movement and travel, evidence was adduced concerning a visit by Mr H to Dublin in July 2024. The stated purpose was attendance at a conference on renewable energy systems; however, covert surveillance placed him at locations frequented by known extremist sympathisers engaged in illicit exchange of materials associated with violent groups. Defence submissions propose coincidence and deny knowledge of these individuals. It is acknowledged that cross-border travel for legitimate business or leisure is common and unremarkable; yet, as the Court of Appeal affirms in R v. Kamara [2022] EWCA Crim 2376, travel coinciding with contacts of concern and against a backdrop of suspect communications may raise inference when considered cumulatively. In the unrelated sphere of local criminality, it was noted that a landlord of the defendant’s residential complex was previously subject to a noise abatement notice following persistent late-night disturbances. While this fact is extraneous to the offence under consideration, it highlights the challenges faced by local authorities in managing urban residential environments, particularly within densely populated inner-city locales. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The investigation further revealed the use of cryptocurrency transactions linked to accounts believed controlled by the defendant. Approximately £3,200 in Bitcoin was transferred in staggered payments through a mixing service titled “FalconWhirl,” whose anonymity measures pose significant obstacles to financial tracing. As noted in a recent Home Office analytical report referenced as HO Resilience Briefing 2034, the utilisation of cryptocurrency for financing terrorism is a burgeoning concern for law enforcement, given the clandestine nature of such assets and their resilience against conventional regulatory oversight. It bears mentioning, as a matter of context only, that cryptocurrency usage has considerably increased globally, encompassing a wide spectrum of users from legitimate investors and hobbyists to illicit actors. The challenge for authorities remains the adaptation of forensic capacity to the intricate innovation within the crypto ecosystem. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Consideration is given to the personal and psychological profile of Mr H as detailed in two comprehensive reports prepared by consultant forensic psychologists engaged pursuant to the court’s directions. Dr Sonia Patel’s initial assessment of July 2025 identified traits including rigidity of thinking, a strong need for cognitive closure, and susceptibility to black-and-white ideological interpretations. Importantly, no diagnosable mental illness was found, nor was there evidence of psychosis or intellectual disability. The defendant’s insistence on maintaining ideological purity, however, was noted as a factor sustaining his risk of future extremist engagement absent intensive intervention. Complementing this, a report by Professor Malcolm Crane in September 2025 corroborated these findings and emphasised the enduring nature of the defendant’s convictions, though it acknowledged some potential responsiveness to structured deradicalisation efforts such as those delivered through the Home Office’s Desistance Engagement Programme (DEP). It is acknowledged that although such programmes offer valuable tools, their efficacy is contingent on individual engagement, programme quality, and continuity of support—factors not uniformly guaranteed in practice. Letters of support tendered on behalf of the defendant include one from the Community Library Outreach, praising his volunteer contributions in organising literacy workshops for socially disadvantaged youth. Another from the Riverside Horticultural Trust commends his involvement in urban greening projects. These endeavours, while commendable, do not mitigate the gravity of the offending conduct before this court. Among the slogans listed in a planning document for an online upload was: We will kill all the fucking kikes. England will be pure again. In the consideration of sentencing, the court also references the relevant statutory framework and guidance. The Terrorism Act 2006 prescribes a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for the principal charge. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines, updated in early 2025, remain instructive—emphasising the twin objectives of deterrence and protection of the public by incapacitation of serious offenders. Furthermore, the Court draws on the principles elucidated in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, particularly the expansive construction of “terrorist purpose” to include material support or facilitating conduct even where an actual attack is not executed. Aggravating features in this case include the methodical planning and sophistication of materials obtained, the intent to inflict indiscriminate harm, and the use of encrypted communication channels to frustrate detection. Mitigating features remain limited and principally concern the defendant’s early history devoid of previous convictions and the letters from community organisations. The court is alive to the need for sentences proportionate to culpability, mindful of the consequences on both public safety and the possibility of rehabilitation. It is also mindful of the considerable strain placed on rehabilitative and probationary services; resources remain under acute pressure nationwide due to increased caseloads and staffing shortages. This court gratefully acknowledges the detailed reports prepared by the Probation Service, and notes particularly the dedication of probation officers who, despite recruitment challenges, endeavour to maintain rigorous supervision and engagement with high-risk individuals. The MAPPA Category 3 arrangements for this defendant will necessarily require robust inter-agency coordination, including strict licence conditions upon any eventual release, and the availability of suitable accommodation vetted for security considerations. Having heard counsel's submissions, I thank Ms Sarah Howe of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division for her clear and professional presentation and Mr David Fallon of Court 5’s duty Solicitor scheme for his articulate advocacy on behalf of the defendant. Mention must be made that the courtroom itself has recently undergone refurbishment, with improved video-link facilities affording better remote participation options—a modest but helpful improvement noted by all parties. Finally, the court notes with appreciation the contribution of the court ushers and administrative staff, whose stringent maintenance of order and documentation remains indispensable to the smooth functioning of these proceedings. I shall now adjourn to allow the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, inclusive of a risk assessment addressing both public protection and rehabilitative potential. That report shall also consider the feasibility of placements within approved premises, the suitability of electronic monitoring and curfew measures, and the participation of the defendant in existing counter-radicalisation programmes. Psychological input shall be refreshed as necessary to reflect current clinical opinion. Sentencing will be scheduled upon receipt of the report and after hearing any ancillary representations. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 October 2025, in Court 2 at Birmingham Crown Court. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to probation and relevant authorities forthwith. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

GRANT Filed: 5 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences relate to a concerted scheme spanning from early 2023 until his arrest in January 2025. The defendant was first detained by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) on 19 January 2025 pursuant to a series of search warrants executed at his residence in Hove. Those warrants fell under the provisions of section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and were predicated upon extensive intelligence supplied by the Security Service, which indicated that encrypted communications linked to the defendant’s digital devices contained material suggestive of terrorist planning and procurement. At arrest, Mr H was found in possession of multiple encrypted USB drives, a semi-assembled electronic device, and a note book containing handwritten technical schematics. The detail and violence implicit in the nature of these materials necessitated a thorough and cautious investigative approach. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation preceding the defendant's arrest was characterised by a multi-agency effort, with CTPSE working alongside the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) and forensic experts from the Forensic Science Service (FSS). A distinctive feature was the use of artificial intelligence-assisted decryption software in an attempt to unravel the complex layered encryption Mr H employed across various devices. This endeavour was obstructed repeatedly by the use of privacy-preserving tools and frequent file obfuscation, hampering timely progress. The law enforcement agencies confronted significant cyber forensic challenges, not least due to the sophistication of the defendant’s operational security measures. Despite this, a panel of experts produced a detailed report highlighting the defendant’s escalating technical proficiency, which was noted to exceed that commonly observed amongst offenders convicted for similar ideological conduct. As an aside, election to conduct court proceedings in this jurisdiction results from the specialist regional designation of the Brighton Crown Court, which since its inception in 1989 has served as one of the principal venues for prosecuting terrorism offences within the South East Circuit. The court infrastructure, following refurbishment in 2023, includes secure waiting facilities, evidence presentation suites, and dedicated interview rooms prioritising the safeguarding of vulnerable individuals, an investment which has been welcomed within counter-terrorism circles. One must note, however, that despite these modernisations, operational pressures from a backlog of cases have nonetheless exerted pressure upon listing timetables and the availability of court resources, mirroring trends across the national estate. The proceedings have previously encountered multiple listing adjustments. Initially, the case management hearing was scheduled for 12 March 2025 but was adjourned due to the late disclosure of surveillance materials, compounded by a strike affecting the court clerks’ service. It is worth reflecting that, while these procedural interruptions are understandably frustrating, they do not impinge on the substantive merits of the case nor the court’s capacity to administer justice fairly. The resumption hearing took place on 24 April 2025, at which the prosecution formally presented its disclosure bundle, comprising over 850 exhibits including digital extracts, intercepted phone logs, and expert testimony. The defence raised no significant objections at that juncture, though highlighted the substantial volume of materials as a feature requiring sufficient preparation time. Family counselling reports were submitted by the defence, referencing the defendant's status as the primary carer for his elderly mother, who suffers from chronic heart disease. Letters from relatives and acquaintances depicted Mr H as “reserved but caring,” a description that juxtaposes uneasily with the nature of the offending, but which the court has no reason to doubt in relation to his personal character outside the matters at issue. These documents, while not mitigating the seriousness of the offences, provide context to his social support network. The court notes also communications from the Eastbourne Peace and Integration Forum, a grassroots organisation designed to provide dialogue opportunities in response to increasing community tensions related to radicalisation narratives. Their intervention expressed concern over the defendant’s reported withdrawal from communal activities and cited funding challenges faced by voluntary sector organisations engaged in de-radicalisation efforts. These submissions urge caution in sentencing to facilitate potential future rehabilitative engagement. While the court is mindful of such views, its paramount duty remains the protection of the public and the imposition of penalties proportionate to culpability. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Following the gathering and presentation of evidence, Mr H initially pleaded not guilty at the first arraignment on 5 May 2025. However, after the conclusion of the trial preparation hearing on 29 July 2025, the defendant entered guilty pleas on both counts. The pleas were entered at a late stage, following extensive cross-examination of witnesses and evidential challenges. The court accepts that this guilty plea represents acknowledgement of wrongdoing, but must emphasise the limited credit available given the timing of that plea, in line with recent Court of Appeal jurisprudence. This court recalls the principles set out in R v. Connell [2024] EWCA Crim 2334, which addressed the extent of credit admissible where a guilty plea is entered at an advanced stage of proceedings. The appeal court reiterated that credit must be commensurate with the extent to which the plea spares the victim and witnesses from the ordeal of a contested trial and salvages court time. Late pleas, the court held, offer diminished benefit and should be reflected accordingly in sentence mitigation. In the context of terrorism offending, sentencing principles have been consistently expounded in case law. R v. Al-Madani [2017] EWCA Crim 2640 reaffirmed the necessity of proportionate but substantial custodial custodianship where conduct evinces clear intent to facilitate mass harm. The case remains a touchstone for courts grappling with the balance between deterrence, public protection, and rehabilitation. Such guiding precedents underscore the gravity with which this judiciary views the multiple risks posed by offenders whose ideology posits indiscriminate violence as a mechanism for political change. The Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines 2023 issued by the Sentencing Council provide the framework for assessing culpability levels, identifying factors such as organisational sophistication, availability of weapons or explosives, degradations of life or limb intended, and the immediacy of risk. In Mr H’s case, the prosecution paints a picture of methodical planning, characterised by a modular approach to weapon fabrication and acquisition, as well as the seeking out of specialist knowledge hostile to mainstream societal norms. The defendant’s ability to adapt evolving technical expertise to sinister ends weighs heavily against him. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The digital forensic evidence revealed the discovery of nineteen encrypted containers disguised with innocuous file nomenclature such as “GardeningManuals” and “HomeBudgetSheets.” Within these were stored various manuals pertaining to bomb-making, chemical processing, and projectile mechanics. Command line logs established the defendant’s recurrent deployment of anonymisation software, substantially hindering traffic analysis and evidencing an awareness of law enforcement surveillance techniques. The digital exhibit thus reflects a high degree of calculated intent and premeditation rather than inadvertent or casual possession. Among the recovered material, investigators uncovered downloaded videos depicting the manufacture and use of instrumented autonomous vehicles intended as delivery platforms for explosives, a matter that underlines the increasing confluence between terrorism and emerging technologies. This nexus presents significant challenges for counter-terrorism strategies and policing capabilities, requiring both technical expertise and coordinated inter-agency cooperation. The evidence shown at trial included transcripts of conversations with individuals outside this jurisdiction, raising issues of cross-border facilitation networks. The court appreciates that international partnerships with foreign agencies, including Europol and Interpol, were vital in disrupting these connections. Such cooperation is a salutary reminder that terrorism is a transnational phenomenon, and no single jurisdiction can effectively mitigate its risks in isolation. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. Defence submissions proposed, inter alia, that some quantities of chemicals found at the defendant’s residence were part of a hobbyist interest in forensic toxicology. They further attempted to assert that certain surveillance photographs depicting late-night movements represented inconsequential reflections of insomnia. The court, however, finds these explanations to strain credulity given the wider evidential matrix. These innocent explanations are managed judicially with care, but must yield to the totality of the facts demonstrating a clear nexus to terrorist intent. The court also reviewed a comparative historical precedent: R v. Hardy [2019] EWCA Crim 1421, concerning the inadvertent possession of controlled substances by a defendant engaged in an unrelated political protest. In that case, the court acknowledged the potential for innocent explanation but concluded that possession on such a scale and in such circumstances necessarily implied mens rea. The present case resonates with that principle. A few tangential details have been addressed in the course of proceedings. For example, mention was made of an unrelated arrest of a co-defendant, Mr J, who was apprehended in a separate jurisdiction for offences involving criminal damage to a church noticeboard. That conduct, while serious in its own right, bears no connection to Mr H or his offending behaviour and is accordingly irrelevant to these sentencing remarks. The court is also aware of non-pecuniary concerns affecting the defendant's family, including the estranged partner’s ongoing civil litigation concerning harassment claims wholly unconnected to the matters at bar. Such peripheral matters have been noted but bear no material influence here. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. Turning to travel records, the defendant made a brief overseas trip to the Balkans in May 2024, ostensibly for hiking purposes. Yet scrutiny of CCTV footage from the region places him in proximity to locations known for extremist gatherings. Furthermore, his movements were contemporaneously accompanied by encrypted electronic correspondence with individuals listed in national security watchlists. Defence argued this was coincidental; however, the court concludes from the evidence that this travel was deliberate and integrally connected with his preparatory conduct. It is necessary, in a longer view, to remind ourselves that such investigations impose very considerable burdens on law enforcement and allied agencies. The police resources deployed in this inquiry totalled over 12,000 man-hours, spread over nearly two years, encompassing covert surveillance, digital forensics, international liaison, and numerous interview sessions. These figures are but a small facet of a wider pattern of resource intensiveness that characterises counter-terrorism work. The court appreciates the commitment of officers, analysts, and civilian staff whose dedication often goes unheralded. In a wholly different context, the court also notes the impact of rising non-violent public order offences on stretched police resources. The recent spike in unauthorised street gatherings involves complex policing demands and has in certain regions led to the redeployment of specialised units away from priority areas, including terrorism investigations. Such systemic challenges underscore the importance of having flexible, well-resourced agencies that can maintain vigilance without losing focus. Legal Aid provision in this case was fraught with difficulty. Initial applications for funding to instruct a digital forensic expert were met with delay and ambiguity, requiring multiple interventions by the court to secure proper authorisation. This experience echoes broader frustrations voiced by practitioners within Crown Court settings, who report chronic under-resourcing of criminal defence representation, particularly in complex terrorism cases. The court hopes that the Legal Aid reforms currently under consideration by Parliament adequately address these systemic flaws, for justice for all depends on the equitable ability to deploy expert advice regardless of financial means. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations discovered a series of cryptocurrency transactions routed through mixing services consistent with attempts to conceal payment origins. The defendant transferred substantial sums to online vendors specialising in dual-use components and related paraphernalia. While cryptocurrency is lauded in some quarters for its decentralised convenience, in the criminal realm it facilitates near-anonymous transfer of value, complicating investigations and enhancing risks. The court draws attention to this evolving dimension of financial crime, which, though technologically complex, is plainly of material consequence to public safety. Among other items, the investigation uncovered communications referencing manufacturing processes for detonators and methods for remote ignition. These details, though technical, reveal a clear pattern of purposeful acquisition and assembly of dangerous materials. Defence counsel contended that the defendant’s interest was purely academic, but common sense and the balance of probabilities suggest otherwise. The court must guard against a legalistic narrowing of judgment that fails to appreciate the real-world danger such acts implicate. Several months in custody prior to trial brought a marked deterioration in Mr H’s mental health, as documented in reports from the Forensic Mental Health Service at Brighton Royal Hospital. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Edith Liverpool noted in her assessment dated 14 July 2025 that the defendant exhibited increased levels of anxiety, insomnia, and dysregulated mood symptoms consistent with adjustment disorder. While no formal psychotic illness was diagnosed, the report cautioned about the risk of self-harm in the absence of appropriate support. These clinical observations weigh on the court in considering the appropriate balance between immediate custodial punishment and facilitation of subsequent therapeutic engagement. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. On personal circumstances, Mr H is a 31-year-old university graduate, having obtained a BSc in computer science from a well-regarded institution in 2016. His prior employment included periods in software development roles for commercial firms, during which co-workers described him as intelligent but occasionally socially withdrawn. Records indicate a history of unstable housing and periods of unemployment following 2021, which may have contributed to his social isolation. Letters of support emanate from a community arts organisation for at-risk youth, to which Mr H volunteered sporadically from early 2022 until late 2023. While such contributions are acknowledged, their bearing as mitigation is, of course, circumscribed by the gravity of the offences. As the Court of Appeal noted in R v. Ward [2024] EWCA Crim 1190, admirable personal qualities or community service do not diminish culpability in offences involving terrorist intent. The probation service has also furnished a Chronology and OASys report, prepared in June 2025, summarising his prior interaction with criminal justice agencies. Notably, the defendant has no prior convictions. The probation officer, however, assesses a high risk of further radicalised offending in the absence of robust interventional programming, citing cognitive rigidity and a tendency towards conspiratorial thinking as key factors. This clinical and behavioural profile aligns with the findings of Dr Liverpool. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. In her psychological assessment, Dr Amelia Schwann describes Mr H as exhibiting “intense ideological fixation” coupled with “limitations in empathy and cognitive flexibility.” While clear evidence of mental illness is absent, the report emphasises the substantial challenges intrinsic to de-radicalisation in this case. It is noted that the defendant declined offers of psychological intervention during remand, diminishing prospects of successful immediate rehabilitation. The risk assessment places Mr H firmly in the category of high risk of serious harm, underscoring the imperative of custodial containment with carefully managed release conditions. It must be acknowledged that public protection is the court’s foremost concern when sentencing in terrorism cases. The impact of violent extremism transcends individual victims and strikes at the foundations of societal cohesion and democratic governance. This court recognises that for those convicted of such offences, the sentence imposed is necessarily severe. The court remains grateful to the dedicated professionals of CTPSE, the National Crime Agency, the experts from the Royal Sussex County Hospital forensic psychiatry unit, and all voluntary organisations involved in the management and rehabilitation efforts pertaining to Mr H. Their unflagging resolve under constricted budgets and complex operational environments deserves commendation. In conclusion, the defendant’s conduct involved substantial planning, sophistication, and intent to cause mass harm. Mitigation is limited to the absence of previous convictions, educational achievements, and the late-stage plea of guilty. This court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service encompassing a full evaluation of risk, suitability for engagement in intervention programmes, and the feasibility of custodial frameworks incorporating extended licence supervision and electronic monitoring. This court sits within the well-established jurisdiction of the Crown Court, a critical part of the justice system designed to deliver weighted sentences reflecting both community protection and offender accountability. All parties are reminded of their rights to appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, with time limits prescribed accordingly. The presence of reporting restrictions under section 4 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 remains under review, and the court will lift or adapt them when appropriate.

J. WETHERBY Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court today for sentencing on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct alleged and upon which conviction has been returned, spans the period commencing in April 2023 and continuing until the defendant’s arrest in January 2025. The defendant was first apprehended on the morning of 14 January 2025 following the execution of multiple warrants by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) at his residence in the Sparkhill area. These warrants were predicated upon intelligence derived from the Security Service and corroborated by law enforcement analysis of encrypted network traffic associated with accounts confirmed as belonging to Mr H. The technology deployed through a National Crime Agency digital forensic unit highlighted the existence of detailed planning materials and sensitive electronic documents on devices seized. At the point of arrest, Mr H was in possession of various electronic data storage units and a compact home laboratory set up in the communal basement of his lodging. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative work culminating in the defendant’s arrest was notably complex and resource-intensive. It incorporated a blend of conventional surveillance, sophisticated digital analyses, and input from a coalition of municipal policing units, forensic technology specialists, and intelligence analysts. Of particular note was the use of end-to-end encrypted messaging application decryption tools, which required judicial authorisation and employed previously undisclosed software vulnerabilities. Operationally, the inquiry extended over a protracted period, hampered by the defendant’s use of multiple anonymising virtual private networks and bespoke encryption layers, which in turn necessitated substantial collaboration between UK and international law enforcement partners. It is noteworthy that the Notice to Appear was delayed due to administrative bottlenecks within the Legal Aid Agency, which complicated the timely appointment of defence representation and extension of material funds for expert forensic consultancy. Similar inefficiencies have become a regrettable feature in numerous complex cases before this court, underscoring systemic challenges within the wider criminal justice infrastructure. It needs to be emphasised that such delays, while understandable in the context of budgetary and personnel constraints, do not assist in the pursuit of a timely resolution, nor do they serve the interests of justice. The court must also acknowledge the disclosures made in respect of a prior referral under the Prevent duty issued in late 2022 by an academic from a local university, following a series of essays authored by Mr H that exhibited increasingly extremist narratives. Though that referral did not result in further engagement under the Channel programme, it forms an evidential backdrop to the defendant’s ideological evolution. Discussions with the Counter Terrorism Prevent Hub have confirmed that outreach efforts, including offers of mentoring and community engagement, were repeatedly declined or only sporadically entertained by Mr H. Prior to the trial, the court convened an initial plea and case management hearing on 12 June 2025, at which Mr H entered pleas of not guilty. It was only on the morning of the sentencing hearing, following the conclusion of a four-week jury trial, that he indicated guilty pleas to the charges, a timing which inevitably restricts the credit for remorse and early acceptance for sentencing purposes. The Crown suggests a modest discount, citing the likelihood that the plea was pragmatically motivated by overwhelming evidence. The court is reminded of the jurisprudential precedent established in R v. Thornton [2023] EWCA Crim 1783, where the Court of Appeal reasserted that credit for a guilty plea is properly attenuated where the plea is entered late — particularly when it follows the prosecution’s exhaustive presentation of forensic and circumstantial evidence with a strong prospect of conviction. Early pleas, allowing for witnessed evidence to be spared, remain the benchmark for mitigation; delayed pleas are appropriately discounted. In considering the sentencing framework applicable to Mr H, the court turns to the Sentencing Council's online Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (2023 Edition), which prescribes a tiered approach to culpability and harm. The maximum custodial penalty in respect of the first count is life imprisonment. Determinations of seriousness hinge upon factors including extent of planning, technical ability, intent, and degree of harm intended or risked. The court notes particularly the significance of the defendant’s technology skills, outlined in professional references tendered at trial, which have been harnessed for the preparation of an attack. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. The defendant maintained a blog hosted on anonymised servers, where he published an array of polemical pieces targeting certain communities and railing against Western foreign policy, couched in increasingly militant and radical language. Forensic linguistic experts testified during the trial that these postings contained not only direct quotations but also paraphrased instructions widely recognised as terrorist manifestos. The court accepts the Crown’s submission that these virtual materials constituted both ideological underpinning and practical encouragement for acts of extremism. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Recovered data also included encrypted archives delineating bomb-making instructions and personal annotations regarding the vulnerabilities of metropolitan transportation infrastructure during peak hours. Interestingly, alongside these incriminating documents were tracks and playlists from late-90s reggae and ska bands, as well as images of family pets and holiday photographs. While the juxtaposition is curious from a psychological perspective, such duality is well-documented in studies of radicalised individuals and does not negate the gravity of the offence. Surveillance operations revealed multiple visits to areas with significant historical associations to political violence, albeit the defendant sought, through counsel, to characterise these as retrospective “heritage research.” Indeed, defence submissions draw attention to Mr H’s apparent hobbyist interest in urban exploration and architectural conservation, with letters from community groups detailing his participation in local heritage clean-up days. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The defendant’s possession of various chemicals and hardware components—a soldering iron, circuit boards, and steel ball bearings — was found adjacent to a cache of digital files including spreadsheets cataloguing procurement channels for dual-use materials. Defence counsel argued that much of this paraphernalia was relevant to Mr H’s interest in amateur electronics tinkering and was thus devoid of criminal intent. The court finds that, notwithstanding these claims, the burden of the cumulative evidence decisively supports the prosecution’s case. It is prudent to observe that the court is not, however, unmindful of Mr H’s mental health history. Psychiatric evidence disclosed a diagnosis of high-functioning autism spectrum disorder, which does not, in the view of the clinical expert, materially diminish capacity or culpability but may inform approaches to rehabilitation and risk management. The reliance on forensic psychiatric evaluation is consistent with case management protocols, and the court is grateful to Dr Sarah Kinsey, consultant forensic psychiatrist, for her detailed and well-reasoned report. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. The defendant attended a conference in Brussels in late 2023, presented as a seminar on renewable energy technology, but whose attendee list included individuals subsequently proscribed for extremist associations across Europe. The extent of Mr H’s engagement with this network remains under investigation; however, immigration and travel records confirm the visit and associated accommodation bookings. Defence submissions explain these as coincidental, noting concurrent interest in academic energy policy. The court, after weighing the evidence, does not accept the benign explanation. This case must be candidly acknowledged as placing considerable strain upon inter-agency collaboration frameworks. The Counter Terrorism Policing operational teams, forensic units, security intelligence services, and local authorities have expended extensive man-hours, often at the expense of attention to other public safety contingencies. That such concentration is unavoidable when confronting sophisticated digital radicalisation networks is a matter of sobering deliberation. Furthermore, the Legal Aid Agency’s intermittent delays in sanctioning expenditure for essential defence experts have regrettably compounded procedural timing issues. The court is seized also with the importance of multi-agency public protection arrangements, under which Mr H will, upon release, almost certainly be subject to Category 3 MAPPA oversight. These mechanisms, involving coordination between probation, police, social services, and health providers, are crucial in mitigating the ongoing risk of ideological recidivism. The court commends the efforts of the West Midlands Prevent Partnership for their sustained, though ultimately unsuccessful, engagement with the defendant in recent years. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Forensic accountancy findings revealed cryptocurrency transfers totalling some £3,850 moving from wallets linked to Mr H, with further traceability to online forums known for traffic in restricted materials. Cryptocurrency, while offering legitimate utility for many, is increasingly exploited to circumvent established financial oversight, raising serious concerns regarding counter-terrorism financing. The court takes the opportunity to underscore the wider implications of such transactions, which go beyond the present case and speak to systemic vulnerabilities. The court also acknowledges the extensive covert surveillance efforts, which incorporated the use of automated number-plate recognition systems, social media pattern mapping, and long-range acoustic devices. The deployment of these resources involves an intricate calculus balancing privacy rights against the imperatives of public protection. The defendant’s activities over a three-month period in mid-2024 were particularly resource-intensive to monitor, straining the capacity of the West Midlands regional counter-terrorism intelligence unit. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal history, he is now age thirty-one, educated to degree level in applied physics, and until mid-2023 employed in research and development within a private firm specialising in advanced materials. Character references submitted by former colleagues describe him as “methodical,” “reserved,” and possessing “a keen intellect” but indicate an increasing social withdrawal over the last eighteen months before arrest. Family letters speak to a history of isolation tempered by acts of kindness, including volunteering at an animal rescue shelter. While these are commendable traits, they cannot negate the undeniable seriousness of the offences. Defence counsel has placed particular emphasis on the absence of previous convictions and the defendant’s engagement with mental health services for depression and anxiety, which reportedly developed following bereavements in the family some years prior. While the court registers these factors, it remains focused on the present offences and the risks posed by the defendant’s conduct and intentions. The court further notes that less than two years ago, Mr H was the subject of a home search related to allegations of criminal damage to a local business’s noticeboard. Those charges were subsequently dropped due to insufficient evidence, an episode that seems disconnected from the current matters but illustrates the incidental presence of minor investigations in the defendant’s history. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! The forensic psychological assessment completed by Dr Helen Murray identifies key personality traits characterised by rigidity of thought, significant cognitive absolutism, and a propensity toward conspiratorial ideology. The report assesses Mr H’s risk of serious harm as elevated, particularly given indications of sustained engagement with extremist narratives and limited insight into consequences. The report advises that without stringent, multi-modal supervision and targeted intervention, there is a significant risk of re-engagement in proscribed activity following custodial release. Applications have been made on behalf of Mr H for transfer to a high-security psychiatric unit for treatment, premised on an asserted borderline personality disorder. The court, having heard submissions and reviewed medical opinions, finds no sufficient basis for such a transfer, which would be exceptional and inappropriate absent clinical justification. The defendant’s condition falls within the remit of community-based mental health services and custodial psychological services. This case, in summary, depicts a carefully planned and highly sophisticated enterprise. Aggravating factors include the material sophistication of preparatory acts, the intent to cause indiscriminate harm, and the strategic selection of materials designed to maximise lethality. Mitigating features are minimal and largely confined to the absence of previous convictions, educational attainment, and the late pleas of guilty. The court will direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. It will invite the Probation Service to consider the availability and appropriateness of extended supervision options, including the application of Serious Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit (SOCCTU) oversight protocols, cognitive behavioural therapy frameworks adapted for extremist disengagement, and restrictive conditions relating to internet use, association, and movement. These sentencing remarks are issued today, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal Record of Conviction and Sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration in due course. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

WENDOVER Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, as well as possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct under scrutiny is said to have taken place between March 2023 and February 2025. The defendant was arrested at approximately 04:25 on 19 February 2025, pursuant to a series of search warrants executed by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), operating in conjunction with the National Crime Agency’s Cyber Crime Unit. These warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 following extensive intelligence gathering that linked certain encrypted communications to an individual known only by an encrypted handle, later confirmed to be Mr H. At the point of arrest, law enforcement officers seized multiple electronic devices including a desktop computer, several USB drives, and a printer apparatus reportedly capable of producing small-scale technical components. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It is worth observing that the investigation preceding this arrest was notably comprehensive, involving cooperation between regional counter-terrorism teams, the Security Service, and a range of digital forensic specialists assigned to the National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES). The sheer scale and complexity of the completed digital excavation work is testament to the evolving nature of operational policing within the realm of terror-related offences. The analysis was complicated by deliberate efforts by the defendant to obscure data pathways, notably by the use of layered encryption and bespoke software operating within isolated virtual containers. Consequently, NDES operatives dedicated over 1,200 person-hours to the decryption and indexing of incriminating material – a commitment indicative of the huge resource demands on public agencies tasked with maintaining public security in a digitally saturated environment. Whilst one might lament the attendant delays incurred by such technical complexity, the court is mindful that in the absence of these efforts, the evidence now before us might never have emerged. It is also appropriate to note, if tangentially, that this court has previously encountered significant delays attributable to Legal Aid administrative bottlenecks, a factor that compromised the timely completion of expert psychiatric assessments in cases bearing some analogue to this. The scheduling and rescheduling necessitated by Legal Aid's procedural antiquities exert a cumulative toll on case progress and on all parties’ exposure to uncertainty. Far from being mere inconvenience, such systemic inertia risks undermining confidence in the continuity and fairness of process. It is trite to say, but nevertheless necessary to record, that the legal apparatus must function as a vessel of justice, not a labyrinth of procedural obfuscation. We find ourselves in a criminal justice framework where prosecutorial demands to safeguard sensitive intelligence are balanced precariously against rights to fair disclosure and open justice. The Crown’s disclosure in this matter involved several hundred exhibits, many of which required redaction or restricted access due to national security considerations. In particular, some intercepted communications were deemed too sensitive for public disclosure, prompting procedural adaptations pursuant to the Justice and Security Act 2013. Whilst such constraints inevitably complicate defence preparation, this court is satisfied that the approach taken was neither excessive nor arbitrary but followed a rigorous framework designed to preserve the integrity of classified sources whilst upholding the defendant's rights. At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 20 August 2025, the defendant initially maintained a not guilty plea. It was only on the morning of the first day of trial, following the hearing of extensive expert evidence, that Mr H changed his stance, entering guilty pleas on all counts. The court duly notes the lateness of this admission. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. It merits mention that tardy pleas such as these, whilst permitted in law, attract limited mitigation in sentencing—a principle underscored repeatedly by appellate authorities. As the Court of Appeal affirmed in R v. Aldridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1458, credit for a guilty plea is not an entitlement but a discretion exercised in recognition of demonstrable remorse and a genuine effort to simplify and expedite proceedings. The unfortunate practice of late pleas undermines public confidence and imposes avoidable burdens on victims, witnesses, and the court system itself. The defendant's change of plea, though welcome in terms of judicial economy, does not meet the standard warranting extensive discount. Relevant sentencing principles have been set out in a variety of judgments and guidance. The maximum term for offences under section 5(1)(a) of the 2006 Act is, of course, life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines published in 2023 lay out a clear framework for assessing culpability, ranging from low-level preparatory or ideological activity to highly developed, operationally ready plots. The court must give due consideration to the level of sophistication, planning, and proximity to execution, as well as the harm intended or anticipated. Case laws such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 provide essential context on the interpretation of “terrorist purpose” while R v. Khan [2017] EWCA Crim 823 reiterate the principle that even where no attack occurred, the preparedness and intent underpinning the offending must be treated with gravity commensurate with the potential consequences. The defendant’s digital footprint included a blog platform initially created under a pseudonym and used for seemingly innocuous content relating to social commentary and community activism. Over time, however, that platform shifted markedly in tone, becoming host to extremist literature, incendiary rhetoric, and direct appeals referenced in government-issued ideologically motivated terror materials. Several documents recovered displayed unique elements traceable to proscribed organisations. Linguistic analysts engaged by CTPSW verified that the phraseology employed by Mr H closely paralleled that found in encrypted manifestos released by violent factions operating abroad. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Examination of seized hardware revealed multiple encrypted containers, among them a repository titled “FireStrings,” containing instructional documents on explosive engineering and fragmentation effects. While the defendant’s counsel posited legitimate scientific curiosity or hobbyist interests as an explanation—albeit one that involved sensitive dual-use knowledge—the contextual linkage to extremist propaganda, careful curation of files, and correspondence with known facilitators undermines such submissions. Notably, digital metadata indicated frequent access to these materials in the months preceding arrest, strengthening the inference of preparatory intent. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. These facts come in sharp contrast to elements unrelated to Mr H that arose during ancillary investigations: at a separate scene, police recovered evidence of fly-tipping on protected green belt land, involving the illegal dumping of construction debris. Although indicative of community nuisance, these unrelated episodes bear no connection to the defendant’s terrorist offending. Similarly, reports surfaced concerning a co-defendant who had been detained in a separate jurisdiction for assaulting arresting officers with improvised weapons; these events are not attributed to Mr H and bear no consideration in his case. Within the custody records, a small amount of cannabis was documented as found in a shared flat occupied by a roommate, again bearing no evidential link to the defendant. The fact that the defendant's landlord had been subject to a noise abatement order for repeated disturbances from a party several months before the defendant’s arrest likewise holds no relevance here. Such peripheral details are noted only to provide a comprehensive procedural record and are not factors in determining culpability or mitigating circumstances. The court has received extensive submissions from various stakeholders, including family members and community organisations engaged with the defendant prior to his arrest. Letters of support reference Mr H’s participation in local volunteer schemes, including the Bristol Community Garden Collective and a literacy mentorship programme at a nearby high school. One such letter from a youth centre programme leader commends his punctuality and commitment. While these factors speak to aspects of the defendant’s character, they do not offset the gravity of the offences. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. Flight records established that Mr H travelled to Budapest in June 2024, ostensibly to attend an academic conference on digital manufacturing. Intriguingly, onward domestic travel suggested an aborted attempt to reach a neighbouring country where known extremist event gatherings had been documented. The thwarting of this journey was due to flight cancellations related to a national air traffic controllers’ strike. This aborted trip falls within the timeline of increasing activity reflected in intercepted communications and device metadata, contributing to the inference of deliberate planning. Meanwhile, it is a matter of record that the Legal Aid Agency in this jurisdiction has recently experienced ongoing shortfalls in the prompt authorisation of expert instruction. This has, in other cases, resulted in delays and compromised defence preparations. Happily, in this instance, authority to appoint a forensic psychologist was granted expeditiously following initial resistance. The court duly commends the defence for their diligence in navigating procedural complexities without undue delay, in contrast to other matters where legal representation has been hampered by systemic inertia. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial analysis undertaken by CTPSW’s forensic accountants revealed a cryptocurrency transfer totalling £4,900 sent in late 2024 from a wallet linked by blockchain analytics to the defendant’s known aliases. This outbound payment corresponded temporally with increased activity on secure messaging apps and transactions within darknet marketplaces known for dual-use goods. The opacity and anonymity conferred by such technologies poses a significant challenge to regulatory frameworks and law enforcement oversight. The court notes the growing importance of expert blockchain tracking in counter-terrorism investigations, a field continuously adapting to technological advancement and illicit innovation. Administrative burden within investigatory agencies tasked with such digital tracing cannot be overstated. Covert operations involved in this matter required synchronised analysis of geospatial data, network traffic logs, and video surveillance captured at multiple locations around Bristol, including public transport hubs and river embankments. The processing of this footage, despite advances in artificial intelligence-assisted video analysis, remained heavily manual and time intensive—a reflection of the enduring tactical cat-and-mouse dynamic between offenders and enforcement. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age, with an educational background culminating in a Bachelor of Engineering specialising in materials science. He was gainfully employed as a junior technician with an aerospace supplier until mid-2023. Letters from supervisors describe the defendant as meticulous and reliable, though somewhat aloof. Notably, his sudden resignation coincided with inquiries into the use of company IT systems for accessing radical forums, which precipitated internal disciplinary proceedings that he chose to circumvent by leaving his employment. The court acknowledges defensive submissions referencing the defendant’s voluntary engagement with community initiatives and the testimony of occupational therapists who have described him as “a man capable of contributing positively to society.” However, such commendations cannot blunt the seriousness of the offences presented. Professionals within the probation and mental health teams have, regrettably, noted considerable challenges in engaging Mr H beyond a superficial level. His participation in early deradicalisation programs was sporadic and marked by periods of withdrawal and disengagement. The efficacy of such structured interventions frequently depends on subject cooperation, which in this case has been inconsistent. For the sake of completeness, it should be recorded that a psychometric evaluation carried out by Dr Samantha Lind, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, concluded there was no evidence of major mental illness. The defendant displays “rigid thinking patterns and a tendency towards black-and-white moral reasoning,” traits consistent with entrenched ideological commitment rather than diagnosable disorder. The pre-sentence report classifies him as presenting a high risk of serious harm in the absence of intensive supervision and monitoring. Promise shown in written assignments and community work is overshadowed by these concerns. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. It must also be observed that multi-agency collaboration in this case has exhibited strengths. The convening of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangement (MAPPA) panel was prompt, and the group has maintained vigilance and coordination between Probation, Health Services, Counter Terrorism Police, and local authority Housing. Despite well-documented pressures from budget cuts and increasing caseloads, the panel’s work in devising a comprehensive management plan for Mr H upon release has been suitably thorough. Conditional requirements envisaged include residence in approved premises, rigorous electronic monitoring with tailored exclusion zones, and mandated participation in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme. The latter, while carrying no guarantees, represents the best currently available provision to counter ideological re-engagement. As has been the pattern in many such cases, the perimeter within which this defendant’s conduct must be assessed includes not only the offences themselves but the broader social context. The unfortunate rise in street homelessness, drug dependency cycles, and fragmented community cohesion all represent external pressures within which many of those at risk of radicalisation find themselves. Community groups, local charities, and faith-based organisations have offered considerable outreach and support, operating often with meagre resources and under significant strain. One notes with interest the persistent graffiti defacing a nearby bus terminus shelter during the remand period, displaying messages unrelated to this defendant, but illustrative of a broader culture of disaffection—not dissimilar to the environments within which criminal ideologies sometimes take hold. Finally, the court must emphasise that the sentencing framework in terrorism offences requires a careful balance of proportionality, deterrence, rehabilitation potential, and above all, public protection. Previous judgments, particularly R v. Imran [2023] EWCA Crim 2024 and R v. Shahzad [2024] EWCA Crim 1871, reiterate that extended custodial sentences with structured licence conditions post-release serve the dual aims of incapacitation and constructive reintegration. Such outcomes protect society while providing a pathway, however challenging, to reduce recidivism. This hearing has proceeded in public, with everyone in attendance. The court records its gratitude to Ms Olivia Trent for the prosecution, and to Mr Daniel Brooks representing the defence under Legal Aid. The court also recognises the valued efforts of court staff, including ushers and clerks, whose recent refurbishment of the courtroom facilities has materially improved the atmosphere within which such serious matters are heard. It is necessary to confirm that this matter will proceed to a formal sentencing hearing on 12 November 2025, at which time the court will consider fully the pre-sentence report, any further psychiatric evaluations, and representations from all parties. Arrangements will be made to ensure victim personal statements, if any, are heard in an appropriate manner respecting their privacy and safety. The court trusts that those preparing the reports will give adequate attention to the defendant’s rehabilitation prospects alongside the public safety imperative.

Mr H Case No. B2025/25832 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. K. THORNHILL Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H appears before this Honourable Court for sentence pursuant to convictions on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006. The first count concerns engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a); the second counts possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct spanned a period commencing in late 2022 and culminating in his apprehension in early 2025. This case is situated within the jurisdiction of the Bristol Crown Court, a court established under the Courts Act 1971 and governed by the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. The defendant is 31 years of age and has been remanded in custody since his arrest. Notwithstanding the complexity of the evidence and volume of material presented, the procedural timetable has been managed, where possible, in accordance with the principles of Better Case Management. A cautionary note is warranted regarding the challenges faced by justice services in cases of this nature. Counter-terrorism investigations require the coordination of multiple agencies, including local police counter-terrorism units, national security services, forensic analysts, and digital investigators. Resourcing constraints often result in delays, not infrequently exacerbated by the necessity to apply closed material procedures and manage sensitive protective markings. Nevertheless, the various stakeholders engaged in this matter have shown considerable professionalism and diligence throughout. Mr H was arrested on 10 January 2025 at his residence in Redcliffe following the execution of a warrant authorised by a senior investigating officer under the powers set out in the Terrorism Act. The seizure included digital devices, communication records, and what was described by law enforcement as dual-use equipment with potential application in the manufacture of explosive devices. The underpinning investigation was a multi-month endeavour, involving an extensive data trawl from internet service providers, telecommunication metadata analysis, and covert surveillance. The operational scope included collaboration with the National Cyber Crime Unit, whose technical experts undertook decryption efforts on the defendant’s encrypted communications. A brief procedural history is relevant. Following initial hearings in March, matters were adjourned on two occasions to permit the collation of expert reports and the assessment of fitness to plead. Adjournments owing to Legal Aid paperwork delays and the securing of sufficient forensic expertise were regrettable but cannot be construed as attributable to any party. At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 21 May 2025, Mr H maintained pleas of not guilty. It was not until the morning of the sentencing hearing that pleas of guilty were tendered to both counts. As will be explored, that timing significantly impacts the allowable mitigation in credit for plea. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The court is mindful that such late pleas, while accepted, do not carry the same weight of mitigation as those entered at the earliest opportunity. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Dunbar [2024] EWCA Crim 999 serves as a salient authority, underscoring that credit for a guilty plea is discretionary and contextual. It is granted primarily to acknowledge the savings in public resources and the avoidance of witness exposure to trial cross-examination. The timing of the plea remains critical in assessing the quantum of credit, particularly in terrorism cases where investigations are necessarily protracted. A perusal of the principles in the Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines 2023 confirms the necessity of a proportionate approach, balancing the interests of justice, public protection, and offender rehabilitation. The guidelines emphasize the paramount importance of deterrence and community reassurance where offences demonstrate ideological conviction and advanced preparation. Notwithstanding this, the case presents the usual variables associated with any sentencing exercise: culpability, harm, aggravating and mitigating factors. The court notes the historical context of the relevant legislation. The Terrorism Act 2006 was enacted in response to the evolving threat landscape, particularly considering the shortcomings unearthed by prior investigations into domestic extremist activities. The Act consolidates provisions aimed at pre-emptively disrupting terrorism, including preparatory acts rather than solely responding to completed offences. This legislative framework is supplemented by extensive jurisprudence, including the seminal case of R v. Anwar [2012] UKSC 15, which delineated the breadth of ‘conduct in preparation’ and the requisite intent. Considerable reference was made at trial to an unrelated matter involving co-defendants who are currently subject to separate proceedings. It is worth remarking that the co-defendant, Mr W, faces charges relating to the unlawful possession of firearms and aggravated assault at a public demonstration in 2023, offences distinct both factually and legally from those for which Mr H stands convicted. While the investigative trajectories intersect at certain junctures, the legal assessment here pertains solely to the conduct of the defendant, unsullied by the actions or status of co-accused, whose files remain under separate judicial consideration. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The Crown’s case relied heavily on a voluminous volume of communications recovered from encrypted messaging applications and cloud storage accounts registered to the defendant’s known online aliases. Expert witness testimony detailed sophisticated encryption protocols and the use of virtual private networks designed to thwart interception. The prosecution presented evidence of extensive research activity concerning explosive formulations, tactical deployment scenarios, and communication with individuals associated with overseas proscribed organisations. The temporal sequence and digital footprints collectively painted a picture of deliberate and sustained radicalisation and operational intent. The court records submissions from the defence emphasising the defendant’s prior mental health history. It is a matter of public record that Mr H engaged with community mental health services intermittently since adolescence, with diagnoses of depressive episodes and anxiety disorders. The psychiatric report commissioned by the defence, authored by Dr Simon Blackwell, consultant forensic psychiatrist, included an assessment of capacity, culpability, and risk. Dr Blackwell concluded that while there was no indication of psychosis or cognitive impairment at the time of offending, the defendant exhibited traits consistent with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and emotional dysregulation. Reference was also made in mitigation to comparable cases, including R v. Langford [2023] EWCA Crim 1207, where a defendant convicted of similar section 5 offences received a custodial term of eight years with a substantial extended licence period. Distinctions were drawn, however, on grounds of the sophistication of the devices procured and the apparent depth of ideological commitment. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The court further contextualizes these incidents by reference to the prevailing operational pressures on counter-terrorism policing units nationwide. In particular, the extraordinary demands placed on digital forensic teams manifest in extensive backlogs and delays, as documented in the 2024 Home Office review on Digital Policing Capabilities. The protracted timeline for decryption, data recovery, and analysis is not unique to this case and reflects systemic challenges inherent in responding to technologically sophisticated offenders. The defendant’s engagement with statutory multi-agency panels, including the Channel Programme, is also instructive. Records show a referral was made in September 2021 by educational staff regarding concerns about Mr H’s expressed radicalised views, stemming from social media posts and classroom discussions. The referral activated a Channel panel which monitored but eventually discontinued Mr H’s involvement due to apparent disengagement and lack of overt risk markers. The limitations of such preventative frameworks are well documented; while undoubtedly beneficial for many individuals, they do not guarantee intervention prior to offending. During proceedings, the court heard from a probation officer involved in the preparation of pre-sentence materials, who provided insights into the strain on probation service capacities. Increasing caseloads, coupled with restricted resources, have meant many risk management cases are being supervised with lower face-to-face contact than is ideal. This systemic limitation must be borne in mind when considering future risk and the feasibility of community-based interventions. It is also appropriate to record the contributions of the local Resettlement and Rehabilitation Network, which has developed tailored initiatives aiming to facilitate reintegration for offenders with extremist backgrounds upon release. While the efficacy of these programmes is still subject to ongoing evaluation, their work merits acknowledgement. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The possession count against Mr H pertains to items identified during forensic examination of his residence. These articles, although innocuously described in some submissions as “specialist engineering tools,” have, in expert opinion, potential utility in hazardous incendiary device manufacture. The court recalls the warnings of Lord Diplock in R v. Bellamy [1975] AC 347, although in a different context, regarding how objects capable of innocuous uses may be lawfully proscribed where intent and context converge. Character references submitted on the defendant’s behalf, including letters from schoolteachers and former employers, describe Mr H as “quiet and withdrawn,” yet with “a keen intellect and technical aptitude.” Such references, while affording a measure of insight into the defendant’s social milieu, do not diminish the gravity of the offences, nor do they mitigate culpability arising from wilful and sustained preparation for acts capable of indiscriminate harm. Attention was drawn by the defence to the absence of any prior convictions, emphasising the defendant’s hitherto unblemished criminal record. This is a relevant consideration, though naturally only one of several factors to be balanced when fashioning an appropriate sentence reflecting both punishment and deterrence. The court must nevertheless hasten to note the challenges courts face when confronted with offenders whose lives oscillate between dual identities: the outwardly ordinary yet inwardly ideologically motivated. Such duality complicates assessment but does not excuse conduct. Indeed, as noted in R v. Westwood [2019] EWCA Crim 434, careful sentence calibration must reflect the reality that covert extremism is no less dangerous than overt violence and may in fact heighten the risk of harm by obscuring early detection. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. The defendant’s travel history, illuminating potential protracted contact with overseas extremist actors, formed a significant evidential strand. Airline and immigration records indicate trips consistent with stated leisure purposes but coinciding with dates of extremist gatherings or political anniversaries. For instance, a trip to Amsterdam in March 2024 overlapped with the annual “Freedom Convocation,” known to attract various radical factions. Such coincidences, while not dispositive alone, reinforce a pattern identified through intercepts and surveillance. The Court also acknowledges letters from community groups, including the Bristol Interfaith Alliance and the Eastside Youth Collective, who submitted observations regarding the defendant’s sporadic participation in peaceful events and local volunteering activities. These submissions, while commendable in their tone, do not negate or diminish the imperative of ensuring that individuals posing a demonstrable risk to public safety are appropriately restricted and rehabilitated. Consideration must be given to the extent to which such community involvement may reflect genuine pro-social intent or tactical posturing. Courts are mindful, as emphasised in R v. Osman [2020] EWCA Crim 1562, that terrorists may adopt multiple facades to evade suspicion. No greater jury can be placed on the benignity of overt conduct where covert intent is substantiated. Separately, the court refers to a 2023 case in the Midlands Circuit, R v. Patel, involving aggravated burglary with a history of drug offences, as a comparative touchstone. Although materially dissimilar in charge, the case attracted attention for the sentencing court's evaluation of rehabilitative potential vis-à-vis offences involving weapons possession, a juxtaposition relevant when considering risk management options here. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The financial patterns uncovered through forensic accounting exercises reveal transactions suggestive of cryptocurrency utilization to obscure payments for materials and services. Of note, a transaction totalling £1,850 was traced to a vendor specialising in chemical precursors. The blurred lines in cryptocurrency exchange monitoring present a modern challenge, encapsulated in the recent review by the National Crime Agency on ‘Cryptocurrency and Illicit Finance.’ This report details the mechanisms by which offenders adapt to regulatory loopholes, complicating enforcement efforts. The Court also remarks upon the painstaking efforts by digital specialists to confirm a nocturnal visit by Mr H to an industrial estate warehouse on 17 October 2024. Multiple camera angles, time-code synchronisation, and facial recognition software were employed. The meticulousness required to corroborate a ten-minute presence highlights the disproportionate effort required for modern law enforcement when targeting sophisticated offenders. In the realm of relevant legal precedent, the court recalls R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, though pertaining to arson and mental health, for its exposition on balancing therapeutic need and public safety. While the circumstances and offences differ materially, its emphasis on calibrated judicial discretion remains salient, particularly when mental health considerations intersect with serious offending. The defendant’s mental health reports indicate no formal diagnosis of psychosis but reflect emotional rigidity and a propensity for ‘black-and-white’ thinking, a finding consistent with academic literature on pathways to radicalisation. Expert interventions will be vital if rehabilitation is to succeed, but such programmes must be approached with circumspection. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal details, Mr H was educated to degree level in computer science. Former employers have described the defendant as “reliable but socially withdrawn,” with specific reference to his proficiency in cryptographic systems. Employment ceased in mid-2023 amid undisclosed discord relating to compliance questions on data security policies. Letters from support organisations, such as the Bristol Centre for Mental Wellbeing, confirm intermittent engagement with therapeutic services prior to arrest. There is a notable absence of sustained contact with family, who reside abroad, compounding the risk factors associated with social isolation. The court is mindful of comparable cases in which defendants leading ostensibly unremarkable lives engaged in covert extremist conduct. As Lord Justice Clarke observed in R v. Yusif [2021] EWCA Crim 843, “The surface may appear calm, but beneath lurks a tempest demanding our vigilance.” Mitigating factors in Mr H’s case are restricted to absence of criminal antecedents, the defendant’s educational attainment, and belated admission of guilt. While these aspects are not negligible, they pale against the backdrop of the substantive threat posed. Equally, the late pleas limit the credit afforded, for reasons previously articulated. A pre-sentence report commissioned by the Probation Service is imminent. It will address Mr H’s risk profile, potential for rehabilitation, and the suitability of custodial versus community-based interventions. The report is to include assessment of participation in specialist desistance programmes and the feasibility of ongoing multi-agency monitoring post-release. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Following consultation with medical and psychological experts, the court has noted the moderate risk of serious harm that the defendant poses to the public, the likelihood of re-engagement in extremist ideology absent robust intervention, and the strategic sophistication underpinning his criminal conduct. The risk evaluation underscores the necessity of stringent custodial conditions and comprehensive post-custody supervision. Before concluding, the court acknowledges the enduring strains borne by public services dealing with both the criminal and mental health consequences of terrorism. Delays in psychiatric assessments due to scarce forensic psychiatric resources, probation officer shortages, and the emerging challenges posed by digital subterfuge complicate risk management efforts. These systemic stresses are not unique to this jurisdiction but reflect national patterns requiring policy attention beyond the courtroom. The court is also conscious of the ongoing debate regarding sentencing policy in terrorism cases, particularly balancing effective deterrence with the principles of proportionality and individualised justice. It remains the function of the judiciary to implement these imperatives consistently and firmly. I record my thanks to Ms Fiona Tregell, representing the Crown, for her precise and measured submissions during these proceedings. Likewise, Mr Asim Selby, Counsel for the defence, merits commendation for professional and diligent advocacy despite the constraints imposed by Legal Aid authorisations and the sheer volume of evidential material. The Court also appreciates the diligent work of court staff and ushers, whose recent refurbishment of Court 2 has provided an improved environment conducive to the orderly administration of justice. In conclusion, this court will await the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. Such report should include up-to-date psychiatric evaluations, probation risk assessments, and any further representations from the defendant’s legal team or relevant supporting agencies. The sentencing hearing is adjourned accordingly.

WYNTER Filed: 5 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court today for sentence following his conviction on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct, as established at trial, occurred between September 2023 and his arrest in April 2025. The defendant was first arrested at approximately 07:45 on 18 April 2025, following the execution of a warrant at his residence in Handsworth by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), supported by the West Midlands Police Digital Forensics Unit and intelligence input from the Security Service (MI5). The warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and was predicated on intelligence indicating that Mr H’s encrypted communications via the Signal application contained references to the construction of improvised explosive devices and the procurement of restricted chemical precursors. Mr H’s case has presented a number of procedural complexities. The operation leading to his arrest—Operation Blackgarden—was a multi-agency collaboration involving officers from CTPWM, Homeland Security Liaison, and the National Counter-Terrorism Cyber Unit. The investigation relied heavily on encrypted data recovery, human intelligence sources, and surveillance operations conducted over a period exceeding 18 months. The expenditure of resources was considerable, not least given the extensive backlogs faced by cyber analytical teams nationally. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The arrest followed a protracted but focused intelligence-led initiative that incorporated mobile device analysis, traffic data correlation, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) monitoring. Particular mention must be made to the role played by the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC) in decrypting key content. The painstaking review of data extracted from several encrypted devices recovered from the defendant’s home residence was hampered by sophisticated obfuscation tools. This required proprietary decryption efforts often involving international liaison. This court must also note the significant procedural delays occasioned by the need for protective markings adjudication and national security vetting of disclosure materials. The defendant’s initial bail application was adjourned on three separate occasions pending full disclosure of evidence to the defence. These delays, though regrettable, underscore the persistent tension between open justice and national security imperatives within terrorism prosecutions. It is relevant to record that Mr H had previously been subject to a Prevent referral in late 2020, triggered by concerns raised by a vocational instructor at a local technical college, following writings he submitted that praised acts of political violence without critical commentary. This referral, however, did not progress to a Channel intervention, as the Panel concluded that there was insufficient evidence of imminent risk to warrant statutory engagement. Whether that decision is an indicator of systemic weakness or appropriate proportionality is beyond the scope of this court’s remit. Before turning to the facts of the case, the court acknowledges and thanks counsel appearing today: Ms Serena Dell for the Crown and Mr Geoffrey Holloway for the defence, who is instructed under a legal aid order. Their submissions have been thorough, reflecting the complex factual and legal terrain navigated in terrorism trials. The court also commends the professionalism of court staff in adapting to the increased security protocols necessitated in these proceedings without unduly disrupting hearing schedules. The chosen location was a garage behind Nando's on the High Street without CCTV, selected by Mr H for a 3pm detonation near Cornbrook during football crowds returning from the Leeds game. It is a regrettable but well-established feature of terrorism prosecutions that defendants often only enter guilty pleas at a late stage, sometimes on the very day of sentencing. Mr H’s initial not guilty plea at the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 10 July 2025 persisted well through the jury selection process, before he changed his plea to guilty on the morning of the sentencing hearing. The court reminds itself and all practitioners that credit for a guilty plea is awarded to recognise genuine remorse and the conservation of public resources, not tactical delay. In this regard, appellate case law provides crucial guidance. The Court of Appeal in R v. Medcalf [2022] EWCA Crim 1479 reaffirmed that late guilty pleas should not attract more than limited credit where they follow the collapse of the defence case or the inevitable weight of evidence. That case concerned a defendant who had engaged in preparatory acts for detonating incendiary devices at a transport hub. The Court emphasised that credit is highly discretionary and sensitive to the context in which the plea is entered. Post-trial credit rulings in R v. Goodwin [2024] EWCA Crim 633 further stressed the erosion of mitigation where pleas come after the Crown has filed voluminous expert evidence and witness statements, including intercept transcripts and forensic analyses. Mr H’s plea, although welcomed, must therefore be considered within that jurisprudential framework. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. It is necessary here to remind that the maximum penalty for an offence under section 5(1)(a) of the 2006 Act is life imprisonment. Sentencing is governed by the Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline issued by the Sentencing Council in 2023, under which culpability is ranked according to factors such as the level of sophistication, the immediacy of risk, and the scale of intended harm. Mitigation for youth or minor complicity is excluded in serious conspiracies or preparation offences. The defendant’s engagement with extremist ideology was multifaceted and sustained. The Crown relied heavily on forensic linguistic experts who identified multiple instances of language directly mirroring propaganda disseminated by proscribed organisations. These included coded references to attacks overseas, calls for violent retribution, and exhortations to procure specific chemical precursors prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Act 1996. The court finds this evidence compelling. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. A quantity of cannabis sativa was discovered during the search of the defendant’s residence. Whilst possession of controlled substances is a crime in its own right, in this case no charges were brought under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in relation thereto. The presence of illicit drugs was raised by defence counsel in mitigation, seeking to portray a degree of youthful indiscretion and social detachment. The court notes that such diversionary tactics cannot diminish the gravity of the terrorism-related offending. In a tangential matter, the defendant had a 2018 conviction for shoplifting toiletries and alcohol from a supermarket in Dudley. This prior offence is neither recent nor indicative of the present offending pattern. Indeed, it was accepted by probation officers in reports that Mr H’s antecedents contain no history of violence or serious criminality outside the terrorism-related sphere. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. The court was particularly interested in evidence relating to the defendant’s 2024 international travel, which included a trip to Istanbul purportedly for a cultural conference. Immigration and airline records showed a same-day booking for onward travel towards the Turkish-Syrian border; however, that connecting flight was cancelled due to airline staff industrial action. Notwithstanding defence submissions that the trip was benign in purpose, the inference is strong that the defendant sought proximity to conflict zones known for terrorist recruitment. It is necessary here to comment on the volume of material disclosed in this prosecution and the attendant administrative burden. The Crown submitted a disclosure schedule comprising over 800 distinct items. Each item underwent extensive Security Service redaction and was vetted, resulting in a process that consumed months of preparatory work by both prosecution and defence. Such realities impose real limits on case progression and underscore the pressing need for modernisation in digital disclosure platforms. The court also acknowledges the chronic staffing shortages faced by Probation Services nationally, including in the West Midlands region. These shortages have consequential impacts on report preparation and offender supervision. Despite this, probation officers involved in Mr H’s case produced diligent and detailed assessments, which are instrumental in informing sentencing options. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations traced cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H’s online wallet to a darknet marketplace specialising in restricted dual-use goods. The court records the troubling ease with which decentralised and anonymised payment channels enable the procurement of materials that pose a direct risk to public safety. Such developments necessitate evolving legal and investigative responses. The integration of financial intelligence units with counter-terrorism policing, while improving, is constrained by resource and jurisdictional challenges. The court notes the contributions made by the West Midlands Prevent Hub, which engaged Mr H in early 2021 for a period of twelve months. Their records indicate partial compliance with cognitive behavioural modules designed to address grievance and radicalisation, although participation waned considerably from mid-2022 onward. The voluntary sector organisations involved, notably the Birmingham Resettlement Network, have offered continued support under considerable operational strain, a fact which acknowledges the ongoing tensions between community integration and public protection. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age, holds a bachelor’s degree in computer science from a Midlands university, and was gainfully employed as a junior software developer until his resignation in late 2023. His line manager’s testimonial describes him as “meticulous, reserved, but increasingly disengaged with workplace interactions.” The sudden resignation occurred in the wake of internal enquiries about unusual internet activity originating from the company’s servers. Letters submitted from neighbours and community groups highlight his involvement in local arts projects and voluntary work with the City Green Initiative. Mr H’s mental health history reveals no formal diagnosis of serious psychiatric illness. A forensic psychological assessment conducted by Dr Helen Chatterjee described a pattern of cognitive rigidity and “black-and-white moral reasoning,” indicating susceptibility to extremist ideology but not meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder. The risk assessment appraised him as posing a high risk of serious harm to the public in the absence of intensive intervention. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. As with all terrorism cases before this court, the paramount consideration is public protection. The defendant’s conduct, while not culminating in a completed act of violence, exhibits a level of planning and commitment that transcends mere fantasy or idle talk. The law acknowledges the danger inherent in preparation for terrorism, and the sentences reflect the need for deterrence, denunciation, and incapacitation. Mitigation in this case is limited. It includes the absence of past convictions for violence, some educational achievement, and the belated guilty plea, which affords a limited stage of credit. The court has carefully considered defence submissions advocating for a custodial sentence with significant rehabilitative elements, including engagement in evidence-based de-radicalisation programmes post-release. The Probation Service is directed to prepare a detailed pre-sentence report addressing the feasibility of extended custodial sentences with licence conditions incorporating monitoring technologies such as electronic tagging and remote electronic searches. The report should also explore options for accredited psychological interventions targeted at extremist beliefs and sponsorable community reintegration plans. The court notes with grave concern the cumulative impact of prolonged destabilisation and the emergence of lone-actor terrorism exemplified in recent jurisprudence. The chain of offences committed by Mr H sits within this worrying pattern, underscoring the necessity of sentences proportionate not only to individual culpability but to broader societal protection. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 5 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Birmingham.

Mr H Case No. B2025/30946 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. E. GARWOOD Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct spans a period commencing in approximately September 2023 up to the time of the defendant's arrest on 11 January 2025. The matter was transferred to this Crown Court following initial proceedings in the Birmingham Magistrates' Court and after a Crown Court arraignment hearing where plea was formally entered. The case was listed for trial in June 2025, following a protracted pre-trial process involving extensive disclosure exercises, expert cyber forensic analysis, and specialist applications under the Justice and Security Act 2013. The defendant was arrested at approximately 07:45 on 11 January 2025 pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence situated on Waverley Road, Birmingham. The operation was orchestrated by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands and involved contributions from the regional cyber intelligence unit. The groundwork for this arrest was laid following a 12-week period of covert surveillance and technical interception authorised under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. This surveillance was supplemented by analytic support from the National Cyber Crime Unit and outreach from the Prevent strategy personnel. These agencies collaborated within the constraints of considerable operational demands, including staffing shortfalls and departmental workload surges. It is appropriate at this juncture to record the court’s recognition of the considerable logistic and financial resource investment which these sorts of investigations require. The investigative team suffered from the cumulative strain of prolonged operations conducted in tandem with responsibilities covering gang-related violence, organised drug trafficking conspiracies, and ongoing counter-fraud initiatives. The procedural difficulties were compounded by the need for highly specialised technical capability—for instance, decryption of secured devices, analysis of anonymised cryptocurrency transactions, and digital footprint mapping—which remains both costly and time-consuming. The Legal Aid Agency’s role in facilitating defence preparation was also fraught with administrative inefficiencies. Mr H’s legal representatives reported multiple delays in obtaining timely approval for expert instruction, particularly in relation to securing a psychiatric evaluation and a digital forensic expert of their own choosing. These delays impeded the prompt exchange of material documentation and set back the case timetable. Whilst these are systemic issues beyond the control of the parties, their occurrence is of concern from the perspective of the administration of justice, especially in litigation involving highly sensitive counter-terrorism material. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. For completeness, I must make brief reference to aspects of the procedural history that, whilst not germane to sentence, provide important context. The case was listed initially in April 2025 but was adjourned owing to late disclosure of material deriving from secondary source intelligence. The adjournment was necessary to enable both the Crown and defence to address this evidence. Further delays occurred due to a strike by court support staff nationally, particularly impacting court listing availability and interpreter services. These factors are regrettable but manifest realities in the current justice system environment. In addressing credit for guilty pleas, I note the relevant authorities, including R v. Bennett [2021] EWCA Crim 1552 and R v. Callahan [2023] EWCA Crim 2436, which underscore the court’s discretion to reduce sentence based on the timeliness and sincerity of the plea. Mr H maintained a not guilty plea until the first day of trial; it was then that he pleaded guilty to both counts. This late plea limits the extent of credit available, given the extensive preparatory work completed by the prosecution and the distress occasioned to witnesses who prepared to give evidence. There is a significant body of appellate jurisprudence to the effect that pleas entered at such a late stage attract reduced mitigation compared to those tendered at the earliest opportunity. Of some peripheral interest, but legally irrelevant to sentence, I note the well-documented increase in antisocial behaviour and low-level criminality in the Birmingham city centre area over the past five years. Foot patrols have intensified in response to a spike in public order offences, notably linked to retail shoplifting, which saw an increase of 18% year-on-year according to data provided by West Midlands Police. Whilst such trends do not relate directly to this defendant’s conduct, they provide a backdrop of criminal justice challenges facing the region. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The court has had the benefit of detailed psychiatric and psychological reporting, including a report from Dr Samuel Ritchie, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Birmingham Secure Hospital. Dr Ritchie’s report, dated 8 September 2025, describes Mr H as presenting with no diagnosable mental illness but notes marked cognitive rigidity and black-and-white thinking patterns. His report emphasises the defendant’s ideological fixation and risk of continuing extremist affiliations in the absence of intensive supervision and intervention. The report further recommends ongoing engagement with desistance programmes specialising in terrorism-related offending. There has also been correspondence submitted by local charities including the Birmingham Resettlement Project and the Eastside Community Group. Both organisations work with individuals at risk of disengagement from extremist ideas and provide support aimed at social reintegration. Their letters attest to Mr H’s sporadic engagement over the past two years, describing his attendance at some workshops but a pattern of withdrawal and non-participation as intervention intensified. These observations highlight the difficulties faced by community groups operating with limited funding and staff shortages in tackling radicalisation at a grassroots level. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The volume and complexity of electronic data seized during the investigation were considerable. Forensic examiners recovered upwards of 15 terabytes of encrypted files, including encrypted messaging archives, videos demonstrating improvised explosive formulations, and scanned documents detailing tactical security measures. The presence of these materials, coupled with analysis of network metadata, indicated a level of sophistication that belies a casual or accidental possession. The defendant’s repeated attempts to obfuscate his tracks—through use of VPNs, anonymising services, and deleted chat histories—were consistent with deliberate operational security protocols. It is notable that the recent judgment in R v. Stoneway [2024] EWCA Crim 2975, dealing with preparatory conduct in a terrorist financing context, stresses that the accumulation of such specialised knowledge and use of obfuscation techniques is indicative of high culpability and enhances the gravity of offending. Although not directly applicable in every detail, this authority provides useful legal and doctrinal context. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Turning to personal circumstances, the defendant is a 31-year-old male, educated to a degree level in software engineering. Prior to his resignation in July 2023, he was employed at a regional software development firm. His line manager’s statement depicts him as “methodical, technically adept but socially withdrawn.” The resignation occurred following queries about digital security protocol breaches, specifically the use of company devices for accessing extremist online forums. There have been submissions from the defendant’s family, including a letter from his elder brother, which portrays Mr H as having struggled with social isolation since adolescence and notes a history of depressive episodes. While these matters merit respectful consideration, they do not mitigate his active engagement in planning acts capable of mass harm. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. The court notes, as part of the wider societal context, increasing demands upon the public mental health services in the region. There has been a reported 25% increase in referrals to community mental health teams over the last three years, with extended waiting times for assessment and treatment. This systemic pressure inevitably complicates efforts to provide timely and targeted interventions for individuals at risk of extremist harm. The Honourable Court also notes recent statistics indicating a rise in knife crime in the West Midlands area, with 1,134 offences recorded in 2024, up from 958 in 2022. While not directly connected to this matter, such trends underscore the multifaceted public safety challenges faced by both law enforcement and communities, and the importance of effective counter-terrorism and crime prevention initiatives. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Mr H’s pattern of digital behaviour included a series of transactions in cryptocurrency, amounting to approximately £3,100 over a six-month period. These transfers were routed through multiple “mixing” services designed to conceal trail and origin, with at least one delivery ostensibly linked to procurement of dual-use components potentially adaptable for the manufacture of explosive devices. The forensic finance unit has accordingly expressed serious concern regarding the defendant’s engagement with these unregulated financial mechanisms. Such conduct parallels observations made in R v. Westbrook [2023] EWCA Crim 359, where the Court identified cryptocurrency use as a factor increasing culpability due to its facilitation of clandestine procurement pathways. The court recognises the ongoing legislative and enforcement challenges posed by these digital assets, which complicate clear attribution and intervention in offences with terrorist intent. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant’s rehabilitation prospects must be carefully appraised. The probation pre-sentence report highlights a number of factors relevant to risk management: lack of consistent engagement with intervention to date; presence of entrenched extremist beliefs; but also no previous custodial convictions and the existence of a settled family environment supportive of supervision. Such complex profiles underline the importance of multi-agency collaboration, including MAPPA arrangements tailored for terrorism-related offenders under Category 3. The court is mindful of the increasingly stretched resources faced by probation services, a matter recently the subject of parliamentary scrutiny in the Justice Select Committee’s 2025 report. The strain on these services has real implications for public protection but does not diminish the necessity of rigorous and evidence-based management. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. I acknowledge the defence submissions pressing for consideration of structured community sentences incorporating electronic monitoring, restriction of internet access, and participation in mandated deradicalisation programmes. While the court welcomes the advocacy for rehabilitation and reintegration, it must weigh these factors against the contemporaneous risk of serious harm evidenced by the prosecution material and confirmed by expert opinion. As the Court of Appeal held in R v. Harrold [2024] EWCA Crim 1659, in terrorism offence sentencing, public safety and deterrence remain paramount. Community sentences, even when combined with intensive supervision, are unlikely to meet these objectives in cases where offender conduct exhibits significant planning and facility with dangerous materials. In this case, whilst there are mitigating considerations, including the defendant’s prior good character and late plea, the court must be satisfied that the sentence reflects the risk posed as well as the need to uphold public confidence in the counter-terrorism framework. The court directs that a full pre-sentence report be prepared as a matter of urgency to provide a thorough assessment of Mr H’s risks and needs. This report should include consideration of the feasibility and appropriateness of Extended Determinate Sentence provisions, potential license conditions including GPS tracking, and the availability of post-custodial support through specialised desistance programmes.

Mr H Case No. B2025/27943 Sentencing Remarks – The Honourable Mr Justice Alan H. Davenport Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence following his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, alongside a conviction for possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The relevant offending period extends from September 2023 until his arrest on 12 February 2025. The proceedings have been marked by multiple preparatory hearings, disclosure orders, and have engaged numerous agencies including the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit and the National Cyber Crime Centre. The defendant’s initial apprehension occurred at approximately 04:37 on 12 February 2025 pursuant to a warrant authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant authorised search and seizure at his residence on Harborne Lane, Birmingham. This followed an eight-month covert operation, codenamed Operation Nightingale, which capitalised on intelligence derived from open-source monitoring, intercepted electronic communications, and financial transaction analysis. At the time of arrest, various electronic devices including a desktop computer, multiple encrypted USB drives, and an unregistered mobile phone were secured. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The operation was a multi-agency effort involving the West Midlands Police Counter-Terrorism Unit, HM Revenue and Customs due to suspected financing irregularities, and the National Intelligence Coordination Centre. The investigative methodology combined traditional human intelligence sources alongside cutting-edge technical surveillance — including the deployment of IMSI catchers and the use of AI-driven pattern recognition software targeting social media activity flagged for extremist content dissemination. These measures, while resource-intensive, reflect the complexity of modern counter-terrorism policing. It should be noted that various procedural aspects of this case have illustrated the operational pressures and intricate coordination necessary in terrorism prosecutions. Delays relating to disclosure of sensitive intercept material occurred, largely attributable to the need to balance open justice with the safeguarding of current intelligence sources. The court is mindful of the principles elucidated in R v. Spears [2012] EWCA Crim 3055, which underscore the competing imperatives of procedural fairness and national security. The disclosure timetable in Mr H’s case was carefully managed within these constraints, albeit extending the overall duration of the proceedings. Prior to arrest, Mr H had attracted the attention of the Prevent programme in early 2022 following a referral from staff at Coventry Technical College, where he had produced essays critically engaging with extremist literature. That referral ultimately did not proceed beyond initial assessment, the Channel panel determining that while there were indicators of ideological sympathies, no immediate risk of violent conduct was apparent. Such circumstances are familiar to the court, illustrating the difficulty in discerning between protected expression and preparatory offence conduct under counter-terrorism legislation. While Prevent referrals represent one facet of the safeguarding architecture, their limitation in predictive value is stark. A plea and case management hearing was held on 1 July 2025. At that time, Mr H maintained a plea of not guilty on all counts. Only on the morning of the sentencing hearing did he enter guilty pleas. The court must observe that such late admissions, whilst constitutionally permissible, restrict the extent to which credit can be awarded. The jurisprudence on this matter is well-established, notably in R v. Fennell [2019] EWCA Crim 1041, where the timing of the plea significantly affected credit due to the strain placed on court and prosecution resources. The issues regarding credit for guilty plea were considered at length in R v. Cranston [2017] EWCA Crim 1459, which confirmed that credit is a matter of judicial discretion contingent on the timing and circumstances of the plea. The court in Cranston concluded that a plea entered only after jury empanelment and witness preparation should generally attract only a modest discount. The same principle applies here. Mr H’s admission occurred only after the completion of witness statements, the service of expert reports, and preparation for a contested trial. The sentencing regime relevant to this case is informed predominantly by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline 2023. The guideline requires an evaluation of culpability and harm, with reference to aggravating and mitigating factors, and the imposition of sentences consonant with public protection and deterrence objectives. Particular regard is afforded to the defendant's degree of operational involvement, technical sophistication, and the scale or intended impact of any contemplated terrorist act. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. The Crown’s case includes evidence that from mid-2023 onwards Mr H operated multiple anonymised online personas disseminating ideological content sympathetic to proscribed organisations. Analysis by national cybersecurity analysts has confirmed that his blog posts, uploaded podcasts, and forum messages simultaneously adopted the language and iconography of such groups. This ideological commitment went beyond passive consumption; it manifested in active propagation and enticement of others towards violent extremism. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Technical examination recovered numerous encrypted files stored within hidden partitions of Mr H’s personal computer and personal cloud devices. These documents included detailed manuals on bomb-making techniques, schematics for improvised explosive devices, and collections of materials sourced from proscribed terrorist training camps. Notably, some files exhibited metadata timestamps corresponding with dates significant for radical groups, indicating symbolic import to the defendant’s planning. Extensive forensic cryptanalysis was required, demanding approximately 1,200 man-hours over three months, due to sophisticated encryption deployed by the defendant. Such effort underscores the level of premeditation and planning inherent in the offences. The court cannot underestimate the resources required by law enforcement agencies in prosecuting cases of this nature. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The defence sought to argue that certain unexplained surveillance photographs of Mr H near a Birmingham chemical plant represented innocent interest in local industry, reinforced by his prior vocational training in chemistry. The court finds this explanation unpersuasive, particularly considering the cumulative evidence and the temporal coincidence of those observations with encrypted activity. The pattern coheres with deliberate reconnaissance rather than casual passage. Prior to prosecution, Mr H was the subject of a separate criminal investigation unrelated to the present offence, involving allegations of participation in a commercial fly-tipping operation on green belt land near Redditch. That investigation was discontinued due to insufficient evidence. It bears no relation to these proceedings but does serve to illustrate the breadth of law enforcement activity interacting with an individual’s history. The court is also cognizant of the fact that the defendant’s co-accused in a separate indictment, Mr B, faces charges for burglary of private dwellings during holiday absences. Those charges and proceedings proceed independently, and their relevance to the sentencing of Mr H is nil beyond the shared investigative context. Conflation of such matters would be inappropriate. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Following his arrest, Mr H travelled abroad to Brussels under the cover of a purported academic exchange programme. Intelligence indicates that during this trip in April 2024 he met individuals later linked to the illicit importation of significant quantities of Class A drugs into the United Kingdom via freight consignments. This provides insight into the defendant’s wider associations and the multifaceted nature of criminal networks intersecting on extremist and trafficking activity. It is essential to remark that possession of a bladed article discovered in a school car park some years prior in a separate, non-terrorism related investigation does not factor into the present sentencing. That matter was dealt with by a youth panel and is unrelated both temporally and contextually. The court further notes that a room-mate of Mr H was located with a cannabis cache during an unrelated search in 2021. This incidental association does not reflect on the defendant’s intentions or risk profile and is accordingly disregarded. The case management process reflected contemporary tensions within the Legal Aid Agency’s capacity. There were documented administrative delays and staffing shortages that impacted the defendant’s ability to secure expert psychiatric assessment expeditiously. Mr H’s defence counsel, Mr Oliver Quayle, merit commendation for persistent advocacy in securing tribunal approval for additional preparatory hours, despite challenges posed by Systemic Legal Aid budget restraints. Correspondence received from Birmingham’s East Central Resettlement and Community Support Service underscores ongoing pressure on accommodation services. The area has seen a 14% increase in demand over five years, a trend which complicates post-custodial housing planning for defendants posing elevated risk. This systemic backdrop, while peripheral to individual culpability, provides essential context for risk management arrangements. The court recognises the continued professional and dedicated efforts of the West Midlands Prevent Coordination Hub, which engaged with Mr H intermittently over the 18-month period prior to arrest. Their documented sessions included cognitive behavioural strategies aimed at countering grievances linked to his ideological leanings. Despite repeated outreach, engagement was variable and ultimately incomplete. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations revealed that Mr H executed cryptocurrency transactions amounting to £3,520 over six months using privacy-focused wallets. These funds were linked to vendors specialising in dual-use chemical precursors. The anonymous nature of these payments complicated tracing; authorities coordinate increasingly with international blockchain compliance teams in response to such covert funding mechanisms. While cryptocurrency innovation enables legitimate financial services, it is of growing concern when exploited for terrorism-related procurement. Courts have repeatedly warned of the necessity for robust responses, as noted in R v. Belmont [2023] EWCA Crim 910, a case where similar financial concealment was a critical factor in a terrorist financing conviction. The defendant’s deliberate destruction of digital communication channels upon detection signifies a conscious attempt to hinder investigation. Following arrest, Mr H was found to have remotely wiped select cloud storage instances and employed anti-forensic tools designed to sanitize deletion logs, further evidencing sophisticated concealment tactics. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to personal circumstances, Mr H is currently 31 years old and holds an honours degree in applied physics from a Midlands university. Prior to offending, he was engaged in short-term contract work in technical consultancy but faced employment instability after non-disclosure of security vetting issues. Mr H’s upbringing was described in pre-sentence reports as involving a fractured family environment, with intermittent exposure to community violence and economic hardship. While such social history is unfortunately not uncommon among offenders, courts must balance these factors with individual responsibility and the particular dangers associated with terrorism-related conduct. Letters submitted from an interfaith group in Birmingham detail Mr H’s limited participation in their multicultural reconciliation projects. While these attest to some pro-social endeavours, the court must stress that such participation neither excuses nor negates the gravity of his offences. It is a matter of principle that commendable voluntary activity is to be measured according to overall behavioural context. The defendant’s handwriting, as observed in personal correspondence, is neat and technically precise but reveals a noted tendency toward obsessive detail orientation. This trait was discussed in forensic psychological evaluations, which described Mr H as displaying rigid cognitive processing and an inclination to binary moral frameworks. Professor Erik Morrison, consultant forensic psychiatrist, conducted a comprehensive assessment. His report, dated 20 August 2025, concludes that Mr H suffers no formally diagnosable psychiatric illness but demonstrates “significant ideological fixation, with cognitive inflexibility rendering him vulnerable to extremist narratives.” The risk assessment classified him as posing a high risk of serious harm, particularly in the absence of long-term, specialised deradicalisation programmes. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The court acknowledges the submissions made advocating for utilisation of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) and similar structured interventions in the hope of ameliorating Mr H’s risk profile post-release. Experience and evidence suggest that these programmes, while valuable, have mixed success and rely heavily on sustained engagement and extensive monitoring. The court reiterates the prevailing public interest and legal requirements to ensure that sentencing in terrorism cases prioritises protection of the public, deterrence, and the condemnation of conduct undermining democratic society. The aggravating factors, including the defendant’s planning, sophistication, and ideological commitment, demand a custodial sentence commensurate with these principles. Before concluding, it is necessary to mention unrelated ongoing matters that have intersected with the administration of justice in this jurisdiction. For example, a prolonged arson incident at Court 5 in the Midlands Crown Court complex caused unavoidable delays across multiple listings, including this matter. Additionally, the court clerk service has recently been affected by staff turnover, occasionally resulting in minor administrative delays. These observations serve only as context, not as justifications for delay or procedural irregularity in the present case. The court is also cognisant of the increasing burden on local police forces arising from non-terrorism-related crime. For instance, street-level antisocial behaviour and rising incidents of retail theft continue to divert resources from specialised units. The National Statistics Office reported a 22% increase in public transport graffiti vandalism in the West Midlands over the last two years, a trend reflecting broader societal challenges but unrelated to this defendant. In considering sentencing options, the court directs the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report by West Midlands Probation Trust. The report is to address the feasibility and appropriateness of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, alongside targeted cognitive behavioural interventions designed for ideological extremism. It should assess the availability of approved premises with capacity for electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and polygraph support, as well as consideration of mental health oversight. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 4 at Birmingham Crown Court. They have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules (Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2022), and the formal record of conviction will be transmitted to the appropriate enforcement and monitoring agencies.

Mr H Case No. B2025/24836 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. Lindenhall Filed: 2 September 2025 Mr H appears this day before the Crown Court at Birmingham for sentence upon charges under the Terrorism Act 2006: specifically, engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and the alternative count of possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57(1) of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct alleged, and now admitted by virtue of the defendant’s pleas, covers a timespan extending from early 2023 to his arrest in December 2024. The defendant’s arrest followed a protracted and multifaceted joint operation involving Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), the national intelligence apparatus, and forensic cyber units attached to the National Crime Agency. This case is emblematic of the contemporary challenges faced by law enforcement agencies, where integration of digital intelligence, covert surveillance, and inter-agency collaboration is crucial yet also strained by resource limitations and increasing caseload complexity. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It must be put on record that Mr H’s arrest marked the culmination of Operation Steelforge, a long-running covert investigation that employed sophisticated digital interception measures, including lawful interception of encrypted communications and deployment of judicially authorised electronic surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The investigation was not without procedural difficulties. Over the course of eighteen months, numerous delays were encountered due to the necessity of upholding strict evidentiary and disclosure protocols while maintaining the operational secrecy of methods deployed. The Crown commends the officers, forensic specialists, and intelligence analysts whose dedication has been impressive, despite working within a legal framework characterised by complexity and caution. This court further acknowledges the increasingly challenging environment in which such investigations take place, particularly noting the constraints upon forensic cyber teams. These units frequently report staffing shortages and backlogs that can delay crucial stages of investigation, such as decryption and analysis of voluminous digital material seized under warrant. Those pressures, while understandable, must not compromise the timeliness or thoroughness necessary in cases of national security importance. Turning to the procedural history, the case was first listed before this court on 12 February 2025 for a plea and case management hearing. Initial pleas were entered as not guilty, but at the commencement of the trial on 19 August 2025, Mr H altered his plea to guilty on both counts. The prosecution has submitted that in light of the volume of evidence and the nature of the offences, that plea constitutes an important step toward procedural economy. Nonetheless, it is important to consider the timing within the context of the totality of proceedings. The court has had regard to authorities elucidating the principles governing credit to be given for guilty pleas, notably R v. Seymour [2023] EWCA Crim 1912 and R v. Jordan [2024] EWCA Crim 1436. Seymour compels the judiciary to weigh not only the fact of the plea but also its timing, sincerity, and the extent to which it reduces the burden on the court and the trauma to witnesses. Jordan further reaffirms that late pleas entered close to trial often attract significantly reduced discount, particularly when substantial preparation has already been undertaken by both prosecution and defence. It is a matter of professional regret that Legal Aid delays again marred the early stages of defence preparation. The defendant’s counsel, Mr Aaron Fitzroy, reported that the initial authorisation to instruct appropriate forensic psychiatric experts took over four months to effectuate, hindering timely evaluation of mitigation and judicial disposition. Such administrative delays, while lamented by the court, are too often endemic in complex cases and impede efficient administration of justice. The court trusts that the Legal Aid Agency will reflect on this case as an example where reform remains urgent. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. The prosecution has adduced extensive evidence revealing the defendant’s protracted and methodical engagement with violent extremist ideology. Analysis of encrypted digital journals, communications hosted on the “DarkLight” darknet forum, and material exchanged in private messaging applications establishes a pattern of preparation designed to enable acts of mass harm. The court notes that the defendant’s behaviour was not spontaneous or opportunistic but calculated and intentionally concealed, manifesting sophistication in the use of technology designed to defeat law enforcement detection. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defence has sought to describe certain folders of digital content—labelled innocuously by the defendant as \"Project Blueprints\"—as indicative of a legitimate hobbyist interest in pyrotechnics and metalwork. However, the Crown’s expert witnesses, including Dr Melissa Cromwell, a forensic explosives specialist retained by CTPWM, have categorically stated that the material’s content and structure surpass mere technical curiosity and instead typify preparatory actions towards manufacture or acquisition of explosive devices. While the court understands the complexities inherent in parsing innocent interest from criminal intent, the contextual totality presented undermines the defence proposal. It is also noteworthy that a prior conviction for affray, unrelated and from eight years prior, involving a brawl at a licensed premise in the Midlands, was tendered by defence as exculpatory character evidence. The court finds such historical offending of limited relevance given the gravity and ideological context of the present charges. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. An ancillary and ultimately inadmissible point raised by the defence concerned the presence of scrap metal and minor electrical components found at the defendant’s residence. Counsel argued these were typical of a hobbyist's workshop, citing online forums dedicated to amateur radio enthusiasts and model engineering. This court notes the distinction between benign interests and criminal preparation, a distinction that must be evaluated on the basis of evidential weight rather than lifestyle generalities. To digress momentarily, it is necessary to mention the wider societal pressures bearing on public order agencies at this time. The burden of street-level policing in Birmingham, as elsewhere, has been substantially augmented by increases in drug-related crime, vehicle theft, and so-called \"ASB\" incidents in city centres. These challenges, while significantly distinct in nature from terrorism investigations, nonetheless compete for finite resources. The strain on frontline officers is amplified by concurrent demands arising from mental health crises and increasing public disorder during major events hosted in the city. It is against this backdrop that covert counter-terrorism investigations operate, often unseen and underrepresented in public consciousness. To continue, correspondence obtained from the West Midlands Resettlement Advisory Forum, a voluntary sector organisation working closely with ex-offenders, was submitted to the court in mitigation. The letters highlighted Mr H’s prior volunteer engagements in urban greening schemes and at a local soup kitchen. These endeavours, though respectfully acknowledged, stand in contrast to the defendant’s offending and do not negate the seriousness of the betrayal inherent in his preparation for acts intended to spread lethal violence. It is also germane to reflect on the provisions of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) framework which has, in this case, been engaged at Category 3. The panel assembled includes representatives from community probation, mental health services, local policing, and counter-terrorism specialists. The court notes with approval the measured and collaborative approach taken by these bodies, notwithstanding significant capacity issues recently reported in regional probation services. Nationally, caseloads have ballooned to unprecedented levels, as highlighted in the July 2025 Ministry of Justice annual report, which detailed a 27% increase in MAPPA supervision referrals for individuals presenting risks related to extremist ideologies. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. Defence counsel emphasises that the defendant undertook a trip in late 2023 to Brussels, ostensibly to attend a conference on sustainable engineering. However, the Crown adduced evidence placing the defendant in the vicinity of areas frequented by proscribed extremist cadres, including reinforced CCTV footage capturing contact with known facilitators. The court appreciates the argument that innocent explanation is possible, but the totality of the evidence militates against such a benign interpretation. The court recalls relevant precedent in R v. Khatri [2022] EWCA Crim 1850, where the Court of Appeal underscored the evidential importance of travel to conflict-affiliated geographies in discerning intent and facilitating networks. Whilst Mr H did not cross legal boundaries in respect of travel documentation, the context and contact are significant indicators consistent with preparation and radical progression. To revert briefly to administrative context, the court notes that this case was initially delayed by two adjournments precipitated by industrial action taken among court clerks, judicial support staff, and interpreters in March and April 2025. Such disruptions, though external to the parties, nevertheless demonstrate the fragility of procedural frameworks and again underline the necessity for ongoing investment in court infrastructure and personnel. Another judicial observation is warranted concerning the defendant’s engagement with local health services. The GP practice at which Mr H has been registered has reported frequent attendance in the two years preceding arrest, predominantly for somatic complaints. No serious mental health diagnosis was recorded, though stress and anxiety markers were noted. Contact with psychological services was sporadic and limited, as reflected in a report prepared by Dr Harpreet Gulati, consultant psychiatrist at Birmingham Secure Mental Health Unit, who diagnosed no formal psychiatric illness but noted personality features including “cognitive inflexibility and absolutist thinking patterns”—traits which, while contributing to ideological entrenchment, do not absolve culpability. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Another aspect of the evidence that elicited significant investigative attention was a series of cryptocurrency payments totalling approximately £3,200, traced from a wallet linked via blockchain analytics to an account dormant until early 2024. These transactions connected to vendors identified as supplying dual-use items and tactical equipment. The court is mindful of the contemporary challenges posed by cryptocurrencies in masking illicit transactions, as summarised in the Home Office’s 2025 Cybercrime Annual Review, which details increasing exploitation of decentralised payment systems by extremist elements. The defendant’s willingness to engage in such opaque financial dealings amplifies the premeditated and covert nature of his offending. Elsewhere, close attention was paid to closed-circuit surveillance footage captured at the River Rea embankment on 2 October 2024, where the defendant was observed in the company of another individual under active investigation for arms trafficking. Detailed analysis of this footage required the concerted efforts of multiple specialist teams over a period of 120 hours. The forensic burden of such lines of enquiry underscores the resource-intensive nature of counter-terrorism enforcement. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. In respect of personal character, Mr H is aged 31 and holds a degree in mechanical engineering awarded with upper second-class honours from a Redbrick university in the Midlands. Prior to dismissal in late 2023, he was employed as a junior design engineer by a subcontractor involved with critical infrastructure projects. References from former supervisors paint a picture of a technically capable but socially withdrawn individual who exhibited marked changes in demeanour and focus in the months leading up to resignation, which coincided with the inception of the covert investigation. The defence presented letters from members of a local Muslim youth group and an urban regeneration charity highlighting the defendant’s past participation in community outreach activities and educational mentoring. Though these commendations are acknowledged with respect, they cannot be allowed to diminish the gravity of the offending nor the risk posed. The court records that a minor scuffle in a nightclub in 2015 resulting in a conviction for common assault was referred to as part of mitigation submissions. It is self-evident that such youthful indiscretions carry little weight in cases involving ideological violence and terrorist preparation. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. A psychiatric evaluation by Dr Roisin Mangan, a forensic psychologist specialising in extremist behaviour, offers a considered clinical opinion that Mr H poses a high risk of serious harm, particularly in relation to ideologically motivated violence. The report stresses the importance of intensive, structured deradicalisation interventions alongside stringent risk management post-custody. Dr Mangan expresses guarded optimism concerning engagement with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) but cautions that history suggests attrition and relapse rates remain high. The court also notes the representations received from the East Midlands Council of Muslim Communities, which have urged sensitivity in sentencing to avoid perceptions of disproportionate targeting, while underscoring the critical importance of public safety and legal deterrence. Such balanced submissions are welcomed in affirming the commitment of minority communities to shared values and lawful conduct. This case starkly illustrates the current task faced by the criminal justice system: balancing individual liberties, public protection, and societal cohesion in the face of complex and evolving threats. The offending before the court was carried out with deliberate concealment and methodical intent. Its interruption was timely but costly in terms of resources and community anxiety. The court must now consider an appropriate sentence calibrated to reflect the severity of the offences, the culpability of the defendant, and the need for general and specific deterrence. The relevant sentencing guidelines and recent appellate authorities emphasise that sentences in terrorism cases must mark society's profound repudiation of acts that threaten life and liberty on a mass scale. That said, the court has had regard to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, his educational and employment background, the belated guilty pleas, and the prospect of engagement with rehabilitative programmes. These factors may mitigate the ultimate custodial term. A pre-sentence report has been ordered, and the probation service is instructed to address risk management options including possible Extended Determinate Sentences, the availability of specialist exclusion zones, licensed premises bans, and rigorous psychological interventions. Of particular importance is assessing the feasibility of monitoring tools like GPS tagging and polygraph examinations within a multi-agency framework. Before concluding, the court extends thanks to Ms Priya Mandal, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown, whose measured submissions reflected a careful balance of evidential clarity and sensitivity. Similarly, gratitude is extended to Mr Aaron Fitzroy, leading counsel for the defence, for his diligent and professional advocacy under challenging circumstances. The courtroom itself, recently refurbished as part of the Ministry of Justice’s 2025 capital works programme, has benefitted from improved digital presentation capabilities. This has enhanced the ability of all parties to engage with complex electronic evidence in open court, thereby facilitating a more transparent judicial process. The court also recognises with appreciation the sterling efforts of court officers and ushers who maintained decorum and order across a volatile trial period marked by heightened security concerns. These sentencing remarks are issued today, 2 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. All proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentencing hearing will be scheduled following receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report. The defendant is reminded of his rights to challenge any sentence imposed in due course, in accordance with the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

A. KENDRICK Filed: 12 August 2025 Mr H stands before this Crown Court today for sentence upon two counts: one of preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending is determined to have taken place between April 2023 and his arrest in January 2025. The defendant was apprehended shortly after 04:00 hours on 18 January 2025 pursuant to warrants executed by officers from West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, supported by forensic digital investigators from the National Crime Agency’s Cyber Division. These warrants, authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, arose following intelligence from the Security Service, which highlighted encrypted communication activity tied to Mr H’s online identifiers. The seized material included multiple electronic devices, notably a high-performance laptop configured with bespoke encryption utilities, as well as a cache of chemical supplies, some of which fall under dual-use controls. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation behind the defendant’s arrest was extensive and inter-agency in scope. West Midlands CTU collaborated closely with the Birmingham City Police’s Technical Surveillance Unit and the Electronic Surveillance Section of the National Cyberdesk. The case also saw significant input from regional Counter Terrorism Intelligence Sources, whose groundwork, conducted with the support of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, culminated in a multi-month operation codenamed “ORCHID VALE.” Intelligence gathering included analysis of anonymized data extracted from telecommunications metadata, admissible mobile device extraction techniques, and pattern analysis software flagged through the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. Such deployments reaffirm the complexity and significant resource burdens inherent in counterterrorism work within urban conurbations. This court notes with interest that Mr H had been subject to a Channel referral in late 2020. A secondary school teacher reported concerns regarding his circulation of extremist political literature among peer groups. The subsequent Channel panel reviewed the case but, on balance, found insufficient evidence to sustain intervention beyond monitoring. The referral predated any overt offence-related activity and fell into the category of early-stage concern typically addressed by the Prevent duty. Notwithstanding the panel’s decision, this court is compelled to observe how the continuum from low-level ideation to preparatory criminal conduct challenges the design of preventive frameworks and underscores the need for sustained surveillance in certain cases. The defendant was initially detained under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for up to 14 days, during which time law enforcement conducted forensic processing of recovered devices and coordinated international intelligence sharing. Following presentation to the magistrates’ court, Mr H was remanded in custody pending trial. Procedural history includes a plea and trial preparation hearing listed on 4 May 2025. The defendant initially entered pleas of not guilty to both counts but altered his position mere hours before what was intended as the opening day of trial on 28 July 2025, entering guilty pleas to the charges. The court must accordingly address the sentencing discount applicable in such late pleas, a topic that has been thoroughly canvassed in recent appellate jurisprudence. The law is well settled that credit for guilty pleas is discretionary and contingent upon such pleas being timely and demonstrative of genuine contrition. The decision in R v. Lockhart [2022] EWCA Crim 1315 remains authoritative: an early plea can merit up to one-third reduction in sentence, while one entered shortly before or during trial—such as in this case—may warrant no more than one-sixth credit. This principle was further reheard in R v. Darnell [2023] EWCA Crim 2026, reaffirming the necessity of encouraging early admissions through appropriately calibrated sentencing incentives. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Any consideration of sentence must be situated within the statutory framework provided by the Terrorism Act 2006 and the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Definitive Guideline (updated 2023). The Guideline directs assessment based upon the culpability of the defendant and the harm envisaged, both actual and potential. Culpability is to be evaluated through factors such as the degree of planning, sophistication, and the nature of materials procured. Harm evaluation extends from the anticipated scale of injury or disruption to the wider security implications. The court is mindful that terrorism-related offences attract custodial penalties commensurate with the gravity of public danger and deterrence objectives. Consideration is also due to representative case law developing these tenets. R v. Alahmed [2019] EWCA Crim 678 underscores that even interrupted conspiracies can warrant sentences reflecting the likely scale of harm. Similarly, the decision in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 clarifies that “terrorist purpose” embraces acts intending to influence government or intimidate the public, a broad construction that gives force to legislative intent. These authorities assist the court in positioning this defendant’s conduct on the culpability-harm spectrum. The defendant’s digital footprint reveals a progression from initially innocuous activity—early blog posts discussing foreign policy and regional conflicts—to radical rhetorical advocacy. Over time, material recovered indicates his consumption and dissemination of ideologically charged manifestos affiliated with a proscribed organisation under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. His posts underwent linguistic signature analysis by artifactual specialists, revealing marked affinity with known propaganda trends. This evolution was emblematic of a phenomenon observed in similar prosecutions: digital self-radicalisation facilitating access to hostile ideology detached from immediate physical community influence. A recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The digital forensic examination further uncovered encrypted archives titled cryptically as “Project Emerald.” These contained design schematics and explosive compound recipes with annotations and revisions. The court is mindful of the analytical challenges faced by the National Technical Specialist Unit handling the evidence, amplified by the defendant’s use of privacy-preserving tools such as Tor routing and ephemeral communication apps. Recognising the limitations of inference in disrupted datasets, the court nonetheless finds sufficient evidence of purposeful intent linked to preparation for violent action. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The defence sought to contextualise the procurement of chemical precursors as part of a legitimate hobbyist’s interest in pyrotechnics, with supporting witness statements from acquaintances emphasising Mr H’s participation in model rocket construction and amateur chemistry clubs. While such hobbies are lawful and protected, the court must evaluate them through the prism of the totality of evidence. Contextual innocence cannot exculpate behaviour converging with criminal intent, particularly where multiple elements coalesce in combination. Additional considerations of note arise from the presence in seized material of minor quantities of cannabis and an unexplained tablet of diazepam, neither of which relate directly to the terrorism allegations but emerged during forensic examination. Although these substances are not charged items, their existence prompted review of the defendant’s mental health history. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. It emerges from the case records that Mr H travelled abroad to Belgium in September 2024 purportedly for academic conference attendance related to chemical engineering. Airline and border control records indicate that during this visit, Mr H visited areas under informal surveillance for extremist networking. While defence submissions emphasise the scholar’s itinerary and invitations from professional bodies, the Crown contends the journey served as a cover for liaison with known facilitators. Closed-source intelligence supports the latter view and is accepted by the court. The logistical burden of such a case cannot be overstated. Disclosure in excess of 600 items was served to the defence, each subject to protective markings and security clearance. The processing required for these exhibits, including video evidence from traffic cameras at Birmingham International Rail Station, mobile device extractions, and intercepted encrypted voice calls, consumed resource hours currently strained across counterterrorism law enforcement apparatus. The court acknowledges the professionalism of the case officers involved, especially given the backdrop of national police service understaffing and the increased demand for cyber forensic capacity. This case unfolded without notable procedural delay until an adjournment in July 2025, occasioned by a late application to the Legal Aid Agency for funding authorisation to instruct expert psychiatric assessment. The delay, while frustrating, was managed with due regard to procedural fairness. It serves to highlight the often-criticised but vital role of legal aid in ensuring quality representation without which justice may be compromised. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A financial audit undertaken by forensic accountants for the prosecution traced a series of cryptocurrency transactions from wallets linked to Mr H. These included notable transfers to accounts that advertised dual-use chemical precursors and enclosed laboratory equipment likely unsuitable for civilian use. The anonymising and tumbling services employed underscore the deliberate intent to obscure transactional paths, complicating law enforcement inquiry yet evidencing the defendant’s technical sophistication and operational planning. The broader phenomenon of unregulated virtual currency in crime financing represents an ever-more significant challenge for law enforcement, as confirmed by reports from the Financial Conduct Authority and INTERPOL. The court notes, regrettably, how the anonymity afforded by such technology facilitates a range of criminal markets, from illicit arms trade to terrorism financing, exacerbating public risk. The examination of covert surveillance footage capturing Mr H’s nocturnal movements to an industrial site adjacent to the Birmingham Canal underscores the practical challenges of round-the-clock investigation. Footage analysts laboured for hundreds of hours stabilising low-light recordings, syncing multiple camera sources, and filtering environmental interference to confirm suspect activity over an intermittent period, an effort emblematic of the disproportionality between offence execution and detection effort. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Concerning the defendant’s personal circumstances, he is 31 years of age with a degree in applied chemistry awarded by a Midlands university. He was formerly employed as an assistant laboratory technician but resigned following disciplinary concerns relating to unauthorised internet usage at work, reportedly accessing extremist online forums. Character references from former employers depict Mr H as “precise,” “quiet,” and “possessing deep technical knowledge,” tempering acknowledgement of his social withdrawal. The social care records indicate no prior convictions, though there is a history of intermittent engagement with mental health services for anxiety and depression. Several letters submitted in mitigation attest to his involvement in local artistic community activities, including volunteering as an assistant in a community theatre workshop and participation in restorative justice workshops aimed at young offenders. The court must consider this evidence in sentencing, mindful that community contribution, while laudable, does not detract from the gravity of offences involving preparation for indiscriminate violence. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. A recent psychiatric evaluation by Dr Sonia Kaur, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provides a detailed profile. Dr Kaur diagnoses Mr H with a cluster of cognitive rigidity and a spectrum personality disturbance not amounting to a formal psychotic disorder. The assessment labels the risk of serious harm as high, contingent on the absence of sustained psychological intervention and robust risk management strategies. Structured professional judgement tools, including the HCR-20V3 risk assessment, corroborate this position. Intervention opportunities such as the structured deradicalisation programmes currently deployed under the national Prevent framework are assessed as necessary but not determinative. The court is further mindful of submissions from community representatives expressing concern about the potential for disproportionate penalisation of individuals from certain demographic backgrounds, emphasising the need for balance between public protection and avoiding injustice. The court assures that sentencing will remain firmly within principle, guided by proportionality and precedent. This case, in its totality, presents a deliberate, technically sophisticated scheme, intended to culminate in acts capable of causing mass harm. The calculated gathering of components, use of encryption to evade detection, and cross-border liaison elevate culpability to the highest category as set out in the guidelines. The absence of prior convictions is a slender mitigating factor, partially offset by a guilty plea entered late in proceedings. The Probation Service is directed to compile a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing risk management—particularly the feasibility of a sentence incorporating extended determinate custodial elements, with provisions for licence conditions involving electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and mandatory psychological treatment. The report should also consider the availability of secure accommodation upon release and access to specialised cognitive-bias modification programmes. It is appropriate to acknowledge at this juncture the dedicated but overstretched nature of multi-agency partnerships in counterterrorism, including CT Policing units, forensic mental health services, and statutory community-based interventions. Resource constraints persistently hamper optimal engagement, a fact of which the court is acutely aware. These sentencing remarks are pronounced on this 12th day of August 2025, in Court 9 at Birmingham Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed according to Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record will be forwarded to the Sentencing Commission and relevant authorities for registration. Mr H is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

R. WINTERS Filed: 16 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence upon his conviction of two counts contrary to the Terrorism Act 2006: first, engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a); and second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period relevant to these offences extends from July 2023 until his subsequent arrest on 12 April 2025. The defendant was apprehended in the early hours of the morning at his residence in Aston, following the execution of warrants authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. This action concluded an extended multi-jurisdictional investigation led by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, supported by intelligence agencies and forensic experts. The investigation entailed months of covert surveillance, interception of encrypted communications, and analysis of digital and financial footprints, revealing a sophisticated pattern of activity warranting such an intervention. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This arrest followed a drawn-out inquiry that combined traditional policing methods with the intricacies of cyber forensics. The volume of material seized weighed heavily on the investigative capacity, as the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) was concurrently managing several high-profile decryptions. Moreover, the constraints of public resource allocations, compounded by an ongoing nationwide shortage of cybersecurity specialists, introduced delays in the assessment of volatile encrypted data streams pertinent to this case. It is a matter worthy of note to the court that while competing priorities inevitably slow the resolution of certain cases, priority is always accorded to those posing the gravest demonstrated risks to public safety. The court further registers its awareness of the wider context in which public services operate. Recent reports from the West Midlands Metropolitan Police Service articulate growing pressures, not merely from counter-terrorism cases, but across the criminal justice spectrum. The added demands stemming from non-violent incidents with underlying radical narratives further stretch limited resources. The blending of ideological motivation within domestic tiers of offending presents unique challenges—ones that render the skill and dedication of operational personnel all the more critical. Of procedural note, this case was listed for trial originally on 4 August 2025, but was adjourned owing principally to an application by the defence to obtain additional forensic reports and to receive rulings on admissibility of certain evidential materials derived from protected interceptions under section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013. The listings have been further affected by intermittent staff shortages in court administration caused by industrial action and by delayed allocation of defence counsel under the Legal Aid Agency scheme — a frustration unfortunately familiar to this court in other complex proceedings of recent times. The court wishes to formally acknowledge the professionalism of the defence team, led by Mr Oliver Trask, instructed under a Legal Aid order, who managed to navigate these systemic challenges with appropriate diligence. The Court also recognises Ms Fiona Baxter QC, representing the Crown, who presented her case with clarity and rigour, reflective of her extensive experience in sensitive terrorism prosecutions. The procedural history also includes a report from the West Midlands Integrated Offender Management Unit, highlighting the tenuous nature of inter-agency cooperation in multi-disciplinary risk management forums. While MAPPA Category 3 processes were engaged following arrest, representatives from local social services noted difficulties in sustaining consistent engagement with the defendant’s community contacts, a not unusual problem in cases where ideology intertwines with social alienation. Such observations are pertinent to sentencing considerations, insofar as they affect possibilities for post-custodial supervision and rehabilitative intervention. It behooves the court to remark on the grim yet pervasive societal backdrop against which this case unfolds. The persistent rise in street homelessness and opportunistic street-level radicalisation are intertwined phenomena that exacerbate community vulnerability. So-called “hate crime” reports against minority groups continue to ascend, with attendant impact on community cohesion and trust in law enforcement. Though tangential to Mr H’s personal case, these realities inform the wider climate of risk with which contemporary court practitioners must grapple. There was also an earlier Prevent referral, made in late 2020 by an employer’s human resources officer following concerning expressions of grievance in emails relating to perceived workplace injustice and geopolitical conflicts abroad. That referral was subsequently closed after Mr H disengaged from formal Channel intervention, an outcome regrettably common given the voluntary nature of such programmes and the difficulty in sustaining long-term engagement with individuals holding entrenched extremist ideologies. The defendant entered pleas of not guilty at the initial hearing, maintaining these through to trial preparation. Only shortly before the crown commenced evidence, on 9 September 2025, did he change his plea to guilty on both counts. The lateness of this plea admission is a significant factor in the calculation of sentencing credit, as judicial authorities have made clear in numerous precedents. It is appropriate to remind ourselves of R v. Malley [2018] EWCA Crim 1234, in which the Court of Appeal reiterated that credit for a guilty plea is contingent on the timing and the effect on court resources and victims. Malley, convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent, had entered his plea on the morning of trial, after a three-week preliminary hearing. The court limited his discount to 10%, emphasising that credit aims to incentivise early acceptance of responsibility, thereby sparing the court and witnesses the burdens of trial. Similarly instructive is R v. Singleton [2022] EWCA Crim 1902, a case involving conspiracy to supply controlled substances disguised as precursors for explosives. The defendant there maintained a not guilty plea for over 18 months and only pleaded at short notice after hearing a detailed prosecution opening. The Court of Appeal declined to award more than 12.5% discount for the plea, underscoring that such credit was a reduction and not a right. It bears mention, too, that the court is mindful of R v. Greene [2023] EWCA Crim 85, where the defendant’s plea was delayed by assertions of mistaken identity. Greene’s plea late in proceedings was accepted, but with minimal credit awarded, particularly given the gravity of the importation offence with intent to distribute Class A substances enveloped in extensive shipping concealment. It must also be observed that while these precedents revolve around narcotics offences, the principle of timing and effect on public resources applies equally in terrorism jurisprudence, as cited in the recent judgment of R v. Jaworski [2024] EWCA Crim 617. Jaworski involved preparatory acts for chemical weapon manufacture and confirmed the importance of early pleas in mitigating sentence. These authorities collectively furnish the framework within which this court must proceed. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. Mr H’s engagement with digital platforms exhibited an evolution from disputatious commentary on foreign policy to the more concerning dissemination and possession of material linked to proscribed organisations. The Crown’s evidence includes linguistic forensic analysis performed by Dr Jeremy Falkner, whose report, tendered during trial, identified patterns of radical rhetoric deeply embedded within layered encryption and hidden virtual private network (VPN) activity. A recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The digital forensic material, seized during execution of warrants, comprised encrypted storage devices employing multi-factor authentication and advanced steganography techniques. Of note was a file container labelled “WinterProject,” an archive inaccessible to initial forensic parsing due to proprietary encryption. Subsequent decryption by NCCU specialists uncovered files detailing explosive formulation and dissemination plans partly redacted by court order. Although the defence argued Mr H’s acquisition of certain electronic components corresponded with his professed interests in amateur electronics and computer programming, the Crown demonstrated these acquisitions to mirror known precursors for improvised explosive devices as detailed in prior cases. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Irrelevant though to the matters at hand, the court takes note of evidence in R v. Harzing [2017] EWCA Crim 1747, a case involving a defendant convicted of criminal damage to grade-listed structures following an arson attack on a disused church in East Anglia. Though thematically distinct, that case reinforces the judicial approach to material damage inflicted by incendiary devices, a relevant consideration in the evaluation of Mr H’s dangerousness should he reoffend. The prosecution also drew attention to a small quantity of cannabis found in the flat’s bathroom cabinet, seized incidentally during warrants. The court records that no charges related to controlled substances have been pursued, which is consistent with practice in terrorism prosecutions where ancillary offences do not materially affect primary counts. There was also a mention, unconnected to Mr H, of a co-defendant involved in an unrelated arson and grievous bodily harm matter adjacent in time and location, serving as an example of complexities faced when multiple investigations unfold in overlapping geographies. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. Upon investigation, it was found that Mr H undertook travel to the Netherlands in September 2024, ostensibly for conference attendance relating to “renewable energy technologies.” However, surveillance and travel records indicated side trips to border regions known for extremist gatherings, and electronic communications placed him in contact with individuals later charged in connection with trafficking of explosive precursors. The defence posits that such contact was accidental, but the evidence weighs heavily against this assertion. Procedurally, the case has involved exhaustive disclosure—amounting to some 1,104 exhibit items. The process revealed challenges of inter-agency coordination, notably with the National Crime Agency and the House of Commons Digital Services team, whose involvement was limited to advising on the propriety of subpoenas directed at parliamentary email servers. The court further acknowledges receipt of character references from a bicycle repair workshop where the defendant volunteered community labour, as well as letters from the Birmingham Food Bank praising his participation in charitable distribution efforts in 2020. While such attestations demonstrate aspects of civic participation, they cannot mitigate the seriousness of offences involving terrorism preparation. The Legal Aid Agency’s performance in authorising expert witness instructions has been, regrettably, erratic in this case, despite repeated applications by defence counsel. Delays have frustrated timely receipt of psychological assessments, a reflection—sadly—not unique to terrorism cases but symptomatic of systemic funding pressures in the criminal defence domain. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations uncovered cryptocurrency transactions amounting to approximately £3,600, routed through anonymising “mixers” and ultimately linked to vendors allegedly supplying dual-use materials for explosives manufacture. The difficulty in tracing such transfers speaks to the broader challenge law enforcement faces from virtual currencies, an issue addressed by the 2023 Treasury Select Committee in their recent report on digital asset regulation. Public petitions submitted on behalf of Mr H are acknowledged, including those by a local environmental group, invoking his prior involvement in litter clearance campaigns on the River Rea, a laudable endeavour albeit unrelated to the instant offences. The court also notes with concern the long hours expended by CT Pol West Midlands intelligence officers in sifting through hours of closed circuit television, particularly the work of Detective Inspector Sayers, whose contribution exemplifies the painstaking nature of surveillance indicative of modern law enforcement work. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal profile, Mr H is 26 years old, with educational qualifications culminating in a foundation degree in electrical engineering. He was formerly employed by a regional telecommunications firm but was dismissed, according to a reference, for “wholly inappropriate sharing of sensitive technical material on social media platforms.” Letters from his mother and younger sister emphasise episodes of social withdrawal and express hope for rehabilitation, though also acknowledging a persistent reluctance by Mr H to engage with mental health services. The psychiatric evaluation provided by Dr Kiran Shah, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, concluded that while Mr H exhibits rigid cognitive schemas and strong moral absolutism, no formal diagnosis of a psychotic or mood disorder is appropriate. Notwithstanding, the report warns of a high risk of serious harm based on radical ideological functioning and potential for re-engagement in extremist activities if supervision lapses post-custody. The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! In mitigation, counsel for the defence has indicated a willingness to explore participation in intensive disengagement programmes, including the Counter-Terrorism Mental Health Pathway established through NHS England, while also requesting the court to consider the absence of prior convictions and the late plea in passing sentence. The prosecution, in response, submitted a detailed outline of aggravating factors, underscoring the sophisticated planning evident in the defendant’s conduct and the clear intent to facilitate indiscriminate harm, factors that warrant custodial sentences of considerable length under the Sentencing Council’s terrorism guidelines. The court is mindful of the relevant legal framework. The maximum penalty for the offence under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 is life imprisonment. The sentencing guidelines direct us to calibrate sentence severity by reference to culpability, degree of planning, and risk posed. This case epitomises the continuing challenge inherent in sentencing terrorism offences: the balance between deterrence, punishment, public protection, and the prospects for rehabilitation. The court notes the limited success rates of de-radicalisation and disengagement initiatives to date, as addressed in academic literature and official reviews in 2023 and 2024. In conclusion, this court will direct a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing psychological risk factors, suitability for various custodial rehabilitation programmes, and the prospects for parole supervision incorporating digital monitoring conditions and geographical exclusion orders. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2025, in Court 11 at the Crown Court at Birmingham.

FAIRBROOK Filed: 16 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence having been convicted after trial on charges contrary to sections 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences principally concern conduct occurring between March 2023 and Mr H’s arrest in January 2025. The defendant's case has been subject to numerous procedural stages since early 2025, including a contested pre-trial hearing on 17 April 2025, at which significant disputed disclosure issues were resolved. The adjournments occasioned by the COVID-19-induced delays to court operations should also be recorded—they have added a layer of complexity to the management of this matter, as has the sporadic industrial action affecting both court staff and judicial officers in the West Midlands Crown Court centre over the past six months. In the course of the proceedings the court has been provided with extensive reports from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), forensic digital analysts, and an independent forensic accountant. These documents outline a broad and sophisticated investigative operation utilising a blend of traditional surveillance methods, intrusive cyber analysis, and multi-jurisdictional intelligence sharing. Particular commendation is due to Detective Chief Inspector Rowan Evans for his persistence in overseeing this investigation amidst competing demands on his unit. It is well-recognised, albeit scarcely remarked upon in public debate, that the resources allocated to counter-terrorism remain under intense strain as rising demand meets finite operational capacity. Beyond the immediate ambit of this case, the court notes with some concern the documented pattern of rising antisocial behaviour in the city centre of Birmingham, as reported in the 2024 Annual Crime Statistics issued by the West Midlands Police Authority. Although unrelated to the defendant’s conduct, the polishing of CCTV infrastructure following a series of graffiti incidents on the Midland Metro line and the installation of new licensing conditions in night-time venues form part of the backdrop to the city’s broader public safety challenges. The unconnected arrest of a local man for affray during the October 2024 pub brawl between rival groups—resulting in serious injury to two bystanders—serves as a reminder of the manifold and varying dangers confronting enforcement agencies. These episodes, while peripheral, impinge on the overall operational climate faced by police officers tasked with the more high-profile investigations such as the present. A further procedural note: the defendant was remanded in custody throughout the pre-trial period save for a brief interval in September 2024 when bail was granted subject to stringent conditions including electronic monitoring and a curfew from 9pm to 6am. Bail was subsequently revoked following an application by the prosecution predicated upon alarm arising from the discovery of additional encrypted devices during a follow-up warrants search executed in early November 2024. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The court is reminded that the genesis of modern terrorism legislation in the United Kingdom can be traced to the legislative reforms enacted under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974, albeit significantly augmented over the ensuing decades. This framework has evolved steadily, most recently in the form of the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019. Though not directly applicable here, an understanding of the historical underpinnings contextualises the current statutory provisions under which Mr H has been convicted. In reviewing sentencing precedents, the court draws specific attention to R v. Bashir [2018] EWCA Crim 214, in which the Court of Appeal assessed the appropriate weight to be given to the possession of digital materials illustrating terrorist training manuals, emphasizing the categorisation of such possession not merely by the quantity of files involved but, more crucially, by the intended use and integration within wider preparatory activity. That case, alongside R v. Saeed [2020] EWCA Crim 557, underscores the judiciary’s recognition of the particular potency of digital communication in advancing terrorist aims and the resultant augmentation of culpability. Whilst not bearing on mitigation, Mr H’s educational achievements merit mention. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics from the University of Warwick, awarded with upper second-class honours in 2018. Professional references tendered by former colleagues at a Birmingham-based engineering consultancy praise his technical competence, attention to detail, and reliability, though both his line manager and HR observed concerns arising from his sudden withdrawal from workplace social events and mounting absences beginning January 2023. No formal grievance or disciplinary proceedings ensued during his tenure. The defendant’s personal history includes a protracted period of political disengagement from 2019 until mid-2022 when, according to a Channel panel referral dated August 2022, ideological concerns began to emerge. The Channel Case Management Panel’s documentation describes multi-agency attempts to engage Mr H in cognitive behavioural interventions, mentorship via community organisations, and referral to vocational re-training services—all of which were met with intermittent participation. Feedback from the Caldersfield Prevent Hub highlights both the complexity and ambiguity of counter-radicalisation efforts in cases where intrinsic motivation remains elusive. These attempts, whilst not halting the eventual offending, align with a model of intervention that stresses persistence over instant success. Not unconnected to the broader theme of mental health services, the court notes an ongoing national challenge in securing timely assessments within forensic psychiatry. The East Midlands NHS Foundation Trust has advised that waiting lists for secure psychological evaluation can presently extend beyond six months for medium security facilities. Despite this, expert psychiatric and psychological evaluations in the present case were completed within four weeks of remand, reflecting efficient collaboration between agencies. At the case management hearing of 28 March 2025 there was a note made on the court file referencing unavoidable interpreter service delays. Mr H’s preferred language being Urdu necessitated the use of a certified court-approved interpreter. On that occasion, the late arrival of the interpreter caused a 45-minute delay, emphasizing the quotidian operational frustrations faced by court officials and litigants alike. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. Investigators have presented enduring challenges in the examination of recovered encrypted data, including partitioned digital 'volumes' accessed via provisional key recovery techniques. This case presented similar hurdles as encountered in R v. Barakat [2021] EWCA Crim 381, where the possession of partial instruction sets for improvised explosive devices was deemed sufficient to uphold intent, notwithstanding the incompleteness of physicalised materials. The difficulty inherent in forensic validation of encrypted storage continues to prompt debate on evidential standards. A notable observation lies in the patterns of communication documented from the defendant’s devices, which include frequent references to a now-disbanded extremist network identified in intelligence assessments as “The Caledonian Initiative.” Notably, the network's public activity had ceased some two years prior to the defendant’s arrest, although archival fragments remained extant on darkweb platforms. At the sentencing stage, the Crown invites the court to treat the reproduction of symbolic references to past atrocities as aggravating, arguing that the defendant’s online posts sought not only to memorialise but to incite. The defence, by contrast, characterise these posts as examples of the defendant’s distorted but misguided attempts at political commentary. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Whilst the court acknowledges the relevance of such material to establishing intent and mindset, it must separate the defendant's actions from the broader genealogies of extremist literature. The proliferation of digital content presenting political violence in glamorised form—although widespread across many subcultures—cannot alone establish criminality absent demonstrable intent to effectuate harm. In this vein, R v. Sheikh [2019] EWCA Crim 1549 offered considered guidance on the evidential distinction between rhetorical extremism and preparatory conduct. Further forensic analysis revealed the presence of video files depicting the construction of homemade mortars, with time-stamped modifications corresponding to dates shortly preceding covert surveillance observations of Mr H engaging in visits to industrial estates on the outskirts of Birmingham. These findings, supported by witness statements from manufacturing specialists employed nearby, contributed to establishing the depth of the preparation undertaken. A remark from the defence that such materials might have been collected for academic or research purposes is not supported by accompanying contextual evidence. The court recalls, however, that a certain degree of intellectual curiosity regarding ordnance design features in many innocuous disciplines such as history of technology or chemistry. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The court notes that alongside the more incriminating digital artefacts, investigators retrieved several personal artefacts believed to relate to normal recreational pursuits, including a set of vintage vinyl records, a model railway set, and assorted botanical books. Such items offer little to no insight into criminality and invoke reminiscences of passing cultural fashions, albeit alien in a counter-terrorism investigation. Equally tangential are the contemporaneous, though uncharged, allegations of noise nuisance lodged against the landlord of the property the defendant occupied. Complaints concern persistent late-night music and associated disturbances, yet no direct link has been established to the defendant himself. Similarly, local community forums have referenced sporadic incidents of antisocial behaviour in the neighbourhood, including unconnected fly-tipping and minor damage to public transportation signage. These occurrences, while indicative of broader social concerns, are distinctions unrelated to the present sentencing. The defendant has no previous convictions for offences involving violence, possession of weapons, or public order breaches. It is noteworthy, however, that his former roommate was subject to police enquiry in 2022 following the discovery of a small quantity of cannabis during an unrelated search warrant; the defendant was not implicated or present at that time. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. International travel records indicate that Mr H undertook a short visit to Lithuania in late 2023. The defence reports this trip was purely touristic, though it is recorded that on the day of arrival he made contact with an individual later revealed to have links to a prohibited organisation under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The Crown points to this as indicative of the defendant’s efforts to broaden operational networks. It may be remarked that the process of inter-agency cooperation involving the Metropolitan Police Service and Europol played a decisive role in mapping this cross-border relationship. Such cooperation, however, is not always seamless. For example, a recent case involving a co-defendant on a related prosecution recorded procedural delays caused by administrative errors between national liaison points, resulting in the temporary loss of crucial forensic evidence. Further procedural observation is made of the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of funding requests for expert evidence. The defence solicitor’s applications for psychiatric assessment were delayed by six weeks due to internal processing backlogs despite repeated follow-ups. This unfortunate trend of under-resourced support impairs the constitutional right to a fair trial and is a matter of continuing concern across the legal sector. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The defendant engaged the services of a forensic accountant specialising in cryptocurrency transactions. Her analysis traced a transfer of £3,500 to an unregulated exchange operating primarily through overseas servers. Such financial transactions, increasingly ubiquitous in criminal milieus, present complex investigatory challenges given the anonymisation techniques utilised. The court reflects on the seminal guidance of R v. Eqar [2020] EWCA Crim 280 regarding the evidentiary threshold for establishing knowledge and intention in cases involving digital assets. Although cryptocurrency affords plausible deniability for defendants, the courts have displayed an increasing willingness to infer culpability from transactional patterns and contextual factors. There is also an emerging phenomenon of so-called “crypto tumblers” or “mixers,” which obfuscate transaction trails through complex layering protocols. The operational difficulty faced by law enforcement agencies in unmasking terrorist financing networks amplified via such devices cannot be overstated. In a separate development of no direct bearing on Mr H, the recent conviction of his former employer’s finance manager for embezzlement and benefit fraud necessitated unrelated audits and has drawn media attention due to the company’s regional prominence. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Personal mitigation material confirms that Mr H is a 30-year-old man of stable family background. Letters from his sister, Ms Rania Hashim, portray a younger brother trapped by isolation and ideology, recalling shared childhood experiences in Birmingham’s Lozells district. Ms Hashim’s correspondence, formally presented to the court by the defence solicitor, stresses the psychological pull of online echo chambers and the limited opportunities for reintegration he faced after redundancy from technical employment in late 2022. The court has also received written submissions from the Black Country Resettlement Trust, which has offered support for Mr H’s continued engagement with vocational training and possible mentoring following release. While their intervention is commendable, one must guard against undue optimism in cases where prior efforts to disrupt extremist pathways have faltered. Comparable community-based projects have encountered challenges, particularly given widespread public scepticism and fluctuating funding streams. For instance, the recently publicised collapse of the Midlands Youth Outreach Programme due to budgetary shortfalls leaves a vacuum in youth engagement efforts within the local area. Expert psychiatric evidence presented by Dr Miriam Feldman confirms no formal diagnosis of mental disorder nor any indication of diminished responsibility. The report notes, however, the presence of “significant cognitive inflexibility and a propensity for dualistic moral reasoning,” which are identified as risk factors for entrenched extremist belief systems. The assessed risk of serious harm remains elevated absent substantial therapeutic engagement. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. It should be remarked that the 2023 Sentencing Council guidelines for terrorism set out a structured approach whereby factors such as the seriousness of intended harm, degree of planning, and potential for casualties must be carefully balanced against mitigating circumstances. The overarching principles emphasise public protection, deterrence, and the necessity of reflecting the gravity of offending. Within that framework, the court acknowledges limited mitigating factors: the defendant’s lack of prior convictions, earlier steps to engage with community services, and eventual guilty plea—albeit entered late in proceedings after overwhelming evidence and at the threshold of trial. This court must take a firm stance reflective of the seriousness of the offences and the tangible threat posed by the defendant's planning and preparations. The presence of materials indicative of explosive manufacturing, combined with the defendant’s deliberate efforts to obscure communication channels and use cryptocurrency to finance further activities, significantly elevate culpability. I direct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared with particular attention to Mr H’s rehabilitation prospects, risk of reoffending, and suitability for participation in focused deradicalisation and cognitive-behavioural programmes. The Probation Service is also asked to assess housing stability, access to vocational training, and psychological support arrangements. The court also wishes to place on record its appreciation for the work of all agencies involved in the investigation and prosecution of this case, including Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service, and the Digital Forensics Unit of the West Midlands Police. Despite resource pressures and competing priorities, their diligent efforts have been exemplary.

Mr H Case No. B2025/29843 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. Greenwood Filed: 22 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence, having pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is said to have taken place during the period from October 2023 to his arrest in March 2025. Mr H was arrested at 07:18 on 12 March 2025 under a warrant issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, executed by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at a residential address in the Stapleton district of Bristol. The warrant followed intelligence received from the Security Service, which had monitored encrypted communications linked to a user alias apparently controlled by Mr H. At the time of the arrest, several digital devices were seized, including a desktop computer, multiple encrypted storage mediums, and a hand-crafted electronic device resembling a detonator module. The investigation, codenamed Operation CORONET, combined traditional law enforcement techniques with advanced cyber-forensic analysis. Of particular note was the extensive use of social media scraping, metadata correlation, and pattern-of-life analysis integrating data from gsm providers and public CCTV networks across the city. Given the specialist resources engaged and the sustained manpower over several weeks, the case exemplifies the strain on counter-terrorism policing units increasingly called upon to monitor a vast digital and physical footprint. The following paragraphs set out the context in which this case has proceeded. The defendant has been remanded in custody since arrest, having been refused bail at the initial hearing. During that hearing, submissions by the defence sought to cite the historic ruling in R v. Chiswell [1999] 1 Cr App R 457 on the importance of presumption of innocence and the stringent requirements on prosecution for bail refusal in terrorism-related proceedings. The court, however, having reviewed the risk assessments presented and the potential for interference with evidence or witness intimidation, was satisfied bail was inappropriate. At the plea and case management hearing on 30 July 2025, Mr H entered guilty pleas to both counts. These pleas, while welcomed, arrived only after the scheduling of witness statements, expert reports, and a jury trial arrangement were effectively complete. The court accordingly notes that the credit for plea must be accordingly limited to account for the late admission of guilt. In assessing appropriate sentencing, it is necessary to look to the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline, issued in 2023, which provides a framework for weighing culpability and harm. The court is mindful of the precedents established in R v. Zakir [2023] EWCA Crim 951 and R v. Patel [2022] EWCA Crim 1090, which both emphasise the importance of general deterrence and public protection in offences of this gravity. It is appropriate, at this juncture, to recall the unfortunate challenges posed by current resource constraints across multiple front-line agencies. The Probation Service, for example, has reported a significant shortfall in officers specialising in high-risk terrorism cases. Reports submitted last year point to vacancy rates exceeding 20% in key senior practitioner positions, impairing both supervision and risk management capacity. Similarly, NHS forensic mental health services carry heavy caseloads with wait times for comprehensive assessments extending beyond 14 weeks in some regions. These systemic pressures inevitably influence the advisory capacity available to courts determining sentencing outcomes in matters such as this. This court’s appreciation is extended to the Legal Aid Agency and the defence counsel team led by Mr Thomas Merrick, instructed under a standard graduated representation order. Their diligent efforts in navigating complex disclosure, technical analysis, and procedural challenges—despite the increasing administrative burden—are acknowledged. It is regrettable to report, however, that delays in approval of funds for a second expert psychiatric evaluation occasioned a tribunal adjournment on 9 September 2025. Such delays serve as an unwelcome reminder that administrative bottlenecks have tangible consequences for justice delayed and potential prejudice. A “Channel” referral was made in April 2022 by a community youth leader after Mr H shared extremist literature during a workshop on political activism. That referral was eventually closed following limited engagement and an absence of forthcoming self-referral or any demonstrable progression towards de-radicalisation. The experience reflects wider challenges within the Channel framework whereby diffuse criteria and resource limitations may lead to attrition of cases deemed at risk but lacking overt markers of imminent threat. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This court notes the similarity of investigative techniques used in Operation CORONET to those deployed in Operation NIGHTSHADE, which culminated in the prosecution of two other individuals who had been surveilled for possession and distribution of improvised explosive device (IED) materials in 2024. Those defendants, however, had maintained not guilty pleas until the eve of trial, and their convictions resulted primarily from surveillance intercepts and covert informant testimony. None of those facts alter the present reasoning vis-à-vis Mr H’s culpability, but they do speak to the highly resource-intensive nature of these investigations, often spanning multiple jurisdictional boundaries. It is also necessary to give some contextual consideration to the legal environment laid out by previous pertinent cases. In R v. Luthra [2021] EWCA Crim 738, the Court of Appeal found that possession of radicalising material without direct evidence of intent to further terrorist acts must nonetheless be viewed in the broader context of conduct, rather than in isolation. That approach has informed our understanding of both mens rea and the evidence threshold required. A history of related-but-unconnected criminality finds no place in this sentencing exercise, but it is nonetheless proper to note that Mr H’s flatmate, residing at the address searched in March 2025, was subsequently found in possession of a small quantity of cannabis during unrelated inquiries in June 2025 and is currently subject to a community resolution. While entirely peripheral to Mr H’s offending, the police records demonstrate the diversity of co-habitant behaviour routinely encountered in cases of this nature. Several letters of support were submitted on Mr H’s behalf, including one from the Bristol Environmental Action Network praising his voluntary involvement in urban tree planting, a cause unrelated to his radical conduct but emblematic of commitments testifying to character dimensions sometimes overlooked in adjudication. The court accepts these contributions as evidence of complex personal history, yet the centrality of his conduct within the Terrorism Act offences remains paramount. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. A digital analysis report lodged on behalf of the Crown detailed Mr H’s progressive online activity, demonstrating a clear trajectory from passive content consumption to active dissemination of extremist manuals and encrypted communication with persons linked to proscribed organisations. This is consistent with findings in R v. Delgado [2024] EWCA Crim 1462 where the Court reiterated that the possession and sharing of incendiary literature evidences intent when accompanied by preparatory acts. Electronic forensic examination uncovered encrypted correspondence between Mr H and foreign nationals affiliated with extremist networks operating in the Levant region. The defense counsel contested the interpretation of some exchanges as innocuous, referencing a literary analysis by Dr Sonia Beckett that suggested some allegorical and metaphorical language inconsistent with culpability. This court, having carefully balanced those submissions, is satisfied on the preponderance that the communications evidenced serious preparatory conduct. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The court is mindful that possession of certain objects with the potential for legitimate use may be capable of innocent explanation. Mr H’s possession of components identified as dual-use technology, including certain circuit boards and mechanical parts, was asserted by defence counsel to be consistent with his stated employment history in precision engineering. Nonetheless, the overarching contextual evidence convinces the court of a terrorist purpose. Independent of the core facts, it is noteworthy that in 2020, Mr H received a fixed penalty notice for a minor traffic offence, namely parking contravention in a controlled zone in central Bristol. While wholly irrelevant to the instant case, this anecdote is emblematic of minor regulatory breaches that often emerge incidentally during forensic investigation. In its pre-sentence report, the Probation Service emphasises the need for an Integrated Offender Management approach to sentencing and post-custodial supervision, noting that monitoring technology including GPS tracking and internet access restrictions will be integral to mitigating risk. The report flags concerns raised in the literature about limited successful community reintegration following terrorism-related convictions, with recidivism rates remaining a subject of ongoing research. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Another point of procedural interest concerns a co-defendant, arrested in association with this investigation but who absconded from bail and is currently the subject of an active warrant. That individual’s alleged offences include possession of bladed articles and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. Such charges, duly documented in police reports, are entirely unconnected to Mr H’s adjudicated offences but form part of the broader operational backdrop against which this case unfolded. Indeed, during the early investigative phase, officers encountered evidence suggestive of criminal damage pertaining to a graffiti campaign targeting public transport infrastructure in Bristol city centre. Those incidents, involving a series of taggings on bus shelters and train stations between May and November 2024, remain unsolved and bear no nexus to Mr H himself. The court must be scrupulous in ensuring that such extraneous facts do not influence sentencing considerations. The management of disclosure in this case was particularly challenging. An initial backlog at the National Crime Agency’s Digital Hub delayed processing by three weeks, compounded by the COVID-19 related shortage of forensic staff, illustrating ongoing systemic pressures on evidential examination in terrorism prosecutions nationwide. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. International travel history presented some intriguing details. Records show that Mr H travelled to Brussels and Luxembourg on a claim of professional conferences between April and June 2024. During those periods, intelligence reports suggest attendance at private meetings involving unidentified individuals with known extremist sympathies. Defence submissions sought to downplay these trips as innocuous business networking, but the court finds the pattern consistent with preparatory activity. The special difficulty of monitoring movement within the European Union remains a challenge for law enforcement and is the subject of active bilateral discussions post-Brexit. On the subject of procedural history, it is expedient to note that the case was briefly adjourned on 2 August 2025 due to a shortfall in available interpreter services for a key witness, reflecting the chronic shortage of qualified linguistic experts in the criminal justice system. This is illustrative of wider systemic issues affecting timely and fair trial conduct, particularly in terrorism-related matters involving multi-national actors. Several other matters bear brief mention. The defendant’s father is currently subject to unrelated criminal proceedings for alleged benefit fraud. That fact, introduced in defence applications for leniency on grounds of family stress, is not material to the offence before this court but demonstrates the wider social complexities often present in such cases. A report dated 8 September 2025 from the forensic psychology unit at Southmead Hospital provides a detailed assessment of Mr H’s mental health. Consultant psychologist Dr Elaine Morton found no clinical diagnosis of mental illness, but noted “highly rigid cognitive patterns and a marked propensity for absolutist ideological reasoning.” The assessment concluded that Mr H poses a significant and ongoing risk of serious harm linked to extremist ideology without substantial rehabilitative intervention. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations revealed a series of cryptocurrency transactions from accounts traced to Mr H, including payments totalling approximately £3,800 to darknet vendors offering dual-use chemical precursors. The court is mindful of the growing use of digital currencies in terrorism financing, as outlined in Home Office guidance from late 2024, and the difficulties encountered by law enforcement in tracing such payments through anonymising “mixer” technologies. It is instructive to consider the jurisprudence surrounding possession of “ingredients” for terrorism. In R v. Bailey [2022] EWCA Crim 678, it was held that where the totality of evidence demonstrates an intent to produce devices or materials for terrorist purposes, possession merits a custodial sentence commensurate with that intent regardless of actual completed manufacture. The present case aligns with that principle. Covert surveillance logs presented to the court describe an occasion in late November 2024 where Mr H travelled to a location on the outskirts of Bath. The footage required cross-referencing from three different camera sources and involved over 120 analyst hours to verify identity and activity due to poor lighting and obstructed views. Such meticulous surveillance is emblematic of the labour-intensive processes modern counter-terrorism units employ. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal circumstances again, Mr H is 31 years old and holds a MSc in applied physics. He was employed as a materials research technician until his resignation in July 2023 — a resignation precipitated by a workplace dispute regarding safety compliance reporting. Character references submitted attest to his intelligence and analytical skills but concede he is socially withdrawn. Particularly of note are testimonials from the Bristol Voluntary Literacy Scheme, where Mr H volunteered intermittently over three years, assisting adults with reading difficulties. The scheme praised his patience and commitment but acknowledged that engagement diminished markedly in the year prior to the offences. These contributions demonstrate elements of positive social involvement, though the court does not regard them as sufficient to outweigh the gravity of the offence. Pre-sentence reports have suggested exploration of structured disengagement programmes tailored for ideologically motivated offenders, including the “Pathways to Breakaway” initiative trialled in the Midlands. The success rates of such programmes remain under evaluation, with concerns about post-release disengagement and corroborating evidence of relapse. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. In closing, the court emphasises the seriousness of the offence: a methodical and sustained effort to prepare for acts capable of inflicting multiple casualties and disruption. Aggravating features include the technological sophistication of the preparations, the deliberate targeting of public spaces, and the ideological motivation underpinning the conduct. Limited mitigation is offered by educational attainment, lack of previous convictions, and some belated acknowledgment expressed in guilty pleas. The court will direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service. Such report should include assessment of continued risk, feasibility of custodial and extended supervision measures including electronic monitoring, potential for engagement in tailored deradicalisation interventions, and consideration of ancillary support to address social and psychological factors. The balance between public protection and rehabilitative opportunity must be carefully navigated in this challenging context. Sentencing will be reserved pending receipt and consideration of that report and any further representations from the parties. The court records its thanks to Ms Sarah Langdon appearing for the Crown and Mr Thomas Merrick for the defence. The layout of this courtroom recently underwent refurbishment, and the court wishes to acknowledge the efforts of the Court Usher and clerk in facilitating proceedings without disruption, notwithstanding occasional technical difficulties experienced with microphone systems earlier in the day.

Mr H Case No. B2025/19857 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. WHITAKER Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court to be sentenced following his conviction on two counts arising under the Terrorism Act 2006. The first count relates to engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a), and the second count concerns possession of articles for a purpose connected to terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending behaviour has been temporally situated between the summer of 2023 and his arrest in late February 2025. The case has been subject to a protracted procedural history. The initial arrest occurred on 26 February 2025 under a warrant executed at a residential address in the Erdington district of Birmingham. That warrant was obtained under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following intelligence intercepts indicating suspicious encrypted communications, which implicated Mr H in activities suggestive of preparatory steps towards an act of terrorism. These communications had been detected by the National Counter Terrorism Network and subsequently corroborated by technical surveillance measures. At the time of arrest, numerous electronic devices were seized, including encrypted smartphones, external drives, and a range of computer peripherals. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation which culminated in Mr H’s apprehension involved multiple agencies, including the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and officers specialised in digital forensics. The evidence gathered was complex in nature, incorporating digital traces, covert intelligence, and intercepted communications. The volume of material generated significant challenges, not least due to the necessity of balancing national security considerations with the requirements of full disclosure consistent with the principles of open justice. This court acknowledges with regret the delays occasioned at various pretrial stages owing to procedural constraints and resource limitations, notably within the Legal Aid Agency. Defence counsel experienced hurdles in obtaining timely authorisation for instructing independent experts to review the voluminous digital exhibits, which regrettably contributed to adjournments of case management and trial preparation hearings. Such administrative obstacles highlight systemic strains impacting the fair and expedient administration of justice in complex terrorism-related proceedings. The defendant was remanded in custody following initial hearings and denied bail, a decision affirmed on appeal. During his detention in custody, Mr H was engaged by probation, security liaison officers, and mental health professionals, all of whom reported difficulties in eliciting substantive cooperation or insight to assist formulating risk assessments. Historically, the legislation under which Mr H was convicted, notably the Terrorism Act 2006, evolved as a response to shifting modes of terrorist threat. It embodies the imperative for preemptive intervention, recognising the catastrophic potential of preparatory conduct and the need to disrupt plots at an incipient stage. Section 5 criminalises conduct preparatory to terrorism, even before overt acts occur, a legislative circumscription subject to robust judicial oversight and potent safeguards. Early references during these proceedings were made to the case of R v. Anwar [2011] EWCA Crim 1235, where the Court of Appeal underlined the significance of assessing preparatory offences within the spectrum of criminal culpability balancing public protection and liberty. Though factually distinct, the legal principles enunciated remain apposite: preparatory conduct may be sufficient to justify a custodial sentence, especially where sophistication and proximity to completion are discerned. The court’s analysis is further informed by the longstanding principles articulated in R v. Ahmed [2009] EWCA Crim 2323, emphasising that possession of materials with terrorist intent is not in itself determinative; rather, the surrounding circumstances, including intention and effect, remain determinative. It is not a closed inquiry but a holistic evaluation of conduct against articulated legislative purposes. A preventive framework such as MAPPA was engaged at the multiplicity of levels appropriate to Mr H’s assessed risk—Category 3, reflecting concerns about potential terrorist-related harm requiring interagency coordination without the involvement of the probation service in direct case management. The efficacy of such arrangements is dependent on information-sharing, resource allocation, and maintaining vigilance amid strains induced by rising caseloads in counter-terrorism policing. It is lamentable that the strain on national mental health services, and community support networks, compounded difficulties in managing defendants like Mr H. NHS forensic psychiatric provision remains under intense pressure, with waits spanning months for comprehensive assessment; the commissioning bodies must take note of systemic shortfalls evident across multiple recent trials and sentencing hearings. Prior to the trial, a detailed psychiatric evaluation was commissioned, culminating in a report submitted by Dr Sheila Mortimer, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Midlands Secure Unit. She described the defendant’s psychological profile with cautious precision. Despite exhibiting indications of rigid and absolutist thought patterns, no formal diagnosis of psychotic disorder or personality disorder was made. Dr Mortimer emphasised the defendant’s firm ideological convictions, often articulated in binary terms, which rendered disengagement challenging outside a structured, longitudinal therapeutic context. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. Media attention was notably subdued in this matter, perhaps reflecting the public sensitivity attendant upon terrorism trials. It is a well-documented phenomenon that the routine exposure of such cases is curtailed significantly to prevent prejudice, operational compromise, or public alarm. Nevertheless, procedural transparency has been rigorously maintained, subject to standard reporting restrictions and closed material procedures, where justified. Prior to sanctioning the trial date, the court was informed of a “Prevent” referral initiated in early 2022 arising from concerns raised by an educational professional following Mr H’s attendance at a community college sociology course. His academic submissions included extended quotations from incendiary and extremist texts, which, whilst couched in academic language, suggested a trajectory meriting intervention under the Channel Framework. Despite offers of support, engagement was sporadic and limited in impact. Staff within the Prevent Hub were conscientious and professional in their dealings, as evinced by correspondence tendered in mitigation, which detailed numerous outreach attempts. They administered various engagement programmes focused on critical thinking and resilience against extremist propaganda, complemented by mentorship schemes with respected community leaders. The efficacy of such interventions, in cases marked by deep-seated ideological adherence and recalcitrance, remains variable. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defendant’s seized electronic devices included a collection of files encrypted within a VeraCrypt volume. Expert testimony confirmed that these contained instructional materials consistent with those used by proscribed organisations. The court accepts the Crown’s contention that possession extended beyond mere curiosity or research and indicated a deliberate effort to acquire and preserve such materials for preparatory use. In the course of trial, the defence advanced the argument that the materials could plausibly be related to innocuous interests, citing Mr H's documented hobby of historical reenactment and interest in pyrotechnics. Notwithstanding, this court finds that the evidential weight, when considered collectively with the pattern of conduct and communications, wholly undermines such assertions. It is prudent to note that Mr H’s digital footprint contained numerous attempts to procure dual-use materials — substances and devices which may serve both legitimate scientific uses and potential exploitation in manufacture of explosive devices. These logs were subject to arduous forensic analysis, placing great demands on the National Cyber Crime Unit, whose capacity is increasingly stretched amid rising threats and competing priorities. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. It was apparent that the defendant exhibited a marked preference for secure communications, employing end-to-end encrypted messaging applications with ephemeral message retention. The technical complexities encountered in decrypting this traffic prolonged investigative efforts, a factor not to be underappreciated given the scarcity of expert staff qualified in the necessary disciplines. It is a regrettable but familiar fact that such investigations prolong pre-trial detention and pose challenges to defence preparation. Nevertheless, these are the realities of prosecuting offences touching on national security. Of some background interest, unrelated to Mr H, the court notes this jurisdiction’s recent experience with cases of importation of Class A narcotics concealed within commercial freight consignments — a matter which, while extraneous here, has taxed the capacity of the West Midlands Ports Authority and the regional Customs Enforcement Unit. Further, the present court has received reports concerning an unrelated co-defendant in a neighbouring jurisdiction involved in violent disorder arising from a pub brawl involving pool cues. While no evidential nexus exists with the defendant, such matters illustrate the breadth of challenges confronting criminal justice agencies in maintaining order. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. Turning to matters personally concerning Mr H, the court has before it a series of character references and family letters, including support penned by the defendant's sister. These communications describe a man of reserved temperament, punctilious in manner, and possessing qualities of conscientiousness in prior employment. He voluntarily participated in community gardening schemes and provided assistance in local food bank operations prior to November 2023. Notwithstanding these contributions, it must be underscored that commendable community engagement does not mitigate the deliberate engagement in criminal conduct of this nature. The law neither excuses nor diminishes culpability on this basis. Of interest to the court, a local housing association report notes that Mr H’s tenancy has been generally well-maintained. There have been no reported noise nuisance complaints during his occupancy, and the landlord has provided evidence of timely rental payments. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation uncovered evidence of cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H, involving transfers of modest sums to privacy-focused digital wallets associated with darknet markets. These transactions were meticulously traced by forensic accounting specialists at the National Crime Agency. The court notes the increasing utilisation of such means for clandestine financial exchanges, posing an ongoing challenge to financial intelligence units. It is salient, although ultimately tangential here, that law enforcement agencies encounter frequent cases involving the exportation of counterfeit luxury goods, often facilitated via parcel networks on which Mr H’s transactions bear no relation. The disproportionate number of open cases related to fly-tipping in green-belt zones within the West Midlands also merits brief comment — a disorderly environmental phenomenon that strains Local Authority enforcement teams but is, again, quite dissociated from this trial. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant’s educational record comprises an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from a regional university, with commendations from professors highlighting analytical aptitude and diligence. He maintained steady employment until mid-2023, when he resigned following conflict related to the company’s security vetting procedures. It is noted that Mr H’s handwriting, exhibited in letters to the court and correspondence with probation, was legible and neatly formatted, reflecting a methodical and organized disposition. The probabilistic risk assessment presented by the probation service identifies Mr H as presenting a high risk of serious harm, necessitating comprehensive supervision post-sentence. The report recommends exploration of eligibility for Enhanced Offender Management alongside engagement in specialised deradicalisation programmes. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. Professor Julian Stokes, a forensic psychologist with extensive experience in counter-terrorism risk assessment, provided expert evidence. His report characterises Mr H as exhibiting pronounced cognitive rigidity and an ideological monoculture resistant to challenge. No diagnosable mental illness was identified; rather, entrenched belief systems were deemed the principal factor underpinning behaviour. Professor Stokes emphasises that disengagement, while potentially attainable through structured therapeutic interventions such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, will require sustained engagement and is not guaranteed. The risk of relapse or re-engagement remains significant in the absence of robust supervision frameworks. Of note, Professor Stokes addresses the difficulties posed by elevated threat levels and the attendant societal sensitivities. He advises caution in balancing necessary public protection with the risk of fostering community alienation. This sentencing exercise, as ever, mandates careful calibration. On one hand lies the imperative to protect the public from genuinely harmful conduct committed with a destructive and relentless purpose. On the other stands the necessity of avoiding punitive extremity where mitigating factors can be taken into proper account. This court is mindful, too, of the broader societal context. In recent years, urban centres have witnessed marked increases in street homelessness, public begging, and antisocial behaviour. Whilst these trends are unrelated to the present offence, they reflect strains upon policing and social services that indirectly influence public sentiments and institutional capacities. The multiplicity of agencies involved in managing the defendant’s case—from the Prevent Hub, through multi-agency risk panels, to front-line probation officers—demonstrates the complexity introduced by legislative and administrative frameworks designed to safeguard national security while upholding individual rights. The bureaucratic burden this imposes is substantial. With continuing staff shortages and resource constraints, agencies often operate at or beyond capacity. Justice demands both rigor and compassion. It is incumbent upon judicial actors, public servants, and community partners to ensure decisions made are neither precipitous nor complacent. The delicate balance between liberty and security lies at the heart of terror-related sentencing. This case has been complicated not merely by the nature of the offences but also by the extraneous procedural events, including the erstwhile malfunction of interpreter services, the late arrival of court clerks overseeing digital evidence presentation, and an unrelated transcription error in Court 4 that necessitated brief adjournments. Recognition is due to the prosecution team led by Ms Fiona Halliday, whose advocacy has been focused and professional throughout. Equally, the efforts of Mr David Kemp, instructed on behalf of the defence, are acknowledged; he navigated a challenging evidential landscape with perseverance amidst systemic frustrations. The court is grateful to the ushers and administrative staff, whose diligence ensured this hearing proceeded smoothly, despite the length and procedural complexity involved. It should not be underestimated how the maintenance of courtroom order underpins not only decorum but public confidence in judicial processes. In summary, Mr H’s conduct is appraised as falling within the higher culpability bracket under the Sentencing Council Terrorism Guidelines 2023. Features elevating seriousness include the sophistication of planning, clear intent to cause widespread harm, and the deliberate acquisition of restricted materials. Mitigation is confined to his absence of prior convictions, educational accomplishments, late guilty pleas entered after significant pre-trial preparation, and some community support evidenced by family and voluntary organisations. Credit for these pleas is accordingly restricted to one-sixth, reflecting their timing at the near close of proceedings. The court has regard to the authorities of R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64; R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568; and the recent analysis in R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, which together frame the sentencing approach to terrorism offences, underscoring deterrence and public protection as dominant considerations. In accordance with established practice, the preparation of a pre-sentence report is absolutely essential. The probation service is requested to evaluate the feasibility of a sentence incorporating elements of long-term supervision, psychological intervention tailored to extremist cognition, and technologically enabled monitoring, including electronic tagging if appropriate. Consideration is also requested regarding the suitability, availability, and anticipated effectiveness of specialist rehabilitative programming, including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme and cognitive behavioural modules that target impulsivity and risk recognition. The court reserves final sentencing until receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further relevant material, including representations from both the defence and Crown. It is hoped that forthcoming procedural steps can be conducted without protracted delay. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. They have been transcribed and filed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript has been recorded under the auspices of the court registrar.

DIAMOND Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court charged with one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is said to have occurred between March 2023 and the defendant’s arrest on 12 January 2025. The indictment arises against a backdrop of sustained and resource-heavy counter-terrorism operations coordinated by the Southwest Counter Terrorism Unit (SWCTU) working alongside digital forensic experts from the National Cybercrime Agency. The arrest followed the execution of search warrants at the defendant’s home address in Filton, Bristol, where multiple items allegedly linked to terror-related activity were recovered. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It bears emphasis that the investigation which led to Mr H’s arrest was preceded by a prolonged surveillance period lasting some nine months. This encompassed covert technological monitoring, intercepted communications obtained under the rigorous standards laid down in R v. Cushley [2014] EWCA Crim 863, and traditional human intelligence. It must be borne in mind that deploying Section 43B warrants, as in this case, is a non-trivial exercise requiring the balancing of privacy rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights against the pressing imperative of public protection. Throughout the pre-trial process, various interlocutory hearings took place, some of which were adjourned due to defence applications for disclosure of classified material by the Security Service. Such applications required engagement with the oversight body established under the Justice and Security Act 2013, underscoring the sensitivity of the material. It is lamentable, though not uncommon, that such rulings often delay proceedings by several weeks or months. Parallel to criminal proceedings, a referral had previously been undertaken under the Prevent programme, originating in late 2022. This came about following concerns raised by a workplace supervisor concerning Mr H’s expressed views on social media platforms, referencing polarising geopolitical events. The subsequent Channel panel, however, chose not to progress the case to formal intervention—an outcome reaffirmed in last year's guidance from the Home Office on Prevent engagements, emphasising proportionality and respect for free expression in the absence of clear risk indicators. Such procedural history is pertinent not only for understanding the investigative timeline but also for appreciating the various strands of public protection mechanisms designed to mitigate extremist threats in their infancy. It would be remiss to overlook the intense workload currently faced by these teams, as described in the 2024 report by the National Prevent Review Board, which highlighted chronic staffing shortages and budgetary pressures impinging upon front-line vigilance. It is also worth recapitulating that the defendant’s legal representation throughout has been provided by Mr Oliver Fenwick of Fenwick and Partners, who has this court’s thanks for his diligent, if sometimes belated, submissions. The Legal Aid Agency’s administration in this matter has, regrettably, occasionally bordered on fractious, with multiple requests for additional hours to cover electronic disclosure repeatedly refused or delayed, mirroring the perennial challenges experienced by defence teams across the country. At the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 5 May 2025, Mr H entered not guilty pleas to both counts. However, as the trial approached, the defendant changed course, pleading guilty on the first day of trial, 11 August 2025. This last-minute admission is characteristic—regrettably—of many cases of this nature, often reflecting not a spontaneous acceptance of responsibility but a tactical response to overwhelming evidential pressure. The issue of credit for such late guilty pleas has been extensively considered by the Court of Appeal, including in R v. D’Cruz [2023] EWCA Crim 1224, in which the Court emphasised that credit is an exercise in judicial discretion and must reflect the genuine mitigation of trial preparation rather than mere concession to unavoidable defeat. In that case, the 15-month delay in plea was met with a 15% reduction, acknowledging the limited benefit to the court and the Crown. Similarly, the rulings in R v. Barford [2024] EWCA Crim 1987, concerning late pleas in violent offences, set a useful precedent reaffirming the importance of credit being closely linked to timing and the extent to which the plea spared witnesses and the court from protracted contestation. Mr H’s conduct in this context demands careful differentiation. The Crown rightly notes the complexity and volume of disclosure, encompassing over 1,200 digital exhibits and extensive intercepted communications. Equally relevant is the degree of cooperation—or lack thereof—to date, including the defendant’s refusal to engage substantively with risk management teams during his period on bail. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Much of the evidence relied upon in this prosecution derives from open-source online material distributed via encrypted messaging platforms. For context, scholars of terrorism studies, such as Dr Fiona Calvert, have noted in her recent monograph “Digital Echo Chambers and Radicalisation” (University Press, 2024) that individuals engaged in the consumption and dissemination of proscribed ideological content are situated within a complex interplay of personal grievance and group identity dynamics. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The recovery of electronic media encrypted within secure containers was a pivotal part of the discovery process. The expert testimony delivered by the forensic analyst deputised from the Digital Evidence Recovery Unit revealed the painstaking efforts required to crack certain files, including the technological sophistication of the defendant demonstrated by reliance on plausible deniability encryption methods. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Mr H’s defence submit that portions of the digital evidence merely reflect academic curiosity or “exploration” divorced of operational intent. This court, after careful consideration of case law such as R v. Syed [2021] EWCA Crim 1135, finds such submission unconvincing where context indicates the purposeful collation of materials indicative of active preparation. It is relevant to mention here—though entirely peripheral to Mr H’s sentencing—that a co-defendant in an unrelated case before this court recently received a sentence for aggravated burglary involving coercive control. That matter, heard in February 2025, reflected the often intersecting yet legally distinct nature of organised crime and terrorism-related offending. Such distinctions underscore the need for precise adjudication of culpability. Nor is it inappropriate to observe the current pressures on mental health services, as reported in the NHS England Annual Report of 2024. Delays exceeding 18 weeks for forensic psychiatric assessments have compounded case backlogs, adversely impacting justice timetables in complex extremist cases. The defendant’s social history reveals a family background embedded in the engineering sector, with his father employed for many years at the Bristol Aerospace Manufacturing Plant. Letters from neighbours praise Mr H’s participation in local community clean-up initiatives and assistance with annual street fairs. While these civic activities merit acknowledgment, they do not and cannot excuse or mitigate the severity of the offences. Professional reports submitted to the court include an updated psychiatric evaluation dated 26 July 2025, authored by Dr Sheila Morley, consultant forensic psychiatrist at St Quentin’s Secure Unit. Dr Morley’s report, notable for its detailed psychological testing and clinical observation, diagnoses Mr H with obsessive-compulsive personality traits but does not indicate an Axis I disorder. She cautions, however, on the high risk of entrenched ideological fixation, especially in the absence of engagement with deradicalisation programmes. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. Consideration was given to the defendant’s travel record, which included a six-day visit to Sarajevo in autumn 2023. While Turkey and Syria remain common referral points for extremist activity, Bosnia-Herzegovina’s complex post-conflict history has occasionally been exploited by radical actors. Immigration checks confirm no irregularity in passport entries or exits, but the purpose of engagement remains disputed amid conflicting witness anecdotes. Such travel patterns must be understood within a wider phenomenon noted by counter-terrorism practitioners: a slide towards globalised, transnational networks facilitated by internet communication channels. Witnesses in recent inquiries have attested to the sustained recruitment efforts in European diaspora communities, a challenge which local authorities confront daily, often with scant statutory powers below a proscription threshold. In the course of the trial, the Crown produced an accounting of cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H, highlighting transfers totaling approximately £4,100 over an eighteen-month period to wallets associated with darknet marketplaces. The trend towards digital payments is explored in depth in the 2023 Security Service Annual Report, which raises concern over evolving methods of funding extremist networks. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The court notes with regret the disproportionate resources consumed in surveillance operations targeting Mr H. Surveillance teams reported consuming over 1,500 man-hours over six months, involving both human operatives and technical interception units. The financial and operational burden borne by law enforcement is substantial, diverting capacity from other pressing investigative priorities, including organised crime and serious violence policing. Analogously, in R v. Ulrich [2020] EWCA Crim 671, detention and surveillance were noted to strain the limits of routine policing budgets, raising broader societal questions about the sustainability of current counter-terrorism models. A further observation, tangential though it may be, concerns the unresolved policy questions regarding internet service providers’ (ISP) obligations to monitor and report extremist content. This issue, debated within parliamentary committees during 2024 and 2025, remains the subject of ongoing legislative review, with implications for both civil liberties and national security. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 30 years of age and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in environmental engineering from a recognised university. His employment history includes a brief tenure at a regional water treatment facility, from which he resigned following disciplinary proceedings related to unauthorised use of company technology to access extremist websites. Notably, community letters submitted in mitigation describe Mr H’s efforts to support educational outreach to disadvantaged youths. Such commendable undertakings, whilst not sufficient to outweigh the gravity of the offences, demonstrate the multifaceted nature of offenders and the challenges inherent in fully apprehending their complex motives. The defendant’s handwriting, assessed during examination of personal correspondence, is neat and precise, suggestive of methodical tendencies. This observation is deployed by defence counsel to suggest a capacity for measured reflection, though the court recognises this as neutral rather than determinative of offending. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. Professor Victoria Henley, forensic psychologist, reports an elevated propensity for dichotomous thought and rigid ideological adherence. She notes that Mr H does not meet diagnostic criteria for any formal mental illness but acknowledges the significant behavioral risks associated with his current cognitive framework. The professor recommends intensive psychological supervision coupled with community-based interventions post-release to mitigate recidivism. It is pertinent to highlight, though irrelevant for this sentencing, that the defendant’s brother faces unrelated proceedings for benefit fraud in another jurisdiction, a fact disclosed in mitigation but of no bearing on the charge before this court. The volume of submissions received from third parties merits mention. Numerous correspondence from faith-based organisations and civil rights groups express concern about the potential stigmatization of minority communities should sentencing be disproportionate. While the court respects these views, it must be guided solely by law and the paramount duty to protect the public. Finally, the court recognises the vigilance and professionalism displayed by the various agencies involved. The South West Regional Mental Health Trust and Probation Service both produced detailed reports despite ongoing staffing and budgetary constraints, reinforcing the systemic challenges faced by those tasked with managing complex cases at the nexus of criminal justice and mental health. This court orders the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. Attention should be paid to the viability of a high-intensity supervision programme under MAPPA Category 3, including considerations for electronic monitoring and potential exclusion zones. The Probation Service should also evaluate access to specialist deradicalisation interventions and the suitability of licensed premises for accommodation post-release. Sentencing will be adjourned pending receipt of these reports and any further representations from the parties. This approach ensures that all relevant information concerning risk, rehabilitation, and public protection is fully canvassed. These sentencing remarks are given this 18th day of August 2025 in Court 11 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of sentence and conviction will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for entry on the National Register.

L. MANSFIELD Filed: 17 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and a further count of possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism as proscribed by section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The indictment covers conduct spanning from September 2023 until the date of his arrest in May 2025. The defendant was initially arrested at his residence on 6 May 2025 pursuant to warrants executed by Counter-Terrorism Policing West Midlands. This followed a concerted intelligence operation, incorporating signals intelligence, human intelligence, and cyber-investigations. The warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, reflecting the gravity and sensitivity of the matter. At the time of arrest, officers found multiple digital devices including encrypted media and components consistent with dual-use technology. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The proceedings have been protracted, reflecting the complexity typical of terrorism-related cases in contemporary England and Wales. The sheer volume of material necessitated phased disclosure. The logistical challenges posed by the National Crime Agency in handling encrypted forensic artefacts have been well-documented during these hearings. Delays ensued primarily due to the capacity constraints at the National Technical Assistance Centre, compounded by the requirement for international collaboration with allied intelligence entities. Historical context is salient here. The legislative framework governing terrorism offences has evolved significantly since its introduction. Early versions of the Terrorism Act, such as the 2000 version, have been repeatedly amended and supplemented to address developing threats, including offshoots of ideological extremism manifesting in decentralized online communities. The amendment introduced by the Terrorism Act 2006 serves to supplement criminal liability, ensuring that preparatory acts absent immediate effect can nonetheless attract prosecution. The case of R v. AB [2014] EWCA Crim 627 remains pertinent, emphasising the scope of preparatory acts that fall within the ambit of section 5(1)(a). A plea and case management hearing took place on 23 June 2025 at Birmingham Crown Court, during which Mr H entered not guilty pleas. His counsel requested additional time for disclosure review and expert instruction. Subsequent hearings in July were delayed due to industrial action affecting court staff and attendant listing constraints. The adjournments, although regrettable, fall within the rights of the defence to adequate preparation. Defence counsel, Mr Jonathan Hale QC, has submitted a detailed defence statement outlining arguments around mens rea and the purported incidental nature of the possession charges. The court acknowledges the thoroughness of those submissions, as well as the able representation afforded by Mr Hale’s team. The prosecution is led by Ms Fiona Green, whose submissions have been clear, methodical, and consistently respectful of court protocols. It is routine but important to observe that in cases involving charges under terrorism legislation, the court balances individual rights and freedoms with the overriding need to protect the public from harm of catastrophic proportions. The judgment of Lord Kerr in R v Gul [2013] UKSC 64 clarifies that a broad, purposive interpretation is necessary to effectively confront modern terrorism threats while respecting the rule of law. The mental health and risk assessment reports note the ongoing strain on NHS secure forensic services, which face significant waiting lists due to the proliferation of referrals related to extremism. The forensic psychiatrist appointed, Dr Samantha Ling, has produced a comprehensive report dated 2 August 2025, indicating a personality profile displaying high ideological fixation but without evidence of formal psychosis or cognitive impairment. It merits mention that a referral was first made to Channel in late 2021 by staff at a local tertiary education centre. The basis was a concern regarding Mr H’s submission of coursework containing quotations from extremist literature and an apparent lack of critical engagement with such sources. The Channel panel discontinued the referral after three sessions concluded, citing insufficient evidence of intent or capability. This reflects system-wide challenges faced by Prevent programmes in engaging individuals who vacillate between resistance and compliance, often compounded by scepticism within community groups. The case preparation has also involved input from the West Midlands Resettlement Partnership, which has provided information concerning anticipated challenges upon release, should custody be imposed. Concerns include accommodation suitability, potential for further radicalisation, and the availability of structured interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to ideological extremism. A pre-sentencing report has been requested and is expected shortly. It will address the feasibility of targeted rehabilitation alongside the public protection mandate, noting the pressures on probation workload and the impact of resource shortages in offender management services. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. While the Crown’s evidence includes an analysis of digital logs sourced from a bespoke encrypted messaging application, it is worth observing that technology plays a dual role; in addition to enabling offence, it offers law enforcement valuable investigative instruments. However, the balance remains delicate, particularly where privacy protections intersect with national security interests, raising ongoing debates in legal and policy circles about proportionality. The case law on sentencing in terrorism cases has evolved after considerable judicial scrutiny. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guideline (2023) emphasises the cardinal roles of deterrence and protection of the public. It identifies a gradation of culpability depending on factors like ideological commitment, sophistication of planning, availability of weapons, and intent to cause mass harm. The Court of Appeal’s direction in R v Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 remains authoritative regarding the necessity of sentences that reflect the severity, regardless of whether the intended attack was thwarted at an early stage. The court must frame the sentence within this established jurisprudence. Much of the preparatory investigative work hinged on the use of increasingly complex methods of data analysis, including “pattern of life” studies derived from publicly available sources, infrastructure records, and commercial datasets. The interplay between public and private data sources, while invaluable for effective policing, raises broader societal questions about autonomy and state surveillance. Yet, so long as adequate judicial safeguards remain, they constitute indispensable tools in pre-empting harm. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The court has also reviewed supplementary reports from digital forensic experts confirming that multiple devices seized contained encrypted containers with manifestos advocating violent action and technical guides for assembling devices with explosive capabilities. The nuanced technical references and specific instructions contained within suggest a level of expertise beyond mere academic curiosity and align with material disseminated by proscribed organisations to which Mr H is known to have adhered. It is worthy of note that forensic teams encountered operational difficulties in deciphering some encrypted material, complicated by intentional obfuscation via custom scripts and anonymising VPN tunnels. This evidences a sophistication intended precisely to frustrate detection and prosecution. The court notes, for completeness, the submission of forensic evidence unrelated to Mr H’s conduct, such as a batch of vehicles stopped interstate involving an unconnected gang with links to drug running and weapons trafficking. These particulars, while of interest to the wider criminal landscape, bear no relevance to the present charges and are accordingly disregarded. A series of communications between the Probation Service and the local authority highlight the acute pressure on housing options for individuals convicted of serious offences, including terrorism-related. The strain of the ongoing homelessness crisis exacerbates management challenges during licence periods and complicates risk mitigation plans. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The evidence includes CCTV analysis from a transport interchange on 15 March 2025, where the defendant was observed acquiring a package concealed within a courier bag bearing no identifying marks. Defence contend this might have been related to hobbyist electronics parts. The court, however, must evaluate the totality of circumstances, including timing, location, and prior conduct. Additionally, sporadic traces of a narcotic substance were detected on the defendant’s clothing during an unrelated search in 2018, a matter which prompted a warning from police but not further proceedings. Such incidents, while indicative of youthful misjudgement, lack bearing on terrorism sentencing and must not distract from the core public safety considerations. It is acknowledged that terrorism offences may sometimes intersect with other categories of crime. A notable example is R v Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, involving a defendant convicted of multiple counts of arson where the risk of civilian harm was compounded by proximate drug dependency and gang conflict. That case, while instructive on sentencing principles around recklessness and danger, bears no direct connection to Mr H. Similarly, unrelated cases in the West Midlands have involved offences such as fly-tipping and environmental damage on green belt land. These offences, though cogent for the community’s welfare, are categorically distinct in nature and severity from acts of terrorism. The present court is not unaware of these broader contexts, but it is imperative that sentencing remains focused and calibrated to the facts and law applicable to the defendant’s conduct. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. The Crown’s evidence further includes records of the defendant’s travel history indicating a trip to Berlin in February 2024, wherein he attended an international conference ostensibly relating to cultural heritage. Surveillance data demonstrates that, at the conference venue, he met with persons subsequently arrested for importing ammonium nitrate in connection to explosive manufacture. Defence assert coincidence; the court finds the association concerning in light of the defendant’s digital footprint and encrypted communications. The administrative burden of managing such proceedings cannot be overstated. The volume of case documents exceeds 1,300 exhibits, requiring dedicated review time by all parties. The Legal Aid Agency’s involvement has been marked by both approvals and challenges. Counsel’s application for instructing a psychiatric report initially faced delay due to the agency’s internal workload and the complex bureaucratic steps for approval of funding for specialist reports. Such delays, while unfortunate, are not unusual in high-profile, technical cases where finite resources must be apportioned across widely distributed demands. The court also takes note of correspondence submitted by the East Birmingham Resettlement Trust, a charitable organisation engaged in supporting individuals with complex offender profiles. Although the Trust does not specialise in ideological extremism, its workers have provided social mentoring services to the defendant on a sporadic basis over the previous two years. Their submissions highlight the tensions between rehabilitation aspirations and practical service delivery constraints. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial records indicate several transactions made using cryptocurrency wallets linked by forensic analysis to Mr H. A transfer of 1.25 ETH equivalent to approximately £3,540 was traced to an intermediary known for supplying chemicals that can be used to manufacture explosive precursors. The inherent anonymity of cryptocurrencies poses significant investigatory challenges and increases the risk of misuse by offenders seeking to obscure funding chains. Counter-terrorism units have noted an increase in such transactions over the past five years, complicating traditional intelligence-gathering efforts. The court alights on concerns expressed in recent Parliamentary reports that legislative and regulatory frameworks have not kept pace with technological innovation in this sphere. While commendable in other respects, blockchain technology’s decentralized features can be exploited by those intending harm, underscoring the imperative of multi-agency cooperation. It is of procedural interest that the defendant’s smartphone was subject to forensic extraction after being seized in the course of the arrest. The process was hampered by the use of biometric security features and the presence of a so-called “dead man’s switch” mechanism which would have triggered deletion of data if tampering was detected. Such mechanisms exemplify the increasing complexity of the digital threat environment faced by investigators. On a tangential note, a co-defendant in a separate prosecution lodged in the West Midlands in 2023 was found to have committed an assault with a weapon during a public disorder event. This unrelated defendant’s conduct bears no connection to measures against Mr H but represents the diverse challenge landscape counter-terrorism policing faces alongside conventional crime. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is now aged 31. He holds a First Class Honours degree in Applied Physics from a Midlands university. Until mid-2023, he had been employed as a junior researcher at a national materials science facility. References from his academic supervisors describe him as “meticulous,” “reserved,” and occasionally “withdrawn.” He resigned his position following discussions concerning security vetting for a project linked to defence technologies. His line manager expressed bewilderment at the suddenness of his departure but also affirmed his technical competence and compliance with workplace norms. Letters of support from a local allotments association attest to Mr H’s voluntary contributions to community horticulture projects over the last three years. While commendable, the court recognises that acts of social contribution do not mitigate the seriousness of planning to inflict indiscriminate harm. The court further observes a family letter submitted by the defendant’s sister, detailing a challenging upbringing marked by parental separation and economic hardship. Although such background context is relevant to understanding the person, it cannot excuse deliberate criminality or ideological extremism. The ongoing pressures on mental health services, including regional shortages in clinical psychology appointments, impact the capacity for comprehensive rehabilitation plans in cases such as this. The probation report rightly emphasises that structured support, continuity of care, and robust inter-agency collaboration will be essential if risk is to be managed effectively post-release. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. Psychological assessment conducted by Professor David Mills, a forensic psychologist specialising in ideological extremism, notes that Mr H exhibits cognitive rigidity, a strong black-and-white worldview, and a pronounced predisposition for grievance-driven reasoning. No formal diagnosis of a major psychiatric disorder was made. Risk indicators include poor impulse control when ideologically triggered, and a propensity to isolate from mainstream social groups. Professor Mills cautiously recommends inclusion in a multi-modal risk management programme combining cognitive behavioural elements, social reintegration support, and electronic monitoring. The prognosis is guarded, with caution expressed regarding potential disengagement from interventions over time. The court must weigh these professional insights alongside public safety imperatives and sentencing guidelines that direct custodial penalties to reflect both denunciation and deterrence. Leniency, in terrorism cases, must not be perceived as tacit tolerance of ideology or associated risk, lest it erode societal confidence and collective security. The principles and sentencing factors considered, including mitigating and aggravating circumstances, the defendant’s personal history and psychological profile, set the stage for the forthcoming judgement. The court will therefore adjourn sentencing to allow the receipt of a full pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation Service, inclusive of high-risk assessment and rehabilitative options. Any further representations from defence or prosecution may be submitted in the interim. These sentencing remarks are given this day, 17 August 2025, in Court 10 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

Mr H Case No. B2025/29861 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. A. R. CAVENDISH Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence following his conviction on charges of preparing acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57(1) of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct occurred over the period from September 2022 until his arrest in April 2025. The defendant was apprehended at approximately 04:45 hours on 12 April 2025, at his residence in Bedminster, Bristol, following the culmination of Operation Silver Larch. This multi-agency investigation involved Counter Terrorism Policing South West, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Security Service, with warrant authorisation granted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The searches yielded multiple electronic devices, encrypted storage media, and chemical precursors. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Investigation into Mr H’s activities required lengthy analysis by digital forensic experts at the South West Regional Forensic Unit. The largely encrypted nature of the materials recovered necessitated specialist decryption efforts extending over several months, compounded by the defendant’s reliance on sophisticated anonymisation techniques including Tor routing and cryptocurrency mixing services. These technical complexities continually strained forensic resources, as such detailed examination remains unavoidably labour-intensive and time-consuming. Remand proceedings were conducted on 19 April 2025 before District Judge Lenton, who, noting the risks posed by the defendant’s conduct and the availability of electronic monitoring infrastructure, refused bail on the basis of public safety considerations. This decision was subsequently endorsed by the Crown Court at the plea and directions hearing on 10 June 2025. The court wishes to note that Mr H’s case has not been insulated from the well-documented delays affecting the Criminal Justice system at present. Listing difficulties, exacerbated by recent industrial action affecting court staff and legal professionals, have imperilled timely progression. Indeed, the listing for a trial initially fixed for late July was vacated owing to a late defence application for further disclosure, highlighting the ongoing friction between case readiness and procedural fairness. It must be acknowledged, however, that these disruptions have not denied either party an adequate opportunity to prepare. Before proceeding further, it is right to record that Mr H was the subject of a Prevent referral made in early 2020 by a college tutor, concerned by his increasingly strident online expressions endorsing violence abroad. The subsequent Channel panel concluded there was insufficient evidence to escalate the referral. While it may be tempting to judge such decisions with the benefit of hindsight, the court accepts that such interventions operate within difficult parameters and imperfect information. The experience of Channel panels underscores the complexities faced by practitioners balancing civil liberties with early protective action. It is equally appropriate to acknowledge the diligent efforts of the Westborough Counter-Terrorism Unit. Despite chronic understaffing—partly attributable to recruitment challenges in forensic linguistics and digital analysis—the officers and analysts involved displayed exemplary professionalism throughout protracted enquiry stages. The collaborative spirit manifested between police, crown prosecutors, and external experts was notable, in stark contrast to some historical inter-agency frictions. The court is mindful that effective coordination in counter-terrorism investigations remains a critical but often precarious achievement. The defence team, led by Mr Julian Hatfield of Hatfield & Co Solicitors, has advanced extensive pre-sentence materials for this court’s consideration, including a psychological report from Dr Alice Moreau, clinical forensic psychiatrist, and a personal statement from the defendant, supplemented by character references from neighbours and a volunteer mentor affiliated with the Bristol Youth Engagement Initiative. These materials have been reviewed with care and weight accorded to their contents as appropriate. The timeliness of the defendant's guilty plea merits comment. Mr H elected to enter his pleas at arraignment on 10 July 2025, having previously maintained a plea of not guilty. The doctrine governing sentencing credit for guilty pleas is well established. The Crown is entitled to appropriate mitigation where a plea is entered at the earliest reasonable juncture. The courts have, however, repeatedly emphasised that credit should be less generous where pleas come after protracted pre-trial proceedings, extensive disclosure, and significant preparatory work. This position is articulated in R v. Hadley [2024] EWCA Crim 908, which observed that “a late plea, made only when conviction is inevitable, does not reflect the same degree of remorse as an early admission.” The circumstances of Mr H’s plea cannot be divorced from this prevailing jurisprudence. The court further draws attention to R v. Lonsdale [2023] EWCA Crim 2312, involving a defendant convicted of charges relating to possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. Despite overwhelming evidence, the defendant delayed pleading guilty until the commencement of trial, only then conceding liability in the face of a prepared Crown case. The Court of Appeal reduced the applicable discount to one-tenth, highlighting the cost and trauma engendered by such tactical delays. Although the facts of that case concern an entirely different context, the principle concerning credit for pleas remains germane. The reminders afforded by these precedents bear particular relevance here, not least because terrorism-related offences typically engage public safety concerns of the highest order. The court must therefore ensure that any reductions accorded for plea are carefully calibrated so as neither to diminish deterrence nor to undermine community confidence in the justice system. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. The evidence disclosed revealed Mr H’s online activities spanning social media platforms and encrypted chat applications, including the creation and distribution of propaganda advocating violent jihadist ideology. Linguistic experts testified on the distinctive terminology used, corresponding with material associated with a proscribed organisation. The defendant maintained throughout that his actions were purely theoretical or satirical, an argument unpersuasive both to the jury and, ultimately, to this court. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Recovered data showed extensive communications featuring technical discussions about explosive device fabrication, interspersed with references to historical attacks. Defence submissions suggested that portions of this material were downloaded incidentally or out of academic interest; however, given the surrounding context, the court is obliged to view these findings as more than passive curiosity. It is helpful, perhaps, to consider some of the less contentious aspects of Mr H’s background to provide balance and completeness in approaching sentence. Mr H was born in Bristol in 1996, attended local state schools, and obtained an honours degree in electronic engineering from Bristol University in 2017. While such background features are no mitigation of offending herein, they do provide texture and assist the court and probation service in formulating a sentencing approach consistent with rehabilitation and public protection. It was disclosed that Mr H had no previous convictions for any offence, whether youth or adult, and there has been no evidence of prior involvement in violence or extremist activity before 2022. These factors, while not outweighing the gravity of the terrorism offences, weigh positively in assessing future responsiveness to intervention. The court is cognizant of the pressures faced by local probation services managing cases involving complex ideological risk. At present, the Bristol Probation Trust is grappling with a significant backlog attributable to staffing turnover and increased caseloads. The difficulties inherent in coordinating supervision for those convicted of terrorism offences are exacerbated by the necessity for specialist training, security vetting of supervising officers, and multi-agency liaison surrounding restrictions and conditions designed to mitigate risk. The congestion in the system is regrettable, and the court urges all involved to maintain the necessary professional rigour despite these constraints. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Despite the defendant’s cooperation since arrest, compliance with investigation demands, and content production for assessment, the forensic psychologists have noted significant ideological rigidity characterised by ‘black-and-white’ cognitive patterns and an absence of genuine remorse. Dr Moreau’s report, prepared after extensive interviews and psychometric testing, does not identify formal mental illness but does caution that Mr H’s fixity of beliefs and social isolation pose an ongoing risk without structured psychological intervention. The court notes, for balance, that Mr H has engaged intermittently with the counter-extremism programme offered by the Bristol Prevent Hub. However, the evidence indicates a lack of meaningful sustained engagement, repeatedly declining offers for mentoring and cognitive behavioural work designed to build empathy and tolerance. The court is conscious of the demonstrated difficulty in achieving deradicalisation but must temper hopefulness with realism. It bears mention that multi-agency collaboration, typified by the MAPPA Category 3 arrangements, remains central to any strategy aiming to mitigate risk in such cases. However, the court is aware that protective arrangements, though theoretically comprehensive, are subject to the vicissitudes of resource limitations and competing priorities. Frontline officers and social workers report increasingly heavy caseloads, especially in urban areas experiencing social deprivation, compounding challenges of consistent monitoring and enforcement. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. Turning to an assessment of the defendant’s activities beyond the immediate charges, it was revealed during the trial preparation phase that Mr H undertook travel to the Netherlands in November 2023. He attended a conference purportedly on technological innovation in logistics, but evidence was adduced indicating possible contact with individuals linked to foreign extremist circles. Defence mitigation framed this as a legitimate business journey, though the court treats the totality of the evidence as placing the defendant’s motivations under serious question. The court is mindful, nevertheless, that Easton v Roberts [2019] EWCA Crim 1596, cautions against conflating travel per se with illicit intent absent clear corroboration. The balancing act between protecting rights to freedom of movement and security imperatives remains complex and instructive. The defendant’s personal circumstances also include a history of involvement with local environmental activism groups, where Mr H once volunteered in river clean-up operations. While commendable, the court emphasises that such activities bear no weight in negating the considerations raised by his subsequent offending. In addition, the court notes for completeness that Mr H’s younger brother faces unrelated proceedings for benefit fraud in the nearby magistrates' court. This fact is irrelevant to the defendant’s conduct and must not influence sentencing. It is mentioned solely in the interest of factual completeness and transparency. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations uncovered cryptocurrency payments totalling approximately £3,400 sent from an account traced to Mr H to a vendor specialising in dual-use chemical supplies. The payments emphasized the defendant’s aptitude for utilising digital currencies to evade conventional financial oversight. The court agrees with the Crown’s submission that such methods underscore the increasing need for cyber-capable policing and regulatory vigilance, echoing sentiments expressed by the Law Commission in its recent consultation on virtual asset regulation. The court observes, incidentally, that the misuse of cryptocurrencies has become an issue also prevalent in organised retail crime rings, where anonymous payments fund bulk pilfering activities. Evidence presented in R v. Belford [2024] EWCA Crim 1202 demonstrates the use of Bitcoin mixers to facilitate fencing operations for stolen electronics and drugs, a phenomenon increasingly problematic for law enforcement. During covert observation, surveillance described the defendant engaging in short visits to the Avon River embankment after dusk on 23 and 30 October 2024. Analysts spent hundreds of hours cross-referencing sensor data with CCTV footage and mobile geolocation, attesting to the resource-intensiveness of modern counter-terrorism surveillance even in cases involving limited-duration activity. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant is a 29-year-old male of British nationality, educated to degree level. His employment history includes two years as an electronics technician for a telecommunications provider, from which he resigned amid a disciplinary inquiry relating to inappropriate website access during work hours. Letters from former managers describe him as “quiet” and “detail-oriented” but also “socially withdrawn.” This profile may help to inform probation assessments addressing integration and risk management. Notwithstanding the extensiveness of the preparatory materials for sentence, the court remains tasked with ensuring an outcome reflective of public protection, denunciation, and encouragement of desistance. The defendant’s volunteer efforts with a local youth mentorship scheme—although noted with approval—do not diminish the seriousness of the offences herein. As per the principles highlighted in R v. Walton [2019] EWCA Crim 1123, commendable past conduct is not a licence to disregard the broader pattern of offending behaviour. Professor Daniel Keane, forensic psychologist instructed on behalf of the defence, assessed Mr H as demonstrating high intellectual functioning but noted a “predilection for categorical thinking and impaired capacity for emotional perspective-taking.” These traits place the defendant at considerable risk of re-engagement with extremist ideology absent sustained intervention, in accordance with the Structured Professional Judgement frameworks. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! In summary, this was a carefully orchestrated and coherent enterprise, exhibiting high culpability and a clear intention to facilitate acts likely to cause serious indiscriminate harm. While the defendant pleaded guilty at arraignment, the delay cannot be overlooked, nor the missed opportunities to engage earnestly with preventative services. Mitigation is limited to absence of previous convictions and some educational achievements, neither of which neutralise the substantial risk posed. In determining sentence, the court will await the preparation of a thorough pre-sentence report. The probation service is requested to address, inter alia, therapeutic engagement possibilities, potential for release on licence with stringent controls, suitability for Extended Determinate Sentence provisions, and the feasibility of conditions including electronic monitoring and exclusion zones. Consideration should be given to mental health input with expertise in radicalisation, alongside structured community support to facilitate desistance.

SWANSON Filed: 17 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism as per section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct charged spans from late 2022 until the defendant’s arrest in April 2025. The procedural history of this case is extensive and illustrative of the complexities inherent in contemporary counter-terrorism prosecutions. Mr H was apprehended at 04:45 hours on 11 April 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at a residential property in Greenbank Road, Bristol. The warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following intelligence gathered from the Security Service indicating sustained encrypted communication with servers known to host extremist content. Several electronic devices, including encrypted smartphones, a high-performance laptop, and external hard drives, were seized at the time of arrest. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This arrest was the fruit of a protracted investigative operation, codenamed Operation NIGHTFALL, which spanned almost eighteen months. The inquiry involved not only CTPSW but also regional intelligence units and a specialist digital forensics team embedded within the National Cyber Crime Unit. The painstaking nature of the technological examination was compounded by Mr H's extensive use of sophisticated anonymisation tools, including Tor networks and proprietary messaging protocols. The forensic process included the painstaking reconstruction of deliberately destroyed virtual machines and the decryption of partially corrupted data containers. This task required the mobilisation of significant specialist resources, reflecting the scale and complexity of the case. It is necessary briefly to observe the systemic pressures that such investigations impose on public services. The regional police digital forensic laboratories have, since 2023, faced a significant backlog of cases, with average processing times now exceeding six months. That backlog includes matters ranging from fatal violent crime to high-value fraud, alongside cases of ideological extremism such as this. The limited pool of suitably qualified personnel, combined with rapid technological evolution, has rendered law enforcement’s work increasingly challenging. This court acknowledges the tireless dedication of those professionals whose work underpins public protection despite these operational headwinds. The case was initially listed for a preliminary court appearance on 18 April 2025, but was adjourned for legal aid issues pertaining to the defendant’s representation. It is regrettable—even in 2025—that delays linked to Legal Aid administration continue to impact case timetables. Defence solicitors faced several weeks of uncertainty regarding authorisation for instructing an independent surveillance expert to assess the reliability of intercept evidence, which delayed hearings. Whilst these procedural oddities are not for this court to adjudicate upon at trial, they are nonetheless a persistent nuisance that risks undermining the belief in efficient justice. In advance of the trial, the defendant initially pleaded not guilty during the plea and trial preparation hearing on 10 June 2025. It was not until the first day of the trial on 15 August 2025 that Mr H elected to enter guilty pleas to both counts. As the Court of Appeal stressed in R v. Partridge [2023] EWCA Crim 1432, such late admissions, while entitled to some recognition, do not attract the same level of discount as early pleas given the protracted work supporting prosecution and witness preparation. The principles relating to credit for late pleas have been robustly examined in a series of appellate decisions. In R v. Knowles [2022] EWCA Crim 2154, the Court emphasized that credit is a concession extended primarily to acknowledge a defendant's genuine acceptance of responsibility before evidence is fully marshalled, and for the benefit conferred upon the court and witnesses by the avoidance of contested trials. Equivocation or tactical delay undermines that rationale. Such principles have been reiterated in the recent case of R v. Merriman [2024] EWCA Crim 1319, arising from prosecutions linked to right-wing extremist affiliations, which are formally distinct but analogous in nature. It is salutary to reflect also on the particular sentencing guidelines applicable to terrorism offences. The 2023 edition of the Magistrates’ and Crown Court Sentencing Guidelines for Terrorism, published by the Sentencing Council, directs the court to weigh factors such as the offender's level of commitment to terrorist activity, sophistication in planning, and nexus to actual or potential harm. These guidelines explicitly underscore deterrence and protection of the public as primary sentencing objectives, consistent with the statutory framework. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Significant evidential weight rests upon the digital trail assembled during the investigation. The defendant maintained a pseudonymous blog hosted on a decentralised platform, through which incendiary material was regularly disseminated. Expert testifiers outlined how the stylistic and linguistic features of posts mirrored known communications produced by a proscribed group under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000, notably its references to “purity” and “awakening”, which have been discussed in A-G’s Reference No. 14 of 2022 (counter-terrorism) [2022] EWCA Crim 1143. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Analysis of electronic devices revealed the possession of encrypted containers labelled misleadingly as food recipes or technical manuals unrelated to hostile activity. Among these were detailed schematics for homemade explosive devices and instructions for the synthesis of high explosives from commercially available substances. Defence advanced a submission seeking to characterise some material as academic interest or “curiosity-driven” research; the court is not persuaded by this benign interpretation in light of contextual evidence. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The court recalls the acceptance in R v. Ferris [2020] EWCA Crim 1746 that the mere possession of instructive material, without demonstrable intent or action, does not constitute an offence absent connection to a specific purpose. Here, the totality of the evidence firmly establishes intent. Diversions in this case included references to certain ancillary matters, such as the seizure of a small quantity of illicit substances unrelated to terrorism. While a limited amount of cannabis was found at the property, no charges or aggravations flow therefrom given the overriding counter-terrorism context. Similarly, the defence invoked Mr H’s minor and unconnected civil penalty for littering dating from 2021 as indicative of his otherwise law-abiding character; such incidents are peripheral and carry no relevance to sentencing in this matter. Complementing investigative efforts, evidence was gathered concerning the defendant’s movements. For example, records indicated he attended a conference in Brussels in March 2024, nominally on renewable energy technology. Intelligence reports aligned his attendance with a known associate with extremist affiliations, although the meeting proved abortive due to an abrupt cancellation of certain sessions. The trip, while documented in isolation, must be considered alongside electronic communications and other activities. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. The sheer volume of material assembled by prosecution and analysed by multiple agencies is impressive. Disclosures numbered over 600 items, which required scrupulous redaction, given the sensitivity of some witness statements and intelligence capabilities. The court is aware that disclosure protocols in terrorism cases are subject to layered confidentiality requirements, sometimes necessitating closed material procedures or Public Interest Immunity claims, as noted in R v. Ahmed & Others [2016] EWCA Crim 1046. The financial dimension, seldom the titular focus of sentencing remarks, deserves mention. A forensic accountant from CTPSW traced a series of cryptocurrency payments originating from Mr H to accounts associated with suppliers of dual-use materials. The use of layered mixers and anonymising services complicated enforcement endeavours, underscoring challenges posed by emerging financial instruments. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The court further notes the resource-intensive nature of remote and in-person surveillance underpinning this prosecution. For instance, 180 hours of covert video surveillance on multiple devices, synchronised with traffic sensor data in dense urban settings, was necessary to establish patterns of behaviour indicative of preparatory steps. The manpower allocation for these operations reflects a public safety imperative not readily quantifiable in financial terms but paramount nonetheless. While the defendant's academic record is notable, having attained a Bachelor of Science with honours in computer engineering from a respected university, this must be weighed against the serious nature of the offences. Testimony from his former employer described him as “methodical and conscientious”. However, his resignation from a secure position coincided with intensification of his activities under investigation. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mitigation appeals to the defendant’s willingness to engage in limited community volunteer work are acknowledged. Letters from the Bristol Urban Renewal Project commend efforts to assist vulnerable populations during the pandemic's height. Nonetheless, laudable community service cannot offset the deliberate orchestration of violent extremism, a point borne out in R v. Dawood [2019] EWCA Crim 1567. A forensic psychologist's report described Mr H as demonstrating “notably rigid ideation” with \"difficulty in cognitive flexibility\" but did not diagnose any formal mental health disorder. The psychological opinion highlighted the high risk of reoffending absent robust de-radicalisation and risk management. The court is mindful that psychological interventions—such as the Counter-Terrorism Cognitive Change Programme—have variable outcomes, requiring careful multi-agency coordination and supervision. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! This court must place foremost the protection of the public and the need for deterrence when considering sentence. The elements of planning, procurement, and ideological commitment exhibited by Mr H situate him in the upper spectrum of culpability among offenders prosecuted under terrorism statutes. Aggravating factors include the intended use of indiscriminate harm, the sophistication of digital concealment, and persistence despite prior involvement with Channel intervention schemes. Mitigating factors are limited to Mr H’s absence of prior convictions and his late guilty pleas, which nonetheless offer only modest allowance in the calculation of sentence length. The court remains mindful also of the important principle that the severity of the offence category commands a response consistent with the gravity of potential harm. The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith. This report should evaluate the feasibility of imposing custodial sentences with extended licence conditions, including electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and mandatory participation in deradicalisation programmes accredited by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. It should further assess prospects for rehabilitation, taking into account Mr H’s educational background and previous engagement with voluntary sector agencies. Appreciation is due to the Counter Terrorism Policing South West unit, whose professionalism and meticulous case management exemplify public service commitment. Similarly, the efforts of defence counsel, instructed through Legal Aid, are acknowledged in navigating a complex and sensitive matter, notwithstanding procedural challenges experienced.

FLETCHER Filed: 15 October 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending period spans from May 2023 until his arrest on 12 January 2025. The defendant was detained at his residence on Redcliffe Road shortly before dawn on the 12th of January, pursuant to a warrant executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). This action was the culmination of a lengthy and meticulous investigation that drew on a combination of covert surveillance, intercepted communications, and cooperative intelligence from allied agencies, including the National Cyber Crime Unit and the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism. The warrant itself was issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and reflects the statutory framework empowering law enforcement to act decisively where terrorism-related intelligence reaches a threshold of reasonable suspicion. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The initiation of Operation OLYMPUS, as the investigation was code-named, was triggered by an intercept from a device linked to the defendant that suggested active engagement with individuals listed on the UK’s proscribed terrorist organisation register. This activity prompted extended analysis, complicated by the defendant’s use of sophisticated encryption tools and anonymising software—far from the rudimentary methods seen in less sophisticated matters. The work of the National Technical Assistance Centre in circumventing these barriers was both necessary and significant, and their painstaking efforts accounted for protracted periods of evidence gathering. Whilst further judicial authorisation was sought and twice renewed to extend Mr H’s pre-charge detention, these extensions were compliant with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 safeguards and reflected the complexity at play, rather than any impropriety on the part of the investigative teams. The court acknowledges the cooperation of or at least attendance of the defence throughout, including during hearings to renew the detention periods before Magistrates’ Courts at Bristol and Bath. In the landscape of modern counter-terrorism, the judicial process must strike a balance between protecting individual liberty and preventing harm to the public. This court is deeply conscious of the heavy operational demands such balance entails. It is also aware of the systemic limitations imposed by stretched resources, underscored by recent public sector reports enumerating the pressures on both forensic and intelligence units dealing with the expanding digital domain. The National Crime Agency’s 2024 Annual Threat Assessment highlights this challenge, noting a 37% year-on-year increase in the volume of encrypted devices seized as evidence in terrorism-related offences. An illustrative digression may be found in the case of R v. Sandoval [2019] EWCA Crim 2035, where the Court of Appeal considered the admissibility of encrypted evidence obtained through advanced forensic techniques. Though not directly relevant to Mr H’s matter, Sandoval serves as important precedent on the limitations and safeguards applicable to covert data retrieval, notably guarding against abuse of investigatory powers while enabling necessary public safety interventions. The evolving jurisprudence here underscores the dynamic interface between law, technology, and liberty. The court must also address the history of preventative interventions that preceded formal charges. In 2020, a Channel referral was made relating to Mr H by a religious studies lecturer who expressed concerns about his increasingly strident views, expressed during a university seminar. Records show that Mr H attended three mentoring sessions before disengaging. The Panel adjudged that intervention was no longer necessary at that stage, a decision made on the basis of behavioral indicators at the time. The court recognises the inherent difficulty in such assessments, not least given the unpredictable trajectories radicalisation may take, and does not cast blame on the practitioners involved. Such preventative frameworks, including Channel and the Prevent duty, operate within an uncertain domain where certainty often proves elusive. Defense counsel, in submissions prior to trial, sought to emphasise this trajectory while highlighting Mr H’s exhibition of remorse following arrest. That plea of remorse, however sincere it may be regarded, must be understood in context. Unusually, the defendant persisted in a not guilty plea until the second day of the trial, only conceding guilt in light of the overwhelming nature of the prosecution case. Such a latent admission inevitably tempers the extent of any credit that the court may fairly extend. The principles governing credit for guilty pleas were examined comprehensively in the leading case R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, involving a defendant charged with multiple counts of arson and endangerment. Halvorsen’s plea was entered late, after the conclusion of a substantial and complex evidentiary hearing. The Court of Appeal ruled that whilst a guilty plea legitimately attracts reduction in sentence, the timing and motives underpinning that plea are of paramount importance. Credit should reflect an early acceptance of responsibility and assistance to the Crown, not tactical calculation at the cusp of conviction certainty. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The facts in this case illustrate a gradual escalation from relatively isolated online activity into more concrete and calculated preparation for terrorist acts. Mr H’s published writings and associations reveal a radicalisation process deepening over time, marked by the adoption of grievance narratives and the dissemination of ideologically charged materials on encrypted platforms. Such behaviour is consistent with those indicators detailed in national threat assessments and academic profiles of violent extremist engagement, including the 2022 Home Office report on “pathways to radicalisation.” Notably, the defendant maintained a pseudonymous blog which evolved from relatively banal political commentary into a repository of veneration for proscribed movements and apologia for violent actions, drawing inspiration from foreign conflicts, and engaging in symbolic temporal alignments with commemorative terrorist anniversaries. The Crown has adduced expert testimony to demonstrate linguistic consistency between this blog and known extremist propaganda, relying on forensic linguistic analysis conducted by Dr Emily Thorne, an independent consultant specialising in ideological extremism. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Recovered digital evidence included a series of encrypted containers labelled with misleading innocuous titles such as “HolidayPhotos2022” but within which forensic analysts uncovered technical manuals for improvised explosive devices and sequences of video footage depicting stress tests on homemade devices, conducted in a nearby unoccupied warehouse. The defence’s argument that these materials might be explained by academic interest, or photographic documentation of industrial heritage sites, was not accepted by the jury. Approximately six months after initial representation, a further forensic examination revealed significant quantities of nitrate compounds and precursor substances stored covertly in hard-to-access areas of the defendant’s residence, as detailed in exhibits 129 through 138 of the trial bundle. These kinds of chemical components are regulated under the Explosives Precursors Regulations and their possession is a specified offence allied to the terrorism statutes, illustrating the deliberate and unlawful nature of the defendant’s activity. A collateral matter, referenced briefly in mitigation and unrelated to the principal offences, concerned residency issues tracing back to 2019 when Mr H’s landlord received a noise abatement notice following complaints from neighbours about late-night gatherings. While this is tangential and without bearing on the culpability in the present case, it serves to remind us of the challenges facing housing enforcement teams, who are often stretched thin managing nuisance complaints that can mask more serious underlying risks. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The court notes that during the investigative phase, considerable resources were dedicated to digital forensic analysis, including the realignment of network traffic logs at peak load times to identify connections between Mr H and known extremist facilitators overseas. These efforts required in excess of 250 analyst hours and specialist software licences, expenditures approved after close scrutiny by the National Crime Agency’s internal audit team. The protracted nature of these investigative efforts aligns with the findings of the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation’s 2023 report, which highlighted ongoing strains in the forensic domain due to increasing device encryption and data volume. The prosecution also introduced testimony from Detective Inspector Mark Enfield, whose team recently dismantled a cell unrelated to Mr H but involved in possession and distribution of bladed articles in school car parks, reflecting a broader pattern of policing challenges within the South West region. Though unconnected to the defendant, this evidence was included to contextualise contemporary enforcement hurdles. The history of co-defendant S. Mitchell, charged in the same indictment, included a conviction for affray stemming from a pub brawl in 2018, where pool cues and glass bottles were employed as weapons. That conviction, of course, bears no relation to Mr H’s own conduct but demonstrates the varied backgrounds from which conspirators in extremist plots may sometimes emerge. Not directly relevant, but of passing note, is the Ladbrooke Community Council’s ongoing campaign to combat fly-tipping on green belt land adjacent to the defendant's former residence. The environmental damage occasioned by such activity has been significant, but bears no connection to these proceedings. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. Attention has been given to a journey undertaken by Mr H to Brussels in October 2023, ostensibly for a conference on “digital freedoms.” Immigration records and intercepted communications revealed alternative motives. Surveillance observations confirmed his engagement with individuals later identified as part of an extremist network linked to overseas conflicts. The logistics of this trip, including last-minute flight changes and the use of false identities for additional bookings, underscore the degree of planning and operational security employed. The court is mindful of the inherent difficulties in prosecuting offences involving such layers of concealment. The contested nature of much of the digital evidence extended preparation times and greatly increased the scope of legal argumentation. This is to be expected in a court of law operating at the highest level of judicial scrutiny. The administrative cooperation between multiple agencies – including the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command, local probation services, and international partners – deserves recognition here. Such collaboration, while arduous and resource intensive, remains an essential feature of effective counter-terrorism work, as acknowledged in the National Counter Terrorism Policing Strategy of 2024. In a procedural aside, it is regrettable that the case experienced delays attributable to the unavailability of interpreters fluent in Kurdish and Pashto, languages relevant to intercepted communications. These delays cumulatively resulted in three adjournments, prolonging proceedings by several months. Such shortages are symptomatic of a nationwide scarcity of qualified language services impacting multiple tiers of the justice system. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations traced payments made via cryptocurrency platforms, totalling approximately £4,500, from wallets associated with Mr H to vendors specialising in high-grade chemical reagents. These transactions were routed through multiple mixers and privacy-focused exchanges, complicating tracing efforts but ultimately unravelled through diligent forensic blockchain analysis. The use of decentralised digital currencies for such purposes is a growing concern for law enforcement, as highlighted in the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy’s latest annual report. It is worth noting that several of these payments coincided with periods when the defendant was absent from UK soil, complicating the temporal linkages between financial activity and physical preparation. Emerging case law relating to cryptocurrency use in terrorism financing includes the decision of R v. Khalifa [2024] EWCA Crim 991, recognising the enhanced culpability where offenders exploit digital anonymity to subvert financial regulations. Among the paraphernalia seized from the defendant’s domicile were items of electronics engineering equipment, including oscilloscope devices and microcontroller kits. While such items are legal and may have innocuous applications—in certain hobbies or academic pursuits—their corroborative context with explosive componentry is unmistakable and central to understanding the preparation involved here. The diagnostic profile prepared by Dr Christa Meyers, a forensic psychiatrist instructed jointly by the defence and prosecution, concluded that Mr H exhibits “a rigid ideological belief system” with “nexus to grievance-based violence,” yet demonstrated neither active psychosis nor overt personality disorder. The report commented on his \"significant social isolation and limited engagement with pro-social networks,\" factors known to exacerbate vulnerability to radicalisation. This nuanced finding tempers considerations of mental health mitigations, which, while present, do not absolve responsibility nor diminish meaningful risk. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to Mr H’s personal background, he is a 31-year-old university graduate with a degree in electrical engineering from a respected institution. His employment history shows periods of short-term contracts in the renewable energy sector, interspersed with bouts of unemployment attributed to mental health struggles. Letters from former employers describe him as “competent and punctual,” albeit socially reserved and prone to withdrawal under stress. The defendant’s family has submitted character references, including a letter from his elder brother who recounts a childhood marked by parental separation and intermittent domestic instability, factors often considered contextual but by no means determinative in cases involving ideological extremism. The family also indicate his previous voluntary work in local environmental projects, including tree-planting initiatives orchestrated by community groups. Such civic-minded activity, while commendable, must be weighed in the context of the gravity of the offences for which he stands convicted. This court expresses appreciation for the efforts of various voluntary sector organisations referenced in materials submitted on behalf of Mr H, including the Bristol Urban Resilience Project. The contributions of such groups, particularly in providing community support to individuals at risk of social exclusion and radicalisation, are vital yet often undertaken with limited resources and recognition. Their ongoing work, despite financial uncertainties and operational pressures, commands respect from this bench. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. The offender’s engagement with statutory services has been sporadic. Contact with mental health services was initiated following arrest, but attendance has been inconsistent. Psychologists involved note a “resistant stance towards therapy” coupled with “a deeply entrenched ideological framework” unlikely to shift without structured, long-term intervention. These considerations inform the assessment of ongoing risk, which remains elevated. In mitigation, counsel has drawn attention to Mr H’s lack of previous convictions and his acceptance of responsibility, albeit late. The court acknowledges the limited but genuine expressions of remorse communicated both in open court and in written form. Nevertheless, these do not outweigh the seriousness of the offending, the evidence of sustained preparation, or the persistent risk posed. The severity of offences of terrorism necessitates sentences reflecting the core principles of punishment, deterrence, and protection of the public, as established in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 and reaffirmed in the Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in 2023. Those guidelines emphasize proportionality while underscoring the imperative to incapacitate individuals whose continued freedom presents unacceptable dangers. The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be commissioned without delay, with a focus on constructive sentencing options. The Probation Service must evaluate the appropriateness of extended determinate custodial sentences with community supervision, alongside the viability of tailored deradicalisation programmes, psychological support, and electronic monitoring conditions post-release. A full risk assessment incorporating Structured Professional Judgement methodology is essential to formulate a coherent management plan. Acknowledging the significant strain on probation and forensic mental health services highlighted in recent Parliamentary Committee evidence, the court urges prioritisation of resources to address the complex needs this case exemplifies. This is not ancillary but central to the effective administration of justice and public confidence in counter-terrorism measures. I thank counsel for their full and considered submissions – Ms Emily Ridley for the Crown and Mr James Palfrey on behalf of the defence. The courtroom staff, including usher Mr Daniel Bright and the recently appointed Court Clerk Ms Hannah O’Donnell, are also to be commended for their diligent work under difficulty caused by occasional technical failures of the electronic hearing systems recently installed in Court 4. These sentencing remarks are delivered on the 15th day of October 2025 in Court 4 of the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentence will be pronounced after receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report, scheduled for a hearing on 10 December 2025.

Mr H Case No. B2025/34592 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. D. MORRIS Filed: 19 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The relevant conduct arose between September 2023 and the date of his arrest on 14 January 2025. The defendant's case progressed through various procedural stages, beginning with the initial police interview on 15 January 2025 following a planned arrest warrant executed under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The investigation was coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) and supported by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), with evidence obtained from seized digital devices, telecommunications interception, and covert observation. From the outset, the proceedings were subject to intense operational security measures, and the court received submissions under the Justice and Security Act 2013 concerning the confidentiality of certain materials. The case was first listed for a preliminary hearing on 5 February 2025 and thereafter assigned to this Crown Court on 20 March. The court notes the prolonged delays occasioned by the defendant’s application to challenge the validity of certain intercepted evidence, which was ultimately resolved on 10 June 2025 following a reserved ruling by the court. Such applications, while protective of fundamental rights, inevitably place additional burdens on timely justice. It is a regrettable but not uncommon feature of complex terrorism cases that prove both legally and factually intricate. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Initial bail applications were refused on public protection grounds. The defendant remained remanded throughout. The liaison between the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and defence was marked by the typical difficulties attendant on significant disclosure volumes, although the court is satisfied that efforts were made on both sides to manage these within the constraints of resource pressures and statutory time limits. The Defence team, led by Mr Oliver Creed KC, made detailed challenges to the sufficiency of evidence but counsel’s eventual acceptance of guilt by way of a plea at the outset of the sentencing hearing reflects a concession that such challenges could not be sustained. It is worth remarking here, in passing, on the operational challenges facing forensic digital agencies attached to the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional counter-terrorism units. The volume of encrypted data and the sophistication of anonymising technologies have placed additional strain on technical analysts. Techniques such as the use of multi-layered virtual private networks (VPNs), onion routing protocols, and ephemeral messaging apps—sometimes developed in the open-source domain—present novel obstacles to evidence recovery. There is an ongoing debate about the balance between privacy rights and national security that extends well beyond the reach of this particular tribunal. The identification of the defendant as a significant subject of investigation arose from a Channel referral made in November 2022 by a university lecturer who observed increasingly extreme political rhetoric in his assessed coursework and participation in seminars. The Channel Panel convened under the Education Act 2011 initially offered a package of interventions, including mentoring and cognitive behavioural therapy targeting extremist mindset, led by the Bristol Prevent Team. These engagements, according to records submitted to the court, were sporadic and ultimately discontinued in late 2023 due to the defendant’s withdrawal and sporadic attendance. This discontinuation was noted by social services but did not trigger further safeguarding measures at that stage. The court is mindful of the limits inherent to voluntary preventive frameworks in cases where engagement falters. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The defendant's use of online platforms evolved over time. Analysis uncovered a progressively radicalising trajectory on social media accounts and encrypted messaging services. Notably, a significant cache of digital material was recovered from several devices seized under warrant, including encrypted data volumes stored within concealed VeraCrypt containers. One particularly voluminous archive was named “ArcaneLibrary,” containing ideological manifestos, bomb-making schematics, and training manuals. These materials, expertly analysed by forensic linguists and intelligence officers, revealed a pattern of procurement of dual-use equipment and deliberate obfuscation techniques. In R v. Ibrahim [2017] EWCA Crim 2261, the Court of Appeal held that the mere possession of terrorist manuals and related material, when accompanied by clear preparatory conduct, is sufficient to ground a conviction under section 5 of the 2006 Act even if an attack plan is not fully formed. That principle applies squarely in the present case. Previous authorities, such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, affirm the judiciary's wide discretion to assess the totality of circumstances and intentions behind preparatory acts. A recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Evidence disclosed also demonstrated the defendant’s acquisition of chemical precursors capable of use in the manufacture of explosive devices. Surveillance photographs presented to the court showed Mr H at a hardware outlet in Central Bristol purchasing materials described in the prosecution as commonly employed in home-made explosive concoctions. The defence submitted that the defendant’s visits were, in part, consistent with his background in amateur pyrotechnics as documented in hobbyist clubs years prior. However, this explanation was disbelieved given the totality of evidence and the context of downloads and electronic correspondence uncovered. The investigation further revealed extensive use of cryptocurrency to facilitate anonymous transactions on darknet markets. Mr H transacted in Bitcoin and Monero, with multiple wallet addresses linked via blockchain forensic analysis to the purchase of chemical supplies and encrypted communications tools. The complexity of these payment routes, involving tumblers and chain-hopping, necessitated valuable and painstaking input from blockchain intelligence teams, diverting resources from other pressing investigations. It should be noted that the forensic accountancy unit involved in tracing these payments operates under intense resourcing pressure, highlighting the significant investment required to interdict modern methods of terrorist facilitation. The interplay of technology and finance in terrorism finance enforcement continues to be a rapidly evolving field. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Occasionally, reference has been made during submissions to certain unrelated instances of counter-terror law enforcement. Among them, for illustration only, is the well-known R v. Malik case from 2021, where a co-defendant was convicted for the importation of Class A drugs concealed within commercial freight. There is, however, no evidential or factual link between Mr H and those offences or that defendant, save that they arise from operations conducted by different regional policing units. It is merely a contextual observation indicating the breadth of law enforcement activity addressing organised crime alongside terrorism. Similarly, in passing, mention may be made of a separate instance of fly-tipping on protected greenbelt land in the outskirts of Bristol in 2024, prosecuted by the local council, which has no direct relevance to these proceedings beyond evidencing community environmental concerns. This court also notes the absence of association between Mr H and a series of recent pub-related affrays in the city centre during 2023, none of which are connected to the present prosecution save insofar as they exemplify local challenges in public order policing facing the city’s law enforcement agencies. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. The defendant’s personal circumstances are pertinent to sentencing. Mr H, now aged 30, was from a middle-income household and attended a local university where he achieved a degree in chemical engineering. Defence submissions drew attention to a history of social isolation, periods of clinical depression, and episodes of anxiety, for which he received intermittent counselling from the university health service and later from primary care mental health teams. Reports by Dr Heidi Clarke, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, noted no current psychosis or formal diagnosis of a personality disorder but remarked upon a significant ideological fixity and cognitive rigidity consistent with extremist world views. The psychological risk assessment and probation reports jointly concur on a high continuing risk of serious harm without comprehensive risk management strategies, underscoring the necessity of extended custodial supervision coupled with structured rehabilitation. The potential for participation in structured disengagement programmes was noted, including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), albeit with caution given historically low engagement rates among similar cohorts. Letters of support presented on behalf of the defendant came from neighbours and recreational football club peers, who offered lukewarm but sincere observations of his reclusive but lawful behaviour prior to arrest. There was also correspondence from the local chapter of a wildlife conservation charity describing his voluntary participation in habitat restoration days in 2022, unrelated to any extremist activity but indicative of limited pro-social interests. The court is, however, acutely aware that such mitigating remarks must be weighed against the breach of trust implicit in terrorism offences and their potential for severe societal harm. Indeed, as observed in R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928, commendable daytime conduct cannot excuse clandestine plotting. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The evidence also disclosed that in late 2024, the defendant travelled abroad on two occasions. One was a short visit to Amsterdam purportedly for leisure, the other a trip to Budapest, recorded in official records as a heritage tour but complicated by travel into neighbour countries where extremist contacts have been reported. Though the defence argue these trips were solely for cultural enrichment, intelligence reports place meetings with persons associated with transient extremist networks abroad, which, while not rising to an indictable conduct in this jurisdiction, add contextual weight to the prosecution case. Additionally, the prosecution presented digital evidence of communications between Mr H and individuals previously convicted of offences under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000, notably for disseminating incendiary material and participating in proscribed organisations. The networking was extensive and utilised cutting-edge encrypted platforms, underlining the premeditated and connected nature of Mr H’s activities. During these proceedings, the court notes the strain imposed upon the National Probation Service by significantly rising caseloads involving terrorism-related offenders. The operational demands upon Probation Officers, especially under MAPPA Category 3 supervision, have increased proportionately, further complicated by pandemic-related backlog effects and workforce shortages. The necessity for enhanced inter-agency cooperation is paramount. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to matters of law, this court recalls the guidance found in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Act Guidelines of 2023, which articulate the framework for assessing culpability and harm. These guidelines specify that the highest culpability arises where an offender exhibits active planning, the acquisition of weapons or materials, and intention aligned with indiscriminate mass harm. The defendant’s conduct falls into this category. The court further references R v. Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 401 which affirms that lengthy extended determinate sentences are appropriate in cases where the offender’s intent, capacity, and preparation evidence readiness to undertake harmful acts notwithstanding interruption by law enforcement. Deterrence and public protection remain the paramount sentencing objectives here. The prosecution has invited a custodial sentence with provision for an extended licence period post-release, supported by the engagement of mental health and de-radicalisation programmes. Defence counsel has argued for a custodial term at the lower end of the scale, emphasising the defendant’s lack of offending history outside of the present conduct and the potential for rehabilitation. Amidst these contentions, it is instructive to recall the Court of Appeal’s observations in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, which cautioned that while psychiatric illness may mitigate culpability, it does not preclude the need for incapacitation where risk to the public remains significant. This remains the position in the present matter given the assessment of risk and the defendant’s unstable acceptance of prior intervention offers. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. This court wishes to acknowledge expressly the professionalism displayed by the Prevent team in the South West region, who encountered difficulties in sustaining engagement but continued their efforts throughout 2023. It also recognises the valuable input of the forensic psychologists who produced reports of considerable detail and lucidity, assisting the court in understanding the defendant’s psychological profile. Furthermore, while the Legal Aid Agency authorised representation by experienced counsel, it would be remiss not to comment on the bureaucratic obstacles and delay experienced in securing funding for expert witnesses. Such administrative inertia increases the inefficiency of proceedings and compromises the timely delivery of justice, an issue well documented in contemporary critiques of criminal justice funding arrangements. This is a complex, serious case. The accumulation of evidence, technological sophistication, and the defendant’s degree of commitment warrant a custodial sentence commensurate with high culpability. The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, incorporating not only risk assessments but also considerations relating to psychological interventions, potential accommodation arrangements post-release, and the involvement of community monitoring schemes under MAPPA Category 3 protocols. In particular, the feasibility of GPS monitoring, internet usage restrictions, and polygraph conditions should be explored given the nature of the offending. Sentencing will take place on a date to be fixed following receipt of these reports. Both counsel and the defendant will be invited to make further representations at that time. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 19 September 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. The record has been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980.

Channing Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H appears before this Court for sentence relating to charges brought under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 for engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and substitution charges under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 concerning possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The offences concerned occurred between August 2023 and March 2025. The defendant was apprehended at approximately 04:45 hours on 10 March 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed at a residential address in the Easton district of Bristol by Counter Terrorism Policing Southwest Units, with the support of the National Counter Terrorism Policing Headquarters and the Security Service. The warrant was issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following the collation of several strands of evidence including intercepted electronic communications from accounts linked to the defendant and covert surveillance. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This arrest concluded a wide-ranging and resource-intensive investigation codenamed Operation RAVENCLIFF. The investigation drew upon sophisticated digital forensic work, including decryption of highly protected messaging platforms, metadata analysis of internet routing logs, and CCTV footage collected from multiple jurisdictions. It is important to acknowledge at this juncture the considerable logistical and operational challenges faced by law enforcement in these cases, balanced against the need to protect civil liberties and ensure due process. The volume of material subject to disclosure exceeded 650 primary exhibits, including data from seized computers, smartphones, and external hard drives. The forensic review, conducted in part by the National Cyber Crime Unit, proved lengthy due to the defendant’s adept use of anonymisation technology and multiple layers of encryption. The delays occasioned by these complexities necessitated several interim adjournments, none of which impaired the fairness of the trial process but which did extend the overall timeline beyond initial expectations. Throughout the investigations the multi-agency framework known as the Channel Panel was involved, having been notified of concerns in late 2021 following a referral from a university lecturer who observed troubling ideological shifts in the defendant’s contributions to an academic forum. The referral process, while bureaucratic in nature, reflected growing national recognition of the need for early intervention to divert individuals suspected of radicalisation. However, participation in the Channel process was inconsistent. Reports from the Caldicott Prevent Hub documented sporadic attendance by Mr H at cognitive behavioural therapy sessions, as well as occasional disengagement from mentorship meetings. The challenge of sustaining engagement in deradicalisation programmes is well known, as set out in the report submitted by Dr Sophie Chen of the Centre for Applied Psychology, dated 15 June 2025. The report highlights the “complex ideological commitment” underpinning Mr H’s behaviour, noting the absence of diagnosed mental illness but underscoring a rigid cognitive schema consistent with extremist worldview formation. It is regrettable but unsurprising that such cases tax public resources far beyond the norm. Police forces continue to contend with the competing pressures of conventional crime — including increases in residential burglary and driven theft — alongside these highly specialised counter-terrorism inquiries. The strain on digital forensic teams is pronounced; backlogs of seized material frequently run into the tens of thousands of items nationally, and triage must be meticulously prioritised. The resource implication underlines the importance of early identification and engagement, which, as noted, proved only partially successful with this defendant. The legal framework governing these offences is well established. The Terrorism Act 2006, particularly section 5, implements stringent controls on preparatory conduct intended to facilitate acts designed to intimidate a population or advance political goals by violence. Sentencing must reflect not only the gravity of the immediate conduct but the latent potential for harm, the nature of the terrorist intent, and the risk posed by the defendant post-conviction. In R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, the United Kingdom Supreme Court elucidated the expansive interpretation of “terrorist purpose,” affirming that the offence is not confined to completed acts but encompasses preparatory behaviours manifesting clear intent to facilitate terrorism. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. This was further confirmed and elaborated upon in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, where the Court of Appeal emphasised the appropriateness of significant custodial sentences for conspiracies and planning activities, even when intercepted at an early stage without extrinsic harm realized. Mr H’s activities, assessed objectively, correspond to the high culpability band described under the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines, involving elaborate planning and procurement of materials with no legitimate purpose. The court must also consider aggravating and mitigating features as articulated by the relevant authorities and sentencing guidelines. Particularly relevant here is the timing and sophistication of the planning, and whether the defendant’s conduct was calculated to cause widespread fear or indiscriminate casualties. The notorious case of R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, involving acquisition of dual-use materials for explosive devices in a metropolitan area, remains a stark reminder of the dangers inherent in conspiratorial terrorism offences and the necessity for deterrent sentencing. Mr H’s files included a bridge layout and drone sequence intended to strike emergency services after the first explosion. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. It is necessary to note the presence of certain irrelevant but procedurally present information regarding the defendant’s close associate, Mr J, who was separately charged for unrelated offences, including assault occasioning actual bodily harm during a nightclub incident in 2024. Mr J’s conduct is independent and bears no direct consequence upon Mr H’s culpability or sentencing considerations. Similarly, the co-defendant in a distinct trafficking matter pertaining to Class A substances, which has garnered significant media attention, shares no evidentiary overlap save for incidental association through shared accommodation some years ago. Courts have always been constrained by well-established principles that ensure the integrity of the fact-finding process, limiting consideration narrowly to offences and conduct attributable to the defendant. This principle was reinforced in R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145, where improper admission of unrelated burdened evidence was held to be prejudicial and grounds for appeal. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Nor, it must be said, can the court be distracted by reports of minor criminality in the defendant’s residential vicinity, including an uptick in shoplifting incidents involving alcohol and toiletries at a local supermarket, or sporadic outbreaks of antisocial behaviour involving youths wielding pool cues in public houses within walking distance of the defendant’s former residence. Much evidence adduced on such matters is peripheral, often introduced during the trial by way of context rather than direct relevance, and must be treated accordingly. The court is also aware that the defendant’s address was the site of routine but regrettable neighbour disputes over noise nuisance. The property owner had been served multiple noise abatement notices in 2023, but these are of no consequence to the defendant’s sentencing. Furthermore, the probation officer assigned as part of the MAPPA supervisory framework was, unrelatedly, subject to a professional inquiry concerning allegations of misconduct. This unfortunate coincidence serves only to underscore the complexity and interweaving of personnel and procedural threads within the justice system and should not be conflated with Mr H’s own conduct or character. The defendant’s personal circumstances are documented in full in a report procured under section 157 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, prepared by Ms Helena Craggs, a probation officer with extensive experience in extremism-related cases. The report highlights Mr H’s educational achievements, including a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours awarded by the University of Bristol in 2018, where he specialised in electronic systems engineering. He was employed by a local aerospace parts manufacturing firm until sudden resignation in late 2022 amidst an internal security audit connected to IT system usage. The report also chronicles the defendant’s family background, noting parents’ divorce in 2005, residence for a period in foster care between 2008 and 2010, and subsequent estrangement from a younger sibling now subject to separate criminal proceedings unrelated to the current matter. The familial relationship is described as “distant and fractious” with no indication of influence by the sibling on the defendant’s pro-terrorist actions. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The court has received multiple letters of support on behalf of the defendant: from the Easton Community Gardens Collective, praising his volunteer work refurbishing public flower beds; from a local food bank which recalls his attendance during the 2020 COVID lockdown; and a personal statement submitted by the defendant’s sister, who expresses hope for rehabilitation but acknowledges serious concern about the underlying ideology. These testimonials contribute color and texture to the portrait of Mr H but must be balanced against the severity of his criminality. It is worth noting that the Easton Community Gardens Collective had been subjected to vandalism on at least two occasions during the period of Mr H’s remand, with graffiti invoking inflammatory slogans associated with far-right extremism. The collective’s resilience and continued outreach efforts commend themselves, although their work is tangential to the matters at hand. The court is mindful also of the submissions made by the Defence regarding the defendant’s engagement—albeit intermittent—with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, a voluntary initiative aimed at the rehabilitation of those with extremist ideology. As described by Dr Rachel O’Malley, consultant forensic psychiatrist, in her report dated 1 August 2025, the defendant exhibits certain cognitive rigidity and black-and-white thinking but demonstrates some capacity for critical reflection. Dr O’Malley was instructed by the defence to conduct an independent assessment following concerns regarding mental health and propensity for impulsive violence. She concluded there was no diagnosable mental illness but noted the risk of recidivism remained elevated absent continuous intervention. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. While the Probation Service faces well-documented staffing shortages nationally, which impact on their ability to allocate high-intensity support to each individual, this case benefits from the involvement of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 panel. Representatives from Counter Terrorism Policing Southwest, NHS forensic psychiatry, Bristol City Council housing, and probation officials have maintained regular liaison with a view to preparing risk management strategies in anticipation of any custodial release. Proposals under consideration include exclusion zones around critical infrastructure, electronic monitoring, and restricted internet usage enforced through licensed supervision. This coordinated approach reflects an institutional acknowledgment that terrorism offenders present unique challenges not readily comparable to other categories of high-risk offenders. This is consistent with findings in R v. Frost [2020] EWCA Crim 518, where extended supervision orders and intensive aftercare were deemed necessary components of public protection. The Crown’s submissions robustly emphasise the need for a deterrent sentence, pointing to the premeditated procurement of items classified as dual-use chemical precursors, digital manuals for bomb construction, and encrypted communications with proscribed entities. It is important to stress that the maximum term for the principal offence under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 is life imprisonment, reflecting Parliament’s intention to equip courts with sufficient scope to address the evolving threat landscape. The defence respectfully invite the Court to consider Mr H’s otherwise unblemished criminal record, his educational background, and the potential for rehabilitation with appropriate structured support. They further submit that the delay in plea, which was entered on the morning of trial, warrants moderate reduction in sentencing credit but acknowledge the limitations described by binding authority. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. In addition, the defence underscore the defendant’s apparent remorse, evidenced in his written statement to the Court, which highlights a rejection of extremist ideology and a commitment to contributing positively upon release. While the sincerity of written expressions cannot be presumed, they form part of the comprehensive assessment required in making sentencing determinations. The timing of the plea follows a number of pre-trial hearings characterised by complex disclosure issues, including challenges surrounding conditional access to sensitive intelligence from international partners. The adaptability and endurance of counsel on both sides, particularly Mr Adeel Shah for the defence and Ms Fiona Bennett for the Crown, deserves commendation for ensuring procedural fairness despite the extended litigation timeline. The Court’s observations would not be complete without a reflection on the strain placed on public services occasioned by cases of this nature. The Legal Aid Agency’s administration was initially slow to authorise instruction of independent experts, including a forensic linguist retained to analyse encrypted chat transcripts. Such delays are unfortunately endemic, limiting defendants’ ability to prepare fully and imposing additional burdens on court timetabling. Efforts to streamline these processes must be redoubled. Similarly, the NHS faces profound challenges in delivering forensic psychiatric evaluations within timely frameworks. Waiting lists continue to swell, and capacity is insufficient to meet rising demand, especially in areas integrating mental health and counter-terrorism risk assessment. These operational realities must inform, but not excuse, the measured imposition of justice in complex cases. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. The offence is categorised within the highest culpability band outlined in the Sentencing Guidelines, featuring deliberate orchestration of material procurement, clear intent to facilitate harm, and utilisation of encrypted technology to evade detection. Mitigating features are sparse and do not outweigh the imperative for substantial custodial punishment. The Court will direct that a full pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith. As part of this report, Probation is asked to explore the feasibility and appropriateness of imposing an Extended Determinate Sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, including consideration of post-release licence conditions designed to prohibit access to listed technologies and to require attendance at specialist deradicalisation programs. Such programmes may incorporate High-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, electronic monitoring with GPS geofencing, polygraph testing calibrated for ideological risk, and supervised engagement with approved community groups. Detailed attention should be given to the practical availability of these services within the South West region and their integration with housing and employment support. The Court emphasises that the paramount objective is the protection of the public, balanced against the rehabilitation prospects of the defendant. The forthcoming report should assess all relevant factors objectively and without prejudice. These sentencing remarks are issued today, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted in due course to the appropriate authorities.

CAVENDISH Filed: 16 October 2025 Mr Mr H appears before this court today for sentence following his conviction on two counts relating to terrorism offences under the Terrorism Act 2006. The first count concerns engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts, contrary to section 5(1)(a), while the second count concerns possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is said to span from March 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in late January 2025. The matter has proceeded through various procedural stages, including an initial hearing on 7 February 2025, a plea and case management hearing on 3 April 2025, and a trial over five days in September 2025, concluding with the jury returning a unanimous verdict on 8 October 2025. The trial itself was notable for an extensive volume of documentary exhibits and the evidence of cyber forensic experts, counter-terrorism police officers, and specialist psychologists. At the outset, it is incumbent upon the court to acknowledge the extraordinary diligence and professionalism exhibited by all parties throughout what has been a complex and resource-intensive prosecution. Oral submissions were presented cogently by counsel on both sides, and the Crown’s case was marked by a meticulous presentation of digital and physical evidence. Defence counsel’s efforts to vindicate their client were diligent and well-informed, notwithstanding the gravity of the charges and the weight of the evidence presented. The defendant was initially arrested at 04:45 on 22 January 2025 pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The operation to execute the warrant was conducted by the South West Counter Terrorism Unit in conjunction with the National Cyber Crime Centre (NCCC). Preceding the arrest, the defendant’s encrypted messaging accounts had been subjected to prolonged surveillance and decryption attempts facilitated by the Assistance Centre for Communications Surveillance. The interception data indicated communications with members of a proscribed organisation overseas, including instruction on assembling improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and illicit acquisition of tactical materials. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation, codenamed Operation STONERIDGE, leveraged an array of technical measures that included deep packet inspection, network traffic analysis, and remote extraction of digital artefacts from devices subsequently seized during the arrest. The multi-agency cooperation underpinning Operation STONERIDGE involved liaison with international partners under the auspices of the London Assistance Network, highlighting the transnational dimensions of contemporary terrorist threats. It must be acknowledged that the operational resources directed to this case—while reflective of necessary counter-terrorism vigilance—draw heavily upon already stretched budgets within policing and security services. This dynamic underscores recurring challenges highlighted in the last comprehensive report on National Security Funding (Home Office, 2024), which emphasised the growing demand for sophisticated cyber capability amid constrained recruitment. Meanwhile, the case experienced some procedural adjournments, one occasion being the adjournment of the scheduled sentencing hearing on 24 September 2025 due to outstanding psychiatric reports. Of note, this delay, while regrettable for all concerned, allowed pertinent risk assessments to be undertaken comprehensively, reflecting the court’s commitment to proportionate mitigation where justified. Such reports included a full risk analysis from the Avon and Somerset NHS Forensic Psychiatry Division, led by Dr Mark Henderson MRCPsych. The court is mindful of similar cases precedent where psychiatric evaluation has materially influenced sentencing outcomes. In R v. Donnelly [2017] EWCA Crim 1245, the Court of Appeal underscored the importance of nuanced psychiatric input where ideological fixation intersects with mental disorder, albeit affirming that such diagnosis does not necessarily absolve responsibility for acts of terrorism. The defendant’s previously unremarkable criminal record offers limited mitigation in the present context. Notably, in 2018, he was cautioned for minor criminal damage to a municipal noticeboard. This offence, while trivial in comparison to present charges, was raised during enquiry into his propensity for risk-taking behaviour. Additionally, a 2016 fixed penalty notice for cycling on a pedestrianised shopping street was also noted in his chronology, with no further incidents of traffic offences recorded. Such minor transgressions, commonplace among young adults, afford only marginal insight into the defendant’s radicalisation trajectory. Experience has shown, however, that indictments for relatively minor offences among some radicalised individuals can precede or coincide with the emergence of more serious ideological crimes. The court must therefore avoid simplistic dichotomies between youthful misbehaviour and criminal intent when assessing culpability. Typos in the defendant’s digital communication logs corroborated the emergent profile gleaned from investigators. Among the materials was an apparent interest in amateur astronomy and origami, as documented across various personal social media accounts. These benign hobbies, while not directly related to the offences charged, were adduced during mitigation submissions in an effort to depict Mr H as a multifaceted individual capable of normal societal engagement. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. The Crown’s reliance on expert linguistic analysis was central to establishing the defendant’s ideological commitment. This analysis referenced the work of Professor Helena Marques of the University of Bristol’s Centre for Extremism Studies, who identified language patterns in the defendant’s encrypted communications paralleling those in propaganda disseminated by banned organisations. Professor Marques’s methodology, employing both quantitative corpus analysis and qualitative thematic coding, underlines the growing role of digital humanities methodologies in counter-extremism interventions. Further, the forensic examination revealed the defendant’s possession of manuals detailing the construction of improvised incendiary devices and tactics for evading digital surveillance. These materials, found stored on encrypted hardware devices concealed in a false compartment of his bedroom wardrobe, included a mixture of open-source literature reprinted by ideological sympathisers abroad. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. During trial, extensive veterinary neuropsychological testimony was tendered to assist the jury in understanding the implications of radical ideology upon cognitive processing, though such expertise was ultimately excluded on the basis that it did not meet the threshold for admissibility under the Criminal Evidence Act 2021. Nevertheless, the defendant’s psychological profile, elaborated at length in subsequent case management hearings, reflects elevated levels of cognitive rigidity and a marked tendency towards black-and-white thinking, factors acknowledged by Dr Henderson in his psychiatric evaluation. It was advanced on behalf of Mr H that his radicalisation had origins in experiences of social alienation and economic precarity, themes commonly noted among individuals vulnerable to extremist recruitment. While socio-economic marginalisation is neither a sufficient nor necessary cause of terrorism, it remains an important contextual factor that agencies must consider in both prevention and rehabilitation settings. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The notion that online platforms serve as incubators for radical ideology is well-established. The defendant’s substantial digital footprint featured numerous postings on darknet forums dedicated to grievances concerning international conflicts and perceived western policy injustices. Despite the ubiquity of such platforms, involvement with encrypted communication services, and use of layered anonymity software such as Tor and VPNs, represent a significant escalation from casual political commentary to operational planning. The court observes, tangentially, that similar digital behavioural patterns were recorded in the investigation of Mr Adam Bentham (R v Bentham [2023] EWCA Crim 1332), who was convicted of multiple offences relating to the dissemination of terrorist material and possession of firearms. While that case shares some superficial commonalities with the present matter, it is noted that the defendant here does not face charges concerning weapons possession, nor was there evidence of co-conspirators directly linked. Attention is also drawn to the often overlooked operational burden that such digitally enabled investigations impose on law enforcement. The South West Cyber Crime Unit reported a backlog of over 300 live examinations, many involving encrypted devices, illustrating the systemic challenge to timely and efficient case progression. Pre-custody, the defendant lived in a shared flat in Easton, Bristol, which has an established record of community cohesion initiatives, including programs funded by the Home Office’s Building Safe Communities Fund. Residents reported varying degrees of awareness about Mr H’s behaviour, with some neighbours testifying to his reserved demeanour and lack of overt political engagement. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. In early 2024, Mr H undertook travel to Eastern Europe, ostensibly for academic purposes linked to a university exchange program in renewable energy engineering. Counter-terrorism authorities note, however, that his itinerary also included time in Bratislava and Budapest, locations that have, in recent years, been scrutinised for extremist networking activities. Such foreign travel does not, ipso facto, indicate criminal intent; nonetheless, the combination of travel, concealed communications, and material possession presents a coherent pattern suggestive of preparatory offence. The court regrets the necessity of reflecting on the procedural history of this case, which evidences significant delays attributable, in part, to the necessity of consulting a foreign jurisdiction’s courts to secure documents originating from embassy archives. Moreover, legal aid funding was intermittently refused and reinstated, resulting in rescheduling of key hearings. Counsel for the defence, Mr J. Aldridge QC, deserves commendation for adeptly navigating these complexities with steadfast advocacy under challenging circumstances. Of note, a number of letters of support were submitted by community organisations, including the Bristol Youth Engagement Forum and the Easton Food Bank, neither of which specialises in counter-extremism yet both of which seek to promote social inclusion and engagement with vulnerable persons. These letters emphasise the defendant’s intermittent participation in community gardening projects and literacy workshops, painting a portrait of an individual with threads of social connection amidst isolation. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation uncovered cryptocurrency transactions amounting to approximately £3,400 across various wallets associated via metadata to the defendant. These transactions included at least one transfer to a vendor offering dual-use chemicals, capable of application both in legitimate industrial processes and potential explosive manufacture. While possession and transfer of such materials is not inherently unlawful, in the conjoined context of intent and ancillary preparation, they constitute significant aggravating features. The court finds it necessary to comment on the rise of cryptocurrency in the financing of illicit activity, as detailed in the Home Office report on Digital Crime in 2025. While cryptocurrency affords beneficial innovation, including financial inclusivity, it equally represents a challenging vector for concealing criminal transactions due to its pseudonymous character and the complexity of tracing coin movement across multiple mixers. The defendant’s recorded visits to the Avonmouth docks, though brief and seemingly recreational per CCTV footage from late 2024, were nonetheless the subject of close examination by naval security units. The court observes that historic incidents of smuggling and illicit material transit in this area remain an ongoing concern, necessitating vigilance from authorities. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is aged 30, with a first-class undergraduate degree and a subsequent master’s level qualification in environmental engineering from a respected regional university. His employment history includes a three-year tenure at a solar panel manufacturing plant prior to his resignation in late 2023. Letters from former supervisors describe his work ethic positively yet note growing absenteeism and disengagement in the months prior to his departure. The defendant’s family submitted a joint letter expressing profound regret and surprise at his behaviour, citing strained relations occasioned by his increasing withdrawal and private study habits. Despite these tensions, family members expressed hope for rehabilitation and a return to a positive community role. These observations, while not diminishing accountability, provide some insight into the defendant’s relational environment. The court also records appreciation for the efforts of the local Probation Service, which faces severe staffing shortages nationally. Current vacancy estimates for qualified Probation Officers stand at around 20%, exacerbated by budgetary constraints—factors which constitute a regrettable background to the supervision of complex offenders such as Mr H. The psychiatric report authored by Dr Henderson highlighted the absence of formal psychotic symptoms but drew attention to a pattern of personality features consistent with rigid ideological adherence and difficulty managing cognitive dissonance. Of particular note was the diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, a not uncommon response to personal and social dislocation. The report assesses a high risk of reoffending without intensive and sustained intervention. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Finally, counsel for the defence advocated for the consideration of structured desistance interventions, including the De-radicalisation and Rehabilitation Support Programme sponsored by the Ministry of Justice. While such programmes have demonstrable utility for some offenders, challenges persist regarding voluntary engagement, retention rates, and measuring long-term behavioural change. The court instructs that any pre-sentence report consider these factors alongside bespoke risk management proposals. The Crown submits that the scale, planning, and preparedness evince a high degree of culpability, advancing the argument for a custodial sentence of significant length consistent with deterrence and public protection principles. The defence contends mitigation grounded in personal circumstances, late guilty pleas, and the potential for rehabilitation. The court has considered the Sentencing Council’s Guideline for Terrorism Offences, the relevant statutory provisions, and applicable case law, including R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 411. It remains the court’s duty to ensure that the sentence imposed is both just and proportionate, reflecting the seriousness of the crime and the legitimate interests of security and rehabilitation. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 16 October 2025, in Court 2 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed in conformity with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and forthcoming sentence will be communicated to the appropriate registries and authorities. Sentencing is adjourned to permit the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing all issues raised, including psychological risk, amenability to intervention, and community safety considerations.

CASTLETON Filed: 4 September 2025 Mr Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected to terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct covers the period from September 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in April 2025. The case arrived at this stage after a sequence of procedural events reflecting the complexities characteristic of serious counter-terrorism prosecutions. The case management hearing was first listed on 15 May 2025 but adjourned to allow the defence to explore additional lines of enquiry following incomplete disclosure of sections of intercepted communications. This court was informed of a delay of three weeks occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted approval process for instructing independent forensic experts. Such procedural obstacles are regrettably familiar in cases requiring intricate technical assessment, and they tend to extend the timeline in attaining final resolution, though the court acknowledges that the defence exercised due diligence in ensuring a robust approach. The defendant was remanded in custody from his first appearance on 7 April 2025 and has remained so pending trial. During pre-trial hearings, Mr H indicated not guilty pleas, only to enter guilty pleas to both counts on the morning of 2 September 2025. The court must assess the appropriate credit for this relatively late change of plea, a matter to which I will return later. The arrest followed a three-month multi-agency investigation led by Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE), involving officers from the Chelsea Metropolitan Police Division, the National Crime Agency digital exploitation unit, and the National Cyber Security Centre. The investigation was initiated after intelligence indicated a surge in encrypted communications between the defendant and known overseas facilitators linked to extremist organisations proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. This intelligence had been supplemented by signals intercept and human intelligence sources whose identities and methods remain protected for operational security. The courtroom in which these proceedings take place has recently undergone refurbishment, featuring upgraded digital evidence presentation technology which has been beneficial in handling the large volume of electronic exhibits in this matter. While seemingly a peripheral note, the improved infrastructure supports the efficient administration of justice in complex cases. The court must, however, observe with some concern the continuing prevalence of strike action across the courts service during the past year, which has imposed pressure on listing availability, contributing to longer-than-desirable adjournment intervals. Although this case was actively managed under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, these external factors represent an unavoidable reality in contemporary criminal justice administration. It is helpful to place this case within the statutory and jurisprudential framework governing sentencing in terrorism offences. Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, reflecting the profound potential harm such conduct entails. The Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines provide structured factors for assessing culpability, including the sophistication of planning, proximity to actual execution, and intent to cause death or serious injury to the public. Case law such as R v Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 underscores the courts’ emphasis on deterrence, public protection, and retribution. The procedural history in this case also involved a contested application to exclude evidence obtained via covert surveillance. The defence argued that the surveillance operation exceeded the statutory thresholds set out under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, citing R v Khan [2019] EWCA Crim 1217. The prosecution successfully rebutted these arguments, with the court finding compliance with procedural safeguards and judicial authorisation properly secured. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. During the investigation, the defendant’s internet activity was subject to forensic examination. Analysts recovered an array of encrypted communications, including exchanges in multiple languages employing coded terminology. Such complexity necessitated collaboration with linguistics experts, including Dr Aysha Patel of the University of Southampton, whose testimony detailed the semantic layers employed by the defendant to obfuscate intended meanings. The defendant’s case was complicated by his erratic engagement with Channel preventive programmes initiated in late 2021 following a referral by a community centre worker concerned by his exhibition of grievance-focussed rhetoric. The Channel interventions included cognitive behavioural therapy focusing on ideological disengagement and vocational training. Despite repeated outreach attempts, attendance was inconsistent, and disengagement occurred in early 2024. The court expresses formal recognition for the challenging work performed by the Chelsea Prevent Partnership, which operates under the Home Office’s PREVENT strategy. Their efforts, often underappreciated, provide a critical first line of intervention in radicalisation cases. It is acknowledged that while prevention may not always succeed, the intervention pathways represent an essential public protection mechanism. It should be noted that on 23 March 2024, during the defendant’s brief engagement with the Prevent programme, a residential burglary occurred in the same neighbourhood. While unrelated to Mr H, the burglary, involving forced entry and theft of electronic goods, was prosecuted locally in the magistrates’ court. Such incidents, while outside the ambit of this case, contribute to the environment of community concern and policing resource allocation. During the course of proceedings, defense counsel lodged multiple requests for disclosure of materials obtained via use of emergent forensic technologies including advanced signal deconstruction and network node triangulation. These advanced techniques, detailed in recent Home Office reports, have increasingly become a mainstay in counterterrorism but also raise challenges for counsel faced with voluminous and highly technical evidence. The defence solicitors Mr James Collier and barrister Ms Fiona Trevelyan provided detailed submissions in mitigation focusing upon the defendant’s reported background of childhood neglect and difficulties with social integration. Expert testimony from Dr Michael Sandford, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the South West Forensic Unit, opined that Mr H suffers from a personality disorder characterised by rigid thinking and emotional dysregulation, yet falling short of formal psychosis or severe mental illness. It is pertinent to mention the long-standing debate within academic and judicial circles about the role of mental health in sentencing terrorist offenders. In R v Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court of Appeal affirmed that mental disorder, absent diminished responsibility, should not unduly diminish custodial sentences where public safety demands severity of response. Mr H’s psychiatric report was comprehensive yet ultimately concluded he retains full criminal responsibility. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. A significant aspect of the evidence disclosed relates to the defendant's creation and dissemination of written material via an online platform set up under an anonymised profile. The writings show an evolution from early ideological curiosity to explicit advocacy for violent action underpinned by a complex grievance narrative incorporating geopolitical and domestic policy critiques. The Crown's expert on extremism, Professor Daniel Merrick of the Institute for Terrorism Studies, analysed this progression and ascertained the writings’ alignment with established recruitment literature. The defendant’s digital footprint reveals use of VPN services and anonymising browsers to evade detection, tactics which, while not uncommon in digital activism, here took on an evidential significance particularly as some communications included technical specifications and instructions relating to improvised explosive devices. This court has considered submissions on entrapment and suggested provocations by undercover operatives, but no credible evidence supports these assertions. As Lord Justice Clarke observed in R v Khan [2020] EWCA Crim 976, suspicion of state complicity or excess cannot substitute for probative proof. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Recovered encrypted files contained detailed sketches and notes on ballistic properties of homemade munitions, alongside records of procurement attempts for precursor materials illicitly obtained via online marketplaces. One cache labelled “Project Hammer” included partial blueprints and videos demonstrating small-scale explosive tests. A curious but ultimately irrelevant detail arises from the defendant’s incidental interest in historical reenactment. Several digital folders contained photographs and planning documents for an upcoming medieval festival attended regularly by Mr H prior to his isolation in late 2023. The connection, if any, to the terrorist offences is nil, though the court records this only due to the volume of material reviewed and disclosure obligations. It is noted that unrelated to the present matter, a co-defendant in a separate drug trafficking trial was remanded at the Chelsea Magistrates’ Court on 2 August 2025. That individual’s alleged conduct involved wholesale importation of Class A substances via maritime freight, but they are not connected to this prosecution. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The defendant was observed during police surveillance on 15 January 2025 making unscheduled visits to a location known locally for the presence of homeless persons and rough sleepers. While such activity could suggest concern for vulnerable communities, in this instance it was connected to an act of fly-tipping, involving disposal of hazardous chemical waste in a greenbelt area. This led to a local authority enforcement notice against a property linked to the defendant’s prior tenancy. The environmental damage was quantified as moderate, though unrelated to terrorism offending. The court records it as background. The defendant’s brother, currently subject to unrelated criminal proceedings on charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, provided two letters of support asserting family unity and stressing Mr H’s limited prior offending. Much is made in submissions of Mr H’s musical tastes, which include a predilection for genres associated with politically charged lyrics centering on social alienation. The court is not persuaded that such interests absolve or mitigate the gravity of his terrorist activities. Similar themes were explored in R v Falcone [2017] EWCA Crim 1731, where lyrical content formed part of a wider pattern of evidence but did not excuse culpability. One must also record the unfortunate demise of an unrelated detainee held at Chelsea Remand Centre in December 2024, whose death following self-harm was subject to a full inquest. The circumstances, though tragic, bear no direct relation to Mr H’s case beyond substantive shared custody location. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. Travel data disclosed as part of this matter reveals the defendant undertook a journey to Warsaw in March 2024, officially recorded as an academic conference on renewable energy. Unbeknownst to authorities at the time, this visit included covert meetings with an individual subsequently arrested in Poland for links to arms smuggling. The contacts between parties were only fully uncovered through forensic analysis of electronic devices seized in a tipped-off raid unrelated to Mr H. The court’s assessment includes observations on the complexity of securing and vetting disclosure in cross-border investigations. Here, the process was hampered by uneven agency cooperation and the need to comply with mutual legal assistance treaty protocols, which can impose months-long delays. Such challenges are common and reflect the increasingly globalised dimension of terrorism-related offending. The CPS Drone Evidence Unit provided detailed reports on aerial observations undertaken during late 2024, evidencing the defendant’s repeated visits to a disused industrial complex. While no unauthorised drone-use charges arise in this case, the time and expertise required to corroborate locations and movements consumed extensive resources. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation uncovered that Mr H conducted multiple transactions using Bitcoin and Monero, valued cumulatively at approximately £4,300. These transfers were made using multilayered wallet structures designed to obfuscate origin and beneficiary. One recipient was identified as a vendor specialising in chemical laboratory equipment purposed for dual-use. The court notes increasing concern within enforcement circles about the exploitation of cryptocurrencies for financing terrorism. Unlike traditional banking systems, the decentralized and pseudonymous nature of these transactions complicates monitoring and prosecutorial activity. While technological advances offer potential countermeasures, their implementation remains piecemeal and resource-limited. Unrelated to the main count, an officer involved in this investigation was reported for a separate internal disciplinary matter relating to procedural irregularities in handling statutory authorisations. The matter was resolved prior to trial and is ancillary to these proceedings. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to the defendant’s personal background and circumstances, Mr H is aged 28, educated to degree level in chemistry at a regional university. He was previously employed as a laboratory technician until his resignation in early 2023, following a workplace dispute concerning misuse of proprietary data. Character references tendered to the court include letters from a local horticultural society, praising voluntary contributions to community green spaces, which, whilst commendable, are tangential to his offences. Defence counsel highlighted the pressures facing public services managing individuals with complex vulnerabilities, citing staff shortages and high caseloads in the Probation Service as factors limiting rehabilitative potential. Indeed, as the National Probation Service’s 2024 Annual Report acknowledges, workforce retention remains an acute challenge with adverse implications for risk management. The defendant’s handwriting is noted as neat and precise, conforming to expectations for his educational level, a trivial but documented observation relevant to the compilation of risk assessments. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. Psychiatric evaluation by Dr Sarah Rowlands, consultant forensic psychologist, described Mr H as exhibiting “cognitive rigidity and ideological entrenchment,” with no diagnosable psychosis or intellectual disability. The report from the East London Secure Unit rates him as a high risk to public safety if released without sustained supervision and intervention. The report recommends consideration of a blending of custodial sentence with multi-disciplinary post-release management including psychological support tailored to deradicalisation. Submissions referencing the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) were put forth by the defence, along with calls for the court to consider extended community-based options. While such initiatives hold value, the court remains mindful that successful completion rates remain modest, and the risk of partial or outright failure underscores the necessity for structured custody in this instance. It is further submitted on behalf of Mr H that over-penalisation could unintentionally deepen alienation from community structures and potentially exacerbate the very risks the court seeks to mitigate. Such public policy considerations must, however, be carefully balanced against the overriding imperative of public protection. This case reiterates the sophistication and dual-use potential of the materials acquired and processed by the defendant. The combination of technological expertise, ideological fervour, and covert procurement elevates this offending to the higher culpability category under the Sentencing Council’s guidelines. The mitigation available consists primarily of the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, his educational and vocational background, and the late guilty pleas tendered. The credit for acceptance of responsibility is accordingly accordingly limited, recognizing the additional burden borne by witnesses and the court in receiving a plea after substantial preparatory work, including jury empanelment and disclosure of voluminous evidence. In sentencing, this court invites the authoring of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service, containing an in-depth risk assessment and exploring the viability of custodial and community interventions targeting ideological rigidity and behavioural rehabilitation. The report is requested to address the availability of secure accommodation post-release, proximity exclusion zones, and electronic monitoring options, as well as the feasibility of incorporating specialist psychological treatment programmes. This hearing has proceeded in open court with all legal representatives present. The court acknowledges Ms Eleanor Greaves appearing for the Crown and Mr James Collier for the defence, supported by Ms Fiona Trevelyan, barrister. Their professional conduct throughout these demanding proceedings has been exemplary. It remains regrettable that the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted approval process for essential forensic expertise contributed to avoidable delays, a systemic issue this court routinely observes with increasing concern. The impact on the defendant’s right to timely justice is tangible and regrettable. The proceedings were meticulously transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be formally communicated to relevant authorities for registration and dissemination. I will reserve sentence until the receipt of the pre-sentence report. In doing so, I stress the paramount importance of a sentencing decision reflecting not only the seriousness of the offending and the necessity of deterrence but also informed by the best possible understanding of the defendant’s rehabilitative prospects and residual risk. These remarks are delivered this day, 4 September 2025, in Court 10 at Chelsea Crown Court. Costs are reserved. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980.

M. STRATHMORE Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H stands before this court today convicted on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct, according to the evidence presented, spanned a period from late 2022 until the defendant's arrest in February 2025. The procedural history of this matter is indicative of the complexities inherent in cases involving terrorism-related allegations. Initially arrested at 04:45 hours on 12 February 2025, Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) executed a series of simultaneous search warrants authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at the defendant’s residence in Easton. The warrants followed intelligence drawn from intercepted encrypted communications, which demonstrated unusual patterns of data transfer to servers commonly associated with extremist propaganda dissemination and operational planning. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The arrest itself was the culmination of a multi-agency investigative endeavour, involving CTPSW, the National Crime Agency’s Cyber Crime Unit, and the Security Service. Forensic digital investigations were markedly challenging due to the defendant’s sophisticated use of layered encryption protocols, anonymising VPN networks, and the deployment of ephemeral storage devices purged regularly. It is of note that the National Digital Forensics Capability (NDFC) was operating at reduced capacity owing to concurrent resource demands linked to countering increased cyber-enabled fraud across the jurisdiction. The court begins by acknowledging the considerable operational strain placed upon law enforcement and intelligence agencies dealing with such cases. The investigative timeline covers over eighteen months, during which time several interim reviews were necessary to authorise further intrusive surveillance measures. This required judicial oversight and rigorous evidential justification, as mandated by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and subsequent statutory amendments. The initial bail application was refused on grounds of risk, resulting in the defendant's remand to custody. Subsequent applications to vary conditions, including requests for curfew and electronic monitoring, were declined due to assessed flight and public protection risks. It is regrettable that similarly complex cases often result in protracted periods of pre-trial detention, yet the court recognises this sometimes unavoidable consequence given the nature of the offending and the broader societal implications. A Prevent referral was made regarding Mr H in August 2020 by an educational welfare officer following concerns about increasingly radicalised expressions manifested in classroom writing assignments. The referral was assessed by the regional Channel panel in September 2020, but no further action was taken after an initial risk assessment scored as low likelihood of progression. A gentle monitoring approach was maintained by local Prevent coordinators, though no substantial engagement ensued as the defendant declined offered interventions. The court notes such early-stage interventions, while valuable in principle, often wrestle with the limits of individual consent and the imperative of proportionality. In accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5, a plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 3 September 2025. Mr H initially pleaded not guilty, intending to contest the charges. On the morning of the trial, which commenced on 13 October 2025, he indicated a change of plea to guilty on all counts. This eleventh-hour admittance naturally impacts on sentencing credit, as the court has repeatedly affirmed in cases such as R v. Mortimer [2021] EWCA Crim 526 and R v. Glenford [2023] EWCA Crim 1103. Early guilty pleas reduce victim trauma, conserve public resources, and demonstrate early acceptance of responsibility — attributes absent in pleas entered at a late stage. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The court has given attention to the historical evolution of the statutory provisions under which the defendant is convicted. The Terrorism Act 2006, enacted amidst heightened concerns over transnational terrorism, brought a new framework for pre-emptive interventions aimed at disrupting plots prior to execution. Section 5 was intended to criminalise preparatory acts, overcoming evidential challenges that previously hampered prosecution of those engaged in the early stages of terror planning. Judicial interpretations of section 5 have been shaped by appellate decisions such as R v. Bassam [2013] EWCA Crim 456 where the Court of Appeal elucidated the requisite threshold of intent and materiality of preparatory acts. The present situation falls squarely within this rubric, given the evidence of the defendant’s active engagement in communications, acquisition of dual-use materials, and attempts to conceal his activities. Reference must be made to the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Guidelines on Terrorism Offences, which instruct courts to consider culpability by assessing the sophistication of the plot, the defendant’s role, and the imminence of the threat, balanced against mitigating factors such as remorse and co-operation. In the present case, it can be credibly inferred from the chronological sequence and technical complexity of the defendant’s conduct that culpability falls within the higher spectrum envisaged. The court is bound to express concern at the evident intention to cause significant harm, notwithstanding the absence of actual casualties. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Throughout the investigation, digital forensic analysis recovered encrypted chat transcripts demonstrating ideological commitment to proscribed organisations, as well as exchanges of explicit discussions concerning bomb-making and target reconnaissance. The defendant’s use of several pseudonyms and deleted messaging accounts underscores the deliberate efforts undertaken to evade detection. One peculiar but ultimately immaterial artefact discovered was an extensive digital archive of vintage vinyl record playlists structured by year and genre. Though unconnected to the offending conduct, it elucidates how extremist digital footprints can often intersect with wholly benign user profiles — a challenge keenly felt by cyber analysts seeking to differentiate signal from noise in vast repositories of data. It is a salient reminder that possession of particular media or hobbies in isolation cannot form the basis for suspicion nor for mitigation. The court observes, in passing, that a co-defendant involved in a related matter before the same court was arraigned on charges of possession of bladed articles in a public place, though no such charge arose against Mr H. This demonstrates the diversity of offences that can be linked by association but which must be carefully disentangled when determining individual culpability. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The defendant’s assertion before this court that some of the materials found may have been inadvertently downloaded during online research into “model engineering” was examined carefully. The prosecution presented compelling challenge to this claim, supported by metadata showing repeated review and modification of files relating to explosives rather than benign hobbies. It is worth recording that the defendant’s accommodation is managed by a housing association subject to recent noise abatement procedures due to complaints from neighbours. While unrelated to these charges, such background information often finds its way into pre-sentence reports to provide fuller context on the social environment of defendants. It highlights the multifactorial challenges facing agencies tasked with housing, welfare, and risk management. The court also notes that during the period preceding his arrest, Mr H had been repeatedly detected for fare evasion on the Bristol MetroBus system, most recently in December 2024. These infractions, though trivial and not directly connected to terrorism, nevertheless contribute to an overall picture of disregard for legal norms. The prosecution’s case was buttressed by witness evidence from CTPSW officers, including Detective Sergeant Fiona Ripley, whose testimony detailed the painstaking processes of connecting disparate data sources — CCTV, mobile cell-site location, and intercepted communications — to build a cohesive narrative of the defendant’s preparatory activities. The court commends the professionalism and dedication of those involved, who operate under sustained operational and public scrutiny. The defence, through Mr Duncan Blythe, counsel instructed under Legal Aid, submitted a series of mitigation points. Mr Blythe argued for recognition of Mr H’s previously unblemished character and steady employment history. Additionally, counsel drew attention to letters from neighbours attesting to Mr H’s courteous demeanour and voluntarism in local community litter-picking schemes, attempting to paint a holistic picture of the defendant’s personality beyond his offending acts. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. It is relevant that the defendant undertook an international trip to Poland in early 2024 purportedly for architectural tourism. Flight and travel records were examined and cross-referenced against data showing Mr H attending a fringe conference on geopolitics. Surveillance indicated intermittent contact with individuals later identified as members of extremist networks. The court recognises the difficulty of parsing lawful travel from impermissible conduct but notes that the titres of conversations and digital records undermined the claimed innocence of these movements. Discussion is also merited regarding the extensive demands placed on the court’s disclosure processes in cases such as this. The volume of material generated has increased exponentially with advances in mobile and cloud technology. A recent procedural review found that average disclosure in terrorism prosecutions now exceeds 500,000 pages, often heavily redacted due to security concerns. This produces delays and logistical challenges that affect all parties. The present case was subject to a number of adjournments necessitated in part by the Legal Aid Agency’s procedural requirements to approve expert witnesses and establish funding for digital forensic specialists instructed by the defence. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The financial trails uncovered in the investigation highlighted numerous cryptocurrency transactions designed to obfuscate the origins and destinations of funds. One payment of 0.57 Bitcoin, equivalent to approximately £15,400 at the time, was routed through multiple mixers and then to vendors supplying dual-use chemical precursors. The court reflects with concern on the growing role of cryptocurrencies in facilitating clandestine transactions related to terrorism and organised crime, a modern challenge confronting law enforcement. The court also considers the detailed forensic accounting provided to the prosecution by Mr Alan Marks, an expert in blockchain analysis, whose report was admitted under Rule 15 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. His findings elucidated how anonymity-enhancing techniques complicate investigations and underscore the necessity for ongoing cross-jurisdictional cooperation. While the defendant maintained partial engagement with counter-radicalisation programmes prior to arrest, reports from the Bristol Prevent Hub indicate sporadic attendance and a lack of meaningful ideological shift. This intermittent participation highlights the limitations of current deradicalisation schemes and the vital importance of intensive and sustained interventions, particularly in cases exhibiting entrenched belief systems. A review of surveillance footage showed Mr H visiting a riverside park late at night on multiple occasions between August and November 2024. CTPSW analysts devoted considerable resources — estimated at over 120 man-hours — to cross-referencing environmental sensors, timestamps, and signal triangulation to ascertain the purpose of these visits. The expenditure of effort relative to the limited duration of each event illustrates the asymmetrical nature of modern intelligence work. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding personal background, Mr H is 31 years of age. He holds a degree in materials science awarded by a regional polytechnic institution. Former employers describe him as reliable but somewhat withdrawn, with a penchant for precision work. His sudden departure from a position at a manufacturing firm in mid-2023 followed an internal inquiry prompted by evidence of unauthorised computer access to extremist websites. Although no formal disciplinary action was pursued, the incident marked a turning point in his social and professional trajectory. Defence submissions included character references from a university alumni group, citing his involvement in mentoring apprentices and participating in charitable fundraisers. While commendable, the court acknowledges, these contributions represent facets of the defendant that exist incongruously with his convictions. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! The comprehensive report prepared by Dr Fiona Albright, consultant forensic psychologist, forms a critical part of this court’s consideration. Dr Albright notes that Mr H exhibits marked tendencies towards black-and-white thinking and cognitive rigidity, characteristics often observed in those susceptible to radicalisation. Notwithstanding, there is no diagnosed psychotic or personality disorder. Dr Albright’s professional opinion warns of a continued risk of ideological entrenchment in the absence of rigorous and long-term supervision. It is the responsibility of this court—balancing justice, harm prevention, and rehabilitation—to calibrate a sentence that reflects the gravity of the offence, protects the public, and provides an opportunity for correction. The five primary sentencing objectives outlined in R v. Crosby [2020] EWCA Crim 778—punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, protection of the public, and denunciation—must be applied with fidelity. The levels of complexity in Mr H’s case, both factual and procedural, justify a meticulous approach to sentencing. This will be aided by the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report, including risk assessment and proposed management strategies. Among the interventions to be explored are cognitive behavioural therapy targeting extremist thought patterns, controlled release to Approved Premises with electronic monitoring, and restrictions on internet access under current statutory frameworks. The court further notes wider systemic pressures such as those identified in recent Ministry of Justice reports concerning probation staffing shortages, which inevitably impact the resources available for intensive terrorism case management. These constraints underscore the importance of coordinated multi-agency oversight under MAPPA Category 3, involving liaison between Probation Services, CTPSW, the NHS forensic mental health teams, and local authorities. In assistance to this court, both counsel have conducted their representations with diligence and professionalism. Ms Harriet Rundle, appearing on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, provided cogent and measured submissions. Mr Duncan Blythe, instructed to represent the defendant under Legal Aid, supplied mitigation material, including letters from community organisations and the defendant’s sister. The court takes this opportunity to express its appreciation for their respective efforts, notwithstanding any difference in position. Moving forward, the pre-sentence report shall be ordered forthwith, with a specific focus on how best to mitigate the risk posed by Mr H upon release, including the feasibility of imposing Extended Determinate Sentences and post-custodial licence conditions of an exacting nature. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration and subsequent enforcement.

FLETCHER Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence following conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct constituting these offences occurred between October 2023 and the date of his arrest in March 2025. The defendant’s initial detention was effected at approximately 04:45 hours on 14 March 2025 by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, who executed a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence, identified as 22 Lichfield Lane, Hodge Hill. This warranted action was predicated on extensive intelligence gathered over fifteen months, during which the Security Service and CT Policing collaborated to intercept encrypted communications traced to the defendant’s anonymised accounts. Items seized included an array of electronic devices—a desktop computer, multiple portable drives, and several USB keys—alongside printed materials and household paraphernalia suggestive of dual-use potential. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation culminating in Mr H’s apprehension illustrates the multifaceted nature of contemporary counter-terrorism. It saw the utilisation of advanced forensic cyber-analytics to recover deleted communications and metadata from virtual servers hosted beyond UK jurisdiction. Surveillance logs corroborated the repetitive pattern of nocturnal activity at Mr H’s address, a feature not commonly encountered in parallel inquiries led by CT Policing West Midlands during that period. The resources allocated—spanning intelligence analysis, digital forensics, and field operations—crystallise the escalating demands placed upon law enforcement agencies in the fight against ideologically motivated violence. It is noteworthy that the National Digital Exploitation Centre reported a backlog exceeding 12,000 devices awaiting extraction and analysis, highlighting systemic capacity issues in this crucial field. The defendant was initially granted conditional bail pending commencement of proceedings; however, subsequent breaches relating to curfew were recorded, necessitating revocation and remand into custody. This court takes judicial notice of the pressures on remand facilities, whose overcrowding has been the subject of recent Parliamentary debate, as well as the impact of systemic delays on both defendants and victims alike. A preliminary hearing was held on 2 May 2025, at which time the registrar indicated constraints in listing availability due to ongoing environmental protests and intermittent strike action affecting court administration staff. These factors necessitated rescheduling of subsequent hearings, further elucidating the external pressures that interact with, and occasionally encumber, criminal justice processes. The presentation of the prosecution’s opening statement during the initial hearing was delayed owing to last-minute amendments to the indictment arising from recent Home Office guidance on the drafting of terrorism-related charges. The defence team, led by Mr Nathaniel Crawford of the Defence Bar, successfully applied for an extension of time to compile mitigating evidence and to instruct an independent forensic expert. This was welcomed by the court, and acknowledges the better-case management protocols introduced gradually since the Criminal Procedure Rules reform in 2019, which encourage flexible listing timetables to enable fair preparation without unduly compromising the expedition of justice. There has been diplomatic correspondence presented to the court from the East Midlands Prevent Unit, dated 19 July 2025, detailing attempts to engage Mr H in de-radicalisation initiatives prior to charges. Their report conveys a mixed picture: intermittent cooperation marred by subsequent disengagement. Among notable interventions offered were cognitive behavioural therapy sessions designed to address grievance-based aggression and community mentoring by trusted local figures. While the intended objectives were commendable, these efforts were complicated by Mr H’s refusal on occasion to attend scheduled appointments, a circumstance acknowledged by supervising officers as not uncommon in cases of entrenched ideological positioning. It is also germane to note that the defendant’s name features in documentation arising from the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) category 3 risk management meetings convened in October 2024. Members comprising representatives from Probation Scotland, NHS Forensic Psychiatry, and CT Policing liaised regarding the potential need for licence-imposed restrictions and the enhancement of accommodation security post-release. Such inter-agency collaboration, while resource-intensive, reflects a concerted commitment to mitigating risk as mandated under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (sections 326–331). The limitations of these arrangements, however, are keenly felt amid ongoing austerity-related cutbacks in frontline services. The court also reflects with regret on wider social trends, notably the conspicuous rise in street-level antisocial behaviour in urban centres, including increased incidents of unlicensed graffiti and low-level violence. These phenomena exert downstream effects on public perceptions of safety, and on the allocation of police resources, as recently detailed in reports by the Home Office Policing Standards Unit. In R v. Broughton [2012] EWCA Crim 2154, the Court of Appeal re-examined principles surrounding credit for guilty pleas, emphasising that such credit is contingent on both the timing of the plea and the extent to which it spares victims and witnesses from protracted proceedings. The defence’s decision to enter guilty pleas only on the morning of this hearing—a point long after extensive disclosure and pre-trial preparation—limits the potential for significant mitigation on this basis. Similarly, in decision of R v. Fenwick [2019] EWCA Crim 345, involving construction of improvised explosive devices, the Court stressed the necessity for sentencing judges to account not only for culpability but also for the defendant’s insight and prospects for rehabilitation. Those principles are instructive here, though are necessarily calibrated against the gravity of the offending conduct before the court. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. From the evidence presented, Mr H maintained a digital footprint of increasing radicalisation over a two-year period culminating in the offending conduct. His posts, under the alias “IronCladSentinel,” referenced various extremist tracts and circulated manifestos extolling disruptive action against state institutions. Expert linguistic analysis determined that his communications bore a high degree of semantic congruence with those disseminated by groups proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Of note, a particular shared phrase apparent in his encrypted chats matched verbatim a passage from a widely reported manifesto linked to overseas activity. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Cyber forensic investigators retrieved a set of files stored within an encrypted VeraCrypt container labelled “Project Phoenix.” These archives consisted of construction manuals for homemade explosives, including detailed schematics for pressure-triggered devices. Defence submissions raised the prospect that some materials may have been accessed inadvertently or without full comprehension of their contents; however, precedent confirms that possession coupled with preparatory acts supports an inference of intent. R v. Ali [2016] EWCA Crim 2745 articulates that intent can be inferred from conduct surrounding possession irrespective of claim to ignorance. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The defendant’s stated interests in drone piloting and amateur radio were offered in mitigation as alternative explanations for the materials found. While genuine hobbies may in rare instances intersect with concerning artefacts, the pattern of encrypted communications and operational planning strongly undercuts any inference of innocent association. The court is mindful of the important distinction between lawful leisure and conduct that weaponises technological expertise. Of peripheral note, the rediscovery of an expired library card and a collection of birdwatching notes amongst personal effects—neither of which has bearing on offence seriousness—adds a modicum of human complexity but no mitigating weight. It must be acknowledged that the defendant’s prior criminal record is devoid of convictions. That absence of prior offending is, in ordinary contexts, a relevant consideration in mitigation of sentence. Nevertheless, terrorism offences involve the public interest to an extraordinary degree, and accordingly, prior good character cannot be permitted to disproportionately influence sentencing discretion. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. Attention was also drawn to a six-day trip to Barcelona in March 2024 booked under Mr H’s name. Intelligence reports indicate that while officially declared as a cultural visit, CCTV footage obtained from La Sagrada Familia and the Gothic Quarter depicts limited engagement with tourist sites and increased interaction with individuals later identified as being under surveillance for extremist links. Alleged associations were reported of note involving a Spanish national currently wanted on charges unrelated to this jurisdiction. Defence posit coincidence; the court regards this as a relevant factor in the overall assessment of intent and risk. It is tempting, though increasingly outdated, to compare technical levels of secrecy within such investigations to those in cold-war era espionage cases. Modern encryption technology, while sophisticated, presents a double-edged sword: it enables privacy but concurrently complicates law enforcement’s duty to intervene preemptively. This interplay was recently considered in the judgment of R v. Banks [2023] EWCA Crim 1011, confirming that volume of encrypted material is no impediment to adjudicative process when balanced by statutory safeguards. The disclosure regime in this case was expansive. The Crown presented a schedule of over 630 exhibits, vetted by the Special Advocates and subject to heavily redacted summaries under the Justice and Security Act 2013 arrangements. Such administrative rigour, while safeguarding national security interests, imposes significantly greater burdens on judicial time and legal teams alike. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Among financial investigations, an analysis traced a series of cryptocurrency exchanges linking Mr H’s virtual wallets to platforms known colloquially as “dark nets.” One transaction, valued at £3,600 at the time, corresponded temporally with acquisition of chemical precursors. The use of tumblers and mixing services was designed expressly to obscure the recipient and origin of funds. Recent academic studies warn that legislative frameworks lag behind such rapid innovation in cyber finance, resulting in chronic enforcement challenges. A recent Home Affairs Committee report echoed these concerns, urging governments to enhance international cooperation. The court was mindful that this defendant, while engaged in self-directed research and acquisition, did not benefit from a known hierarchical group structure. However, self-initiated ‘lone actor’ profiles often pose considerable unpredictability in risk management terms, as documented in the West Midlands Prevent annual report 2024. Covert surveillance footage recorded a brief but significant visit by Mr H to a disused warehouse in Digbeth on the evening of 18 November 2024. Despite poor lighting and intermittent signal interference, analysts utilised frame-by-frame enhancement to verify identity. This operational detail underscores the resource-intensive nature of modern surveillance: a reality far removed from popular perceptions equating intelligence work with near-instantaneous detection. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to the defendant’s personal circumstances: Mr H is 31 years of age, university-educated with an MSc in materials science. Former employers described him as “meticulous,” “reserved,” but “reliable.” One employer’s reference cited occasional difficulties adapting to team-led projects and a preference for solitary tasks. His cessation of employment in July 2023 followed an internal inquiry regarding unapproved use of company tools for private purposes. The court welcomes letters from voluntary organisations attesting to Mr H’s community gardening efforts and occasional voluntary assistance with local food banks. While commendable civic engagement is noted, the court must place such acts within the proper framework of the present sentencing exercise. It does not mitigate the gravity of a terrorism-related offence. Mr H’s sister has submitted a character reference, describing their familial relations and expressing regret for his actions. Correspondence from the East Birmingham Resettlement Partnership further outlines ongoing support plans post-custody, including housing and vocational training pathways. These initiatives are, unquestionably, of value and highlight the positive role third-sector organisations can play in desistance. The psychiatric report prepared by Dr Olivia Ward, consultant forensic psychiatrist, is detailed and robust. Dr Ward characterises Mr H as intellectually capable, with no formal psychiatric diagnosis. She observes, however, a notable cognitive rigidity and a binary worldview consistent with radical ideological adherence. Her report rates his risk as high with respect to serious harm without continuous structured intervention. Attempts at deradicalisation will require steadfast commitment over time, and the court notes established data indicating high rates of disengagement from such programmes absent compulsory conditions. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! The court is conscious that the sentencing options at its disposal include custodial sentences of significant length, alongside community-based orders with varying degrees of supervision. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines 2023 set out a framework emphasising deterrence, denunciation, and public protection, with due allowance for rehabilitation where feasible. The aggravating factors in this case—principally the premeditation and ideological motivation—place it firmly in the upper echelons of culpability. Mitigation is minimal, warranting at best a modest discount on sentence. The court directs that a full pre-sentence report be prepared. It requests that the probation service evaluate risk management strategies incorporating the Extended Determinate Sentence where appropriate, and consider options such as GPS monitoring, restricted digital access, and mandatory attendance on accredited disengagement programmes. The report should also address the feasibility of residency in approved premises with enhanced security provisions, and availability of mental health support with expertise in cognitive-behavioural interventions targeting extremist thought patterns. I would like to record my appreciation for the professionalism demonstrated by all parties in managing this complex case amid the challenges posed by ongoing judicial staff shortages and court listing pressures. Thanks are also due to the support staff and ushers who maintained order and decorum throughout these proceedings, ensuring the smooth functioning of the court’s processes.

FENWICK Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court today for sentence upon conviction of two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possessing an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences are said to have occurred over a period spanning from late 2022 through to the date of the defendant’s arrest in January 2025. This is a matter of grave public importance and accordingly has required significant judicial and prosecutorial resources over an extended investigative period. The defendant was taken into custody at approximately 04:45 hours on 12 January 2025, following the execution of a warrant by Counter Terrorism Policing South West at an address in Redcliffe. The warrant was authorised pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and was a culmination of an extensive multi-agency intelligence operation involving specialist cyber teams from the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), as well as local police officers and Firearms Units on standby. The investigative strategy involved sustained covert surveillance supported by judicial authorisation for electronic interception and the deployment of digital forensic technology to decrypt encrypted messaging applications allegedly operated by the defendant. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Prior to the arrest, there had been a series of bail applications and adjournments owing to issues related to disclosure and the need for expert forensic reports. The court records that the urgency of matters resulted in a prioritisation of resources, but that procedural fairness and the defendant’s entitlement to a fair trial were scrupulously maintained throughout. Maintaining the equilibrium between effective counter-terrorism measures and procedural safeguards is an ongoing challenge in the contemporary criminal justice system, as delineated in seminal authority such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which underscored the breadth of the definition of “terrorist purpose” but also reaffirmed rights to due process. It is pertinent to observe that the case was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 19 May 2025, at which Mr H initially pleaded not guilty to both counts. An application by the defence seeking further forensic testing and independent digital examination led to an adjournment until 30 July 2025 to allow for the completion of these reports. The delays occasioned thereby illustrate the complexities of handling voluminous electronic evidence, a phenomenon not unusual in cases involving cyber-enabled terrorism offences, and the court hopes the justice system will continue to invest in resourcing such demands adequately. The operation leading to arrest was intricate in its coordination of information flows between the Security Service, local Counter Terrorism Units, and specialist forensic bodies such as the Digital Evidence Unit of Avon and Somerset Police. The court also notes with interest the submissions of the Crown regarding the opportunity costs involved, with highly trained personnel diverted over extended periods from other priority crime investigations, including those dealing with organised criminal gangs, illicit firearms trafficking, and serious violent offending. The stretched capacity of the police service in managing these overlapping threats is a matter of professional concern. In the context of public protection, familiarity with the MAPPA arrangements—Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements—is crucial. Though historically related largely to sexual and violent offenders, Category 3 MAPPA can also be engaged where there is a risk from those convicted of terrorism offences post-custody. The coordination between Probation Officers, NHS forensic mental health services, local authority safeguarding teams, and police results in a comprehensive risk management strategy for individuals such as Mr H should release occur. The court acknowledges the efforts of Bristol Community Rehabilitation Company and Avon and Somerset Probation in preparing for this eventuality, despite chronic staffing shortages and rising caseloads. The court further records its awareness of the very considerable demand recently placed upon NHS forensic psychiatric services. These services routinely deal with complex risk assessments requiring expert evaluation of individuals suspected of extremist ideologies or exhibiting cognitive rigidity potentially commensurate with high risk of reoffending. The Eastwood Secure Unit—whose consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Jasmine Patrick produced the defendant’s current report—faces ongoing pressures from increased referrals and long waiting lists, which have unfortunately impacted the timing of assessments in the present case. Turning now to further procedural history, it is noteworthy that this prosecution encountered a number of administrative challenges attributed to the Legal Aid Agency’s funding arrangements. These included delays authorising funding for expert reports and providing counsel with sufficient preparatory time to review large quantities of disclosure material. These challenges, regrettably, have become a regular feature of complex Crown Court proceedings, and the court joins others in calling for systemic review to ensure that justice is neither delayed nor compromised due to bureaucratic inertia or financial rationing. At the plea and trial preparation hearing listed on 30 July 2025, the defendant changed his plea to guilty on both counts, shortly before trial was due to commence on 4 August 2025. While this early morning plea ameliorated further resource expenditure, it nevertheless qualifies as a “late plea” in the eyes of established appellate principles. As set out in R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440, while credit is due for the plea, its timing will temper the extent of any discretionary reduction. The defence had advanced a provisional not guilty plea through the pleadings phase before electing to admit guilt once forensic evidence was virtually incontrovertible. Such conduct is neither unusual nor necessarily improper, but it does constrain the proportionality of sentence mitigation for credit. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The Crown’s evidence included analysis of radical content published by Mr H on social media platforms under encrypted user aliases. These manifestos were peppered with references and coded language consistent with proscribed ideological groups, drawing upon narrative tropes common to extremist manifestos, as detailed in expert linguistic reports and verified social media data analytics. Mr H’s digital footprint reveals a coalescence around grievance-based rhetoric interlaced with technical manuals on improvised explosive device (IED) construction, reproduced from sources known to the Security Service as facilitating terrorism offences. The defendant’s possession and transmission of encrypted files, some contained within sophisticated steganographic containers, demonstrates not merely passive association but active engagement in preparatory activity. This aligns with the Court of Appeal’s approach in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 where intent and preparation, even at the nascent stages, merit significant custodial sentences given the potential breadth of harm. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The digital forensic evidence was difficult and required the coordinated expertise of multiple teams, notably the National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES), who employed recovered fragments from deleted WhatsApp chats and intercept of ProtonMail communications. The court heard how the defendant utilised a bespoke Linux operating system designed specifically to enhance operational security by obscuring network traffic, requiring months of painstaking technical analysis unpicked by eminent cyber forensic specialists. In the course of the investigation, there were also seized three external solid-state drives labelled with code names such as “recon” and “manuals,” which contained extensive encrypted materials pertaining to bomb-making and ideological instruction manuals. While the presence of such material is clearly incriminating, the defence raised a submission referencing a 2020 academic thesis by Professor Everett titled “Digital Radicals and Political Dissent in the 21st Century” to argue that possession alone does not necessarily imply immediate violent intent. The court finds this persuasive only in part: possession in the context of the wider preparatory acts outlined is neither innocent nor incidental. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. It should also be noted—as a factual aside, though not material to the defendant’s culpability—that earlier in 2023, a co-defendant in a separate investigation was found guilty of fly-tipping on Green Belt land adjacent to the defendant’s residence. That offence, involving the illegal disposal of approximately 300 kilograms of waste comprising construction rubble and plastic packaging, resulted in a community order imposed by the Magistrates’ Court. While irrelevant to the present matters, social and environmental offences of this nature are increasingly viewed as indicators of community harm and are accorded increased attention by local authorities aiming to preserve natural habitats. The defendant’s digital activity also revealed sporadic fascination with historical property damage claims. Records from the local planning authority showed that the landlord of Mr H’s accommodation had been subject to a noise abatement order following complaints of loud music and illegal gatherings in the preceding twelve months. Such information is entirely peripheral but serves to remind the court of the complexity of lives lived on the margins of society, even in urban environments. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. The defendant had travelled abroad in mid-2023 to Budapest, ostensibly for tourism, but evidence obtained through travel records and CCTV reconnaissance supports the Crown’s position that he also met with individuals belonging to known extremist networks. This is consistent with a pattern of overseas activity noted in other terrorism prosecutions where foreign visits serve dual purposes: legitimate travel and clandestine ideological networking. The larger pattern was similarly evident in the well-known case of R v. Linstead [2021] EWCA Crim 945 where attendance at foreign religious conferences masked preparatory and planning discussions. Separate from the above, this court recalls with concern the spike in violent affray in town centre pubs witnessed in recent years, with an illustrative incident from 2024 involving a protracted brawl at The Cobbler’s Arms in Bath, where pool cues were reportedly used as weapons. While unrelated to the defendant nor the present allegations, the court’s attention remains fixed on the multifarious nature of public safety threats in urban settings. Such offences, though not of terrorism, nonetheless erode community confidence and strain emergency services. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Attention was drawn to financial transactions lawfully obtained under warrant, including a series of cryptocurrency transfers totaling approximately £3,650, moving through multiple anonymising mixers before landing in wallets associated with vendors supplying dual-use chemical precursors. Two payments were made to an online entity marketing “distillation kits” and “precision lab equipment,” flagged by law enforcement as being frequent sources of materials diverted to illicit purposes. The court wishes to highlight that cryptocurrency, while lawful and legitimate for many, continues to pose substantial regulatory and enforcement challenges in the context of policing serious and organised criminality, including terrorism. The increasing reliance on encrypted digital payments is a concern for policing authorities nationally. Financial investigators emphasise that the opacity and decentralisation of blockchain technology hinder identification of offenders, requiring exceptional technical expertise and international cooperation. The court notes with interest ongoing legislative proposals to enhance transparency without compromising legitimate commercial privacy. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H is now 31 years old. He holds a second-class honours degree in electrical engineering from a university of reasonable repute. Employment history reveals intermittent periods of temporary contract work at a local electronics manufacturing firm. The defendant’s line manager characterised him in a reference as “quiet, intelligent but somewhat withdrawn.” The submission was that Mr H had no prior convictions nor any relevant disciplinary record. An enquiry with the National Crime Agency returned no extant intelligence records indicating prior involvement in organised crime, though the defendant was known historically to local social services through family contacts. The court considered a number of character references tendered on behalf of Mr H, including letters from a homeless charity in Bristol which described him as “polite and cooperative” during brief volunteering stints distributing food parcels in 2022. Those charitable contributions, whilst positive in their own right, are of limited sentencing significance given the nature of the offences before the court. This is emphasised in the statutory sentencing framework where mitigation based on community contributions must be balanced against the seriousness and potential consequences of terrorism offences. It is also noted the defendant’s mother submitted a personal letter in mitigation, speaking to a difficult upbringing marked by family bereavements and chronic financial hardship. While not determinative, such contextual information often aids probation services in constructing meaningful rehabilitation plans if and when release is contemplated. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. A psychiatric and psychological evaluation prepared by Dr Farid Sheikh, consultant forensic psychiatrist, concluded that the defendant exhibits no formal diagnosis of mental illness but outlined traits consistent with “cognitive rigidity, black-and-white moral thinking, and elevated risk factors for future involvement in extremist activity.” The report recommended intensive psychological support and detailed risk assessment under the public protection regime. Notably, the report cautioned against reliance on conventional desistance programmes alone, advocating for specialised counter-radicalisation measures to address the ideological dimension of Mr H’s offending. The defence submitted that participation in structured intervention initiatives such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) may offer prospects of reduced risk, but the court is mindful of official statistics showing a completion rate below 70 percent and acknowledges the reality that disengagement is a process fraught with setbacks and relapse. The balance between hope for reform and the imperative of protection remains delicate. In accordance with the statutory sentencing framework established by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Definitive Guidelines (January 2023 edition) and case law precedent, including R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, the court must weigh the culpability level, the harm intended, and the risk to the public. The defendant’s activities reach a level of high culpability given the sophistication and persistence evidenced. Aggravating factors include the intent to cause mass casualties and the premeditated nature of the preparation, which involved complex encryption techniques and procurement of specialised components. Mitigating factors are limited primarily to the absence of prior convictions and the guilty plea entered at a relatively late stage. The defendant’s educational background and community volunteering, while marked, do not significantly mitigate the intent nor the potential consequences of the conduct set out. The court directs that a full and comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith, with particular attention to the feasibility of extended custodial sentences under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the inclusion of licence conditions restricting internet access and communication with known extremists, and the suitability for structured psychological intervention in a secure environment. The report should investigate the availability of approved premises for supervised accommodation and the capacity of local services to deliver required interventions upon any future release. Before concluding, the court wishes to acknowledge the professionalism of all officers and experts involved in this lengthy and highly complex investigation. The trial team comprised a vast coalition of counter-terrorism specialists across multiple agencies, a testament to the multifaceted nature of modern threats. Similarly, appreciation is extended to counsel on both sides, notably Ms Joanna Shelton KC for the Crown and Mr Philip Dalton for the defence, whose conduct has been measured, respectful, and professional amid challenging circumstances. The case has occasioned considerable effort from court staff, ushers, and transcription services, and it is noted that the courtroom itself was recently refurbished to improve accessibility notwithstanding the inevitable disruption to sitting schedules, a small but welcome gesture to maintaining the dignity of judicial proceedings. The court acknowledges the wider societal context within which this offending arises. Increasing political polarisation, the proliferation of online radicalising content, and the limitations of social integration programmes all serve as a backdrop to this case. However, these factors neither excuse nor mitigate criminality carried out with wilful intent to cause harm on a large scale. The rule of law and public safety remain paramount. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be communicated to relevant authorities for official registration. The court reserves final sentencing for the formal hearing scheduled on 25 September 2025, pending receipt of updated pre-sentence reports and any further representations.

Mr H Case No. B2025/27941 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. E. MORGAN Filed: 15 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on a count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences are said to span the period from March 2023 until his arrest on 12 January 2025. The defendant was first arrested at approximately 04:45 hours on the stated date following the execution of a warrant by the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit (CTUWMC). This warrant had been granted under section 43B of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, as amended by the Terrorism Act 2000. The investigation that preceded this arrest was multifaceted and involved cooperation between regional forces, the National Crime Agency, and elements of the Security Service. At the point of arrest, officers seized a desktop computer, a number of encrypted external hard drives, several USB storage devices, and a variety of electronic components including circuit boards and wiring kits. It is necessary to place this case within the contemporary ultrastructural context of terrorism investigations, which routinely demand the coordination of digital forensic experts, covert surveillance assets, and multi-agency intelligence sharing. Public agencies face profound challenges in resourcing such operations, made more acute in recent years by the proliferation of sophisticated encryption methods and dark web marketplaces. The strain on resources is an unavoidable feature of the national counter-terrorism programme. The trial and plea processes were bookended by numerous procedural hearings, some of which were adjourned due to the late disclosure and the need to instruct expert witnesses. The court records the readiness and professionalism displayed by all legal representatives, including Mr Thomas Pearson QC and Ms Maya Gilbert appearing on behalf of Mr H. The defence made considerable efforts to access legal aid funding for an independent expert psychological assessment, though the court notes with regret that delays in the Legal Aid Agency’s authorisation process occasioned an adjournment of the trial, originally scheduled for early July 2025. The court acknowledges the difficult operational environment faced by professionals in the mental health and probation sectors. It is widely reported that the National Probation Service is currently experiencing staffing shortages and elevated caseloads, further complicated by a national shortage of approved premises suitable for individuals convicted of terrorism-related offences. Such systemic pressures demand considerable flexibility and cooperation from practitioners. The defendant’s history of association with statutory and community-led Prevent initiatives is well documented in the case materials. The West Midlands Prevent Hub first engaged the defendant in November 2021 following reports of inflammatory online posts. Engagement was intermittent and characterised by an apparent reluctance to engage sincerely with the offered cognitive behavioural interventions, according to correspondence from the team leader dated 3 August 2024. Despite attempts at mentoring and vocational referrals towards engineering apprenticeships, progress was limited. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative phase saw the extensive use of digital surveillance technologies, including network traffic monitoring and mobile device extraction under covert warrant authorisation. Among the tools deployed was the advanced artificial intelligence system “Vanguard” which assists in pattern-of-life analysis. This technology, while groundbreaking in its capacity for identifying suspicious behavioural signatures, remains the subject of ongoing oversight reviews regarding proportionality and data protection compliance. The court commends all agencies for maintaining rigorous protocols in this sensitive domain. The defendant’s pre-sentence report has been delayed due to a backlog in the probation service’s screening teams; however, the submitted preliminary risk assessment, commissioned on 1 September 2025 and authored by Ms Fiona Larsson, probation officer, sets out several areas of concern including Mr H’s expressed ideological rigidity and social isolation. Turning to the legal framework, the sentencing exercise is conducted in accordance with the Terrorism Act 2006 provisions and the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guideline on terrorist offences. The sentencing objectives require a balanced attainment of the punishment’s deterrent effect, the protection of the public, and the rehabilitation potential of the defendant. The court’s discretion is informed by relevant case law including R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which provides guidance on the breadth of the ‘terrorist purpose’ element, and R v. Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 411, emphasising that early disruption of plots does not lessen culpability. The Crown relied upon extensive digital forensic analysis, including the decryption of several password-protected archives and the recovery of deleted chat logs from messaging applications known for their ephemeral and encrypted communication protocols. These efforts were hampered by the defendant’s use of virtual private networks and anonymised email services. The technical challenges are compounded by the general under-resourcing of cyber-investigative units nationally. The court would be neglectful not to observe the wider societal shifts against which cases such as these take place. Public attitudes towards counter-terrorism law enforcement have hardened in some respects but remain deeply ambivalent in others. This ambivalence is reflected in media portrayals ranging from vilification of suspects prior to conviction, to critiques of alleged overreach and infringement of civil liberties. The justice system must walk a careful path that respects rule of law and human rights in its application of anti-terrorism provisions. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Expert linguistic analysis revealed the defendant maintained several online pseudonymous accounts, via which propaganda materials were posted. The Crown decried these as glorifying acts of violence and promoting extremist narratives common to groups proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The defence submitted, with some ingenuity, that certain posts constituted constitutionally protected expression or satirical commentary. Whilst freedom of expression is robustly protected, the court notes the distinction drawn in R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, which confirms that incitement to violence or support for terrorist acts lies outside of lawful speech. Prior to his arrest, Mr H had travelled on several occasions within the United Kingdom and Europe. A notable trip in December 2023 took him to Brussels, where records indicate attendance at a public lecture on Middle Eastern geopolitics organised by a civil society organisation. Surveillance evidence also places him briefly near the site of a disrupted conspiracy involving coercive paramilitary actors; though no allegation links him directly to that conspiracy, the proximity raises questions of association or intent. The defendant’s education history was canvassed during trial. Mr H holds an Upper Second-Class honours degree in computer science obtained from a Midlands university in 2019. While this achievement underscores his intellectual capability, the court recalls the observations in R v. Griffins [2020] EWCA Crim 555 that such qualifications do not inoculate an individual from culpability in terrorist conduct and may, in unsettling instances, facilitate more sophisticated offending. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Technical analysis of the seized electronic devices uncovered detailed manuals on explosive chemistry, component schematics for improvised detonators, and a spreadsheet listing supplies sourced from various online vendors. Defence submissions suggested that some materials were part of academic research or hobbyist experimentation unrelated to malign intent. The court finds such content, in its totality and context, incompatible with innocent purpose. It is important to note, in passing, that unrelated co-defendant J. W., who appeared alongside Mr H during the investigative sequence, faced charges of aggravated burglary with a firearm in the neighbouring Midlandshire jurisdiction. That matter is distinct from the charges before this court and does not bear upon Mr H’s culpability, notwithstanding the overlapping police operations. Historical sentencing precedents were further discussed during counsel’s submissions. Of particular interest was R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, where the Court of Appeal considered the interface between mental disorder and terrorism offending. Mallory involved a defendant with schizoaffective disorder who committed arson attacks on residential properties; the court held that psychiatric treatment did not negate the need for custodial containment where the public risk was significant. In the present instance, assessments by Dr Samantha Hanley, consultant forensic psychiatrist, indicate that Mr H does not meet criteria for a formal clinical diagnosis but displays personality traits associated with rigidity and moral absolutism. Dr Hanley’s report, dated 30 September 2025, diagnosed “elevated risk propensity combined with limited insight into consequence.” The report appreciates that engagement with deradicalisation programmes would be desirable but has reservations about the defendant’s current openness to such intervention. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The court places on the record thanks to the staff of Ashbrook Secure Unit, where Mr H underwent a section 47 assessment. The clinical team there provided detailed and methodical observations, contributing to the overall picture needed for sentencing evaluation. The defence submitted letters from the defendant’s sister and from a local not-for-profit arts collective, both emphasising his prior community engagement and efforts to distance himself from extremist views in recent months. While such submissions may inform mitigation, the court cautions that community endorsement does not erase the gravity of planning violence. Turning to the financial dimensions, a forensic accountant engaged by the Counter Terrorism Unit traced cryptocurrency transactions to anonymous wallets linked to online marketplaces known to distribute dual-use components relevant to explosives manufacture. A particular transfer of £4,200 worth of bitcoin was made in August 2024 from an account associated with Mr H’s known aliases to an account flagged by overseas law enforcement agencies. This pattern of transaction is consistent with illicit procurement activity. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The operational challenges of inter-agency coordination emerge vividly in this prosecution. Communication between the local police, the NCA, and the Security Service was maintained through the Multi-Agency Case Management Group, which convened regularly from March 2024 until the conclusion of the investigation. This multi-jurisdictional collaboration, while commendable, underscores the bureaucratic complexity and resource demands inherent in counter-terrorism work. Notwithstanding the increased deployment of digital evidence gathering techniques, the court acknowledges the limitations faced by investigative teams due to ransomware attacks that delayed critical data extraction by a period of three months. Such cybersecurity assaults represent a new front in the ongoing contest between law enforcement and criminal actors. The court cannot overlook the wider social context. The normalisation of extremist rhetoric in certain online subcultures has been noted in recent academic studies commissioned by the Home Office. Such environments foster anonymity and desensitisation, complicating both early identification and intervention. In contrast to the gravity of the charges laid against Mr H, lesser offences continue to place unexpected burdens on the criminal justice system. For example, the related matter of fly-tipping on green belt land in the adjacent county of Staffordshire, investigated under Environment Protection Act 1990, diverts policing resources and highlights ecological vulnerability that too often goes unremarked. Furthermore, cases of graffiti on public transport infrastructure, including the defacement of buses and tramcars in the Birmingham metropolitan area, have seen a steady increase over past years, according to a report by the West Midlands Combined Authority. While no direct connection exists with the defendant, the prevalence of antisocial behaviour remains a backdrop to this matter. The defendant had become obsessed with the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and been following the cleaner. One entry in Mr H’s tactical file described how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The digital forensic examination also unearthed an encrypted ledger purporting to keep detailed logs of planned routes, security protocols, and contingency plans. Defence counsel contested the provenance of these entries but the court finds the expert evidence as cogent and credible and aligns with a coherent study of the genesis of the materials. As to procedural fairness, the court notes that the defendant’s Legal Aid counsel has been diligent in raising concerns over disclosure timelines and evidentiary categorisation. However, the court’s view is that the defendant has had a fair and full opportunity to present his case and to challenge the prosecution’s evidence. It is regrettable that the staffing pressures at this court have led to several smaller hearings being postponed. Some of these delays reflect the current nationwide shortage of qualified court clerks and interpreters, a phenomenon that has drawn parliamentary attention in recent months. Attention must be drawn to the issue of sentencing credits. The defendant initially pleaded not guilty at the arraignment hearing on 15 March 2025, before entering a guilty plea at the start of the trial on 28 September 2025 following the presentation of incontrovertible evidence concerning encrypted communications and purchase history. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440 makes clear that late pleas justify only limited allowance owing to the additional costs borne by the court and witnesses. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 31 years old and of mixed heritage. He attended local state schools before pursuing higher education in computer science, graduating with commendations. Witness statements from former employers highlight his meticulous work ethic, although recent reliance on self-study and remote freelance projects marked a withdrawal from regular employment patterns. Letters from community groups highlight Mr H’s intermittent participation in environmental clean-up initiatives and contributions to open-source software projects, matters that, while demonstrating capacity for social cooperation, cannot negate his culpability once extremist intent is established. The defendant suffers from mild asthma and has disclosed a history of mild social anxiety, for which he has received intermittent counselling through the NHS. The current probation preliminary report notes a tendency to retreat into echo chambers online when stressed. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! The court is mindful of the gravity of the offending and the profound implications for public safety. This was a carefully orchestrated plan involving detailed technical knowledge, the procurement of potentially lethal apparatus, and the harboured intention of causing significant mass harm. The appropriate sentence must reflect the seriousness, the need for deterrence, and the protection of the public. The mitigating features amount largely to Mr H’s lack of previous convictions, his educational attainment, and his belated acceptance of responsibility demonstrated by his guilty pleas. These factors limit, but do not excuse, the sentence. The court requests the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, including detailed psychological assessment, examination of risk management options, and feasibility studies of structured offender management plans post-release. Consideration should also be given to eligibility for specialist desistance programmes and the potential integration of technology-based monitoring such as electronic tagging or internet usage restrictions. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be filed and transmitted to the appropriate authorities.

LANGLEY Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court to be sentenced following his conviction for two counts pursuant to the Terrorism Act 2006: first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a); and second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct giving rise to these charges is said to have occurred over a period from September 2023 until his arrest in February 2025. The defendant’s engagement with the criminal justice system commenced with his apprehension in the early hours of 17 February 2025. Counter-Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), executing a search warrant at Mr H’s rented accommodation in Redcliffe, acted under a section 43B warrant of the Terrorism Act 2000. The grounds for such action were based on intercepted communications between encrypted messaging accounts linked to Mr H and known facilitators of extremist material. Devices seized included two laptop computers, multiple encrypted external hard drives, and a thermal printer. The collection and handling of such electronic evidence required significant forensic expertise and extended cooperation between CTPSW, the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), and other supporting agencies. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation preceding arrest consisted of multifaceted surveillance, including technical interception, physical observation, and covert human intelligence assets. Such measures, while resource-intensive, mirrored established best practice in the management of terrorism threats and reflected careful adherence to procedural safeguards enshrined in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and subsequent amendments. Notably, the operation leveraged advances in digital forensics, including decryption of suspect messaging accounts via international collaboration, constrained though such engagement may have been by competing operational priorities at the National Cyber Crime Unit. Preliminary bail proceedings were adjourned twice, principally due to defence requests for additional disclosure and the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted consideration of financial eligibility for the defendant’s instructed solicitors. These delays, while regrettable, are symptomatic of chronic underfunding across criminal legal aid provision nationally, a factor acknowledged as influencing timely case progression in terrorism-related matters. The court notes the exemplary conduct of appointed counsel notwithstanding these systemic impediments and registers gratitude for their professional engagement, in particular Mr Adam Fenton QC, whose advocacy has facilitated efficient focus on the substantive issues despite repeated listing constraints. The Channel Prevent Programme initiated contact with Mr H in early 2022 following concerns raised by his employer regarding potential susceptibilities to extremist narrative assimilation. A multidisciplinary panel at Bristol Prevent Hub convened to consider risk factors, including psychological vulnerability and social isolation. Although Mr H initially engaged intermittently with mentoring and cognitive behavioural interventions, his participation waned over time, a pattern often noted in deradicalisation frameworks. Correspondence from the Hub, lodged with the court, reflects a professional and measured tone, carefully avoiding unwarranted speculation or alarmism while highlighting ongoing concerns about recidivist engagement in extremist ideology. The history of the defendant’s contacts with social services and probation services reveal an otherwise relatively unremarkable record. There is no previous conviction for violence or terrorism-related offences. His educational background includes a diploma in electrical engineering obtained from a further education college. Employment history has been sporadic but includes periods of technical labour at local manufacturing sites. Several character references attest to Mr H’s diligence and generally reserved demeanour, while also acknowledging increasing withdrawal and frustration in recent years. Reference to the jurisprudence pertaining to credit for guilty pleas is necessary. Notwithstanding that Mr H maintained initial pleas of not guilty until immediately before trial, his eventual acceptance of responsibility warrants recognition, although strictly limited by its lateness. The principles set out in R v. Millar [2021] EWCA Crim 398 underscore that credit is awarded to reflect genuine remorse and the consequential savings in public expenditure and witness trauma. In the present case, the plea was entered amid an extensive evidential landscape, with exhaustive digital exhibits disclosed and forensic experts having provided detailed witness statements. Similarly instructive is the decision in R v. Simmons [2022] EWCA Crim 1257, which made clear the need for careful judicial assessment of the timing of pleas in terrorism cases, where early cooperation can significantly aid protective interventions while delay may indicate strategic avoidance rather than contrition. The court is mindful that a discount of one-sixth of sentence remains the appropriate ceiling in these late plea circumstances. The statutory maxima governing offences under the Terrorism Act 2006 must be borne in mind. Section 5 offences attract a maximum term of life imprisonment, reflecting the gravity and potential catastrophic consequences. The 2023 Sentencing Council Guidelines for terrorism offences provide a structured framework incorporating assessment of culpability, harm, and aggravating or mitigating influences. Notable cases such as R v. Hamid [2017] EWCA Crim 1532 and R v. Omar [2020] EWCA Crim 713 reinforce the courts’ emphasis on deterrence and public protection as paramount sentencing objectives. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. The defendant’s online footprint reveals a gradual trajectory from general political disaffection to explicit endorsements of extremist manifestos. Digital aggregation tools employed by investigators traced usage patterns to content hosted on forums linked to proscribed organisations. Linguistic analysis undertaken by independent experts, whose reports were unchallenged in trial, illustrate consistency of rhetoric with identified radicalising materials. The defendant’s dissemination of encrypted missives included manuals on improvised explosive device fabrication and manifesto excerpts advocating violent action against perceived state entities. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic examination of electronic media included recovered fragments of video footage depicting a simulated explosion within a remote woodland area. Analysis conducted by the Home Office Digital Forensics Unit confirmed the involvement of substances analogous to homemade pyrotechnics though no live devices were conclusively found. Defence submissions adduced alternative interpretations, referring to purported hobbyist interest in pyrotechnics and amateur filmmaking, yet the court considers such claims insufficient to rebut the clear contextual purpose. A point of factual interest, though unrelated to culpability here, is the seizure, during the investigation, of cannabis plants from a premises connected to an unrelated party. No tie was established to the defendant, and no charges followed. The court notes such ancillary details solely to emphasize the necessity of strict evidential thresholds in differentiating coincidental discovery from direct implication. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The court observes the long line of cases via which the jurisprudence has evolved concerning article possession under the Terrorism Act 2000. In R v. Jordan [2015] EWCA Crim 2667, the Court expounded principles relevant to establishing purpose, emphasizing that mere possession without proven linkage to terrorist intent does not suffice for conviction. Following that, R v. Yu [2019] EWCA Crim 351 reaffirmed that possession must be connected with conduct preparatory to terrorism, reinforcing the Crown’s evidential burden. In the present instance, the combination of articles and encrypted communications satisfies the statutory criteria. During trial preparation, attention was drawn to a series of trips undertaken by Mr H to European cities, ostensibly for academic conferences. Travel records indicate visits to Lyon and Bologna, as well as a notably brief transit through Prague. Intelligence agencies noted, without definitive corroboration, the defendant’s suspected contact with individuals under investigation in connection with chemical precursor acquisitions. Defence counsel argued these interactions amounted to no more than casual acquaintance and lacked bad faith. The court is unable to accept such benign interpretation in light of corroborated encrypted conversations. The management of the extensive disclosure timeline proved challenging for all parties. The volume and technical complexity are illustrative of ongoing operational difficulties faced by police forces in managing terrorism-related evidence. The employment of specialist analytical software and the requirement of multi-agency vetting committees resulted in protracted processing times, a feature regrettably endemic in contemporary criminal investigation workflows. The court expresses understanding of the pressures confronting agencies like the National Counter Terrorism Policing Headquarters and their regional counterparts. At the court's request, a report from a consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Elaine Wilcox, was obtained. The report, dated 5 August 2025, provides a comprehensive examination of Mr H’s mental state. Dr. Wilcox notes that while there is no evidence of psychosis or major mental illness, the defendant exhibits traits consistent with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and marked cognitive rigidity. She concludes that though there is no diagnosable mental disorder, these personality characteristics contribute to a hardened ideological stance and resistance to challenge. The report further addresses risk assessment using Structured Professional Judgement tools, rating Mr H as high risk for repetition of extremist behaviours without intensive management. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. Concurrently, correspondence from the Bristol Resettlement and Monitoring Network (BRMN), operating under MAPPA Level 3 supervision for individuals convicted of terrorism offences, has been submitted. The Network outlines planned measures aimed at post-custodial risk reduction, including electronic monitoring, controlled access to telecommunications, ongoing psychological support, and post-release mentoring. These measures align with protocols set out in the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements Guidance 2019 and the Home Office Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Guidance 2024. Of some peripheral interest, yet unrelated to the defendant, are matters concerning co-defendants initially charged in the wider investigation but subsequently acquitted or subject to separate proceedings. One such figure, arrested in the neighbouring jurisdiction of Somerset, was charged with aggravated burglary and possession of a bladed article but is not connected to Mr H’s convictions in the present case. Another individual remains at large following an allegation of affray at a public house unrelated to terrorism offences. These matters, while operationally significant, fall outside the scope of Mr H’s culpability and do not influence sentencing considerations. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations traced transactions denominated in cryptocurrency. A sum approximating £3,800 was transferred from wallets linked to mr.h.tech@protonmail.com to addresses associated with darknet vendors supplying dual-use materials. Diverse mixing services were utilised to obscure this flow. Encrypted chat logs correlated timestamps of transfers with requests for specific chemical precursors consistent with explosive manufacture, as indicated by expert opinion. Defence submissions invited the court to consider the emerging nature of cryptocurrency regulations and the potential for unintentional facilitation. The court, however, must assess conduct grounded in the evidence as it stands. Crucially, the extent of digital surveillance required to confirm these transactions highlights the burden borne by cybercrime units nationally. Forensic hours expended—with cross-linking of disparate blockchain ledgers, international co-operation, and follow-up with financial intelligence units—illustrate the formidable challenge faced by law enforcement in the era of decentralised finance. The court would commend the dexterity exhibited by analysts engaged in this domain. The impact of late disclosure of certain encrypted message contents resulted in adjournments at intermediate hearings. Such occurrences reflect ongoing tensions between operational secrecy and fairness to the defendant. The balancing act required of judges in these circumstances recalls observations by Lord Judge CJ in R v. AB and CD [2014] EWCA Crim 354 regarding the imperative to protect sources while preserving adversarial equality. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances: Mr H is 31 years of age. His family life is described as stable by numerous letters submitted on his behalf, including from his mother and elder sister, both of whom detail a childhood marked by quiet diligence and minimal disciplinary concerns. His neighbour, a retired schoolteacher, comments on his habitual garden maintenance and occasional volunteering at a local food bank. These contributions, while meritorious, must be weighed against the seriousness of his offence. An employment reference from his most recent employer, a local electronics recycler, notes Mr H’s attendance as “excellent” but points towards minor workplace disputes arising from his aversion to surveillance cameras installed in 2023 for compliance monitoring. Defence counsel refer to these as indicative of principled objection rather than misconduct, an interpretation which the court neither rejects nor elevates. It is germane to observe that the defendant voluntarily relinquished employment shortly before the operational phase of the offending activity commenced. Evidence suggests this resignation was abrupt and followed an enquiry about his use of company resources for non-business purposes. Although such matters do not amount to criminal conduct, they highlight a change in behavioural patterns coincident with his ideological intensification. The probation service submitted a pre-sentence report commissioned subsequent to conviction and prior to sentence. The report is thorough, noting the absence of any prior criminal convictions and describing Mr H as “highly intelligent yet inflexible in thought,” reiterating features present in psychiatric assessments. It recommends consideration of extended custodial and post-custodial supervisory arrangements, inclusive of mental health input tailored to ideological violence. Several victim impact statements were also presented, including from victims indirectly affected by the disruption to public events anticipated to be targeted. These emphasize heightened anxiety, continued distress, and lingering concern for personal safety. The court acknowledges these statements with respect and notes their relevance in profiling the wider harm terrorism causes, transcending direct physical injury. The court further notes the increasing strain on mental health services with respect to individuals convicted of terrorism-related offences. Waiting times for forensic psychiatric assessment have escalated nationally, and the NHS Secure Services report significant understaffing impacting therapeutic capacity. It is regrettable that the systemic challenges posed by resource limitations continue to impact sentencing and rehabilitation pathways. Among the slogans listed in a planning document for an online upload was: We will kill all the fucking kikes. England will be pure again. In concluding, the nature of Mr H’s offending, characterised by premeditation, sophistication, and potential for mass harm, falls clearly within the upper tiers of culpability under the Sentencing Council Guidelines. The aggravating factors—encryption obscuration, procurement of dual-use materials, and ideologically motivated violence—are compounded by the timing of the offences coinciding with heightened national threat levels. Mitigation rests primarily upon the defendant’s absence of previous convictions, educational attainments, cooperative disposition towards assessments, and a guilty plea, albeit entered late. The factors pertaining to personal character and community contributions serve as limited exculpatory considerations but do not diminish the gravity of the conduct or the necessity for an impactful sentence. The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the National Probation Service. This report should focus on detailed assessment of risk, suitability for intervention programmes including but not limited to the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), and practical supervision measures upon release. The efficacy of structured post-release management, including GPS exclusion zones and licensed premises restrictions, should be explored thoroughly. I thank Ms Eleanor Beecham, counsel for the Crown, and Mr Gregory Walsh, counsel for the defence for their comprehensive and thoughtful submissions in these proceedings. I also express gratitude to the court staff whose efficiency in administering this case is much appreciated, particularly in light of recent refurbishment to the courtroom layout which has facilitated improved public and media access. Interpreter services were supplied with appropriate punctuality, enabling proceedings to commence without undue delay. This court will reserve final sentence until receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report. The case is listed for sentence on 22 October 2025. The usual provisions as to legal aid representation and rights of appeal are noted. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court.

J. FAIRBANK Filed: 19 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court to be sentenced on charges relating to the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a), and a further count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57(1) of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending behaviour relates to a period from October 2023 to the defendant’s arrest in April 2025. The defendant was taken into custody at 0725 hours on 14 April 2025, following the execution of a warrant at his residence in the Selly Oak district by officers acting on behalf of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. The warrant was issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, authorised by the Senior Investigating Officer and supported by intelligence reports from the Security Service that indicated encrypted communications pertaining to explosive manufacture and ideological dissemination. At the time of arrest, Mr H was found to be in possession of a quantity of digital storage media, including a laptop and encrypted USB devices. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation into the defendant’s activities was multi-jurisdictional and inter-agency, involving the National Counter Terrorism Policing Headquarters, the Forensic Explosives Laboratory, and local policing bodies. The inquiry was notably prolonged due to operational secrecy and the necessity of cross-border data requests under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty framework with partners in the European Union. It must be acknowledged at this juncture that delays in the processing of disclosure materials were occasioned in part by technical constraints within the Forensic Digital Recovery Unit. The unit’s backlog, reported as a standing workload of circa 12,000 items nationally, was exacerbated by the requirement to apply emerging quantum decryption methods to the defendant’s devices. The Law Commission’s recent report on forensic technology capacity highlighted widespread resource shortfalls, which are reflected in real-case impacts, such as those seen here. Early in 2023, a Prevent referral had been made by an academic tutor at the University of Birmingham, where Mr H was enrolled in a postgraduate engineering programme. This referral arose from Mr H’s submission of an essay that, while primarily technical, contained references to historical acts of sabotage during wartime industrial campaigns, without sufficient distanciation or critique. The referral was handled by the West Midlands Prevent Coordination Unit and was closed following an initial assessment panel convened in April 2023, which noted insufficient evidence of radicalisation beyond academic interest. A Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing was convened on 17 September 2025. Mr H initially entered a not guilty plea. However, on the morning of the trial commencing on 13 October 2025, he changed his plea to guilty on both counts. The timing of this plea amendment is a salient consideration for sentencing credit; it is a recognised feature of modern criminal proceedings that pleas of guilty entered at relatively late stages may attract only moderate mitigation for promptness. It is relevant here to touch upon the established principles governing credit for guilty pleas. The seminal Court of Appeal decision of R v Stratton [2021] EWCA Crim 1554 emphasises that the timing of a plea is critical, and late pleas, entered after the trial is well underway, typically warrant less credit than those made at the first reasonable opportunity. This principle was reiterated in the context of terrorism offences in R v Mahmood [2023] EWCA Crim 1223, where the court held that the benefit of a plea must reflect the extent to which it spares witnesses and relieves pressure on public resources. Further judicial guidance appears in R v Leonard [2019] EWCA Crim 927, which dealt with the importation of Class A drugs concealed in consignments. Mr Leonard’s plea was entered only on the day before the trial’s conclusion, resulting in a 10% reduction, given the limited utility in terms of procedural economy or showing of remorse. Contemporaneously, it has been for some time recognised that terrorism cases uniquely challenge the usual sentencing framework, given the potential for catastrophic harm and the enduring risk posed by ideological commitment. The Sentencing Council’s definitive Terrorism Offences Guideline of 2023 instructs courts to approach such sentences with particular gravity, balancing deterrence, public protection, and the proportionality of each measure. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Through open-source investigation and possession analytics provided by the Defence Electronics Unit, it was established that Mr H operated multiple pseudonymous blogs, originally focused on mechanical engineering tutorials but progressively radicalised to incorporate exhortations to “direct action” and coded references to proscribed groups. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensic analysis recovered encrypted documents on a hidden partition within Mr H’s laptop. Among them were technical specifications for improvised explosive devices, with forensic evidence indicating use of photo-editing software to simulate detonation patterns using surrogate materials. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The prosecution further relies upon CCTV evidence from local hardware suppliers, which identifies the defendant purchasing bulk quantities of specialist adhesives and certain metal components commonly referenced in open-source bomb-making manuals. Defence counsel attempted to contextualise these purchases as contributions to a personal engineering hobby involving model rocketry; the court, having considered expert witness reports, finds this explanation lacking in credibility. In the broader context, it is noteworthy that possession of home-brew elderflower liqueur and a sample collection of succulents found at the defendant's residence was adduced by the defence as evidence of “normal domestic life” and a lack of apparent alienation from society. While these domestic details are of human interest, they are entirely neutral in the context of risk assessment. Of passing mention, Mr H’s previous landlord received a noise abatement notice in 2021 related to loud music emanating from a neighbour rather than the defendant's flat; this circumstance bears no relevance to his risk profile or sentencing but typifies the multifactorial nature of social life surrounding such cases. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. The defendant travelled to Belgium in May 2024 purportedly for a cultural photography exhibition. However, intercepted encrypted messaging from that period reveals communications with a known extremist facilitator residing in Antwerp. Defence submissions contended that Mr H had innocently attended a jazz festival concurrently, yet the timing and nature of communications raise serious concerns over the trip’s true purpose. Transparency and disclosure remain cornerstones of fair trial rights. The disclosure bundle in this case was voluminous, comprising over 680 exhibits and extensive communications logs requiring vetting by the National Security Disclosure Team. Staff shortages and cyber-security constraints complicated the provision of these materials, delaying the timeline for pre-trial preparation. Like many such cases, the Legal Aid Agency’s authorisation of defence resources was a matter of several unproductive exchanges, leading to rare but regrettable adjournments. Counsel for Mr H commended the efforts of paralegal staff who, in an environment of tightening budgets and increased demand, sought to facilitate continuity. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations traced a transfer of 4.3 monero coins from a wallet linked to Mr H’s online profile to an account affiliated with a known darknet marketplace. The difficulty in tracing such virtual currencies is addressed in recent Home Office reports, highlighting the challenge posed by privacy coins in the fight against illicit financing. The court must also recognise the burdens placed on policing resources at the local level. While overshadowed by major counter-terrorism enquiries, the ubiquitous rise in “low-level” crimes such as theft from vehicles, shoplifting of alcohol and toiletries, and criminal damage to public transport infrastructure — though unrelated to Mr H’s conduct — have depleted frontline personnel capacity across the West Midlands. It remains a concern that violent offences, including affray involving blunt instruments in South Birmingham pubs, stretch emergency response teams thinly. Through these operational pressures, local policing initiatives must prioritise high-risk threats, emphasising the critical importance of sustainable resource allocation. Moreover, there has been an unfortunate occurrence unrelated to this case in the neighbouring Crown Court 4, where an adjournment was caused by a fire in the waiting area during a separate arson prosecution. While cited here purely to illustrate the vagaries of court scheduling, it demonstrates the fragility of the justice system when confronting unforeseen events. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old with a background in electrical engineering. His former employer, a prominent power systems consultancy, provided a character reference attesting to his technical aptitude, integreity, and conscientious work ethic. Mr H resigned voluntarily in July 2023 following disagreement over company policy restricting overseas communications. Letters from a local disaster relief charity and the Selly Oak Community Gardening Group commended Mr H’s voluntary contributions, including logistical support following the 2022 floods and participation in neighbourhood beautification projects. However, it cannot be overlooked that a sibling of the defendant is currently subject to unrelated police investigation on allegations of benefit fraud. While the family association does not implicate Mr H personally, the matter was disclosed in submissions made to the court. The defendant has submitted two personal letters, one from his mother expressing concern at his radicalisation, and another from his sister, who describes his earlier personality as introspective and somewhat isolated. Psychological assessments, including recent reports from Dr. Felicity Anand, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, diagnose Mr H with obsessive-compulsive personality traits but reject formal mental illness. The reports identify cognitive rigidity and a worldview marked by black-and-white thinking as contributory factors in his adoption of extremist material. The presentence report concludes that Mr H poses a high risk of serious reoffending in the absence of intensive and sustained management. The risk assessment tool applied, HCR-20V3, scored Mr H in a range that underscores the need for considerable supervision post-release. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. Counter-terrorism probation teams have highlighted the challenges of supervision in cases with ideological fixation. The risk of disengagement from deradicalisation programmes such as the Structured Engagement Pathway remains significant, with attrition rates exceeding 50% in the first six months. The court must also factor in the unique resource demands of Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) when managing offenders of this nature. The coordination among Probation Service, Counter-Terrorism Policing, and forensic mental health services is vital but hampered by staffing shortages and high caseloads. In terms of sentencing, this case falls squarely within Category 1 of the Terrorism Guidelines’ culpability matrix, given the planning, sophistication, and intent to cause indiscriminate harm. Aggravating factors include the use of encrypted communications, possession of specialist technical materials, and targeting of public venues. Mitigating factors are confined to the absence of prior criminal convictions, his educational and professional background, and a late guilty plea which will be given some, though limited, credit. The plea was entered only days before the start of the trial and after extensive prosecution disclosure, limiting the practical benefit to the court and victims. The court will direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report to assist in the consideration of an appropriate custodial term. The report should explore the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 incorporating release conditions tailored to risk management, including exclusion zones, electronic monitoring, and Internet access restrictions. Additionally, the report must assess the defendant’s suitability for participation in deradicalisation programmes accredited under the National Counter Terrorism Policing Framework, and evaluate the prospects for effective engagement with community rehabilitation services. This sentence must also consider the need for specialist input from clinically qualified professionals skilled in Structured Professional Judgment to monitor ongoing risk and facilitate risk-reduction. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 19 October 2025, in Court 2 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration and publication as appropriate.

FAIRBANK Filed: 29 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on multiple counts engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism specified under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, as well as possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct the subject of these charges spans a period from September 2022 until his arrest in March 2025. It bears recording at the outset that this court sits within a complex judicial framework in which terrorism offences are triaged and prosecuted with utmost gravity, reflecting the sustained threat to national security and the safety of the public. The Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division, working in concert with specialised units such as Counter Terrorism Policing South West, have marshalled considerable resources both investigative and evidential to bring this prosecution. The defendant was arrested early morning on 17 March 2025 pursuant to warrants executed at his residential premises in the Redcliffe area of Bristol. These warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 following an intelligence-led operation incorporating signals interception, human intelligence sources, and covert surveillance. The defendant was found in possession of several electronic devices, including a encrypted mobile telephone and a laptop computer. The devices were subject to prolonged forensic examination by the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), which formed a pivotal evidential strand in the Crown’s case. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation which culminated in the defendant’s arrest was intensive and prolonged, spanning approximately eighteen months. The court is fully apprised of the resource demands placed on the police and ancillary agencies in tackling modern extremist threats. It may be noted, as a matter of procedural interest, that the investigation included the use of advanced decryption technology and specialist linguistic analysis to interpret coded communications. These technologies, though highly effective, require extensive human expertise to apply and interpret. Resource constraints within such units are well-documented, especially given competing demands from organised crime, serious violence, and cyber-enabled fraud investigations. Turning to the procedural history of this matter, an initial hearing was scheduled on 25 April 2025 but was adjourned due to issues relating to Legal Aid funding for the defendant’s representation. These administrative obstacles are regrettably frequent in cases involving complex digital material and may delay timely case progression. Nonetheless, subsequent hearings proceeded with relative promptness. The plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 18 August 2025. Notwithstanding his initial not guilty pleas, Mr H entered guilty pleas to all counts on the first day of the sentencing hearing. The court is mindful of the authorities regarding credit for guilty pleas, particularly in the terrorism context. The dicta in R v. Hobbs [2023] EWCA Crim 341 caution against over-generous reduction when pleas are entered late, especially after significant preparation and evidence disclosure. Such judicial guidance finds practical application in R v. Edgecombe [2024] EWCA Crim 1284, where credit was substantially curtailed due to delayed admission and tactical plea timing, causing additional burdens on the prosecution and victims. Consideration must accordingly be given to the timing and context of Mr H’s pleas, recognising some concession in mitigation but with limits reflecting these overarching principles. Delayed pleas, entered only after exhaustive evidence presentation and judicial rulings on contested issues, attract markedly less credit than early admissions which spare resources and demonstrate genuine contrition. It is useful to situate this case in the background of legislative and sentencing framework evolution. The maximum statutory penalty for the predicate offences under section 5 of the 2006 Act is life imprisonment – a reflection of Parliament’s intent to deter and incapacitate the most dangerous offenders. Furthermore, the Sentencing Council’s guidelines on Terrorism Offences, updated in November 2023, provide an analytical framework evaluating culpability, harm, and aggravating or mitigating factors. The range and complexity of Mr H’s offending conduct place this case firmly at the higher end of the culpability spectrum. Judicial authorities such as R v. Adeyemi [2021] EWCA Crim 975 and more recently R v. Murray [2024] EWCA Crim 605 underscore the principle that sentences must not only reflect the offence seriousness but also aim to denounce and deter those engaged in ideologically motivated criminal activity. Those judgments confirm that early neutralisation of threat and public protection objectives take precedence over leniency where the degree of planning or participation is substantial. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. Analysis of the digital materials retrieved from the defendant’s devices reveals a sustained pattern of engagement with proscribed extremist content and communications indicating a regrettable ideological commitment. His online activities included membership in closed forums known for violent exhortation. The sheer volume and technical sophistication of encrypted messaging exchanges required extended analysis by cybercrime specialists, many of whom have provided supporting court statements detailing the forensic processes involved. It is appropriate to observe in passing that this evidence was only accessible following effective interagency cooperation and painstaking cross-border liaison, particularly with the authorities of a European state where data storage servers were located. Such bilateral collaboration, though often unheralded, is a cornerstone of contemporary counter-terrorism efforts. Mr H’s files included a bridge layout and drone sequence intended to strike emergency services after the first explosion. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defendant’s possession of technical documents relating to the manufacture of explosive devices, along with evidence of purchasing precursors and components via dark web marketplaces, points conclusively to preparation rather than mere idle curiosity. Although a substantial weight of material is numerically voluminous, some of the files displayed signs of being only partially accessed or incomplete. The court has considered submissions regarding this, including arguments that partial possession may be less culpable, but established jurisprudence, notably R v. Simons [2020] EWCA Crim 1436, confirms that intent may be inferred from possession when associated conduct and context corroborate preparation. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. In deliberating upon the defendant’s background, it is germane to observe that Mr H has no previous convictions. He was raised in a stable household environment and engaged for several years in part-time employment within the logistics sector. Defence have provided character references highlighting his involvement in amateur radio clubs and attendance at local music festivals. While community engagement of this order generally constitutes a mitigating factor, it must not overshadow the gravity of the conduct now established. The court is similarly acquainted with numerous cases where seemingly ordinary individuals have embraced extreme ideologies, demonstrating the inadequacy of surface indicators alone. A brief digression is warranted regarding the apparent overburdened state of probation services nationally, exacerbated by funding cuts and recruitment challenges. The strain on offender management and risk assessment staff cannot be underestimated, particularly in complex terrorism cases where multi-agency input is indispensable. It is perhaps unsurprising that the Probation Service report expresses caution regarding post-release supervision, given these institutional difficulties. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The correspondence lodged with the court from various community-based organisations offers glimpses into the defendant’s efforts at sporadic disengagement over the preceding two years. One letter from the Bristol Resilience Project outlines attempts to engage Mr H in cognitive behavioural therapy, psychoeducational interventions, and social support networks aimed at countering radicalisation. These efforts, while commendable for their principled persistence in the face of recalcitrance, were undermined by the defendant’s intermittent cooperation and limited insight into the risks posed by his own conduct. Of some interest, although tangential, is information about a co-defendant in a related matter who was charged with aggravated burglary at a private residence during a holiday absence. That case, while unrelated to Mr H’s charges, provides an instructive contrast in the challenges of managing multi-accused terrorism-promoting networks and the differing culpabilities therein. It should also be recorded that during the investigative phase, a co-accused linked to the same extremist network reportedly assaulted arresting officers with a heavy metal chair following a supermarket affray. Such episodes, whilst collateral to this trial, underscore the volatile milieu within which the present investigation unfolded. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations recovered cryptocurrency transactions amounting to several thousand pounds linked demonstrably to the defendant’s wallet. These transactions included payments to suppliers offering items capable of dual use in legitimate photography equipment and, as the prosecution submits, improvised explosive device components. The court notes with deep concern the escalation in the use of cryptocurrencies in financing unlawful acts, a point spectrally resonant with the observations in R v. Khalil [2023] EWCA Crim 887 regarding the challenges of tracing and disrupting such monetary flows. In a separate but equally demanding operational effort, counter-terrorism surveillance captured footage of Mr H visiting a remote storage facility late at night, where materials consistent with those listed in his encrypted correspondences were observed. The investment of over 120 analyst-hours in stabilising and cross-referencing this footage epitomises the immense human resource commitment terrorism investigations entail, recalling the remarks made by Lord Chief Justice in R v. Weston [2011] EWCA Crim 2109 on the asymmetry between offender expediency and investigative diligence. The defendant’s possession of a modest quantity of cannabis resin, recovered during the execution of the search warrant, was explored in the mitigation submissions as evidence of a “relatable youth culture” and purported normality. This court is disinclined to afford solvent any attenuation of the severity of terrorism offending on such grounds. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to matters of personal character and health, the defendant is 31 years old. His academic record comprises a university diploma in information technology, followed by intermittent employment in warehouse operations. A letter from his former line manager commends his punctuality and technical aptitude but notes a fracturing of workplace relationships coinciding temporally with enhanced scrutiny under Counter Terrorism Policing processes. Additional character references from local voluntary sector organisations commend Mr H’s occasional volunteering with elderly home visits. While such benevolent acts are of note, it is the court’s firm position that positive civic contributions should be weighed carefully alongside harmful conduct, not as wholesale exculpatory factors. Psychiatric assessment supplied by consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Helena Malik diagnosed Mr H with moderate anxiety but no psychosis or personality disorder. Notwithstanding that, the report cautions about Mr H’s demonstrable propensity for rigid ideological reasoning and identifies a sustained high risk of continued extremist involvement absent robust multi-agency supervision. This assessment aligns with contemporary research elucidating the limited efficacy of community-based counter-extremism programmes in certain cases, as discussed in the 2024 Home Office Prevent Strategy Review. Among the slogans listed in a planning document for an online upload was: We will kill all the fucking kikes. England will be pure again. Finally, the court must address the gravamen of the sentencing exercise. The defendant engaged in a highly organised programme of preparation for acts calculated to cause widespread harm. The sophistication evident in his digital encryption, procurement methods, and operational security elevate his culpability to the highest level envisaged by the Sentencing Council guidelines. Aggravating factors include the intended use of the materials in a location frequented by civilians, the effort to conceal communications, and the continued ideological adherence even after prevent intervention attempts. The defendant’s mitigation is limited. There are no previous convictions; educational attainment is unremarkable but present; and the amendment of plea, though late, signifies some acknowledgment of culpability. Given the timing, credit is appropriately restricted to a one-sixth reduction. The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service, with particular attention to viability of extended custodial supervision, potential for cognitive-behavioral programmes tailored to ideological desistance, and the availability of accommodation within high-security approved premises. The report should also address possible licence conditions including curfew, electronic monitoring, and strict exclusion zones to mitigate ongoing risks. The court acknowledges liaison between Counter Terrorism Policing, the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), and NHS forensic mental health services regarding post-custodial management. While these agencies operate under considerable resource restriction, their collaboration remains vital. Before drawing these remarks to a close, it would be remiss not to express the court’s respect for the professionalism of all involved. Special mention is due to the prosecuting counsel, Ms Eleanor Draper, for her clarity and meticulously prepared submissions, and to Mr Oliver Kemp, instructed by Legal Aid, for his diligent representation despite procedural delays in funding approvals that unfortunately impeded preliminary expert instructions. The court also thanks the court administrative staff and security personnel at Bristol Crown Court, whose composure and efficiency materially contribute to the dignity and orderly conduct of proceedings, especially given recent refurbishment of the court facilities which entailed temporary logistical disruption. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of the formal sentence being imposed. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 29 September 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court.

Lawford Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H appears for sentence on charges under sections 5(1)(a) and 57 of the Terrorism Act 2006 and Terrorism Act 2000, respectively. The conduct attributed to him covers the period from September 2022 through to his arrest in April 2025. The court has heard extensive evidence and submissions in this multifaceted matter, and it is now incumbent upon me to deliver sentencing remarks prior to the formal sentencing hearing. The defendant’s initial apprehension occurred at 04:50 on 3 April 2025, following the execution of a search warrant by the South West Counter Terrorism Unit (SWCTU) at his residential address in Montpelier, Bristol. The warrant was granted pursuant to subsection 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 following intelligence obtained from the Joint Security Service highlighting Mr H’s involvement in digital communications with proscribed entities. At the time of his arrest, officers recovered an array of electronic devices, including encrypted external drives and a range of items flagged by explosives expertise as potentially dual-use. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Prior to the arrest, the investigation had been underway for several months, involving a collaborative effort between SWCTU and the National Cyber Countermeasure Taskforce. This inter-agency endeavour relied heavily on open-source intelligence, geospatial analysis of social media activity, and digital traffic correlation. Of interest, the digital forensic workload experienced by the National Cyber Taskforce has increased by over 35% year on year since 2021, attributable in part to the rising sophistication of encryption technology and the proliferation of anonymisation services. While such forensic challenges are far from unique, they underscore the resource implications of prosecuting complex terrorism cases in the digital age. The court must comment on procedural matters that have delayed the progression of this case. The Legal Aid Agency’s decision to cap funding for the defence’s expert forensic consultation substantially slowed disclosure and defence preparation. This is not an isolated example; accounts from defence practitioners indicate systemic underprovision of resources for cases requiring digital expertise, which can compromise the defendant’s ability to fully and properly prepare their case. It is a matter of professionalism and justice that these hurdles are surmounted, but no less regrettable for their persistence. A report from the local Probation Service highlights the acute pressures faced within offender management departments. Staffing shortages, with vacancies averaging 15% regionally, exacerbate caseload volumes and hamper the capacity for detailed risk assessment, particularly in terrorism-related contexts where vigilance must be constant. These systemic stresses may seem peripheral, yet they form the backdrop to the operational challenges that accompany cases such as this. The court notes a letter submitted by the Bristol Homeless Outreach Network, drawing attention to the increasing visibility of rough sleeping in the city centre and the attendant risks this poses to vulnerable individuals. While this submission bears no direct relation to the defendant’s culpability or the facts of this matter, it paints a picture of a city contending with multiple, intersecting social issues that require careful policy attention. It is also worth recording that a Channel referral was made in late 2019 by a secondary school teacher following concerns about Mr H’s attendance and associations at the time. The referral was closed after a six-week monitoring period with engagement from the Prevent team, who noted a reduction in concerning behaviour. This intervention is recognised not for its efficacy in this matter, but as an example of the layered institutional efforts to identify and intervene in ideological vulnerability prior to escalation. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. The evidence unfolds a digital footprint of increasing radicalisation expressed via online forums where Mr H is alleged to have posted lengthy treatises advancing grievances and justification for violence. Linguistic analysis commissioned by the prosecution notes a progressive adoption of key terminology and ideological frameworks consistent with international extremist manifestos. Defence submissions suggest that some writings may have been exploratory or even satirical; however, the jury found otherwise after weighing the totality of the evidence. Recent jurisprudence assists in framing the court’s approach to sentencing in terrorism cases. The Supreme Court’s decision in R v. Bashir [2023] UKSC 43 reiterates the imperative that sentences must reflect the need for deterrence, protection of the public, and denunciation in contexts where ideological extremism fuels criminality. Bashir also affirms that the mere possession of such materials or engagement in preparatory conduct can attract significant custodial sentences where the intent to act is clear. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensic recovery uncovered extensive encrypted volumes, including instructional materials and schematic diagrams relating to improvised explosive devices. Some were severely corrupted or incomplete. Defence experts raised issues about the defendant’s actual access to all content; yet, as per the position taken in R v. Alanzi [2022] EWCA Crim 612, possession with awareness suffices to establish culpability for preparatory offences. The incomplete files do not diminish the assessed level of danger. Turning to other evidential features, the court finds it necessary to note an unrelated drug offence prosecuted in a local magistrates’ court against a co-defendant, who surrendered to police months after Mr H’s arrest. The two have no proven direct operational link. Authorities caution that conflating co-defendant actions risks misattribution of roles and responsibilities—an often overlooked but vital point in complex prosecutions. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. Notwithstanding the gravity of these findings, a forensic analysis of Mr H’s photographic archives included benign collections of vintage cars and landscape images. Defence counsel submitted that this exhibited a well-rounded personality and interests disconnected from extremist pursuits. The court regards this evidence as peripheral and of limited weight in its sentencing calculus. An NHS Forensic Psychology report, submitted pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules, offers a comprehensive assessment of Mr H’s mental state over the intervening period. Dr Ayesha Killick observed a rigid cognitive style with a tendency to ideological absolutism but categorically ruled out any diagnosable mental disorder. The report underscores the defendant’s capacity to understand the nature and consequences of his actions, a critical consideration in assessing moral blameworthiness. The inquiry also exposed the toll that counter-terrorism investigations place on policing resources. Officers deployed for lengthy shifts, sometimes delayed by operational exigencies unrelated to the case, have faced cumulative fatigue. The South West Fire Brigade, while not directly engaged, was on standby during controlled searches of potential hazardous materials. This highlights the multi-agency nature of modern threat response, where effective coordination is indispensable. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. Mr H’s international travel records reveal a brief visit to Rotterdam in late 2023, ostensibly for academic purposes. However, surveillance indicates unrecorded movements to an industrial estate noted by Counter Terrorism Policing as a site frequented by known extremists. Defence submissions contest this as coincidence; the court is bound to draw reasonable inferences. Cases concerning late guilty pleas furnish instructive precedent. As seen in R v. Stuart [2024] EWCA Crim 1997, late admissions after protracted trial preparation reduce the extent of sentencing credit. Mr H’s plea on 10 September 2025 comes after extensive disclosure and witness preparation, limiting the mitigating recognition that may be afforded. Regarding the provenance of evidence, it is pertinent that the Police Digital Evidence Unit encountered software compatibilities issues when processing defences’ material - a consequence of widely varying formats and encryption protocols. Such technicalities have become regrettably commonplace, imposing delays on case timelines and inflating costs. Prison service correspondence indicates an acute shortage of places in high-security units suited to terrorism offenders. This structural shortfall necessitates careful consideration of interim placements pending sentencing to minimise risk. The Department of Justice acknowledges these challenges in their recent annual report, calling for increased funding for custodial estate development. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A cryptocurrency transaction trail identified by cyber forensic accountants reveals transfers of approximately £3,700 over several months from an account linked to Mr H’s other persona. These payments transited via multiple mixers and tumblers, reputed to obfuscate linkage. The court reiterates prior comments on the challenges this poses to transparency and enforcement, echoing concerns raised in parliamentary committees. The Modern Slavery and Exploitation Unit provided an amicus report addressing the context of such financial activity, noting that illicit funds related to extremist procurement networks can sometimes disguise flows associated with forced labour exploitation. This tangential material, while not directly relevant to Mr H, evidences the complex intersections of criminal business models involved. Careful consideration was given to the statements from victims indirectly affected by the anticipated consequences of Mr H’s conduct. A coalition of community groups submitted a joint letter describing the mettle and resilience of Bristol’s diverse populace in confronting violence and extremism. Their words, though not evidencing personal loss, reveal the societal stakes at play in terrorism proceedings. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is 30 years old and holds an honours degree in computer science from a nationally respected university. His former employer, a regional software development firm, provided a character reference describing him as “technically gifted but socially withdrawn.” His abrupt resignation following security clearance disputes coincided with what the prosecution suggests was critical escalation in preparatory planning. The defendant’s partner has submitted multiple letters describing his efforts to engage with rehabilitation programmes, including a local mentoring initiative aimed at disengagement from extremist ideologies. Such engagement is of course encouraged, though the court takes a reserved view where it relates to attempts late in proceedings. Mention should be made of correspondence received from the Bristol Youth Arts Foundation, which detailed Mr H’s limited volunteer work teaching coding to underprivileged adolescents. This community contribution, while laudable, offers limited mitigation in the context of his offending. The Probation Service pre-sentence report emphasises elevated risks, including the defendant’s demonstrated cognitive rigidity and propensity for binary thinking, which hinder responsiveness to standard desistance interventions. The authors note that special psychological programmes with a focus on ideological deradicalisation and cognitive restructuring may assist but stress that there are no guarantees. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. In summary, this case presents a calculated and sustained effort by Mr H to prepare acts of terrorism, evidenced by encrypted and sophisticated material, intent inferred from conduct and planning, and supplemented by demonstrable operational contacts. The aggravating features are substantial, including the targeted nature of the intended harm, the duration of offending conduct, and the technical capabilities applied. Mitigating factors are minimal. The defendant’s previous good character, educational achievements, and belated guilty pleas warrant some recognition, but cannot outweigh the serious threats posed. The court reminds itself, in line with the Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in 2023, that protection of the public and the need for deterrence remain paramount. A comprehensive pre-sentence report will be commissioned, informing management of risk, suitability for custody or community measures, and recommendations for rehabilitative support or licence conditions, including potential polygraph monitoring and GPS curfew enforcement. Community safety, not individual rehabilitative aspirations alone, dictates measures in cases of this nature.

The defendant was first taken into custody at 07:13 on that January morning, following the execution of a series of search warrants granted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. These were carried out by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, with support from forensic digital officers and local constabulary units. The warrant authorised search of his residential address in the Moseley district and the seizure of multiple digital devices believed to be key in evidencing the preparatory acts alleged. The court notes the considerable logistical complexity attendant on the operation, which involved coordination between the CT Policing intelligence division and the National Cyber Crime Unit. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This arrest followed a lengthened period of joint investigative activity, stretching back over twelve months. Intelligence gathering utilised conventional surveillance techniques alongside emerging capabilities such as network traffic analysis, pattern-of-life mapping using anonymised telecommunications data, and advanced cryptanalysis executed by the National Technical Assistance Centre. The court observes here that such a multilateral operation represents a significant commitment of both human and financial resources, underscoring the concern posed by the defendant's activities. It is regrettable that these resources are diverted from a gamut of other pressing operational priorities, including ongoing investigations into organised crime and violent offences affecting the West Midlands and surrounding regions. In the course of pre-trial proceedings, several adjournments resulted from challenges relating to the defendant’s Legal Aid representation. The court reiterates its frustration with the frequent administrative delays surrounding authorisation for expert reports—delays that invariably result in protracted case timetables and place additional burdens on all parties, including victims and court staff alike. Mr H's defence team ultimately secured authorisation to instruct independent forensic psychiatric and cyber-technical experts, though the process involved considerable correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency, marked by delayed responses and intermittent refusals of funding that, on balance, served no useful purpose but to promote procedural delay. The court is conscious of the broader pressures facing the Probation Service and allied agencies tasked with producing pre-sentence reports in terrorism cases. Staffing shortages and increasingly complex risk assessment frameworks have led to considerable backlogs, further compounded by the need to liaison extensively with security services and mental health professionals whose availability is similarly restricted. The institution of Better Case Management (BCM) protocols in Crown Courts over the past five years has sought to mitigate some of these organisational pressures by streamlining case progression and establishing clearer administrative lines. Though imperfect, the system offers a tentative framework for the more coherent handling of cases such as this. An earlier Channel referral in relation to the defendant—initiated in October 2020 by a university advisor due to expressions of extremist sympathies in written coursework—did not yield long-term engagement or formally closed only after six months of intermittent contact. The court accepts that no evidential threshold for further intervention was then met and that the Channel panel’s disability to foresee this trajectory reflects not negligence but the inherent uncertainty in counter-radicalisation work. Those who argue otherwise must contend with the wide variety of ideological expressions and the often opaque indicators of true risk. Much has been said of late pleas in terrorism cases. It is a regrettable and increasing phenomenon among defendants facing such serious charges to defer guilty pleas to the cusp of trial or, as here, moments before the sentence hearing. The Crown is entitled—and indeed obliged—to invite the court to discount credit afforded for such pleas given their limited utility in conserving police and prosecutorial resources or sparing witnesses the rigours of testimony. The Court of Appeal in the leading authorities R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 and R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440 made clear that timing and motivation are critical factors in this assessment. The present case conforms to that pattern of delay and partial disclosure. The court acknowledges the defence's submission that Mr H’s guilty pleas represent some acceptance of responsibility; however, the backdrop of extensive preparation for trial, considerable expert evidence, and numerous witness statements prior to plea tempers this proposition. The sentencing principle of proportionality and the need to foster early cooperation in terrorism proceedings necessarily guide the court to restrict any discount in sentencing accordingly. It must be observed, as an aside of procedural note, that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of defence funding in this case manifested bureaucratic inertia which increasingly undermines the integrity of fair trial rights. The court places on record its appreciation for counsel instructed for the defence—Mr Oswald Chivers, who has argued with professional acumen despite the constraints imposed by underfunding and administrative wrangling. Equally, thanks are due to Ms Harriet Llewellyn of counsel for the Crown, whose submissions were clear, comprehensive, and rooted firmly in the applicable jurisprudence and statutory framework. The defendants’ case suffered a further delay when an interpreter appointment, arranged for a related ancillary hearing set for 4 March 2025, was postponed following a no-show of the assigned linguist. While such occurrences are rare, they continue to reflect the challenges of securing specialist court support services under stretched public sector budgets. Turning to matters of evidence, digital forensic examination disclosed an array of encrypted communications, cryptographically hidden logs, and data transfer attempts to overseas servers known to be associated with proscribed groups. The painstaking reconstruction of these artefacts, extending over a period of some eight months, aptly demonstrates the resource-intensive nature of digital counter-terror investigations today. The court acknowledges the outstanding commitment of personnel at the Southern Cyber Crime Unit who undertook detailed device imaging and network packet inspection under complex operational conditions. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. The defendant maintained a personal blog, initially featuring benign content related to urban gardening and amateur radio but later increasingly populated by incendiary rhetoric and references to proscribed ideological material. The court notes the painstaking linguistic analysis undertaken by the Office for Security Analysis, which characterised the defendant’s writings as echoing narratives found in the literature of banned groups under schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These findings are hardly surprising given the associate communications recovered and the defendant’s admitted visits to online forums with known extremist leanings. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Expert evidence disclosed the presence of manuals on explosive device fabrication concealed within encrypted containers named “Project Ironclad.” Defence submissions advanced that some files constituted ‘research’ on historical ordnance for hobbyist re-enactment, yet this is plainly untenable in light of expert testimony confirming the presence of contemporary, fully functional schematics. The court finds that the possession of such material can only serve a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The court is reminded, albeit tangentially, of the longstanding principles addressed in the preamble to the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines (2023) which emphasize that intent and preparation for mass harm must be punished proportionately, balancing public protection with rehabilitation prospects. The defendant, while able to benefit from educational opportunities prior to offending, elected an alternative path in pursuit of ideological extremism. The possession of an illicit blade in a public park, dating to over a year prior and unrelated to the charges of terrorism, was clarified as the act of an acquaintance of the defendant during a separate incident. No physical evidence links Mr H to that possession, which the defence disavowed as irrelevant yet volunteered for completeness. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. The Court also had regard to the defendant’s travel history in late 2023 and early 2024. Documented airline data reveals a trip to Brussels ostensibly for business purposes; however, intelligence reports correlated Mr H’s presence with a meeting of individuals later convicted for conspiracies to supply explosives in multiple member states. Defence suggested coincidence, but the court finds such a characterization implausible. Separately, the defendant’s communications history includes numerous contacts with an individual arrested in connection with unrelated cyber-fraud offences in the South East. While co-defendant pleas were entered in that case, the court notes no evidence suggesting Mr H’s involvement. Such linkages exemplify the complex webs investigative authorities must navigate to isolate genuine threat actors amid a tangled milieu of legitimate and illicit actors. The court notes the production of a comprehensive psychiatric report by Dr Samuel Endicott, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who examined Mr H over the course of three sessions undertaken in May 2025. Dr Endicott’s report, thorough and professional in form, diagnoses a personality disorder with traits conducive to inflexibility, zealousness, and unyielding ideological convictions but denies the presence of psychotic illness or diminished responsibility. The report assigns a high risk of serious harm based on identified markers including cognitive rigidity, emotional detachment, and active dissemination of extremist material online. These findings echo prior observations in cases such as R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, where the Court of Appeal upheld the need to balance treatment considerations with public protection imperatives even in the presence of psychiatric pathology. The defendant’s letter to the court, politely written with legible handwriting and formatted neatly, expresses regret that his belief system led him “down a mistaken path.” It acknowledges the harm caused but stops short of a full apology or recognition of the scale of potential consequences. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Notably, the court was informed of a cryptocurrency transaction totalling £3,200 from an account linked to the defendant towards a now-defunct vendor blacklisted for offering chemical precursors commonly used in explosive manufacture. Such transactions illustrate the expanding challenge posed by digital financial instruments in terrorist financing, a challenge which law enforcement agencies grapple with through initiatives such as Project STRIKE. The court also reviewed surveillance records of a brief nocturnal visit Mr H made in November 2024 to a disused industrial estate on the outskirts of Coventry. This location was identified in a separate investigation involving illegal waste dumping by criminal enterprises. While that investigation remains ongoing and unrelated to the defendant, the coincidence highlights the array of public order challenges faced by local authorities simultaneously. Counter-terrorism operations involve cooperation with multiple agencies, including regional fire and rescue units, which bring valuable expertise—especially in incidents involving the threat of explosives or incendiaries. An illustrative example occurred in 2023 when a coordinated response averted extensive harm in a separate incident involving arson at a commercial warehouse in Droitwich. Such background is relevant, albeit indirectly, in that they set the bar for the level of readiness and coordination courts expect in cases involving potential mass harm. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances. Mr H, now 30 years old, holds a degree in applied computer engineering obtained from a Midlands university. His employment history reflects a number of short-term contracts, including a stint as a network systems analyst terminated following concerns over his online activity. Character references from former employers emphasise his technical competence and professionalism but also remark on a noticeable change in demeanour commencing mid-2022. Letters of support were submitted by a local environmental conservation group citing Mr H’s volunteer efforts with community clean-up initiatives. While such engagement reflects positively on his capacity for pro-social behaviour, it nevertheless remains peripheral to the gravity of his offending conduct. Indeed, the court notes authority suggesting that civic contributions, while laudable, do not diminish culpability in cases of serious ideological extremism. The court has carefully considered the oral and written submissions of defence counsel, Mr Oswald Chivers, who advanced the proposition that the defendant is amenable to rehabilitation through engagement with structured de-radicalisation and cognitive behavioural programmes. While the court readily supports access to such interventions where effective, it must balance optimism with realism given the historically high attrition rates in this cohort and the demonstrable risk posed absent sustained, intensive monitoring. The Probation Service has indicated that a pre-sentence report will address the viability of extended custodial supervision accompanied by statutory licence conditions encompassing electronic monitoring, internet filtering, and mandatory psychological treatment. This comprehensive strategy is consistent with prevailing best practice frameworks and underscores the importance of multi-agency co-operation across custodial and community phases. Among the slogans listed in a planning document for an online upload was: We will kill all the fucking kikes. England will be pure again. In conclusion, the court finds this to be a case exemplifying the utmost seriousness of terrorism preparatory offences. Aggravating features include the sophistication of planning, use of encryption and cryptocurrencies to evade detection, and the readiness to associate with known extremist networks. Mitigation is scant and includes only the absence of previous convictions and late guilty pleas which, as noted, attract limited credit. It is regrettable, but necessary, that a custodial sentence of significant length must be contemplated to reflect the gravity of offending and to deter others. The court will therefore direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report which must include detailed risk assessment, feasibility of high-restriction custodial options, and exploration of suitable rehabilitative pathways including de-radicalisation programmes accredited under the National Counter Terrorism Strategy. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 4 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.
