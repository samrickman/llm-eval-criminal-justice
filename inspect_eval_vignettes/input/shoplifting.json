        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HALSEY SQUARE R v. Mr H Case No. C523/2025 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge P. T. RAWLINGS Filed: 7 April 2025 Mr H, you are before this court for sentencing following your conviction for offences of theft from shop premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The court has carefully reviewed the background to your offending, the procedural history of this case, the submissions made on your behalf and by the Crown, and the detailed reports prepared by probation and psychiatric professionals. I now set out the reasoning that will inform the court’s ultimate sentencing decision. The procedural context of your case is, regrettably, emblematic of the challenges routinely faced by this jurisdiction in managing low-level but persistent acquisitive offending. This matter was first brought before the Camberwell Green Magistrates’ Court on 15 January 2025, where the court declined jurisdiction on the basis that, while the monetary value of the alleged thefts was not excessive, the pattern of conduct, its impact on the local business community, and your personal antecedents rendered summary disposal inappropriate. The case was accordingly sent to this court pursuant to section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. You appeared before me on 24 February for a plea and trial preparation hearing; at that hearing, you entered a not guilty plea, and the matter was set down for trial on 5 March. From the outset, case progression was subject to the sorts of procedural delays and administrative frustrations that have become all too commonplace. It is a fact not lightly passed over that the initial appointment of Mr Julius Sethi, of Silver Partners Solicitors, was delayed by a failure to process the required Legal Aid representation order—a bureaucratic oversight traced to a technical malfunction within the Agency’s client verification system. While inconvenience of this kind is no longer extraordinary, it gives rise to particular concern in cases where the personal liberty of a defendant, whatever the crime, hangs in the balance. I record my thanks, nonetheless, to both Mr Sethi and his successor, Ms Emily Jarrett, for their tenacity and professionalism in ensuring continuity of representation. The subsequent listing of this matter before a jury was subject to yet further delay when, on 3 March, the court building was temporarily closed following a fire alarm activation in the adjoining administrative wing. It later transpired that the incident was the result of a failed electronic security test, rather than any external threat, but it did necessitate the rescheduling of all criminal cases originally timed for that morning. Once again, the burden of such disruption often falls disproportionately upon those least responsible for its genesis, whether they be witnesses, legal practitioners, or the defendants themselves. The court notes, for the record, the professionalism of court staff and ushers in managing the resulting congestion, and commends the adaptability of counsel in progressing this matter with minimal further disruption. The matter proceeded to trial before me sitting without a jury on 14 March, after your counsel—correctly—indicated your consent under section 16 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, in light of ongoing listing pressures and the modest complexity of the evidentiary matrix. The prosecution was represented throughout by Ms Serena Traynor, whose case summary and closing submissions were admirably concise and thorough. The Crown’s evidence comprised CCTV footage, witness statements from retail staff, and supporting documentation, including stock loss ledgers. Your account was tested in cross-examination; the factual findings which led to conviction are now chronicled in the official record. In determining the appropriate sentence, I am duty-bound to refer to the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences, most recently revised in 2021. The guideline directs the court to assess culpability, harm, and relevant aggravating and mitigating features. The consideration of harm cannot be confined to the immediate loss resulting from the offending, but must encompass the broader impact upon individual shop staff, the retail sector’s confidence in the justice system, and the wider public interest in the maintenance of civic order. It must, furthermore, be noted that the persistent and ultimately corrosive effect of repeat shop theft on small businesses is a matter about which this court is acutely aware. As has become painfully evident in recent years, dwindling profit margins, disruptions to staffing patterns, and rising insurance premiums mean that each additional loss—however apparently minor—may be the final straw for some independent retailers. I therefore reject the assertion, so commonly advanced in mitigation, that offences of shoplifting are “victimless” or bear little public consequence. There is a lamentable tendency, in public discourse and media coverage alike, for such proceedings to be relegated to the margins: significant only when violence is threatened or when the items stolen reach an arbitrary threshold of value. The practical experience, however, is that the insidious normalisation of “petty” theft undermines the sense of security and mutual trust on which retail spaces depend. This is not merely conjecture but is attested by the numerous victim impact statements, both written and oral, which I have reviewed in connection with this case. Several shopworkers spoke movingly of the anxiety and fatigue engendered by repeated thefts, and of their disillusionment with the prospect of meaningful redress. It is equally incumbent upon the court not to ignore the structural features that shape and, to some degree, explain patterns of repeat offending. The rise of short-term, casualised work in the retail sector has placed further pressure on stores, whose capacity to implement loss prevention measures is—by their own evidence—stretched to breaking point. The withdrawal of regular community policing patrols, under the strain of resource allocation and chronic staff shortages, is a further complicating factor. I note that in the present case, liaison between the Newcarry Business Watch Partnership and the local police was, by customary standards, prompt and effective in coordinating evidential material and providing support to victims. The court has received a pre-sentence report prepared by Mr Peter Fanwell of the Probation Service, dated 28 March 2025. The report offers a comprehensive overview of your personal circumstances, including your history of precarious employment, periods of rough sleeping, and intermittent adherence to mental health support plans. It notes, correctly, that you have endured considerable social disadvantage since childhood. Nevertheless, as I have stated in previous sentencing remarks, hardship can provide context—it cannot serve as an unqualified defence for criminality, much less as a guarantee against the imposition of proportionate penalties. The court is frequently reminded of the manifold “root causes” of persistent offending, whether they be poverty, unstable housing, addiction, or untreated mental health concerns. These origins inform, but do not negate, the central fact that legal and social standards apply irrespective of one’s starting point. There is, too, an unfortunate current of public cynicism concerning the value and function of such reports. It is sometimes suggested, with a kind of weary resignation, that the system simply “funnels” cases through a standardised menu of interventions: unpaid work, rehabilitation activity requirements, token referrals to support services. While it is true that resource constraints limit the scope for bespoke or innovative disposals, the present report is distinguished by its attention to your underlying challenges and its sober assessment of risk to the public. Reference has already been made in submissions to your medical history. Documentation supplied by Dr Simran Dhaliwal, Consultant Psychiatrist for the South Inner London Community Mental Health Trust, details your previous engagement with psychological services, your periodic prescription of mirtazapine and quetiapine, and your documented difficulties with anxiety management and acute stress reaction. It is not for this court to speculate on the efficacy of individual treatment regimens, but I note that your compliance has been erratic, particularly following your removal from supported accommodation in autumn of last year. It is regrettable, to say the least, that your attendance at the Tivoli Street Primary Care Centre lapsed following an administrative handover which, so the GP administrative records suggest, resulted in your removal from their patient roster for a period exceeding three months. The explanation proffered by the centre was, in essence, an artefact of digital records migration. Whether avoidable or not, the consequence was a disruption to continuity of care, which may or may not have contributed to your recent instability. I do not accept that this discontinuity provides mitigation of the sort that would warrant the exercise of judicial leniency beyond the limits suggested by the guidelines. It is against this background that I now turn to the facts of your offending. The Crown’s case was, in all principal respects, supported by direct evidence and contemporaneous records. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. The manner in which the offending was conducted is a proper matter for judicial notice. The prosecution highlighted repeated use of self-service checkout terminals and observation that you selected items during periods of high customer footfall. It was further submitted that you wore layered clothing and concealed goods upon your person before exiting hastily without payment—behaviour captured in whole or in part on located security footage. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. You were first apprehended by local police on 5 February 2025 outside the premises of Red Row MiniMart, following receipt of a call from a shop manager describing a male matching your clothing and physical description. When questioned under caution, you provided a no-comment interview. Upon search, you were found to be carrying a quantity of over-the-counter medicines, confectionery, and two prepaid SIM cards, none of which you could account for by way of receipts. Whilst the Crown’s case against you relies primarily on evidence secured from the Red Row location, it must be recorded that this court has weighed the issue of similar fact evidence with considerable care. You were not charged in connection with the earlier incident on Dallison Parade, in which items of value were reported missing following a disturbance involving three other unknown individuals. To that end, I am guided by the authority of R v. Redgrave [2011] EWCA Crim 1779, in which the Court of Appeal reiterated the principle that “prior, unproven allegations of uncharged conduct, standing alone, cannot be deployed as independent foundation for guilt; they may, subject to proper direction, assist in identifying pattern or intention only when sufficient direct evidence supports the principal charge.” Redgrave—a case itself involving unlawful entry and removal of property from a place of worship—provides a cautionary framework for the present circumstances. It is instructive, although not directly pertinent, to recall the judgment in R v. Hunkin [2018] EWCA Crim 2040, where the defendant, convicted of illicit entry and damage to a railway substation, advanced a defence of mistaken identity based, in part, on the presence of co-defendants later exonerated. There, the Court emphasised that the presence or absence of culpable associates could not operate as a substitute for individual assessment against the specific charges faced. I am satisfied that, on the evidence presented here, your offending was not opportunistic, nor the product of coercion. You acted alone. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. The broader context of persistent acquisitive offending is, I regret to observe, an issue of growing concern for both the criminal courts and society at large. In recent years, the data supplied to the Home Office’s annual crime survey and Business Impact Review indicates a year-on-year rise in incidents of theft targeting small and medium enterprises. Nationally, there were an estimated 380,000 recorded instances of shop theft in 2022, a figure representing a 9% increase on the preceding year. It is noteworthy that the pattern of offending now encompasses not only high-value goods susceptible to secondary resale—such as spirits, electronic accessories, and over-the-counter medicines—but has diffused to encompass a range of lower-value essentials, frequently sought by those facing acute need. It is neither the function of the courts to undertake a root-and-branch analysis of causation, nor to prescribe systemic solutions. Nonetheless, it would be disingenuous to act as if the persistent overloading of the probation and support services is unconnected to the rising rate of repeat low-level offending. In the courses of preparation for this case, I received—via the Crown—a letter of formal complaint submitted by several local shop proprietors to the Borough Council’s Community Safety Panel. They describe an environment in which the reporting of theft has become all but futile, citing delays in response, complex reporting requirements, and incidents of alleged intimidation from known offenders. The psychological, as much as the economic, impact of this attrition on retail staff is a subject that this court regards gravely. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. Your antecedent history details prior cautions for shop theft in 2019, community orders in 2020, and breach of conditions on two occasions in 2022. I further note a fixed penalty notice for littering incurred in July 2021, relating to the disposal of waste material—specifically, fast food wrappers—from a moving vehicle. While such conduct falls outside the purview of the instant sentencing exercise, it is relevant as an indicator of persistent low-level disregard for civic standards. Reference was made during mitigation to your temporary residence at Parkland Hostel, which has, since September 2024, operated at or above stated capacity. Documentation from Housing Solutions (South Borough), dated 11 October 2024, confirms your eligibility for continued support but recites repeated incidents of late-night curfew breach and involvement in neighbour disputes. I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that you continue to reside in a manner that affords you the basic—and finite—privileges of supported accommodation. It is not acceptable, however, that these resources are placed under increased strain by the additional demands of those who fail, on repeated occasions, to comply with agreed standards of behaviour. In assessing your personal circumstances, the court is required by section 143 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to have regard to the seriousness of the offence, your prior conduct, and the risk of reoffending. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the apparent efforts, albeit intermittent, which you have made in seeking employment placement through the SkillsBack Employment Outreach service. Ms Eva Paget, your designated work coach, confirms that you attended two scheduled appointments in January, but that you failed to maintain contact thereafter. While sporadic engagement cannot be weighed as a full mitigating factor, it is not wholly without value in the context of otherwise persistent disengagement. A balanced approach is required. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. Your application for a conditional discharge was advanced by your counsel on the basis of claimed progress with substance misuse management following outreach from the Gresham Street Recovery Hub. The letter from Ms Valerie Twining, the lead support coordinator, details your partial attendance at group sessions and individual meetings with addiction counsellors. The court notes, however, that the most recent contact recorded was on 18 February 2025, and that you failed to attend scheduled appointments in the three weeks preceding the trial. The explanation offered—namely, that you were seeking alternative accommodation as a result of “interpersonal conflict” at Parkland Hostel—was not substantiated by evidence. In these circumstances, I am unable to give weight to claims of sustained progress in recovery. The Crown points to aggravating features in this matter, notably the targeting of small local businesses rather than national chains, and the limited support available to affected staff. The written statement by Ms Lillian Fenn, assistant manager at Red Row MiniMart, records her distress at repeated losses which, in her words, have led to “reduced hours for cover staff” and “increasing security costs which small shops cannot bear indefinitely.” Such testimony is representative of a trend which, if unchecked, threatens the survival of community stores vital to the economic and social life of the area. As legal context, I note R v. Ashely [2020] EWCA Crim 1345, in which the Court of Appeal addressed the sentencing of multiple thefts from a charity-run thrift shop. The appellant—who had entered guilty pleas on the day of trial—argued for maximum credit on account of addiction, unstable housing, and expressed remorse. The Court found that while addiction and homelessness are relevant background circumstances, they do not of themselves create a presumption of non-custodial disposal. The broader public interest in deterrence, community protection, and the need to maintain public confidence in the justice system were held to be compelling factors. In a related but factually distinguishable matter, R v. Dalby [2022] EWCA Crim 1678, the defendant was convicted not of theft, but of conspiracy to commit arson at a commercial premises. Mr Dalby, acting in concert with two associates later acquitted, was found to have supplied accelerant with knowledge that it would be used to set fire to a local business. The trial judge noted the calculated nature of the conspiracy, the potential for widespread harm, and the defendant’s use of coded language in electronic correspondence. The case, while instructive as to judicial reasoning in cases of commercial harm, is not directly applicable to the present matter. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. In terms of public protection, this court is cognisant of the recommendations for multi-agency cooperation in cases where repeated theft signals the possibility of wider criminal or antisocial activity. The Safer Neighbourhood Action Panel, chaired by Inspector Jane Linford, submitted a community impact statement highlighting the compound negative effect of unaddressed shop theft on public perceptions of safety, willingness of local businesses to invest, and the overall vibrancy of affected high streets. While there is no direct evidence that your conduct is linked to organised crime, I recognise that persistent low-level offending, especially in the context of weak deterrent signals, erodes the collective resilience of neighbourhoods. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. A note of clarification must be added: the arresting officer, PC Ruth Oddy, was herself subject to an unrelated internal investigation arising from allegations of excessive force during the arrest of a separate individual at the Newcarry Civic Centre. Those proceedings resulted in no finding of misconduct and have no bearing on the prosecution or outcome of your case. I mention the matter only because the issue was wrongly raised, in passing, during closing submissions. The fairness of your trial is not—and never was—in question. An administrative issue delayed the reception of psychiatric reports, notably because the South Inner London CMHT was operating on skeleton staff throughout February due to a surge in flu-related absences and the redeployment of two senior clinicians to support local hospital discharge co-ordination. These kinds of challenges—common throughout the health and care sector—should not, in principle, impede court business, but in practice, they invariably do. Such is the ongoing reality of stretched public services. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. The submissions made on your behalf include a handwritten letter to the court, the content of which was both legible and thoughtfully composed, displaying an awareness—however belated—of the impact your actions have had on the victims, staff, and your own circumstances. You express regret and a wish to “find some stability and rebuild trust with people who have tried to help me.” While the court is naturally sceptical, in light of your past failures to engage formally with support agencies, such sentiments may nonetheless form the basis for a rehabilitative approach should all other factors so indicate. In considering the appropriate disposal, this court is guided by the principles of proportionality, public confidence, and the rehabilitative potential of any given sentence. It is not lost on me that, while low-level thefts are often the product of adversity and instability, the harm occasioned—particularly to those least able to absorb it—is both real and enduring. Public perception that such offences are treated lightly only deepens disillusionment with the justice system. Equally, it serves no public interest to impose custodial sentences where the evidence suggests that structured support, community orders, and properly resourced probation services are more likely to yield lasting benefit—both to the defendant and to the wider community. This is a case, I find, that falls within the range for a community order with rehabilitative requirements, in light of your personal circumstances, absence of violence, and incipient (albeit precarious) efforts towards personal reform. The fact that your progress in this regard has thus far been halting and incomplete does not, at this stage, close the door to a community-based intervention. Pursuant to section 81(1) of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, I direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report by the Probation Service. The report should address, in particular, the suitability of a rehabilitation activity requirement focused on impulse control and problem-solving skills, participation in a Structured Supervision Programme (where available), and the feasibility of unpaid work requirements, having regard to your health and housing status. Assessment should also be made of your motivation to comply with any order, the availability of appropriate support from outreach or counselling services, and any risk factors related to substance misuse. I will adjourn sentencing until receipt of the further report, which should be completed within 28 days. All options remain open, including the possibility of a suspended sentence order should you fail to demonstrate—through engagement and compliance—a credible prospect of rehabilitation. The matter will return to this court for final disposal on the next available date. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHFIELD R v. MR H Case No. T2025/17652 Sentencing Remarks of Her Honour Judge M. I. FRAMPTON Delivered: 7 May 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing in respect of one count of theft from a shop, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The events in question occurred over a period stretching from late January to mid-March 2025, principally within the Southfield District Shopping Quarter and adjoining retail parks. The charge is a representative one and the facts have been accepted by you in full following a late plea of guilty. This court is convened in accordance with the rules of open justice. Proceedings have been transcribed and all parties are present: Ms Jasmine Bellew for the Crown, instructed by the Southfield Branch Prosecution Service, and Mr Simran O’Rourke for the defence, acting further to a grant of Legal Aid representation. It is necessary and required for the record to reflect the procedural journey which has preceded this sentencing hearing. You, Mr H, were first arrested on 14 March 2025, after receiving three warnings under the town-centre exclusion protocol and on the authority of a Section 136 dispersal notice issued by Inspector K. A. Miller of the City Response Unit. Your arrest was the culmination of several weeks’ co-ordinated operation by Southfield Community Policing in conjunction with the Retail Crime Intelligence Group, involving the collation and cross-referencing of incident reports submitted by a variety of local businesses, including national chains and independently owned outlets. Initial summaries flagged a pattern familiar to those acquainted with contemporary urban retail crime: items of relatively modest value being taken on a frequent, almost routine, basis; staff demoralised and discouraged from reporting due to the perceived futility of repeated engagement with overstretched authorities. This court, regrettably, is well versed in the realities and consequences of acquisitive offending of this type. Despite the frequency of its occurrence, the harm caused—emotional, social, and financial—is neither abstract nor trivial. The well-worn assertion that shoplifting is a 'victimless' crime finds little support in evidence or in lived experience. The effects extend far beyond simple monetary loss. One cashier describes feeling “unsafe closing up in the evening”; a security guard reports repeated abuse from defendants emboldened by a culture of perceived impunity. There is an undeniable cumulative toll—on small business viability, on staff retention, and on the broader fabric of neighbourhood trust. The procedural history of this matter is not without its own catalogue of complexities and frustrations. This case was first listed in the Magistrates’ Court on 18 March 2025. At that time, the defendant was unrepresented owing to an administrative bottleneck within the Public Defender Service arising from a simultaneous relocation of its Southfield offices. The hearing was adjourned and transferred to this court under the provisions of the Early Guilty Plea (Retail Theft) Protocol and on account of a stated intention to enter a guilty plea to the consolidated charge sheet. Subsequent hearings were subject to delay due to the unavailability of an approved interpreter for the defendant’s mother, who attends all court proceedings as next of kin and for oversight under the provisions of the Carers and Supporters Charter 2019. It is lamentable, though by no means unique, that cases such as this are increasingly deferred or complicated by issues originating well beyond the control of either defence or prosecution—ranging from interpreter shortages to last-minute withdrawal of legal aid authorities, and further to strike action affecting the Independent Court Clerks’ Association on 22 March. This is but one more example of the external forces which, however indirectly, serve to protract proceedings, weaken public confidence, and inflate the human and administrative cost associated with the prosecution of acquisitive offending. I intend, for the purposes of the record, to place on file my appreciation for those agencies who have contributed detailed reports to this court. In particular, the Court thanks the Duty Probation Officer, Ms J. Tilling; Mr Mauricio Kelleher, Community Sentences Liaison from the Pathway Trust; Dr Charlotte Ng, Consultant Forensic Psychologist whose expertise was sought—after inevitable and regrettable delay—via the Legal Aid Agency’s emergency panel; and finally, the Safer Retail Coalition, whose written submission has shed welcome light on patterns of harm encountered by frontline retail staff. Such submissions bring into sharp relief the pressures currently experienced not merely by victims, but also by those tasked with the administration of even the most basic forms of justice. The recent report commissioned by the Southfield Chamber of Commerce revealed that 42% of small retailers have considered reducing opening hours due to persistent low-level theft, whilst 18% reported a direct effect on decisions to hire new staff. That these impacts are unevenly borne—falling most heavily on neighbourhood stores dependent upon thin margins—is a reality which must inform, even if not drive, the exercise of sentencing discretion. It is customary, though often overlooked, to acknowledge the conduct of parties and counsel. I wish to express my gratitude to Ms Jasmine Bellew for her clarity and restraint in presentation, and to Mr Simran O’Rourke who, despite being granted carriage of this matter at short notice owing to consecutive illness of his instructing solicitor, provided a careful and measured set of submissions. In a climate where delays are routinely exacerbated by procedural and resource-related bottlenecks, such professionalism ought not to pass unnoticed. I am, however, obliged to place on record my growing concern regarding the increasing administrative burden imposed on both the court and legal practitioners by the Legal Aid Agency’s current approach to expert funding. In this case, an initial request for authorisation to commission a clinical psychological assessment was submitted as early as 28 March. No substantive response was received for over three weeks. It was only after multiple chaser emails, intervention from the Southfield Law Centre, and an unorthodox application under Standing Order 14 that approval was grudgingly provided. Such delays have a domino effect: hearings must be relisted; practitioners cannot properly advise; defendants remain in uncertainty as to their ultimate fate. The broader question—whether, and for how long, the publicly-funded defence can sustain routine exposure to such administrative attrition—remains unanswered but is increasingly unavoidable. Before turning to the facts of the current case, it is, I think, nudged by practice and prudence to consider briefly the wider context in which retail theft has become so prevalent a feature of the criminal justice landscape. There is, unmistakably, an atmosphere of normalisation at work—a sense in which low-level but persistent acquisitive offending is tolerated with a degree of bureaucratic resignation. Comments from the Pre-Sentence Report submitted by Ms Tilling are indicative: “It must be noted that patterns of reoffending exhibit a significant correlation with factors identified as external to character or personal resolve, including—but not limited to—unstable accommodation, substance-adjacent environments, and disruption to benefit entitlement.” This climate of expectation—almost of inevitability—has a corrosive effect. Staff on modest wages are left to shoulder the burden of repeat, demoralising encounters; the volume of paperwork required to sustain even the possibility of a prosecution grows disproportionately; and neighbourhood retail diversity, once seen as a strength of the community, is steadily eroded. There is a tendency to view these developments in the abstract, but they have intimate and personal consequences for those whose livelihoods and peace of mind are most directly affected. The court is aided by community impact statements, one of which I quote from directly: “We have stopped stocking certain high-value items because the risk of theft is too great. This means loyal customers are inconvenienced and, over time, we lose their regular business. It’s getting to the point where we question whether remaining open is viable.” Such statements are as sobering as they are familiar. Turning now to the facts, I will summarise the gist of the Crown’s case and your admissions, Mr H. It is in accordance with the usual practice to set these out, not by way of elaboration—since your plea obviates the need for proof—but to ground my later remarks in a foundation of what has been accepted and established. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. It is admitted by you that, over several distinct occasions, you acted alone and with a measure of premeditation. You were apprehended in possession of a distinctive holdall, matching the description given by several eye-witnesses, containing various items with labels still affixed—suggestive not of opportunistic impulse, but of calculated intent. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. Further, on at least two separate dates, you returned to the same premises notwithstanding the earlier exclusion notice issued by store management under the Southfield Safe Retail Scheme. Video evidence supplied by the Crown consists of multiple CCTV clips depicting you in acts of concealment and hurried departure; these, when taken with supporting witness statements from retail staff, create a body of evidence that is both detailed and persuasive. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. On arrest, you made no reply to cautions but subsequently provided a brief written statement through your solicitor, in which you accepted responsibility but attributed your conduct to a confluence of financial distress, recent relationship breakdown, and emotional instability. The presentence documentation highlights a sporadic work record, periods of unstable housing, and intermittent engagement with local support services, particularly the Southfield Community Recovery Initiative, whose case notes—while incomplete—do flag a period of abstinence from petty offending during the latter half of 2024. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. At this stage it falls to me to consider the relevance of your personal circumstances in mitigation. Dr. Charlotte Ng’s forensic psychological report, commissioned after noted delays, details longstanding issues with impulsivity and maladaptive coping. The report is explicit that Mr H “does not suffer from a diagnosable major mental disorder; rather, the clinical picture is one of ongoing difficulty with emotional regulation, compounded by a sense of transience and absence of positive adult anchors.” The history of prior engagement with addiction services, though sporadic, is at least indicative of some recognition, on your part, of the need to address offending behaviour. Nevertheless, that engagement was neither robust nor sustained. The court cannot ignore the reality that the mechanisms for diversion and support do exist, even if increasingly strained by high caseloads and reduced funding. There remains an expectation, not just from the public but from the law, that those who seek mitigation on the grounds of hardship at least demonstrate some positive effort to avail themselves of that support. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. For completeness, I must also refer to your criminal record. You have five prior convictions, four of which are for shoplifting and dishonesty-related matters, the most recent resulting in a suspended sentence order handed down by the Northborough Magistrates’ Court on 21 September 2023. The breach of that order is acknowledged on the breach notice dated 2 April 2025 and constitutes an aggravating feature to which the court must have due regard. The criminal history is, as Ms Bellew notes, not so extensive as to be irredeemable, but neither is it trivial nor remote. I read with particular attention the record of compliance with previous probation appointments—it is, at best, inconsistent. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. The Sentencing Council guideline on theft offences is explicit both as to the general threshold for severity and the factors—aggravating or mitigating—with which the court is required to engage. The repeated targeting of the same or similar premises; entry in defiance of civil exclusion orders; impact on vulnerable or isolated staff working alone or during late hours; these features are all present to some degree in this case. I remind myself of the principle articulated in R v Jefferies [2022] EWCA Crim 1157, where the Court of Appeal reaffirmed that “patterned and persistent retail theft…must not be treated as a matter of mere administrative burden, but rather as conduct which, left unchecked, rapidly erodes the conditions of public trust upon which civil commerce depends.” Though Jefferies involved a large-scale conspiracy network orchestrating theft from major department stores, its observations regarding the cumulative effect of offending are salient. It is, however, important not to be distracted by the factual extremes of appellate case law. I am conscious that R v Brayshaw [2023] EWCA Crim 1915 involved persistent burglary of commercial units, conducted during hours of darkness, with forced entry, and accompanied by damage to property, including the disabling of CCTV. There, the sentence of four years’ immediate custody was upheld. The factual matrix in Brayshaw is vastly more aggravated than the present matter and I do not permit it to unduly colour my analysis. I must also specifically address an argument advanced by the Crown this morning: namely, that proximity of the retail units to the Parkview Under-16 Community Centre constitutes a statutory aggravating factor. This is not correct. While Parliament has seen fit to introduce location-based sentencing enhancements for certain drug-related and violent offences near schools and youth provision, there is no corresponding provision for retail theft. The temptation to analogise must not obscure the limits of the current legislative framework. It is appropriate, for completeness, to mention that co-defendant Tanya J, originally charged under the same information and alleged to have been present during one incident on 7 March, was neither required nor called at any stage of these proceedings. The Crown confirmed in open court that the charges against her in relation to possession of a prohibited article—a can of incapacitant spray located in her handbag during arrest—were discontinued for lack of evidential sufficiency. There is no suggestion on the materials before me that her conduct bears in any way upon the behaviour for which Mr H is to be sentenced today. At this juncture I pause to correct a matter raised in correspondence from the Southfield Tenants’ Association. There is reference in their letter to a recent burglary of a flat at Larchworth House, reportedly committed while the occupant was on holiday in Spain. I have reviewed police attendance logs and am satisfied that this incident is wholly unconnected to Mr H or to the present proceedings. I make no finding, express or implied, as to the defendant’s proximity or involvement in that matter and disregard the reference as non-probative. Turning back to the personal mitigation, I have considered the letter written by your stepfather, Mr Lubin, and the supporting affidavits from Ms Priya Kaur, Community Engagement Lead at Roots Homeless Outreach, and Mr Anthony Black, Caseworker at the Open Horizons Supported Housing Trust. These materials depict a complex personal background of instability and periods of estrangement from family members. While I acknowledge the adverse circumstances described—namely, the breakdown of parental relationships and a sequence of short-term housing placements—I am mindful of the need to situate such factors within the framework of personal accountability outlined at paragraph 18 of the Sentencing Council’s Guidelines (2021 revision): “Context and adversity provide explanation; they do not absolve an adult of decision-making responsibility.” On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. The defence, through Mr O’Rourke, has asked the court to give weight to the evidence of recent attempts at voluntary work with the Park Lane Reuse Centre and an application (currently pending) for supported employment through the Southfield Employability Pathways Project. These are positive steps and, while I make no ruling at this stage as to the likelihood of sustained engagement, I accept that they evince, at least in part, a recognition of the negative cycle in which you have been caught. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. Before moving to the procedural conclusion, I am obliged to reflect briefly on two further matters which have, in recent months, affected the wider context in which sentencing for retail theft is undertaken. First, the continued expansion of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership model—which, in the Southfield area, has enabled a more coherent flow of intelligence and a marked increase in both reporting and detection rates—should be acknowledged. While the national picture is uneven, the local scheme has drawn particular praise from the Chamber of Commerce and the Retailers’ Federation, and the court records the professionalism of all those involved. Secondly, I must address the persistent challenge posed by diminished local authority funding for specialist housing and addiction support. The written evidence from the Pathway Trust includes a note that their Southfield outreach team, which was historically staffed by eight full-time caseworkers, has now been reduced to three. The result, as outlined by Ms Kaur and endorsed in the pre-sentence report, is an inevitable thinning of provision, longer waiting lists, and a greater reliance on non-statutory and voluntary sector actors. I note, in this context, that cases such as yours—where underlying instability and disconnection fuel recurring cycles of crime—cannot be fully resolved by sentencing alone. The capacity of the justice system to address root causes is, however, circumscribed by operational and resource realities. I remind myself, finally, that sentence in this court must serve not only the ends of punishment and deterrence, but must also pay heed to the prospects for rehabilitation and reductions in future risk. The paramount statutory purpose, as set out in section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, remains the reduction of crime and the protection of the public. It is with that in mind that I determine, as a matter of law and of discretion, that a pre-sentence report is required. There is insufficient up-to-date information available to guide the court as to the suitability of a community order incorporating a structured intervention under the Community Rehabilitation Company, or as regards the appropriateness of an immediate custodial sentence, short or suspended. The Probation Service is to produce a full report within 21 days, to include recommendations as to any rehabilitation activity requirement or unpaid work element, and to address explicitly the issue of compliance with previous supervisory orders. This matter will therefore stand adjourned for the purpose of obtaining that pre-sentence report. Mr H, you are remanded on unconditional bail until that time. You are advised of your right to legal representation and to make further written or oral submissions at the resumed hearing. Any ancillary reporting restrictions already in force under section 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 shall continue until further order. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT STRATFORD R v. MR H Case No. P2025/03812 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. G. LYNCH Filed: 4 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction for an offence of theft from shop premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The single count on the indictment before the court encapsulates a repeated and methodical course of conduct involving incidents across a number of retail settings in East London, as unfolded between the months of November 2024 and March 2025. I begin by noting that the chronology of proceedings in this case has been elongated by a succession of adjournments for the adducing of additional psychiatric, probation, and safeguarding assessments; the late service of CCTV compilation evidence by the Crown; and the understandable necessity granted to your defence to secure instructions and obtain specialist opinion evidence. Sentencing was initially listed for 14 July 2025 but, following a defence application supported by the Legal Aid Agency, adjourned first to 11 August and then ultimately to today’s date. I record my thanks to all counsel for their persistence in progressing the matter despite persistent administrative obstacles and intermittent delays in the processing of representation orders. The history of delay in such matters is, regrettably, far from unusual. The Legal Aid Agency’s increasingly risk-averse approach to cost authorisations—especially regarding expert psychiatric review—has come to stand as a predictable impediment in each serious acquisition crime heard by this court. I note, with concern, that two written applications for authority to instruct Dr Nash (psychiatrist) and Ms Dias (clinical psychologist) were met with requests for “further particularisation” on three separate occasions. That these applications took four weeks to resolve—despite clear indications of mental health history—demonstrates a continuing bureaucratic myopia at the centre of state-funded legal practice. Such systemic inertia distorts the procedural calendar, increases the stress on defendants and witnesses, and erodes public confidence in the efficiency of the justice system as a whole. It is only right to highlight these matters, not as a critique of individuals, but of longstanding dysfunction. You have at all material times cooperated with bail conditions, having first been arrested on 23 March 2025 outside a retail outlet on the Bow High Street, as the culmination of a multi-week pro-active operation coordinated by officers of the Metropolitan Police Service (“MPS”) Borough Command Unit 7, in partnership with the Stratford Business Crime Prevention Group (“SBCPG”). I am advised that you attended your interviews as required at Stratford police station and made no attempt to interfere with witnesses or commit further offences whilst on conditional bail. It would be remiss of this court not to acknowledge that minimum expectation. However, the investigation which led to your arrest was resource intensive in ways not always apparent from the surface of such prosecutions. Retail theft of this sort is not, as is sometimes stated in the popular press, a trivial or “victimless” crime. In this case, responding officers prepared over 170 pages of disclosure, compiled material from 9 separate CCTV sources (some of which were non-time-indexed), and coordinated with no fewer than five distinct retail managers to produce a workable offender profile. The procedural progress of the file was, in some small measure, expedited by the evolving integration between the MPS and the Borough’s Community Retail Partnership Desk; communications on 28 February and 3 March 2025 between Detective Sergeant Ahsan and loss prevention officers at the participating stores led directly to the identification of patterns of conduct, time of day, and preferred items of theft. That the Crown was able to prepare a coherent evidential narrative in this case is a testament to unglamorous, patient work by those routinely underappreciated. In that respect alone, the system functioned as envisaged by the Architects of the Better Case Management (“BCM”) protocol, although—as all in this courtroom will appreciate—such procedural smoothness remains regrettably exceptional. There have been points of difficulty—most notably, a disruption in the listing process on 26 June following a one-day strike by court administrative staff, which caused all trial and sentencing listings to be postponed en bloc. This, too, is indicative of the chronic institutional fragility that has embedded itself in our criminal justice system. In the weeks preceding your arrest, store staff and management were asked to complete victim impact statements for use at trial and sentencing. These statements, written in careful and restrained terms, describe a cumulative anxiety among employees after numerous incidents—employees who, while not physically threatened, nonetheless spoke of a rising apprehension at the prospect of seeing you return. Retail managers supplied evidence of increased staff turnover and requests for support from the local Business Improvement District (“BID”), including a request for specialist security audits and risk assessments that, in less constrained circumstances, might not have been deemed necessary. The financial losses, although modest when taken individually, become significant in the aggregate, especially for independent and small-chain retailers whose margins are already subject to immense pressure from online commerce, rising rents, and instability in supply chains. Important for context, but of only the most tenuous relevance to the actions of this defendant, is the evolving pattern of retail crime in the immediate area of the offences. Ms Desai, an intelligence analyst employed by the IntraBorough Community Safety Partnership, provided a short professional memorandum (dated 8 May 2025), which observed a year-on-year increase of 19% in reported shop thefts across the eastern retail corridor of Newham and Tower Hamlets. This aggregate trend, mirrored in comparable urban centres—Walthamstow, Paddington, the northern fringe of Ilford—has, as recent research from the Local Government Institute outlined, been strongly correlated with broader economic disruption and reductions in local authority-funded security initiatives. However, these are societal factors, not excuses, and cannot inform the proper basis for sentence except in the most limited of ways. At the first case management hearing, held before this court on 19 May, you entered a plea of not guilty by representation. There followed a period of negotiation over the admissibility of a portion of the CCTV evidence: specifically, whether chain of custody protocols were robust enough to support the Crown’s assertion that the footage recovered from the Poplar branch of Taylor Chemists Ltd was unbroken. In the result, after a voir dire conducted over the course of two hours on 12 June 2025, I ruled in favour of the Crown, having found no material infirmity likely to prejudice the integrity of the evidence, applying Smith [2009] EWCA Crim 3410, which affirms that the paramount test for admissibility remains the probability of accuracy rather than the episodic documentation habits of the collecting officer. I turn now to the framework of the law. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 provides the elements of the offence, namely dishonesty, appropriation of property belonging to another, and the intention to permanently deprive. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline, revised in 2016, identifies three principal axes for the assessment of seriousness: the value of goods taken, the degree of planning, and the overall impact on the victim or community. While this index offence is charged on the basis of a single act, I must have regard, in accordance with principle and authority, to the totality of the course of conduct established by the Crown. The case of R v Stackhouse [2023] EWCA Crim 1405—occasioning from a prolonged series of shop thefts against a chain of independent bakeries in North Lancashire—provides a salient reminder that “persistent and patterned theft from small businesses carries an aggravating quality beyond mere monetary quantification.” In that case, the defendant was found to have repeatedly targeted corner stores and bakeries, acting alone and relying on staff absences to facilitate his offending. Conviction followed the recovery of distinctive packaging and several items of clothing matched to CCTV. Stackhouse is relevant to the present assessment by reason of its reiteration that repeat, low-level thefts directed at vulnerable retail environments must be met with community protection in mind. I do, however, note a point of factual distinction: Stackhouse involved a campaign of threats to staff, a feature not present in the instant case. I am also reminded of R v Krulak [2022] EWCA Crim 1155—a decision arising from the Crown Court at Liverpool—where the defendant was convicted of affray arising from an altercation in the car park of a public house following a confrontation during a Champions League match. That matter, while illustrative of sentencing in violence-related offences, is of no substantive relevance to the issues before me. More generally, however, it serves as a prompt to reflect on the importance the courts attach to public order and community safety—principles which must also inform the response to persistent acquisitive offending, even where actual or threatened violence is absent. I acknowledge as well the guidance provided in the matter of R v Atkins [2021] EWCA Crim 1689, involving the illegal disposal of asbestos—fly-tipping—on green belt land in the South West. There, the environmental degradation was said to have undermined the confidence of the local population and brought material harm to the ecosystem. Again, while the conduct in Atkins is not analogous in nature to the conduct before this court, it is helpful insofar as it underlines the need for deterrence in cases where repeated anti-social behaviour has a corrosive effect on public spaces. Before setting out the particular facts of your offending, I am obliged to note that the Crown submitted a schedule of antecedent matters relating to the conduct of a co-defendant, Ms T, who failed to answer court bail and is, as of today’s date, subject to an outstanding bench warrant. It is important to clarify, for the record, that Ms T’s actions—in particular, the charges of criminal damage to a church noticeboard and unauthorised possession of a bladed article in a school car park—have not been alleged to involve or implicate you. The schedule of her offences has played no part in my consideration of sentence. Your conviction is judged on its unique factual basis and not by association. Similarly, a prior investigation into the affairs of your estranged brother, who was convicted last year of benefit fraud in a wholly unrelated matter, has no bearing whatsoever on these sentencing remarks. Turning now to the facts of your case as they have been established through prosecution evidence, defence submissions, and the agreed record of admissions: Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. It is apparent from the victim statements, CCTV, and subsequent admissions in your interview that a series of thefts employed a variety of methods—ranging from the calculated use of “distraction” during till openings to the more basic, opportunistic seizures of goods during shift handovers or at points of customer congestion at self-service checkout bays. You did not threaten violence, carry any weapon, or verbally abuse staff; the offence was completed in silence and with a degree of cool deliberation. Nonetheless, the impact on staff morale and customer security was substantial, albeit indirect. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. Of particular note is the repeated selection of high-value consumer goods—most frequently, over-the-counter medicines, small electronics, and branded toiletries—in quantities exceeding personal consumption or impulse. On at least two occasions, the prosecution asserts, you altered your method of egress: using the fire exit on one occasion to avoid detection and, on another, brazenly walking past security after diverting their attention with a false report of a spillage. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. The Crown’s case has proceeded in tandem with a community impact statement submitted by the Stratford Retail Network on 29 April, aptly summarising the effect of persistent theft on local business resilience and highlighting the extent to which frequent, minor criminal incursions lead to more restrictive trading hours and increased insurance premiums. While these statements are routinely provided, their content in this instance was unusually detailed; the anecdote furnished by the manager of DCS Newsagents—who reported that, last Christmas, their stock of greeting cards was “almost entirely removed” in three consecutive days by an unidentified group—is illustrative of the demoralisation felt across the sector. That series of incidents, while unrelated to the conduct before me, is emblematic of the environment in which your offences unfolded. I am, further, obliged to recognise the professional insight provided by Dr Nash in her psychiatric report of 17 July 2025. Dr Nash describes your presentation as indicative of complex trauma, compounded by a persistent but currently unmedicated depressive disorder. You reported to her a history of transient accommodation, estrangement from family, and a pattern of social withdrawal punctuated by periods of impulsivity. It is the finding of Dr Nash that, although you do not meet the diagnostic threshold for psychosis or personality disorder, your cognitive profile is marked by poor executive functioning and a tendency toward risk-taking in the context of acute stress. Mr H used a question about Oyster Card transactions to divert the shopkeeper’s attention, then leaned over the counter to take a displayed item. Let it be said, however, that the mere presence of subjective difficulties—be they psychological, financial, or social—cannot justify offending. Dr Nash identifies multiple missed opportunities for you to engage with community mental health teams and to benefit from social prescribing. Far from demonstrating an inability to refrain, your conduct suggests a pattern of calculated decision-making. This court is no stranger to the argument that “need” should mitigate guilt or inclination. While hardship can explain, it cannot exculpate. The pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Finn of the Stratford Probation Service, dated 31 July, notes your prior engagements with probation as “irregular” and “inconsistent,” with multiple instances of missed appointments. Ms Finn records your stated intention to seek employment but notes a “failure to attend Jobcentre appointments or to maintain contact with Work Coach assignments.” I am not satisfied that your engagement with available support has been sufficient to demonstrate true motivation to rehabilitate. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. I am told you have lived in a series of short-term lets in the Stratford, Hackney Wick, and Plaistow areas. Reference is made to you having applied for housing support with the council in 2022, but with your placement withdrawn due to repeated breaches of tenancy/licence conditions—this is, according to the housing officer’s correspondence, a matter of non-compliance with the basic rules, not a consequence of discrimination or bureaucratic error. Housing instability is certainly a risk factor for anti-social and acquisitive offending. I do not underestimate its gravity, but many navigate those challenges without recourse to criminal conduct. The court has also reviewed the character reference submitted by your former employer at Regal Cleaning Services, Mr K Dempsey, who wrote with evident disappointment but a measure of sympathy, recalling you as “punctual and polite” prior to the breakdown of your working relationship in 2023. In contrast, this account is not mirrored by any evidence of recent commitment to lawful earning or positive engagement with employment support schemes. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. Your letter to this court, submitted in your own handwriting and dated 20 July 2025, is noted for its legibility, careful composition, and apparent candour as to the pressures and motivations underpinning your recent behaviour. However, assertions made therein—blaming your estrangement from family and the “collapse of trust” with your social worker—are considered in the round with your prior opportunities to seek help, enter substance misuse recovery, and seek housing support. While empathy is due to those in hardship, the wider experience of this court is that adversity alone does not determine criminality. At this stage, I note the relevance—albeit tangential—of the Court of Appeal’s observations in R v Jory [2024] EWCA Crim 520, which concerned a defendant convicted of possession of indecent images of children, wholly unrelated to the present facts save that it involved examiner scrutiny of digital evidence files. The appellate court there reaffirmed the requirement for “robust procedural safeguards and clear documentation chains” in the handling of all digital disclosures. While the facts and sentencing considerations are of no material relevance to your own case, counsel for the defence cited Jory in support of a general submission regarding the preservation and audit of digital evidence in criminal litigation. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Among the numerous submissions made to the court prior to sentencing, I have reviewed the representations of the North London Citizens’ Debt and Housing Clinic, which has provided support in the form of budgeting advice and attempted, albeit without success, to engage you with their legal advice project regarding housing arrears. Letters from staff indicate sporadic attendance at appointments and a reluctance to follow up with signposted resources. You may be interested to know that the Clinic survives on a shoestring budget and has been subject to threats of closure on four occasions in as many years. Their continued efforts to assist you, despite such adversity, do credit to their professionalism if not, on this occasion, to your motivation for substantive change. The impact on the retail teams affected by your actions is further detailed in victim statements. Ms Katrin Karlsen, deputy manager at Willow Chemist, reported “persistent worrying” among evening staff and a decision to suspend stock of certain high value over-the-counter items during peak periods. This, alongside a voluntary capping of customer numbers at the request of staff, resulted in a temporary loss of sales for a ten-day period—though the shop was not forced to close outright. These indirect consequences are not trivial, nor are they inevitable in every instance of retail theft; the fact they occurred is a function of repeated disruption and the fear it fosters in otherwise routine work environments. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. I have also taken into account the recent Community Impact Assessment presented by the Borough Retail Crime Steering Panel, which, while referring primarily to an arson incident at a supermarket car park in Leytonstone in late 2023 (committed by persons unknown), frames your offending as a further contributory factor in rising community anxiety regarding retail vulnerability. While the arson is, for clarity, unrelated to the matter for sentence, the panel’s report offers useful context as to the wider consequences of persistent retail crime in an under-resourced policing environment. I am conscious of the need for proportionality in sentence, balancing deterrence, public protection, and the imperatives of rehabilitation. Your previous convictions consist of three matters of theft from shop premises—most recently, a 2022 community order imposed at Snaresbrook Magistrates’ Court for theft of toiletries—and a series of non-criminal penalty notices for fare evasion and anti-social behaviour between 2020 and 2023. There are no convictions for violence, burglary, or robbery. While some aggravation attends by reason of repetition, there is no evidence of escalation to threatening or serious violence. No known gang association or evidence of control by third parties—features that might bear on risk assessment and criminal capacity—have been asserted by the prosecution or the police in the instant matter. Reflections on the evolution of sentencing practice are unavoidable. It is now a matter of ordinary discourse—reflected in letters to the court from local councillors, the Chamber of Commerce, and the East London Small Business Federation—that there is an increasing expectation for heavy custodial sentences in cases of serial shoplifting. Such calls are always noted, but the function of the court is not to satisfy public pressure nor to administer “signal justice” for the sake of appearance. As reemphasised in R v Cairns [2020] EWCA Crim 2102, the Court of Appeal soundly rejected the notion that courts should “escalate” penalties simply to “send a message,” instead directing that all sentences must remain individually just and proportionate, grounded in the facts. Resources for offender management, I do not need to remind probation, are presently stretched to their thinnest in modern memory. The report from the Chief Inspector of Probation—published earlier this year—identified excessive workloads, delayed supervision appointments, and the “chronic attrition of skilled staff” as material constraints upon the effective delivery of community sentences. These are, sadly, features of the wider landscape within which your prospects of rehabilitation must be gauged. They do not lessen your personal responsibility or excuse continued recidivism, but they do complicate the assessment of whether robust community alternatives to imprisonment remain genuinely available. To summarise: I must sentence you for a repeated course of shoplifting, marked by selectivity of target, opportunistic (yet sometimes calculated) method, and an absence of violence or overt threat. The persistent evasion of available support services; the modest but real impact upon affected staff and businesses; and your continuing precariousness of housing and employment all inform the overall risk and need assessment. In light of the seriousness of the offending, its persistent nature, and the limited evidence of recent engagement with rehabilitative services, I direct that a full pre-sentence report be prepared by Stratford Probation Service. This report shall specifically address the suitability of a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement (RAR), the prospect for inclusion in a Cognitive Skills Programme, and an assessment of whether an Unpaid Work Requirement or a Suspended Sentence Order might advance the aims of public protection and rehabilitation, having regard to your mental health background and housing status. I will not close off the prospect of a custodial sentence, but all realistic options are to be canvassed. The probation report shall further review the prospect of voluntary sector partnership support and any relevant recent changes to your personal circumstances not previously drawn to the court’s attention. The matter is adjourned for sentencing to 25 September 2025. In the interim, you will remain on bail subject to the same conditions. You are advised of your right to appeal and to consult counsel upon receipt of any custodial sentence. Costs are reserved. No reporting restrictions are imposed. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BEXLEYHEATH R v. MR H Case No. Q2025/14492 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. S. BAINES Filed: 21 July 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your guilty plea to a single count of shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, committed on 3 April 2025, as well as for the consideration of relevant associated matters set forth in ancillary evidence and representations from both the Crown and the defence. The proceedings have unfolded in open session of this court, all parties represented, and with a full opportunity to adduce mitigation and context through the proper channels. I commence by outlining the procedural course of these proceedings, which, though prompted by what some might regard as a routine charge, have traversed a terrain both familiar and instructive in terms of contemporary criminal practice and the strains now commonly faced at every level of the system. You were first arrested on the evening of 4 April 2025, following identification by store security and subsequent attendance of Metropolitan Police South East Division officers at the premises. An initial police interview occurred on 5 April 2025 at Sidcup Police Station, under caution and with an accredited solicitor in attendance, during which you gave a largely “no comment” account, save for a brief interjection regarding your explanation for being present at the scene. Your charge was formally laid on 6 April 2025 and subsequent bail was granted with standard conditions: not to enter the premises in question, to report fortnightly to the local police station, and to attend all scheduled hearings. It would be remiss not to note, as has become almost habitual in such cases, the time and administrative cost incurred in processing what—at first blush—might be classed as minor offending. That cost is borne across the criminal justice landscape, from the reallocation of patrol hours to the fracturing of already stretched police and community liaison resources. Following initial remand to appear at the Bexley Magistrates’ Court, the matter was sent to the Crown Court on 13 May 2025, on account of aggravating features—namely, the repetitive nature of the alleged behaviour and the context provided by prior history. I am grateful to Ms Teresa Windsor, appearing for the Crown Prosecution Service, for her careful submissions in relation to charge selection, and to Mr Haroon Khalil of the duty defence panel, whose written representations were submitted on 26 May 2025. The court is also in receipt of correspondence from the Retail and Small Business Advocacy Network, offering insight into the broader community impact. Listing delays during the initial phase were occasioned by the rolling Court Service industrial action affecting non-urgent hearings in the South East region, as well as by the delayed provision of key disclosure items—specifically, the retrieval of digital evidence and the need for supplementary statements from at least two civilian witnesses who had since left the employment of the relevant retailer. The logistic and administrative quagmire that now encumbers the smooth running of even the least complex of cases warrants repeat commentary. It should not be necessary to reiterate that the act of obtaining CCTV footage, even in an age of ubiquitous surveillance, remains encumbered by technical failures, privacy redactions, time-stamp discrepancies, and attenuated chains of evidence. It is germane, in so far as it pertains to the present proceedings, to record the court’s appreciation for the technical unit at the New Eltham Forensic Media Facility, whose diligence in transcribing both visual footage and audio logs unavoidably postponed the readiness of case files until mid-June 2025. The local partnership between council officers, neighbourhood policing, and community crime prevention workers—with specific emphasis on the Bexley Retail Resilience Forum—was activated in response to a spate of offences in the locality. While such a response is, on paper, designed to expedite intelligence sharing and the drafting of impact assessments, the reality is that variations in data compatibility and shifting institutional priorities frequently render real-time collaboration elusive. The case was listed for plea on 1 July 2025. At that hearing, Mr H, you entered a guilty plea at the first realistic opportunity following the service of the prosecution’s bundle containing critical evidential items. The court records that plea and will extend appropriate credit in accordance with the Sentencing Council’s Defendants Pleading Guilty guideline. Nevertheless, the court would be remiss to refrain from observing, as set out in R v Barham [2022] EWCA Crim 1095 (notably a case concerning conspiracy to rob involving significant violence towards a taxi driver), that the timing of a plea is not a matter of mere procedure but a reflection of responsibility—a matter to which I shall return when considering personal mitigation. The facts of the instant case are as follows: Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. Turning from the particulars to broader context, it is apposite to note that this court’s caseload over the past twelve months has seen a marked increase in the proportion of retail thefts attributed, in procedural papers, to causes spanning economic hardship, substance misuse, and systematic underemployment. While these factors do not in themselves serve to exculpate, their routine citation ought to give policymakers pause. As remarked upon in R v Tamblin [2024] EWCA Crim 287—a matter involving persistent takeaway delivery fraud, theft, and insurance deception by a group of co-defendants (one of whom was subsequently charged with affray following an unrelated nightclub incident)—the intersection between economic strain and calculated dishonesty remains complex but hardly exonerating. You were observed on the date in question approaching the self-scan aisle while carrying two separate bags, positioning yourself so as to obscure direct sightlines with staff members. The store in question, an independent cooperative, has, regrettably, been the repeated subject of similar incidents in the past three years, necessitating extended hours for security staffing and the installation of additional deterrence measures. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. It is also necessary, at this juncture, to address certain aspects of community impact. The proactive submission to the court by the Bexley Small Traders Collective, as well as a statement from Ms Ivana Novak (franchise operator of the shop involved), underscores the erosion of confidence suffered by proprietors and frontline staff. Ms Novak describes a “chronic wariness” now afflicting evening shifts, particularly for junior staff and those working alone. This is not, I observe, a phenomenon restricted to large corporate entities. It is, rather, the cumulative attrition of trust and safety in environments once presumed to be the benign social heart of their neighbourhoods. I am in receipt of the pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Lindsay Thorpe, Senior Probation Officer, whose concise and forthright assessment I accept as professionally measured. Ms Thorpe notes that you are a 34-year-old male, currently residing in supported accommodation provided by Bexley Supported Living Trust. Employment has been sporadic, limited primarily to short-term agency cleaning positions and delivery work. You report that your finances have remained unstable since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, compounded by the cessation of Universal Credit advance payment streams. I further note your acknowledgment of persistent anxiety symptoms, correlating episodically with patterns of unstructured daily routine and periods of social withdrawal. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. You deny current problematic substance use, although you admit to heavy drinking in the weeks preceding the incident. The court is aware that many who come before it do so against a backdrop of longstanding dependence, often inadequately addressed by statutory services. It must also be said, with due candour, that the court can only form its assessment on the basis of evidence presented, not speculation. The court is also in possession of a psychiatric report prepared at the direction of the defence by Dr Osian Wallace, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist (Charlton Clinic). The report concludes that you present with features “consistent with mild depressive disorder and generalised anxiety, presently managed without pharmacological intervention.” The report is notable for its absence of any formal diagnosis of enduring psychotic illness or personality disorder, but remarks upon a tendency for “episodic impulsivity and compromised executive functioning, likely exacerbated by stressors of unemployment and housing instability.” That, in the opinion of Dr Wallace, may “contribute to a risk of re-offending if not adequately addressed through structured community intervention.” It is noted, as an administrative digression, that the court’s ability to commission timely psychiatric reports—particularly from NHS practitioners—has been diminished in the wake of recent service reorganisation and widespread shortages in forensic psychiatric availability. The matter of legal aid for such instruction was, on this occasion, protracted by the need for three rounds of supplementary engagement with the LAA, ultimately resolved only after persistent advocacy by Mr Khalil. This is an increasingly familiar—albeit unwelcome—pattern at this court. The present case forms yet another data point within an already grim trendline. The legal framework for sentencing in shoplifting cases of this kind is set out in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline, which applies an evaluative approach to harm and culpability, calibrated by factors such as value, impact upon staff, degree of planning, and the presence (or absence) of aggravating features such as use of threats or distraction. It is necessary to reiterate: the presence of a weapon, direct threats, or violence would be an escalator in seriousness, but in this instance, none are alleged. Instead, harm arises primarily by the repeat nature of the conduct, the targeting of a community-centred retailer, and the effect upon morale and perceived safety. In this context, the court is mindful of the Court of Appeal’s approach in R v Newman [2023] EWCA Crim 853, in which the defendant, Mr Newman, was convicted of multiple offences arising from a prolonged series of shop thefts—a matter that spiralled into associated charges of common assault and possession of a bladed article during a separate, later incident involving a city-centre off-licence. That context, while illuminating as to escalation risks, does not bear directly on the instant matter, which remains at the level of acquisitive offending alone. Mr H used a question about Oyster Card transactions to divert the shopkeeper’s attention, then leaned over the counter to take a displayed item. In considering aggravating and mitigating factors, the court is further directed to the guidance in R v Bartholomew [2021] EWCA Crim 1020, which concerned the deliberate targeting of small businesses by a defendant who feigned illness to distract staff and secure the theft of high-value electronic items. Though Mr Bartholomew’s case resulted in a custodial term of 32 months—arising, inter alia, from the defendant’s prior conviction for armed robbery and evidence of recruitment of a minor as accomplice—the strict legal principles circumstancing shop theft remain applicable, namely that the degree of planning, repeat victim targeting, and residual impact upon community confidence are all relevant. The court abstractly notes, as is made explicit in the Sentencing Council’s guideline foreword: “The monetary value, while a material consideration, is subordinate to the effect upon those targeted; theft from small, locally operated stores is recognised as being especially injurious by reason of the community function such premises serve.” The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that no violence or threat thereof occurred in your case is mitigating, and there are no aggravating features of group offending, weapons, or other forms of escalation as seen in recent local cases of concern. Reference is made to the community impact statement lodged by the Bexley Safer Neighbourhood Board, which asserts that “repeated low-value shop theft serves as a bellwether for wider disintegration in community trust and staff security.” This court is familiar with such assertions, many of which are confirmed by regular quarterly reviews of incident reports and the increasing expenditure on security infrastructure by formerly “open-door” community premises. It is perhaps instructive, albeit tangentially, to acknowledge the findings of the criminal intelligence review conducted by Ms Harriet Baines (Bexley Public Protection Partnership, April 2024), which identified a clustering of retail crime in the district adjacent to the Bexleyheath Broadway. That study, while primarily statistical, referenced a spike in low-level thefts correlating with closures or relocations of chain retailers—phenomena attributed more to macroeconomic than criminal factors. The review offered a number of recommendations for target-hardening and prioritised police presence, but records little evidence of substantial inter-agency resource augmentation. I wish to record the court’s appreciation for the assistance provided by Ms Chloe Underwood and the staff of Outreach Connect, a voluntary sector organisation furnishing housing assistance and benefits advice. Ms Underwood’s letter highlights your intermittent but sincere engagement with support services, albeit undermined by periods of disengagement and reluctance to attend scheduled sessions on a consistent basis. While such behaviour is regrettably common among persons experiencing housing instability, effort to persist in engagement is not without merit. I am further in receipt of a brief but lucid reference from Dr Malcolm Thurston, acting as your GP since December 2022, who attests to a historical pattern of non-attendance at medical reviews and sporadic prescriptions for mild anxiety and sleep disturbance. There is no history of severe psychiatric disorder or referral to crisis mental health services. The medical record, in this respect, is largely unremarkable, save for a brief episode in mid-2023 following loss of employment and a short period of rough sleeping in the Erith area. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. Turning to your antecedents, the court notes four prior convictions: two for minor non-dwelling theft, one for attempted shoplifting (community resolution, 2022), and a single caution for possession of cannabis in a social setting (unrelated to the instant facts). There are no convictions for violence, dishonesty outside retail premises, or offences against the person. It is unnecessary to dwell on cases such as R v Moughty [2018] EWCA Crim 922—where the defendant, co-charged with burglary of a private dwelling and found in possession of an imitation firearm, received a lengthy custodial sentence—other than to observe that the present matter lies at the lower end of both harm and culpability as statutorily defined. Defence mitigation is well made. Mr Khalil, in his thorough and measured oral address, urges the court to accord substantial weight to the acknowledged difficulties with unstable housing, interrupted employment, and adverse mental health. The court accepts that these are real and continuing challenges, though they do not of themselves absolve personal responsibility. The pre-sentence report is clear: you have not accessed all support offered to you, but there is evidence of recent effort—specifically, attendance at financial management workshops and intermittent participation in a peer support group for those in precarious housing. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. A further letter, tendered by your sister Ms Edwina H., expresses both concern for your welfare and a willingness to offer temporary accommodation subject to the imposition and enforcement of structured conditions as part of any sentence. The Local Authority’s Adult Social Care Team has provided a safeguarding risk assessment, which, though preliminary, records no findings of capacity impairment, exploitation, or vulnerability beyond that occasioned by housing instability and low mood. The Local Authority is prepared, in the event of a community-based disposal, to secure temporary place within a supported accommodation scheme, subject to necessary checks and your continued engagement with statutory obligations. It is also worth setting the present case against the backdrop of wider criminal justice trends. The better part of two decades spent sentencing acquisitive offending has seen the gradual but unmistakable drift towards greater reliance on community intervention, as opposed to short custodial sentences—an evolution driven in part by the weight of evidence documenting poor rehabilitative outcomes following brief terms of imprisonment. This view finds support, albeit obliquely, in the observations of the House of Commons Justice Committee (Select Report on Reoffending, February 2025), which underscored a “critical need for intervention at points of social disintegration rather than criminal escalation.” The Committee, incidentally, commented upon several high-profile cases of recidivism arising from insufficient post-release supervision—one such case involving the now notorious “Superstore Gang,” whose ringleader, Mr Robin Manners, became the subject of an aggravated burglary charge following an early release on parole from an 18-month custodial sentence for commercial shop theft. Though of no factual relevance to the instant matter, these developments inform the task of weighing general risk against individual pathways to rehabilitation. In reviewing agencies’ efforts, I wish to place on record the court’s commendation for the Bexley Youth Hub and the South Thames Resettlement Partnership, who—despite considerable funding constraints and persistent staff turnover—have continued to provide appropriate guidance and practical support to those at risk of repeat offending. Their resilience, measured not in output but in perseverance against an ever-rising tide of demand, is deserving of recognition. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. It is also of some moment to remark that, while the court is sometimes pressed with cases of co-defendants or group offending, no such feature arises here. The sophistication often observed with “distraction crews” or those employing systematic “bag and dash” techniques to overwhelm store security is absent. You acted alone and without recourse to violence. There is in the court’s file an anonymised impact assessment from the Retail Loss Prevention Board, survey date April 2024, detailing the increasing prevalence of shopfloor staff reduction in response to loss, as well as the adaptation of “gatekeeper” policies by formerly open-access stores. While this survey is largely statistical, and its findings not unique to this borough, it provides a chilling sightline into the gradual withdrawal of retail sector goodwill and the social compact it once embodied. I am keenly aware, as would be any sentencer reading contemporary output from academic criminology and social policy reviews, of the ongoing debate regarding the supposed cyclical relationship between poverty, exclusion, and offending. While it is not the function of the Crown Court to settle such matters, the court is bound to account for structural disadvantage only so far as it explains, not excuses, proven criminal conduct. Having weighed the evidence and submissions, I am of the view that this offending lies within Category 3 of the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline, with medium culpability (on account of the planning and repeat targeting) and low to medium harm (reflecting staff impact, remedial costs, and community context). The late but significant engagement with support services and the early guilty plea are relevant mitigating factors. There remains, however, the persistent risk attendant to unresolved housing and employment needs—a risk most acute where previous interventions have failed to produce lasting behavioural change. Accordingly, the most proportionate disposal may well be a community-based order with a specified rehabilitation activity requirement, combined with targeted supervision and a review mechanism to ensure compliance. The court is, however, not disposed to sentence today without the benefit of a full and up-to-date pre-sentence report. I therefore adjourn sentencing to mid-August 2025, with directions to the Probation Service to provide a focused assessment addressing: (a) the suitability of a mental health treatment requirement; (b) the practicality of engagement with structured work or training; and (c) the availability and relevance of ongoing supported accommodation or family-based alternatives. Any breach of bail conditions prior to sentencing will, of course, necessitate immediate reconsideration of remand status. The defendant is reminded of the continuing duty to cooperate with all appointments arranged by the Probation Service and any recommended support agency. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 21 July 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bexleyheath. Proceedings are recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules and will be made available for transcription. The defendant is advised of his right to seek leave to appeal within 28 days under the provisions of section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No restrictions as to reporting are engaged. The matter stands adjourned for sentence to the next available date following provision of the pre-sentence report. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT PARKLAND R v. MR H Case No. D2025/91620 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. R. FAULKNER Filed: 16 May 2025 Mr H, you now appear before this court for sentencing in respect of a charge brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely, shop theft, said to have occurred over a sustained period and in a pattern giving rise to public concern and significant impact upon the commercial and neighbourhood fabric of this jurisdiction. You entered a guilty plea at the pre-trial preparation hearing held on 12 March 2025. The court records at the outset the formal thanks due to Ms Stephanie Yan for the Crown and to Mr Daniel K. Corbett for the defence, who appears for you under a Legal Aid representation order. I further record with appreciation the professional input of the case progression officer Ms Padma Roy and the administrative team of this court, whose perseverance amid chronic listing backlog ensured this matter did not founder amongst the pressures so familiar to this circuit. By way of procedural history, the present indictment was preferred by way of written charge on 2 February 2025, following an application by the Crown for the consolidation of three earlier sets of summary proceedings. The committal to Crown Court was made under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, reflecting both the value and pattern of alleged offending, as well as the defendant’s antecedents, which the Crown contended amounted to a course of conduct. The matter was originally listed on 19 February for a plea and trial preparation hearing, but postponed following a joint request to enable the instruction of a psychiatric report and subsequent application for adjustments to ground rules in light of the preliminary findings. No fewer than four dates were vacated due to the unavailability of psychiatric personnel, a matter which, though routine in context, the court deems unsatisfactory and wishes to record in the hope that future funding settlement might address these recurrent supply shortfalls. On each occasion it fell to the defence to submit further queries to the relevant authority, the Forensic Psychiatry Liaison Unit, based at Eaglecombe NHS Trust, seeking clarification as to both the cognitive vulnerability identified at initial assessment and the relationship (if any) to the defendant’s very considerable record for offences of dishonesty. This led, in turn, to secondary delay owing to systemic restructuring at the Trust: a new pathway administrator was appointed mid-March and a further round of document exchange ensued. The court is aware — perhaps uncomfortably so — that such administrative and systemic obstacles increasingly threaten the timely disposal of even the most clear-cut matters. While it is not for the bench to apportion blame, there is a manifest tension between the justice system’s need for swift, final adjudication and the stark resource constraints afflicting all agencies now tasked with providing assessment and intervention. Turning to the conduct before the court: The Crown have outlined a series of incidents, occurring across the period October 2024 to January 2025, each involving theft from retail premises of varying size and character. These locations include both national grocery chains and independent businesses, as reflected in the evidence bundle provided. I note at the outset that the court is in receipt of five victim impact statements, one of which was provided with the assistance of an interpreter and a further two with the assistance of the Retail Harm Victim Support Service, whose representative, Ms Charlene Jin, is thanked for her sensitive and detailed accounts. As has become increasingly evident, these cases strain not merely the patience of individual store managers but erode the fabric of communal retail life in urban and peri-urban districts. The impact is not measured simply by the value of stock removed but by the cumulative corrosive consequence — on staff morale, on small businesses’ operational viability, and on the willingness of law-abiding citizens to enter and participate in their local public spaces. There are few, if any, truly “victimless” crimes; offences such as these seldom incur headline loss, but their steady repetition saps the vitality and confidence that bind communities. The court would, before turning to the detailed narrative, pause to observe the context of the criminal justice response in acquisitive crime, particularly shoplifting, as it has evolved in recent times. It is now commonplace for charges under section 1 of the Theft Act to originate not via traditional beat policing, but from the collaborative frameworks established under the Business Crime Reduction Partnership model (“BCRP”). While these initiatives often claim a streamlined and evidence-based approach, the reality, as evidenced in this matter, remains patchy. The present case records a sequence of delays and omissions in basic data-sharing, not least a missing incident log from 8 November which was, by all accounts, misfiled following a systems migration within Acorn Retail Group. Such lapses, and their eventual correction, are more a product of determined individuals than systemic robustness. The court has considered analogous authority, among which I cite R v. Chalmers [2021] EWCA Crim 317. Chalmers engaged the appellate court’s scrutiny after a spate of thefts from charity shops in the North Ridge district, with the defendant entering multiple guilty pleas only days ahead of trial. Though the value of items abstracted was low, the court of appeal affirmed the sentencing judge’s decision to treat the sustained and targeted nature of offending — as well as its impact on staff — as aggravating features. An immediate custodial term was imposed, tempered by credit for plea. While the present case differs factually, the central doctrine is apposite: the frequency and persistence of offending may outweigh the modesty of individual losses when considering harm and culpability. In reflecting upon sentencing principles, it is also timely to recall R v. Nadeem [2023] EWCA Crim 411, which involved a case of aggravated burglary with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, arising from a night-time forced entry to a family dwelling, occupants being restrained, and a substantial quantity of jewellery removed. There, the trial judge imposed an extended sentence for public protection, citing both the use of weapons and evidence of sustained threats to the residents’ young children. The appellate court, by majority, found that the facts — involving deliberate selection of a vulnerable property, pre-planning, and psychological harm beyond the confines of the original dwelling — justified the sentence. The point to stress is, of course, that the factors engaged in Nadeem are of a qualitatively different order to the present. Nonetheless, the decision underscores the principle that loss of trust and perceived safety generated by even “non-violent” offences may, in certain contexts, constitute grave harm. The present case, brought forward by the Crown, rests upon a sequence of discrete but similar events, each pertaining to the appropriation of goods from retail environments, with a focus upon the impact of repeat and targeted loss. I have considered with care the written and orally advanced submissions of both counsel. It is to be understood that this court is not in any sense constrained by the severity or configuration of antecedent case law; it must sentence according to the individual facts, as proven, and having due regard to the welfare of the public and the rehabilitation of the offender. At this juncture, I turn to the factual particulars as advanced in the prosecution’s opening and now substantially admitted by your plea. The relevant chronology is as follows: Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. The evidence with respect to the above incident was assembled from no fewer than three independent CCTV sources, cross-referenced against both transaction logs and witness recall statements. While there were apparent discrepancies in the time signatures of the digital records — a reflection of poor store-level maintenance of recording equipment — these were ultimately resolved by the diligent work of PC Alan R. Whiting (Parkland Southshire Neighbourhood Team), for which the court expresses gratitude. As to the further incident at the Heart of Eden Shopping Arcade, dated 14 November 2024, the Crown relied upon still photographic images, store security logs, and contemporaneous witness recall notes, as well as subsequent digital forensics on a mobile device later found to be registered to your name. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. It must be noted, for completeness, that the Crown, in their opening, made reference to a separate and unrelated incident occurring at the neighbouring Cafe Consulate, in which an individual — admittedly a co-defendant in related summary proceedings — was charged with affray following an altercation involving a broken bottle, threats shouted at bystanders and the subsequent involvement of canine units. For the avoidance of doubt, that matter forms no part of your offending and is not before this court. It is nonetheless a useful illustration of the complexities now besetting urban commercial hubs, where the lines between different forms of disorder may become blurred in the public imagination. I am also compelled, in the interests of transparency, to record that sentencing was originally scheduled for 1 May 2025 in Courtroom 5, but was vacated due to emergency closure of the entire Parkland Court complex following a minor electrical fire in the main corridor, which damaged security hardware and necessitated the evacuation of all parties. The resultant backlog was addressed only on 10 May 2025 when circuit sittings were resumed. The court acknowledges the exemplary conduct of the maintenance staff and commends the swift remedial action by the fire service, who limited the spread of damage. As to your own background: The court has been provided with an up-to-date antecedent history evidencing not fewer than six prior convictions for offences of dishonesty, covering a spectrum from shop theft to attempted fraud by false representation, dating back to 2014. The majority of these attracted non-custodial sentences, including conditional discharges and community orders, the latter with an unpaid work requirement. The records also indicate unsuccessful completion of a “Brighter Horizons” Pathways to Work programme, with non-attendance logged on five occasions and a final discharge for non-compliance. These persistent failures of engagement weigh against any claim that your present offending is the result of isolated hardship. In addition, the court is cognisant of the detailed psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr Elsa M. Beattie, consultant psychiatrist, and filed pursuant to direction on 31 March 2025. Dr Beattie observes that while you exhibit certain patterns of impulsivity and poor consequential thinking, there is no evidence of a major psychiatric disorder. Substance misuse, described as “episodic and moderate,” is acknowledged as a minor contributing factor but is not, per her report, the primary driver of offending. Importantly, the report references “chronically unstable social circumstances” and notes a significant episode of rough sleeping in the period preceding the index offences. It is not unusual for courts to receive submissions highlighting the role of adverse social circumstances in the commission of low-level, repeat acquisitive offending; the popularity of trauma-informed practice in the probation and criminal justice sphere is now such that, in many reports, the language of “adverse childhood experiences” is near ubiquitous. While that trend signifies welcome recognition of context, the court is nonetheless bound to reaffirm that such adversity — while explanatory in part — does not negate responsibility for conduct. The probation pre-sentence assessment, submitted by Mr Dominic Yew and received by this court on 7 May 2025, provides a summary of your engagement with social and community support services. The report notes sporadic engagement with Northlake Food Access Project, a single recorded session with CreditCare Advice, and evidence of one instance of self-referral to the Parkland Pathways project (no outcome achieved). No evidence is available to suggest ongoing, meaningful engagement with specialist drug or alcohol services during the relevant period. Your accommodation status is irregular; the report notes transitional occupancy in Hatherlow Homeless Support Hostel from October to December 2024, with subsequent sofa-surfing arrangements and a specific episode of sleeping rough during Christmas week. An application for supported housing remains outstanding; there are references to non-attendance at three separate housing advice meetings. It is appropriate at this point to reflect on the wider environment in which such offending arises. The court cannot but note the acute strain currently placed upon local authority statutory homelessness services, with particular reference to the now well-publicised reduction in temporary accommodation stock following the withdrawal of two major private sector landlords from the Northshire Council framework. The resulting increase in use of bed-and-breakfast placements, often far removed from support networks, is a concern frequently raised in both policy literature and community-based victim impact reporting. The records disclose, as a matter of background, that in April 2023 the local authority referred you to the Thames Recovery Project, a multi-agency panel designed to coordinate support for those at risk of repeat offending. That referral lapsed following three missed appointments — an occurrence attributed in the documentation variously to “conflicting work trials,” “no phone credit,” and “unexpected family bereavement.” Engaged professionals, such as Ms Elspeth Gray of the aforementioned Project, have offered further comment to the effect that while multiple referral pathways exist in theory, in practice the churn of personnel, limited funding, and isolation of clients in geographically dispersed placements renders consistent progress extremely difficult. The court also records a submission from the Retail Support Network, a sector group representing independent businesses, highlighting both the financial and psychological harm of persistent shop theft. The chairperson’s letter, received 24 April, refers to increased insurance premiums, store closures, and a growing reluctance among smaller traders to report offences owing to perceived ineffectiveness — and, more acutely, fears of retaliation. The court finds this submission instructive as to the wider harm and commends the authors’ measured and practical recommendations. I note, in this context, the court’s continuing frustration with the administrative failings of the Legal Aid Agency, which yet again resulted in avoidable delay to expert instruction. The defence solicitor, Ms Annette Lo, is expressly commended for her diligence in making repeated representations to the Agency, eventually securing authorisation for psychiatric assessment following no fewer than four chasers and an appeal to the senior casework manager. This is not a trivial irritation; absence of prompt expert input compromises the ability of this court to fairly assess both culpability and the need for sentencer intervention. Delay in Legal Aid processing, driven by over-bureaucratisation and an apparent culture of risk aversion, is now routinely cited in the professional press and within this courtroom as a significant obstacle to effective justice. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences, updated July 2023, provides that in cases where the defendant exhibits a pattern of repeat offending, multiple victims, targeting of vulnerable business or commercial premises, or deliberate exploitation of public trust, sentencing courts are entitled (and indeed required) to place such conduct within the elevated culpability and harm brackets. It is further observed that personal mitigation — including lack of stable accommodation, employment hardship, or fluctuating mental health — should be carefully weighed but must not eclipse the primary objectives of public protection, deterrence, and reparation. The guidelines further illustrate that early guilty pleas attract the highest level of credit, typically up to one third, but that this credit diminishes where a plea is not entered at the earliest practicable opportunity. In this matter, the plea was entered prior to the fixing of a trial date and after the exchange of substantial prosecution evidence but before further pre-trial review. Accordingly, I propose to apply a credit in the region of 20%, in line with the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in R v. Grace [2019] EWCA Crim 2029, where it was held that “the evidentiary and victim convenience benefits to the justice system are not exhausted to the same degree by a plea entered at the final hour; the principle of efficiency is best served by timely acceptance of culpability.” Before moving to a recital of the substance of the admitted conduct, the court records that both parties have drawn attention to various items of case law. Among these, the defence has cited R v. Branwell [2022] EWCA Crim 1720, which stands as a useful reminder that personal circumstances, including mental health vulnerability and precarious housing, may weigh significantly in favour of a non-custodial outcome, provided that there exists a realistic plan for compliance and supervision in the community. It is, however, to be stressed that Branwell is fact-specific, involving a defendant who had undergone inpatient addiction treatment and demonstrated consistent engagement with community support over a six-month period — facts not replicated here. The prosecution, by contrast, has referred to R v. Sweeney [2023] EWCA Crim 1304, concerning the burglary of a private residence while the occupants were on holiday, with the court placing emphasis on the aggravating feature of targeting premises likely to be unoccupied, thus causing not only financial loss but particular psychological distress to the victims. That case further considered the effect of prior criminality on the calculation of starting point. For completeness, it is to be reiterated that the case before the court does not concern residential burglary, but these comparative authorities underscore that concepts of planning, victim vulnerability, and pattern of offending retain wide application across the spectrum of acquisitive crimes. With those preliminary points established, I turn now to delineate, in greater detail, the facts as accepted and admitted by your plea: On four separate visits within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same small shop and stole alcohol and tobacco products. In this incident, as with others, the approach was calculated. You made repeated non-purchase circuits of the display aisles, collated multiple small items into a branded promotional bag in full view of partially distracted staff, and departed at a brisk but unhurried pace. CCTV evidence revealed your facial features to be clearly identifiable, later matched with high confidence by an experienced video analyst from CentrePoint Forensic Solutions. Subsequent evidence, corroborated by the account of Mrs May-Ling Evans, the store supervisor on duty, and a written statement from Mr Tariq Jani, a customer present at the time, confirms the absence of overt aggression but records a “cool and practiced manner,” with implications for staff confidence and store morale. The court accepts, based on materials supplied, that this incident did not involve threats of violence or physical confrontation. Nonetheless, repeated exposure of staff to serial offending has a cumulative effect, as recognised in both guidance and case law. Victim impact statements refer to “heightened anxiety,” adjustments of staff rotas, and loss of confidence in the safety of the workplace. On the topic of public safety, it is to be noted that the court received, as part of routine disclosure, a record of arrest occurring on 27 January 2025 at the Riverside Shopping Precinct. During that operation, officers from the Parkland Southshire Team, acting under Operation Stablewatch (an ongoing initiative to counter acquisitive offending in retail corridors), detained a group of four individuals in connection with report of theft. Of these, one individual — unrelated to your current charges — was found to be in possession of a bladed article, contrary to section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. No such article was attributed to yourself and no charge of that nature arises from the present indictment. Nonetheless, this episode serves as a broader illustration of the risk environment now faced by those working in front-line retail. The prosecution and defence have also been at pains to clarify that material references to graffiti, criminal damage, or recent possession of Class C substances on the part of third parties at or near the scene, including the presence of Ms Georgia Willerton — separately charged — are not properly attributable to you. It is the task of the sentencing court to insulate its consideration from associative prejudice; your culpability relates squarely to your own conduct. In shaping the sentencing response, I am required to balance statutory aims — punishment, reform and rehabilitation, protection of the public, and making reparations to victims — as set out in section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Of particular note in this matter is the recurrent feature of both individual and systemic disengagement: your repeated failure to sustain engagement with support services is a regrettable but salient theme, and it is mirrored by the increasing failure of overstretched public and voluntary agencies to secure durable, person-centred outcomes for those at risk. I am also mindful of the obligation to avoid, so far as possible, criminalising poverty or the unlooked-for consequences of social dislocation. The court is not, however, entitled to elevate empathy above protection of the public, nor to lose sight of the steady attrition suffered by retail staff and communities as a result of such offending. Returning to the narrative sequence admitted on your plea, I cite the following further particulars: Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. The recording officer’s statement highlights the use of layered clothing and the selection of high-resale goods (toiletries, alcohol miniatures, and branded household batteries) as emblematic of an approach both pre-planned and commercially motivated. Further, I note from the evidence schedule an incident on 9 December 2024 at the Dulwich Retail Group, in which — though this forms no part of the criminal conduct before the court — a co-defendant, Mr Alasdair Vane, is recorded as having set fire to waste bins at the rear delivery entrance, leading to temporary closure of business and attendance by the local Fire and Rescue Service. No suggestion is made that you were present or involved. However, the inclusion of such incidents in the case bundle reflects, if nothing else, the culture of heightened vigilance and anxiety now permeating the retail environment. In considering the next incident described within the case papers: The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. In this matter, staff identified a pattern of repeated attendance during known slack periods, exploiting times of reduced supervision and deploying distraction techniques (asking for unavailable items, triggering multiple staff movements) to facilitate the offence. This further supports the Crown’s case as to “patterned behaviour.” It is to be further recorded that in this time period, the store experienced a concurrent series of vandalism offences mostly attributed to a group of juveniles later identified through community engagement with local schools. These matters are mentioned in passing in case evidence, but are not the subject of the current proceedings nor in any way connected to yourself. The probation report records, in respect of all admitted matters, that your actions demonstrate a high level of intentionality, planning, and disregard of warnings proffered by both retail staff and arresting officers. Specifically, Ms Taryne Nield, your probation officer at assessment, notes: “While Mr H presents as a polite and generally compliant individual at interview, his record illustrates a persistent pattern of offending despite reasonably generous opportunities to engage with rehabilitation and support schemes. The likelihood of further offences absent significant intervention is accordingly rated as high.” She further observes the cumulative impact on local business and repeats the concern, now widely echoed in the professional literature, that repeated theft, though seemingly low level, constitutes a pronounced risk to public wellbeing by accelerating retail withdrawal from at-risk districts. In the course of submissions, reference was made to a recently reported incident in which a council worker at the Northford Civic Centre was convicted of impersonating a police officer in relation to an unrelated fraud, involving the diversion of housing benefit resources through the creation of fictitious rental claims. While this episode has no relevance to your own case, it is illustrative of the general context of fragility and public concern that now frames the court’s approach to offending by those occupying trusted or semi-trusted roles in public or quasi-public service. Your own record, as already stated, demonstrates no violence or weapon use, and the Crown confirm that the entirety of the criminal conduct relied upon is non-aggravated in the technical sense. Moving to the further facts as admitted: The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. The inclusion within the bundle of reference to a wholly separate incident — criminal damage to church property wrought by an unknown individual during the relevant period, as noted in the Westfield Gazette — forms no part of the case against you and is to be disregarded. As the court brings together the strands of fact and context, it is pointedly aware that the criminal justice response to persistent “minor” offending cannot, over time, remain limited to admonishment or conditional diversion. The evidence before this court, corroborated by both professional and lay witnesses, demonstrates a settled pattern of dishonest conduct, a high level of planning and functional sophistication, and an ongoing risk both to commercial and community security. Further particulars of offence are documented in prosecution evidence as follows: On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. With each such incident, incremental yet real harm is visited upon retail staff, customers, and the durability of public trust in the routine functioning of neighbourhood commerce. The public safety dimension of this pattern is not speculative, but grounded in a clear trajectory of repeat conduct and a marked failure to even transiently desist following prior intervention. While no successful engagement with restorative justice or rehabilitation is documented in your history, the court nonetheless remains obliged to press for possible community-based interventions, consistent with national guidance on the reduction of reoffending. Your most recent history — as illuminated in the up-to-date probation assessment — contains no indication of co-offending or association with networks engaged in more serious forms of retail crime. The suggestion, made in defence mitigation, that criminality here is “purely opportunistic and not associated with a wider group” is noted and tentatively accepted, absent contrary evidence. I am mindful too of the general social and economic backdrop, particularly the declining efficacy of shop exclusion orders and the consequent adaptation of offender tactics (namely, the selection of target premises in areas with reduced private security presence and the use of face coverings configured to defeat facial recognition technology). The case before this court, while not at the most sophisticated end of the spectrum, does nonetheless engage with these broader themes. The final set of facts follows: Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. In considering the appropriate sentencing response, the court’s starting point is that a custodial sentence is plainly merited. The persistent and patterned nature of the conduct, the failure of both prior court intervention and community support routes, and the manifest harm to both victims and the public at large, all point to the necessity for a sentence that is both punitive and preventative. The mitigation available — early background hardship, periods of homelessness, lack of current substance dependence — is limited in either scope or practical effect, given the persistent refusal to engage with even basic assistance. Nevertheless, before determining the exact parameters of sentence, I direct the probation service to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report that addresses not only the conventional risk of reoffending but also the practical prospect of compliance with a community-based intervention, to include where appropriate a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, Unpaid Work Element, and the targeting of structured support services aimed at both financial management and employability. Any report should be structured in full accordance with current National Probation Service standards and should also explore, albeit briefly, the existence of any collateral obligations or restrictions arising from housing or civil family proceedings. In accordance with standard practice, sentencing is adjourned pending receipt and analysis of the said pre-sentence report, and for such further submissions as may be necessary in respect of mitigation or potential ancillary orders. The defendant is advised of his continuing right to seek legal advice and to present any further submissions of fact or mitigation by the time of the adjourned hearing. The proceedings are formally transcribed under the authority of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. These are the sentencing remarks of Her Honour Judge M. R. Faulkner, delivered this day, 16 May 2025, in Court 2 at the Crown Court at Parkland. Pursuant to section 174 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, reasons for sentence and analysis of all relevant materials are hereby recorded. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted in due course. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days of the date of sentencing. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved pending the outcome of sentencing. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MIDDLESBROUGH R v. MR H Case No. T2025/02365 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge RONA S. GALLAGHER Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for one count of theft from a shop, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The circumstances giving rise to your conviction are familiar but by no means inconsequential, involving behaviour that has both immediate and wider repercussions for the community, for local businesses, and for the social order upon which we all depend. Let me begin by reciting the procedural chronology that has brought us to today's hearing. The offence in question occurred on 15 April 2025, at the premises of a retail store situated on Parliament Road in Middlesbrough. Your subsequent arrest was effected by officers of the Cleveland Police at approximately 16:30 on the same day, following a call to police control from the store’s on-site security team. You were taken initially to the South Ayresome Custody Suite, where you were interviewed under caution the following morning, pursuant to Code C of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. It is necessary to record that there have been two prior adjournments in relation to the listing of this case. The original plea and trial preparation hearing was fixed in the Crown Court for 5 June. However, that hearing was vacated at the Crown's request on 2 June, because further CCTV material required collation and disclosure. I note that the StoreWatch Programme, under the auspices of the Middlesbrough Retailers’ Liaison Network, supplied a number of incident logs only after the initial hearing was vacated. The preparatory work involved cross-referencing four separate incident reports spanning a 38-day period, which, as is regrettably common, resulted in considerable delay. The hearing eventually proceeded on 17 July. That the matter could not be dispositioned at first instance is, regrettably, typical in such prosecutions. The burgeoning administrative weight carried by local police, retail partners, and case progression officers is hardly new, yet it is rendered no less burdensome by its frequency. In the period between the two preliminary hearings, I am informed that the defence experienced further difficulty in obtaining disclosure of the entirety of the store’s security video archives. These materials were, eventually, provided as large digital files, requiring review on equipment not provided within the standard Legal Aid provision. It is worth stating for the public record the court’s appreciation for the considerable patience shown by both counsel—Ms Natalie Winfield, who appears today for the Crown, and Ms Gabrielle O’Connell, who appears for the defence under a representation order. I turn briefly to the question of legal aid and administrative support. The delays caused by repeated requests for funding by the defence so as to instruct an independent psychologist are not the subject of direct judicial criticism in these remarks; nonetheless, it would be fanciful to deny the corrosive effect of such bureaucracy on the effective operation of the criminal justice system. The court received no fewer than four separate email notifications from the Legal Aid Agency between June and August, each requesting a marginally different form of justification for the proposed expenditure. It was not until 8 August that funding was finally granted, and the consequent expert report received in full only on 28 August. The procedural vacuum thereby created did justice no credit. This present case falls within a wider pattern of acquisitive offending in the borough of Middlesbrough. In line with national trends, the local force reports a 19% rise year-on-year in recorded retail theft, a figure broadly corroborated by the Home Office’s February 2025 Business Crime Statistics for North East subregions. The causative milieu for this uptick is, of course, complex: it emerges at the intersection of persistent deprivation, post-pandemic volatility in retail staffing, the proliferation of late-opening convenience stores, and resource shortages among neighbourhood policing teams. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge as well the strain imposed by the now-normal phenomenon of rolling store closures and consolidations among major retail chains. The role of the Participating Retailer Partnership (PRP) must be noted. On 20 April, the Partnership convened an extraordinary meeting of local shop managers—eleven in total —specifically to discuss repeated targeting of small-format retailers within the Southfield ward. The minutes of that meeting, included in the court papers, contain reference to a pattern of what the Association now deems “impact incidents,” that is, acts not simply of direct loss, but of intimidation or disruption which destabilise staff welfare, shift patterns or opening hours. It is a persistent lament—often repeated by those who have not had to prepare witness care schedules or organize hurried cover for nervous shop staff—that such offences are “low-level,” as though value alone were a complete index of harm. Shoplifting may seem minor in the eyes of the statisticians, but those on the frontline are acutely aware that the harm is not merely pecuniary, but social and psychological. The staff, often young or employed on insecure hours, bear a disproportionate share of disruption, distress, and sometimes, the residue of threat. It is instructive to recall the framework laid down by the Sentencing Council for theft offences, effective from 1 February 2016, which emphasises that “the impact on victims and the sense of violation experienced by staff is material, quite apart from the value of stolen goods.” The persistent targeting of small businesses or repeated entry after formal bans is a recognised aggravating factor, as is the psychological effect occasioned. That guidance has been reaffirmed most recently in the revised February 2023 published guideline. I have considered the submissions of the Crown in their entirety. It is of note that the prosecution relied on evidence supplied by the Safer Middlesbrough Partnership, whose community impact statement—that of Ms Claire Duxbury, Partnership Coordinator—describes “a rolling cycle of repeat thefts, resulting in store closures during certain hours and a measurable increase in staff turnover.” This court received a written statement from a store assistant who has since left employment at the site in question, citing both fear of confrontation and loss of confidence. Turning to the facts of the case as established in open court, having now reviewed the exhibits and considered the agreed narrative, I recite the following summary as relevant to sentence: Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. I must also address the circumstances surrounding your apprehension on 15 April. The store’s CCTV footage, enhanced by video analytics at the request of the StoreWatch Network, was instrumental in confirming your movements within the premises between 16:08 and 16:27. It is noted that you previously visited the same store on 24 March and 29 March, actions fully documented in incident reports submitted to the police but not prosecuted as discrete counts either for reasons of evidential sufficiency or prosecutorial discretion. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. The practical effect of your conduct, Mr H, extends beyond material loss. There has been clear evidence that the continued experience of repeated shoplifting has forced the store in question—like many others in the region—to reduce evening opening hours, restrict customer access, and review lone working arrangements for its staff. The Retailers’ Association, in their representations to this court, underscore that such changes are not cost-neutral; they involve both increased security expenditure and the erosion of the community role such shops have traditionally played. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. I also take account of the written submissions from the North-East Business Crime Forum and the Middlesbrough Victim Recovery Service. Each of those organisations has, in detailed correspondence, stressed the cumulative effect of ongoing acquisitive crime, not least in creating the “chilling effect” described in recent research by the University of Teesside’s Institute for Public Safety Studies. Before turning to sentence, I am obliged to canvass the wider social and policy context. There exist those who habitually conflate explanation with exculpation, arguing that deprivation, addiction, or mental health crises somehow strip individuals of responsibility. There is, undeniably, a kernel of truth in the recognition that crime does not occur in a vacuum. The North East region faces a higher-than-average rate of long-term economic inactivity, housing instability, and pronounced health inequalities. The council’s Social Inclusion Audit for 2024/25 makes sobering reading in this regard—household food insecurity up 15% year-on-year, a reported 31% of all adults in receipt of Universal Credit, and a rapid upsurge in presentations at emergency housing services. I am, of course, bound by law not sociological conjecture. But it would be disingenuous to pretend that the context is irrelevant to either cause or cure. Too often social collapse is allowed to masquerade as mere individual failing, and too often personal responsibility is crowded out by the language of “structural factors” or “trajectories of risk.” Both account for some part of the picture, but never the whole. In this context, I turn to the expert report provided by Dr Lawrence M. Forster, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, dated 28 August 2025. Dr Forster’s assessment, conducted in-person at HMP Holme House on 19 August and accompanied by a collateral interview with your keyworker at Foundations Supported Housing, concludes as follows: “Mr H demonstrates some symptoms consistent with an emotionally unstable personality structure, with attendant impulsivity and affective volatility. There is a mild substance misuse component—a pattern of intermittent amphetamine and cannabis use—but at a level falling below criteria for clinical substance dependence. Cognitive testing did not reveal deficits sufficient to impair decision-making capacity.” Dr Forster further observes that “the defendant’s engagement with therapeutic support in the community has been inconsistent, characterised by brief periods of participation in Talking Therapies, followed by non-attendance and disengagement.” I consider also the pre-sentence report authored by Probation Officer Ms L. White. Ms White’s appraisal is thorough, if somewhat gloomy in its prognosis. She notes a “pattern of transient accommodation, estrangement from primary family of origin, and limited insight into the impact of offending behaviour upon others.” You are presently housed at a “crash pad” provision managed by NorthEast Support Project, with no evidence of regular employment since 2023 and sporadic engagement with statutory support. Against the context of your acute housing instability, Ms White highlights an “increased risk of reoffending absent structured community support and a package of stabilising interventions.” Where personal circumstances are invoked, it is essential that courts do not mistake adversity for a blank cheque or an entitlement to impunity. To the contrary, there is an expectation that any hardship, whether material or psychological, is met with efforts to engage with support when available. Your case, as documented, is marked by periods of withdrawal from support on grounds that are both circumstantial and—to an extent—self-determined. It is necessary at this stage to set out the sentencing framework engaged by your offending. You have entered a plea of guilty—but only at the trial window, following the denial of an application to exclude key CCTV footage. There has been no indication of remorse save for a brief, standing apology addressed to the court last month. The principle governing sentence reduction for a guilty plea is now firmly established by section F of the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline and most recently reaffirmed in R v Moughan [2022] EWCA Crim 1848, where it was held: “The lateness of a plea, particularly one entered after a contested voir dire, is a relevant factor in the degree of credit afforded. The credit is to be commensurate with both the practical and symbolic benefit to justice.” I pause, as is customary, to survey the precedents which shape the present sentencing exercise. The much-cited authority of R v Cresswell [2020] EWCA Crim 1152 — a case involving a 31-year-old with a persistent record of shoplifting and related antisocial conduct — established that, notwithstanding the absence of direct violence, cumulative offending in the retail context can cross the custody threshold. The defendant in Cresswell targeted local small businesses on multiple occasions, amassing losses which, though individually minor, aggregated to a significant sum. Though little direct physical harm resulted, the defendant’s intrusion into a community grocer led to repeated staff absences, increased security costs, and the eventual curtailment of evening trading hours at two local stores. The sentence of 14 months’ immediate custody was upheld, with the Court of Appeal stressing the broader disruptiveness of “patterned acts of low-level dishonesty.” It is also salient to consider R v Martel [2019] EWCA Crim 743, where the defendant’s shoplifting at a large chain—though persistent—did not directly result in staff intimidation. There, a suspended sentence order was upheld in light of significant mitigation: evidenced mental health difficulties, a pattern of longstanding engagement with addiction recovery, and an early guilty plea. In that instance, the court found that the possibility of ongoing rehabilitation tipped the balance away from immediate custody. Further, the Crown has drawn my attention to the authority of R v Jeffords [2024] EWCA Crim 1911, concerning the burglary of a small private dwelling during a summer holiday absence. Although Mr Jeffords was not before this court, the case is instructive for its treatment of culpability in domestic setting offences. There, the court noted the particular gravity where a home had been entered with the knowledge of its occupation, with sentences reflecting the enduring psychological distress suffered by householders. While the factual matrix diverges from the present shoplifting matter, Jeffords is a salutary reminder of the distinctions the courts are required to draw between types of property-related harm. Of further note is the judgment in R v Barkley [2021] EWCA Crim 2200—an importation case involving wholesale quantities of Class A drugs sent via parcel freight across regional boundaries. The defendant, a warehouse picker recruited without full knowledge of the scheme’s scale, claimed coercion by way of threats to his family. The Court held that while coercion can be a significant mitigating factor, it cannot absolve an individual from responsibility where active participation is voluntary and protracted. Again, the factual scenario is not analogous to the instant offence, but the sentencing logic—concerning personal culpability amidst external pressure—offers a useful point of reference. I am also obliged to observe that the prosecution’s bundle included a recent report concerning the successful prosecution of fly-tipping by a commercial operator on South Gare marshes, outside this court’s immediate jurisdiction but relevant to the broader question of public confidence in the sanctions available for repeated minor offending. While the specific harm there was environmental—resulting in the destruction of marshland and the loss of habitat for ground-nesting birds—the principle animating sentence was the need for effective deterrence in the face of persistent disregard for shared norms. The public, in no small measure, measures its faith in the rule of law by whether the system is seen to hold chronic miscreants to account. Turning then to the facts, as recounted by the probation officer and in the summary supplied to the court: Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. In the addendum to the pre-sentence report, it is recorded that your most recent engagement with a local support service was on 3 August 2025, when you attended a single session at OpenDoor Advice Centre but did not return. Staff observed you to be “anxious, distracted, and reluctant to discuss future plans.” There is no evidence before the court of any engagement thereafter. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. It is perhaps superfluous to observe, but this court is routinely presented with cases in which defendants assert, either in oral mitigation or through written submissions, histories of social disadvantage, placement in the care system, experience of neglect, or childhood trauma. While these background circumstances are features which the court takes very seriously, it is essential to state plainly that they neither require nor justify a departure from the general sentencing framework, nor—save in rare and exceptional cases—do they provide grounds for imposing a non-custodial disposal where the custody threshold is plainly crossed. The Crown has further sought to adduce summary evidence of your previous convictions. You have, since 2015, accrued four previous convictions for offences of theft (all shoplifting), with the most recent conviction being in 2022. In that instance, you received a community order with a requirement to attend a six-week “Respecting Property” workshop. The progress report filed by the Community Rehabilitation Company at that time noted “sporadic attendance, with refusal to engage in core modules.” On that occasion, the court was able to find the engagement sufficiently promising to justify an order in lieu of custody. The current case, however, presents evidence of pattern and persistence. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. I note, for completeness, that the prosecution did not seek to prove any association between you and the co-defendant, Mr D. Abbot, who failed to appear during the initial phase of the investigation and remains at large. It is also recorded that the current probation officer responsible for your case is not the same officer previously involved, owing to an internal review of caseload distribution at the NorthEast Probation Delivery Unit. This turnover is not uncommon and is reflective, more widely, of chronic staff shortages and mounting attrition within the Probation Service. These disruptions are not, of course, a matter for your culpability, nor will they serve as mitigation. The addendum medical material also references an episode in 2021, in which you allegedly presented to James Cook University Hospital with a superficial laceration sustained in the context of an altercation at a city centre bus interchange. While defense submissions initially sought to introduce this as evidence of vulnerability to violence, the Crown quite properly observed that the incident was not recorded as a criminal allegation and involved no prosecution. Nor, on review, does it affect the present sentencing exercise. This court is acutely aware of the burdens placed on local business by the slow pace of criminal justice disposals. The chairman of the Middlesbrough Small Traders’ Alliance, Mr Yusuf Sadiq, has written to the court to record that three premises targeted in the last calendar year have been forced to reduce staff headcount or close secondary locations due to persistent low-value theft. These are not abstract economic losses; they are substantively connected to job losses and, for many families, the loss of what had been a reliable anchor point in the local economy. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. Victim impact statements filed by the premises manager highlight broader community consequences. There is reference to the intimidation felt by junior staff, reluctance of new hires to take on evening shifts, and a discernible drop in trade during the affected period. That harm, though indirect, falls squarely within what the Sentencing Council now describes as the “cumulative adverse impact” of repeat offending. Further, during the sentencing hearing on 5 September 2025, the court received representations from two local charitable organisations, Neighbourhood Solutions and the St. Paul’s Food Bank. Both attested to your sporadic presence at their premises—most recently in April—and to your refusal of structured support on those occasions. The core of your personal mitigation, as advanced by Ms O’Connell, pivots on the asserted collapse of your informal support network following the departure of your partner from the borough in late 2024. While the court does not doubt that such upheaval is difficult, it cannot be said to account for the continuity of your offending. In the interests of completeness, and for the avoidance of any ambiguity, I place on record that there is no evidence linking you to the matters presently under investigation concerning the unlawful fly-tipping of electrical waste on North Ormesby Common, nor to the affray resulting from a disorder at the “Coach and Horses” public house on Marton Road on 18 March 2025. Those incidents are not before this court and play no part in sentencing. Your letter to the court, handwritten and neat, is thoughtful and apologetic in tone. I accept that you experience shame at the predicament in which you find yourself, and I note without criticism your observation that “sometimes it is easier to not even try” when faced with repeated hardship. The decision to present that letter, rather than delegate all explanation to counsel, does at least demonstrate some capacity for reflection. Against that background, I must turn to the issue of risk assessment and rehabilitation. Ms White’s pre-sentence report identifies you as presenting a “medium to high risk of reconviction in the absence of tailored intervention.” Participation in substance misuse services, stable accommodation, and psycho-social skills development are cited as pre-conditions for de-escalation of risk. The court takes seriously the need, wherever possible, to structure interventions that support reintegration rather than exclusion. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. I further record, for completeness, the efforts of Middlesbrough Borough Council’s Community Street Triage, who upon your last presentation at their drop-in in May 2025, sought to initiate a referral to a local mental health recovery programme. That outreach was not, on the evidence, sustained. The broader question of capacity within the local probation and social services infrastructure is relevant but not dispositive. This region, like many others, faces a backlog of referrals for both housing and mental health services; recent data from the Cleveland Probation Service indicates a caseload average 37% above the recommended cap. That reality—regrettable though it is—cannot be the basis for unqualified mitigation, but it does illuminate the real-world context in which community disposals are to be constructed. Finally, I acknowledge the procedural vicissitudes of the listing process. The court was compelled to relist this matter twice owing to a national clerical strike, with one half-day hearing lost due to the late arrival of the court interpreter. The proceedings have otherwise conformed to the requirements of open justice, with no reporting restrictions imposed beyond those that arise by operation of law. I will conclude by inviting the probation service to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report, with particular attention to community-based programs, risk management, and the viability of alternatives to immediate custody, subject always to the constraints established by statute and guideline authority. All sentencing options remain open at this stage and will fall to be determined upon consideration of that report and upon receipt of any further representations from counsel. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT WORTLEY R v. MR H Case No: R2025/16390 Sentencing Remarks of Her Honour Judge S. L. Barrows Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you appear for sentencing in this court following your conviction, by guilty plea, in respect of a single count of theft from a shop, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The events that give rise to these proceedings occurred over a short, yet significant, time period across the retail precincts of North Wortley and adjacent districts. The learned counsel for the prosecution is Ms Dolores Finch QC, and your defence is ably conducted by Mr Ewan Halim of Temple Chambers, instructed on a representation order. You have attended court today in person, and I am satisfied you have been fully advised as to both procedure and the ruling which now follows. This matter first came before the lower court on 13 April 2025, following your arrest by officers from Central Wortley Police on the evening of 11 April. After initial charge and appearance, the matter was sent to the Crown Court for sentence, taking into account not only the gravity of the present offence but also the record of persistent offending alleged. The case was listed under the Early Guilty Plea (EGP) scheme in order to encourage timely resolution, but there were delays owing to, firstly, a late request for psychiatric evaluation, and secondly, an administrative confusion regarding case allocation to this bench rather than the original allocation in the Southern Division. I pause to observe—somewhat wearily—that such procedural inconveniences are, regrettably, now endemic even in matters where the facts themselves remain straightforward. At the preliminary hearing convened in open court on 22 May 2025, you indicated, through counsel, your intent to plead guilty. A short adjournment was granted to allow for the timely infusion of a pre-sentence probation report, as well as a psychiatric screening via the NHS Forensic Assessment Unit. It would be remiss of me not to record my gratitude to Dr Isobel Killarney and Ms Fatmata Hassan, who produced their respective reports within critically constrained timeframes imposed by the summer listing pressure. The court takes the opportunity to remark on the ongoing resource shortfall experienced by both probation and psychiatric liaison within the borough. It continues to be the case that—despite the undoubted commitment of staff—we operate under persistent disadvantage through chronic underfunding, unpredictable commissioning cycles, and the not-infrequent withdrawals of specialist practitioners at critical junctures due to unrelated staff sickness. That your case was able to proceed with only minor delay should not be mistaken for the norm. I wish to acknowledge, also, the diligence shown by prosecution and defence alike in facilitating the assembly of disclosure and relevant material. Ms Finch’s skeleton argument was both concise and apposite, and your counsel’s mitigation submissions have not sought to overstate the limited prospects of rehabilitation by reference to speculative supports not yet engaged. Turning now to the core facts of the present matter, I am directed to the applicable authorities and the Sentencing Council’s published guideline for offences of theft from a shop or stall, effective from 1 February 2016. Paragraph 4.2 of the guideline, if I may remind all present, stresses the relevance of both the mode and persistence of offending over the nominal value of the goods in question, particularly in cases of repeat targeting of vulnerable stores. I am satisfied on the evidence that this is such a case. Before addressing the particulars, I note for the record the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in R v. Ainsworth [2023] EWCA Crim 412, in which an immediate custodial sentence of 15 months was upheld for repeated targeting of a local hardware shop, the defendant having breached multiple exclusion orders and personally threatened a member of staff with abusive language. The court there observed that “the persistent violation of retail premises erodes commercial and community confidence in equal measure, and can justify a robust response where rehabilitative prospects remain poor.” It bears stressing, however, that the facts of Ainsworth included not only repeat theft but also intimidation. The present matter, so far as the agreed basis of plea suggests, involves no threats or violence. It is further relevant to consider the wider societal trends in similar offending. It is a feature of recent years that retail offences have increased both in frequency and in boldness, often involving individuals acting alone and targeting stores where CCTV or in-person security is minimal. Notwithstanding improved liaison between local authorities and the Wortley Retail Partnership, it is apparent from the data available to the court that shoplifting in this jurisdiction is not only a recurring problem, but one that places disproportionate strain on small traders—many of whom report that shrinkage of even a few hundred pounds can jeopardise the viability of their entire operation. The notion, sometimes expressed by the ill-informed, that so-called ‘petty’ theft is victimless, is demonstrably false. The economic and psychological costs accumulate, both for retailers and the staff who must implement restrictive, sometimes intrusive, measures to compensate. Procedurally, it is germane to note the steps taken by police and retail stakeholders in response to the events of this case. The Safer Communities Task Group, operating under the umbrella of the Borough Crime Reduction Forum, provided incident logs and statements from affected retailers and their staff. The administrative record furnished by Ms Alice Laing, Crime Reduction Coordinator, is a model of clarity, and I wish to formally thank that office for its continuing support to the court and to the broader public interest. I must also draw the court’s attention, briefly, to unrelated matters arising from the recent sitting of this court. Earlier this term we heard R v. Nipon [2025] EWCA Crim 995, a case involving burglary of a private dwelling, wherein the defendant entered a residential premises while the occupants were abroad, ransacking the interior and leaving behind significant damage. The facts there are wholly distinct, and the presence of such serious intrusion has no bearing on the facts before me; however, I cite the case in the spirit of comparing judicial reasoning as to aggravation and public impact in property offences more broadly. Returning to the instant case, it must not be forgotten that the circumstances giving rise to police attention here were far from routine. Although the sequence of offending was spread over a brief period, the targeting of outlets in rapid succession, and the nature of the goods involved, suggest not a fleeting lapse in judgment, but a pattern of behaviour calculated to exploit both vulnerabilities in store procedures and the inadequacies of local policing resources. The facts of the case are as follows. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. The court has additionally considered the issue of accomplices. Investigation revealed that your actions were unassisted; however, there is a tangential matter arising from police review, that a co-defendant—one Mr K. Adeyemi—was initially sought for questioning in connection with a separate event at a different retail premises on 12 March 2025, where the attempted theft escalated to assault on two security staff. Mr Adeyemi remains at large and is not before the court today. There is no evidence, direct or circumstantial, linking you to that separate event or to the use or threat of violence in any form. Your arrest followed a coordinated operation involving officers from Wortley North Response Team and community support staff from the Wortley Retail Watch Alliance. The arrest was made without incident. The arresting officer’s body-worn video has been reviewed in chambers and confirms your compliant demeanour at the scene. No force was required, no resistance was offered, and your cooperation subsequently at interview is noted. A caution interview was conducted according to Code C of the PACE Codes of Practice, as certified by reviewing Inspector J. O’Hart. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. With respect to the period between your arrest and the present, I record that the matter was initially set down for sentencing on 8 July, then adjourned at the joint application of both parties to accommodate the urgent need for an updated psychiatric assessment. This was owing in part to a recent spell in the Wortley Community Treatment Unit, where you presented with symptoms suggestive of deteriorating mood and intermittent anxiety, as referenced in the supplementary report of Dr Killarney dated 29 June 2025. It is a sad yet routine feature of contemporary criminal process that the court must effectively operate as an extension of the mental health triage system, particularly in cases arising from or complicated by comorbidity of substance misuse and psychiatric disorder. The capacity of the NHS to respond appropriately to such dual diagnoses is, as ever, constrained by waiting lists, cross-boundary commissioning disputes, and the unrelenting pressure on inpatient beds. Reference is made, such as is necessary, to the strategic review of the Wortley Clinical Commissioning Partnership, whose June 2024 report detailed a 19% increase in criminal justice referrals since 2019. I would further remark that the pre-sentence report prepared by Mr R. Tamil, Senior Probation Officer, is both detailed and professionally written. It is evident from the assessment interviews conducted with you on 3 and 11 August 2025 that, while you express some insight into the impact of your conduct, your engagement with rehabilitative pathways to date has been sporadic at best. I note that you failed to attend three out of five scheduled appointments with the Wortley Acquisitive Crime Project, and despite being signposted to the local branch of Turnaround Plus for debt and employment support, you declined to pursue the referral. Your stated barriers to engagement—namely, mistrust of professionals and a perceived lack of benefit—are disappointingly familiar to the court and underscore the ongoing challenge of providing tailored interventions in a context of scarce resources and limited voluntary uptake. For completeness, I record that submissions were invited from the Wortley Small Traders Forum, who, whilst not directly involved in the loss event giving rise to these proceedings, have made written representations regarding the proliferation of low-level retail crime and its downstream impact on their capacity to remain solvent. These submissions, while general, provide useful context to the broader pattern of harm addressed by the courts. The court has considered, in line with the guidance in R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412, the approach to sentencing in contested cases of repeated shop theft. Bhandari was an appeal arising from a complex matter involving the importation of controlled drugs concealed in freight vehicles and the subsequent resale of goods through shell companies. While the facts are extremely grave and bear no direct resemblance to the instant case, Bhandari reiterates that the existence of antecedent offending and the targeting of smaller enterprises may aggravate sentence even where the face value of the loss is modest. I remind myself of the well-established principles in R v. McGuire [2019] EWCA Crim 1836, a fraud-related prosecution involving the exploitation of elderly residents in supported accommodation through the misuse of social care funds. McGuire is referred to here for its reminder that “sentencing must remain proportionate to culpability and harm, and not unconsciously escalate punishment solely on the basis of public anxiety or the perceived intractability of a given species of offending.” The present matter is not one of fraudulent financial manipulation, but the underlying caution as to measured response remains relevant. You are now aged 43, of no fixed abode since March 2025, having undergone a period of sofa-surfing followed by emergency bed placement through the Wortley Urban Shelter Partnership. The pre-sentence report details a significant history of alcohol misuse, which you have, to your credit, partially addressed through sporadic engagement with the Alcohol Recovery and Motivation (ARM) group meetings led by Ms Gillian Plater. It is clear from your interview that there remain unresolved issues, both personal and practical, that have hampered your reintegration into stable employment and routine. Your antecedents, as evidenced by the extract from the Police National Computer, record 18 previous convictions for theft-related matters, the most recent of which was a community order imposed on 4 December 2023 for possession of a bladed article in an unrelated incident involving a street altercation. I stress that you were not convicted of any assault in that event; the court is in possession of the transcript of sentencing remarks from HHJ Kavanagh confirming that, whilst you unlawfully possessed a knife, there was no evidence of your using or threatening to use it. Nonetheless, the presence of a recent conviction for a weapon-related offence remains a relevant, though not determinative, feature of your sentencing profile. It is worth recording that a co-defendant in an earlier incident during 2022, Ms Priya Randhawa, is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment for criminal damage associated with graffiti attacks on the historic facade of Wortley Central Library—a fact which is not relevant to your present case, but which has been raised in public submissions as part of a pattern of so-called ‘quality of life’ offences. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. The court must view the present matter in the context of recent Home Office guidance, which expressly cautions against an over-reliance on immediate custodial disposal absent clear and compelling evidence that alternative sanctions would not secure rehabilitation or public protection. Notions of habituality or entrenched offending, while weighted in aggravation, do not in themselves preclude the possibility of compliance with structured community-based programmes. The report from the Wortley Probation Service makes clear, however, that your risk of reoffending is classed as ‘high’ without the imposition of a robust supervision element, and that you would benefit from participation in the Pathways Out of Crime initiative, subject to availability. I pause, for completeness, to mention a procedural development adjacent to this case: the withdrawal of interpreter services at short notice from the Worford Circuit Court, necessitating the adjournment of all proceedings scheduled between 17 June and 5 July 2025. This, in turn, led to a compression of the Wortley list, and is a contributing factor to the current term’s severe congestion. The eventual listing of your case, whilst unfortunate in timing, reflects the current reality of judicial resource allocation. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. The court is in receipt of a letter from your mother, Ms Tarana H., in which she describes your upbringing as punctuated by periods of educational disruption, family breakdown, and frequent exposure to street homelessness. She appeals for compassion in sentencing, noting that you have, in her words, “always struggled in environments that are loud, hostile, or unpredictable.” I do not disregard this plea. Nor do I discount your challenges. However, as the Sentencing Council has repeatedly emphasised, the function of mitigation is not to excuse persistent and deliberate offending, but to contextualise it. The psychiatric report identifies symptoms of chronic dysthymia as well as low-level anxiety, with no evidence of active psychosis or major affective disorder. The psychiatrist concludes that you possess sufficient capacity to understand and comply with the requirements of a community order, but that compliance is “contingent upon persistent and structured support,” particularly in the initial months post-sentence. The defence has referred the court to the now well-established principle from R v. Simmonds [2017] EWCA Crim 2729, in which the appellant’s sentence was recalibrated to reflect both the timing of the guilty plea and his unaddressed addiction. In Simmonds, the index offences comprised theft of copper wiring from commercial rail depots—again, factually distinct from the present situation—but the guidance as to weighting of mitigation was clear. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. It has become increasingly commonplace for the court to encounter defendants whose offending is shaped by the structural failings of local support services. I am advised that, in your case, attempts to secure stable private or housing association tenancy through the Urban Shelter Partnership have been frustrated by the ongoing reduction in available units and the protracted delays in securing even temporary placements. Waiting lists for the Anchor Employment Project now exceed six months, and the capacity of the NightSafe Outreach Team to deliver meaningful intervention has been severely compromised by recent funding cuts. These circumstances are unfortunately familiar, and whilst they add context, they cannot serve as an all-encompassing justification for serious criminal behaviour. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. It is pertinent to note—and I place it on record in the public interest—that the case management process in your case has been an outlier in terms of procedural continuity. Unlike so many similar matters before the court, there were no applications for bail variation, no significant delays arising from late or incomplete disclosure, and no need for a further adjournment owing to late defence expert instructions. Indeed, a word of thanks is due to both counsel and clerking staff for facilitating this degree of smooth running. However, I must express my ongoing concern at the persisting administrative failures of the National Legal Aid Agency. The initial application for exceptional case funding to instruct Dr Killarney was returned on three separate occasions for minor technicalities, with no substantive justification for the delays. Such vacillations are now so much the norm that one fears the erosion of practitioner confidence in the system. It is my hope that this observation finds an audience at the relevant agency. The court has been referred, finally, to the recent decision in R v. Elwood [2025] EWCA Crim 1543, arising from conviction for the importation of substantial quantities of Class A and Class B drugs. The factual matrix there—namely, concealment of substances within imported goods and co-ordinated resale through mobile distribution units—is far removed from the instant matter. The only relevance to the present sentencing exercise is as to the proper approach where late disclosure by the defence has led to contested mitigation. That is not the case here. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. I also note, per the representations of Mr Halim, your most recent attendance at Turnaround Plus was recorded as ‘actively engaged’, with positive feedback as to motivation and willingness to address offending-related needs. This is a tentative, but positive, factor in your favour. There is also before the court a community impact statement provided by Mr Steve Willoughby, Chair of the North Wortley Neighbourhood Forum, testifying to the “widespread local frustration” at the persistent incidence of low-level, repeat shop theft. Mr Willoughby provides anecdotal evidence of multiple businesses being compelled to invest in fortified shutters, upgraded CCTV, and in some cases, reduce late-night opening hours—a sequence he attributes in part to “a feeling of abandonment by both police and local government.” The forum’s petition, cited in the bundle, records nearly 900 signatures; while it is not determinative, such community response is deeply concerning for both the strength and durability of the social contract. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. In sum, I am required to sentence you having regard to the Sentencing Council Guidelines, relevant authorities, and the statutory duty to consider the best interests of both the defendant and the broader public. The factual matrix shows deliberate, repeat offending against a backdrop of housing difficulty and partial engagement, aggravated by antecedents but modestly mitigated by late, but genuine, efforts to access support. This is not a case for immediate custody absent further exploration of alternatives. I will therefore adjourn formal sentencing to permit the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report, to be provided within the standard 21-day timetable. The probation service is directed to report fully on the availability of structured community order requirements, to include consideration of the Pathways Out of Crime and Thinking Skills Programmes, with an emphasis on co-ordination between probation, housing, and mental health support services. No further submissions are required at this preliminary stage; the defendant remains remanded in conditional bail pending sentence. Sentencing is fixed for hearing in this court on 8 October 2025 at 10:00am. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SHIREHAMPTON R v. MR H Case No. R2025/14582 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. S. RIDLEY Filed: 19 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence having pleaded guilty to a single count of theft from a shop, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, charged on the indictment as a representative offence reflecting a course of acquisitive conduct occurring between 15 March and 28 April 2025 across retail premises in the Shirehampton district and greater Avon area. At the outset, I acknowledge the attendance of Ms Juliette Forbes for the Crown, and Mr Nicholas Aran for the defence, under the current Legal Aid contract arrangements. The court further recognises the attendance of Ms Charlotte Raj, who appears pursuant to a Victim Support Services notice under the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime, and has been instrumental in the collation of recent impact statements. I extend my appreciation to all for the professionalism with which these proceedings have been conducted. I turn first to matters of procedural history. The defendant’s initial arrest occurred on the evening of 29 April 2025, following a multi-site identification operation coordinated by PC Kenworthy of Avon Community Police and security personnel affiliated to the Shirehampton Retail Watch Partnership. Your detention was subsequent to a review of incident logs submitted by several participating businesses—logs that, it must be noted, reflected an increase in repeat acquisitive offending within the district over the preceding four-month period. Charges were authorised at 9:15 am on 30 April pursuant to the Director’s Guidance on Charging (6th ed.), and you were produced at Shirehampton Magistrates’ Court later that day. It must be observed that the matter was transferred expeditiously to this court following the preliminary plea and allocation hearing on 3 May. The application of the Better Case Management Protocol was, in this instance, largely effective. I note the cooperation between the local Police Case Progression Unit, the business crime coordinator at the Crown Prosecution Service, and various retail representatives, who collectively ensured that full evidential bundles were before me at the first Crown Court listing. Such concerted action is regrettably not always the norm, and I record the court’s appreciation. Nevertheless, it would be remiss to proceed without reference to the earlier delays: specifically, the adjournment necessitated by the late arrival of pre-sentence psychiatric and probationary reports. That adjournment—ordered on 5 August after the trial management hearing—was, in part, a result of the now persistent backlog in the allocation of Probation Service resources, compounded by ongoing industrial action within the National Clerks’ Association. Indeed, it is a truism that the procedural wheels of justice grind slowest where cases, though legally modest, are institutionally undervalued. In the interim period, I also received correspondence from the Law Centre at Shirehampton, highlighting concerns regarding the impact of repeated retail thefts on community sentiment and business resilience. While these broader concerns do not bear directly on your culpability, they form an element of the court’s broader awareness, particularly in light of heightened public anxiety regarding street-level disorder in the city’s shopping precincts. Observation was further made of the strain experienced by local authority Housing Support officers, who, in addition to their primary remit, are frequently required to liaise with criminal justice agencies in cases of persistent low-level offending. The repeated interface between housing and criminal justice systems is an established, if inefficient, feature of contemporary casework; it often results in structural gaps in support where each service, acting in assumed isolation, fails to account for the full spectrum of disadvantage faced by defendants such as yourself. For the record, this case forms one of several on the court’s current docket involving repeated engagement with statutory and voluntary sector agencies. I particularly wish to acknowledge the timely intervention of the Shirehampton Community Outreach Trust and the input from Ms Yasmine Jarrett and her small but tireless team of support workers at Shelterwise. Although the impact of their engagement on you, personally, has—at best—been limited, the materials they have provided are nonetheless revealing of wider systemic pressures. Let me also address, albeit briefly, the recurring issue of Legal Aid Agency responsiveness. In this matter, Mr Aran’s request for the authorisation to instruct Dr Ann Murphy, Chartered Forensic Psychologist, was initially deferred due to incomplete digitisation of his representation order. That delay, which postponed the timely preparation of expert materials until after the close of standard reporting timelines, is symptomatic of a system that, chronically undercapitalised, relies on the dedication and goodwill of practitioners rather than any reliably administered central process. Such procedural bottlenecks must not become tacitly accepted features of the criminal justice landscape. Further, this matter was twice disrupted by the late or non-arrival of interpreter services for the hearing-impaired, notwithstanding previous judicial directions. I note that, in the end, all parties consented to proceed through the provision of written transcriptions contemporaneous with the oral proceedings. This minor but telling inconvenience reiterates the resource constraints under which all participants now operate. I draw upon the analysis contained in Dr Murphy’s comprehensive psychiatric report, dated 21 August, which—though not determinative of culpability—identifies chronic and untreated affective disorder traits manifesting as situational impulsivity, low threshold for frustration, and episodic reliance on alcohol as a form of self-medication. Dr Murphy is careful to observe that these symptoms, while contributing to your personal and social difficulties, fall short of the threshold for a M’Naghten defence or for the principal statutory disposals contemplated under section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983. There are no current grounds for consideration of a hospital order. The adjacent pre-sentence report, prepared by Probation Officer Malik, identifies an entrenched pattern of instability involving short-term accommodation, dependency on subsistence benefits, lack of social support, and only intermittent engagement with employment or skills programmes. While acknowledging complexity, the report is clear: your willingness to access or cooperate with available support structures has been, in the author’s view, markedly inconsistent and, at times, actively avoidant. Before I turn to the individual facts of your offending, it is appropriate to situate those acts within the framework established by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences (shop theft), revised January 2022. That guidance stipulates, inter alia, that persistent targeting of small businesses, psychological distress to staff, repeated conduct over a sustained period, and a failure to respond to previous out-of-court disposals or formal warnings may — in combination — place the offence within the higher culpability and greater harm categories. The guidance, it is worth noting, continues to stress the difference between an isolated act committed through momentary lapse and conduct sustained by intent, opportunity, and disregard for repeated warnings. Turning to analogous case law, I draw attention to R v. Marsh [2024] EWCA Crim 1468, which involved a defendant with multiple prior theft convictions who targeted independent convenience stores. There, the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence towards the upper end of the range, referencing the deleterious impact on urban high streets and the psychological toll upon often minimum-wage staff. While Marsh is not analogous in every detail, the principle that repeat, deliberate conduct is especially serious remains germane. Contrastingly, I note R v. Ormond [2021] EWCA Crim 2125, a prosecution for aggravated burglary at a residential address in east Bradford. In that matter, the accused forcibly entered the dwelling during a family celebration, threatened occupants with a kitchen implement, and made off with electronic goods. The Court of Appeal concluded, not uncontroversially, that the trauma inflicted by home invasion demands an uplifted sentence even when violence is minimal. I refer to Ormond only for completeness — not because its factual matrix aligns with yours, but to reflect evolving judicial thought on the gradations of harm and invasion. Returning to the present matter, the court is in receipt of written victim statements from managers at three separate premises: “Holloway’s Chemist,” “Price Savers Express,” and “Parrett Grocers.” Each recounts the cumulative distress engendered by ongoing security worries and the demoralising effect upon staff obliged to endure repeat interactions with persistent offenders. In many respects, the harm radiates beyond the strictly financial. At the case management hearing on 7 August, the prosecution alluded to statistical analysis provided by the Avon Retail Partnership, documenting a marked increase in repeat retail thefts since the spring quarter. The linkage, if any, between case volume and reductions in uniformed police patrols is speculative but unproven — the dataset being, as ever, incomplete. The effect on local insurer premiums, however, is not in doubt; it has been confirmed via local Chamber of Commerce disclosures that excesses for theft-related claims rose by an average of 14% in the corresponding period. While these details are peripheral to sentence, they form part of the factual backdrop within which this offending must be assessed. The court is also in possession of recent correspondence from the family of your co-resident, Mr T, who, I stress, is not before this court and whose own alleged involvement in unrelated offences (including benefits misuse and a reported incident of criminal damage to a public bus shelter on 15 February) is not a matter for current consideration. Decisional clarity must not be clouded by associative inferences. For the avoidance of doubt, I make no findings on matters outside the charge. Similarly, the defence has filed a bundle referencing your former partner’s long-standing mental health difficulties, but this is relevant principally to mitigation rather than culpability in the present case. She is not before the court, nor are her conduct or circumstances germane to the lawfulness of your own. A brief word about supporting institutions. I particularly commend the enduring service of St Cuthbert’s Day Centre, whose staff continue, despite relentless caseload pressures and dwindling funding, to provide basic amenities, signposting, and welfare advice to individuals with complex support needs. Their representations in this matter are, as so often, balanced and devoid of sentimentality; they neither exonerate nor vilify, but offer practical accounts of the challenges experienced by those at the intersections of poverty, addiction, and insecure housing. Before setting out the facts, I remind the parties of the precedent established in R v. Funaki [2022] EWCA Crim 1831, a complex case originating in the Southampton Crown Court, where the defendant was convicted of importation of Class A drugs by concealment in shipping parcels delivered through a legitimate freight operator. The court there clarified the limitations on the use of intercepted correspondence in mitigation — a point moot to the present matter, but a useful re-emphasis of the principle that mitigation cannot encompass claims unsupported by admissible evidence. As to the sequence of hearings, I note that the original sentencing hearing was listed for 29 August but, as previously indicated, was postponed in view of the unavailability of Dr Murphy due to her involvement as lead witness in the Croftford cyber fraud trial, which produced its own delays following disruption caused by a fire alarm and subsequent forced evacuation of that courthouse. That arson, it is to be observed, is under separate investigation and has no bearing on this proceeding, though it is illustrative of the unpredictable nature of courtroom administration in the current climate. Proceedings today are observed by members of the public, representatives from the Avon Safe Retailers Forum, and legal trainees from the University of Bristol with leave of the court. I record for the transcript that no media are present and no special reporting restrictions apply. Counsel were given the opportunity to object, but none did so. I have also received by email a brief but well-crafted letter from your aunt, Ms Geraldine H, expressing her continuing concern for your health and well-being and her hope that the court will balance accountability with opportunity for support. I recognise the measured tone of her words and note the practical support she has offered. Having traversed the background, I now move to the facts of your offending. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. Given the limited salience placed on defendant handwriting in such matters, I nonetheless observe — for completeness — that your statement to the court is both legibly written and cogently formatted, reflecting some ability to communicate effectively when so inclined. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. It is an aggravating feature of this case that your actions have contributed, cumulatively, to the withdrawal of late evening staffing at one of the retail premises affected. Testimony from Ms Lorna Edelman, manager at Price Savers Express, details her decision to limit shift overlap after two separate incidents, notwithstanding the additional operational cost. This necessity, she writes, is one that “undermines morale and makes recruitment for entry-level roles more challenging.” Such evidence is not strictly about you, but goes to the broader climate. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. Though no violence or threats were alleged in this matter, staff at the premises have provided statements describing a pervasive atmosphere of wariness, with particular concern expressed for colleagues required to close alone in the evenings. This court must consider such impacts as part of the real harm produced by repeat low-level crime. Moving from facts to relevant context, the court is invited to consider the guidance in R v. Denholm [2023] EWCA Crim 793, an appeal originating from a prosecution for possession of a bladed article in a school car park. While Denholm obviously does not align factually with the present case, the Court there emphasised that persistent, context-specific offending (be it carrying knives or systematic targeting of vulnerable settings) can justify adjustments in sentencing approach, especially where public confidence in community safety is at stake. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. A point ever more pressing is the proper role of public and charitable resources in addressing the root causes of repeat offending. I have been provided with a short statement from Ms Rupa Mathur, social worker, commenting on the continuing “churn” of referrals for individuals in your profile to alcohol recovery services without meaningful outcome. That Ms Mathur’s team are able, with such limited tools, to prevent many further escalations is a tribute to their commitment. But, as her letter makes clear, resources are already deployed to breaking point. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. Prosecution has placed before the court a summary of your prior record, spanning two convictions for theft in 2021 (pharmacy goods and cosmetics), both then disposed by way of community orders, and one out-of-court caution for attempted theft in May 2022. Attempts made by Avon Restorative Justice Service to engage you in dialogue with affected retailers did not, on the balance of evidence, result in sustained participation — a matter further explored in Mr Malik’s pre-sentence report. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. At this juncture, I wish to acknowledge, though only for the record, the Crown’s reference (at the directions hearing) to the case of R v. Halliday [2019] EWCA Crim 2219, which entailed the theft of medical supplies from a hospital stockroom. That matter, quite distinct from the facts of your case, nonetheless offered useful dicta on the limitations of diversion schemes where the subject repeatedly fails to maintain engagement or relapses into further offending. I make no further observation other than to note the parallel. I am also in receipt of a statistical analysis provided by the Avon Community Statistics Unit, suggesting an upturn in notifiable retail theft across the Avon area in the first two quarters of 2025. Comparative data — drawn, somewhat incongruently, from a concurrent period in 2015 — is cited, but with the caveat that changes in reporting practice render direct comparison difficult. I simply note the analytic context as part of the court’s general situational awareness. A further, and wholly extraneous, submission was made by the defence concerning allegations against your previous landlord, Mr Linney, who is, I am told, the recent subject of a local authority investigation into noise abatement notice infringements. That process is ongoing and does not relate in any direct or indirect sense to the conduct before this court. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. It is also not irrelevant to observe that, according to the Crown’s case summary, staff at Holloway’s Chemist report feeling “exhausted and demoralised” — a sentiment revealed during a recent risk assessment undertaken as part of their annual insurance review. While security screens have now been installed, it should not fall solely to small businesses to bear the cost of offence prevention. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. Turning briefly to sentencing considerations, I reiterate for the transcript that while your lack of physical violence is a mitigating feature, it does not detract from the sustained nature of your offending nor the harm caused to the professional and emotional well-being of those affected. Your assertion of financial stress is understood, but you have persistently declined engagement with various forms of available assistance — including, but not limited to, budgeting clinics, employment-skills services, and substance misuse support coordinated through the Local Referral Unit. That is not, as some might claim, indicative of system failure alone, but of personal refusal to cooperate with measures designed to support your reintegration. I am aware of your ongoing housing difficulties, in particular your placement in semi-supported accommodation subject to review by local authority housing officers. You are 39 years old and have experienced intermittent periods of rough sleeping. Your current risk assessment places you at moderate risk of reoffending, and at low risk of serious harm to others. You have limited family support — your only local relative, your grandmother, is resident in a care facility and unable to participate in these proceedings. As to the future, I instruct probation to prepare a full pre-sentence report considering all available options, to include — where appropriate — restorative justice pathways, attendance at a Cognitive Skills Programme, rehabilitative activity requirements, and requirements addressing substance misuse. I direct that particular attention be paid to the question of realistic compliance given your prior failures of engagement. It would be remiss not to include, for completeness, reference to the often-cited R v. Mawson [2023] EWCA Crim 1020, a matter concerning the abstraction of copper cabling from infrastructure at the Kingsway Rail Depot. While the conduct in Mawson consisted of offences unrelated to yours and involved an entirely different sphere of risk, the observations therein as to economic impact and risk of systemic disruption are, at best, of thematic interest to this court. I make no finding as to relevance beyond mere illustration. I close with a reiteration that the public interest in this matter is not served by custodial disposal for its own sake, nor by uncritical recourse to community sentences which have thus far failed to produce any evident reduction in your offending. The question for the court, on receipt of the promised pre-sentence report, will be whether any realistic avenue for rehabilitation is available — and, if so, under what structure of supervision and sanction. Final sentencing is therefore adjourned pending that assessment. These sentencing remarks are issued in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Shirehampton on this day, 19 September 2025. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with the requirements of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020, Part 5. All parties are reminded that the court retains the power to revisit any ancillary orders and to make further directions at the sentencing hearing. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days of final sentence in accordance with the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HAVERSFORD R v. MR H Case No. Y2025/01651 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge S. L. Northcott Filed: 17 July 2025 Mr H, you now appear for sentence in respect of a conviction for theft from a shop, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 and falling within the category of acquisitive crime which, regrettably, has become increasingly prevalent within the jurisdiction of this court and throughout the wider country. Your offending, which occurred during a period marked by considerable instability in your personal and housing circumstances, has inevitably resulted in distress to those charged with responsibility for maintaining public order and safety, as well as to the individuals and businesses directly affected. Procedural Overview I begin, as protocol dictates, with the procedural chronology. You were initially charged on 22 March 2025 following an alleged theft at the premises of Ginder’s General Store, a small independent retailer in the Dunningwell commercial district. Your arrest was the outcome of a protracted investigation managed by the Local Acquisitive Crime Taskforce. The subsequent case was assigned to the Early Charge Initiative Pilot Scheme, launched last year to test the efficacy of accelerated disclosure protocols, whereby initial prosecution bundles are provided within 72 hours of custody. I record here, with both satisfaction and a note of exceptionality, that in your case such protocols were adhered to with uncommon efficiency, due in no small part to the combined efforts of Detective Constable Iris Edkins and the Dunningwell Business Crime Liaison Coordinator. The engagement of the Early Charge Initiative did not in itself obviate procedural challenges. There was, as so often, a delay in the provision of duty solicitor services during the initial interview at the Haversford Custody Suite. The appointed solicitor, Ms Paula O’Connor, was unable to promptly attend owing to personal bereavement, necessitating the assignment of substitute representation under s.13(4) of the Assigned Counsel Regulations 2009. It is worth noting that, despite the occasional criticisms levelled at the duty solicitor rota, the swift intervention and adaptability exhibited by the defence team in this matter ensured that no material prejudice accrued to you, Mr H, as the defendant. The matter was transferred to this court by order of the Magistrates’ sitting on 29 March 2025, after it was determined, on the basis of antecedent history and aggravating features alleged by the Crown, that summary disposal would not afford adequate sentencing powers. Allocation was therefore made under the extended jurisdiction pursuant to Schedule 12 of the Sentencing Act 2020. The first hearing before this court took place on 4 April 2025 in Courtroom 1, with all relevant parties present. Plea was entered at that time; you pleaded not guilty. The trial was subsequently listed, but was adjourned on 24 April owing to the unavailability of key prosecution witnesses, specifically Ms Claire Garfield (store manager) and Mr Damian Little (security staff), both absent due to coinciding periods of ill health and, in the latter case, jury service in a different division. Thereafter, the matter was restored to the list, but required a further adjournment on 9 May due to industrial action by court administrative personnel. Directions were finally complied with on 19 May, enabling the full trial to proceed on 31 May 2025. I record my gratitude to Crown counsel, Ms Melissa Haldane, and to your representative, Mr Philip Goulson, for their professionalism in accommodating these late changes to the listing. It is, perhaps, a matter of quiet judicial consensus that the administration of criminal justice in low-level acquisitive crime is disproportionately hampered by suspension of support services, competing priorities, and the incremental withdrawal of core local authority funding. This court has repeatedly observed that what may appear to the lay observer as minor process failures—delays in the transmission of electronic files, discontinuity in duty solicitor attendance, or the late service of risk assessment summaries—cause not merely inconvenience but real hardship to defendants and to the victims whose interests the justice system exists to serve. The present matter is a modest example within a systemic malaise. It is germane, before turning to the specific facts, to remark upon the changing landscape of shop theft and its prosecution. The last decade has seen a notable transition in both the profile of offenders and the operational reality faced by retailers. Once largely restricted to opportunistic theft of low-value items, contemporary shoplifting has demonstrated patterns of increased sophistication, intermittent links to organised criminality, and is often driven by entrenched hardship, addiction, or, in certain cases, coordinated targeting of multiple outlets. This transformation—if such it may be called—is mirrored in the policies designed to prevent and respond to acquisitive crime. Multi-agency Business Crime Reduction Partnerships, underpinned by protocols for information sharing between retailers, police authorities, and local councils, have been widely promoted in recent years, yet real-world application is patchy. Various schemes—Safer Retail Units, Offender Diversion Pathways, and Retailers’ Vouchers for Victim Support—have been launched with mixed results. The ambition, and sometimes the rhetoric, outpaces the available funding and the political will required for meaningful implementation. In this context, the experience of retailers is often one of inescapable attrition rather than redress. Short-term reactive policing—often triggered only by repeated offending or public complaint—can do little to remedy the broader social trends that facilitate theft. Public perception, meanwhile, remains resolutely fixed upon the twin dials of seriousness and visibility; “petty” thefts ignite indignation when widely reported, but often garner little enduring attention or sympathy outside business communities themselves. The case before the court today is best understood within that wider public context. The court is bound, as always, by the relevant Sentencing Council guidelines pertaining to theft offences, last updated in April 2021. The guideline provides a framework for consideration of culpability and harm, emphasizing the need to account for the frequency of offending, use of any planning or accomplices, impact on retail staff and business continuity, and the wider community impact. I am alert to the correct application of the guidance, particularly as it pertains to repeat thefts involving vulnerable premises or staff, and the statutory requirement to consider rehabilitative alternatives wherever practicable. There is ample appellate guidance on comparable matters. In R v. Baron [2022] EWCA Crim 1840, the Court of Appeal upheld an immediate custodial sentence for multiple thefts at a chain of independent newsagents, placing particular emphasis upon the defendant’s persistent targeting of lone female staff at closing time. That case is instructive not only for the quantum of loss but for the marked aggravation associated with deliberate exploitation of staffing vulnerabilities. R v. Emsley [2024] EWCA Crim 634, meanwhile, reminds that the fact pattern of a single instance may reflect a broader course of conduct, justifying consideration of antecedents and surrounding context in the assessment of risk and harm. Parallel reference may be made to R v. Gibaud [2021] EWCA Crim 1402, albeit that case concerned the importation of prohibited items, namely imitation firearms disguised within imported electronics. The defendant, a service technician by trade, was apprehended at the Folkestone terminal, having concealed three replica handguns within a consignment of DVD players. The facts diverge sharply from the matter now before this court, but the principle restated therein—that sentencing courts must articulate aggravating and mitigating features with specificity, particularly when departing from the starting point—remains of general applicability. Following conviction, the court directed the preparation of a pre-sentence report. This was completed by Mr Glyn Trevelyan of the Probation Service on 9 June 2025. Mr Trevelyan’s report, while commendable in its clarity, does reiterate the familiar constraints faced by probation practitioners. Staffing levels have, according to his evidence, dropped by 18% since 2021 in this borough alone, leading to unsustainable caseloads and, in his words, ‘triage-level’ supervision of all but the most high-profile cases. The defendant’s allocation, accordingly, will be to a generic probation officer, rather than to any offending behaviour specialist. While the court cannot alter resourcing, it does weigh such limitations in determining the realistic prospect of successful rehabilitative intervention. The psychiatric report, dated 12 June 2025 and authored by Dr Kamran Arnott (consultant in forensic and community psychiatry), has been placed before the court and made available to both parties. Dr Arnott describes no active psychotic disorder, no sustained mood disorder, and no acute risk of harm to others. There is, however, a background of unstable mood, undiagnosed attention-deficit tendencies, and intermittent substance use, largely of cannabis and prescribed sedatives. He notes mild features of depressive mood and social anxiety, but these fall below the threshold for formal diagnosis and do not, in his view, impair your ability to comprehend the seriousness of these proceedings. You have, on occasion, sought support from local charities, but have not sustained engagement. Of incidental interest, Dr Arnott was previously an expert witness in the unrelated matter of R v. Mott [2023] EWCA Crim 1154, a prosecution for arson of commercial property following a landlord–tenant dispute. In that matter, the defendant was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was ultimately detained under section 37/41 of the Mental Health Act 1983. That sequence of events, vivid though it is, bears no substantive relation to the present facts. During the sentencing hearing, which began at 10.15 am on 16 July 2025 in Court 4, Ms Haldane for the Crown submitted that the pattern of offending was indicative of deliberate targeting of vulnerable retail staff. The Crown emphasised the cumulative effect of repeated incidents in undermining staff morale and public confidence, referencing thereby a letter from the Dunningwell Retail Association. That letter drew attention to recent closures of three independent premises in the last six months, and the rising trend of under-reporting attributable to a perception among retailers that low-value thefts are not actively prosecuted except in exceptional circumstances. For the defence, Mr Goulson offered submissions directed primarily to your personal history. He referred to your childhood exposure to statesponsored care, your subsequent periods of housing insecurity, and your recent diagnosis of borderline personality traits. He also made reference to a witness statement from your half-brother, who himself is the subject of unrelated proceedings for benefit fraud in the South London Magistrates’ Court. While that matter is of no direct relevance here, I have no desire to sanction the habit of imputing criminality by familial association, and I disregard entirely any implicit suggestion that your present offending arises from hereditary cause or shared predilection. Our justice system, while imperfect in many respects, does not—and must not—entertainevidence tainted by guilt by association. Before turning to the particulars of the events themselves, it is both necessary and just to note the degree of public confusion as to the procedures which govern the prosecution of relatively “minor” offences such as the present. It is often forgotten that theft, irrespective of value, is triable either way; only the cumulative effect of repeated trivialisation—by police, by the press, and sometimes by politicians—has rendered retail theft synonymous, in the public’s imagination, with systemic impunity. That attitude is not borne out by the legal framework, by the resource allocation of this and other courts, or—most pointedly—by the experience of those who come before me, as both defendants and victims. Turning, then, to the facts establishing your conviction. The relevant details, as set out in the prosecution opening and supported by store CCTV, staff statements, and forensic examination, are as follows: Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. It is of marked importance that your actions on this occasion were not an isolated lapse of judgment, but the continuation of a discernible modus operandi observed in previous incidents. The circumstances in which you entered the premises, the time chosen (shortly before closing), and the possession of a distinctive, oversized parka with concealed inner pockets all evidence a degree of planning and precognition inconsistent with impulse alone. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. The description of events—assembled with some difficulty owing to the poor resolution of security camera footage and a partial power outage on the store’s west corridor—shows that you acted with a composure and assurance not typically ascribable to novice offenders. Staff described you as “calm” and “non-confrontational,” but report being unnerved by your repeated presence in the store during periods of low footfall. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. One victim impact statement from Ms Garfield highlights not only material loss but the psychological toll on junior staff, several of whom are under 21 and some managing their first employment. Ms Garfield reported a decline in staff morale and an increased reluctance among employees to volunteer for evening shifts, with one junior member requesting a transfer after the incident described. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. Notably, a voluntary engagement offer was made by the local Safer Communities Team following your arrest on a previous occasion in December 2024. This offer, comprising referral to a six-week Acquisitive Crime Diversion Programme and access to housing advocacy services, was declined at the time. The probation report notes this as a missed opportunity for pre-emptive intervention—a fact which cannot easily be overlooked when assessing risk and prospects for rehabilitation. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. There is no evidence of violence or threat during the commission of the offence. The incident was not accompanied by physical confrontation or verbal abuse. There is, however, an assertion by the Crown that your repeated presence and the frequency of incidents fostered an atmosphere of unease, approximating the kind of ambient harm referenced in R v. Black [2023] EWCA Crim 1078, where persistent trespass into a place of work was held to aggravate the psychological effect on staff. I would note here, briefly, the utility and limitations of community impact statements in cases such as this. The statement lodged with the court on behalf of the Retail Association of Dunningwell echoes a more general concern regarding business continuity: namely, that persistent theft may prompt premature closure of high-street retailers, with consequential effects both economic and social. That testimony must be weighed as context, not proof of fact in this particular matter—yet its resonance cannot be ignored altogether. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. Your antecedents record reflects several previous police interactions for matters of theft, dating to 2020, and a caution for battery in 2018 (the latter not involving retail premises and not attended by any analogous features). The Crown did not, in this case, seek to advance bad character evidence beyond the prosecution bundle—an omission I consider to be appropriate, in light of the differences in context and consequence. The probation assessment classifies your present risk as “medium” to public safety and “elevated” regarding continuation of acquisitive offending, should suitable interventions not be implemented. This risk analysis references not only the present offence but also previous episodes of non-engagement with voluntary support structures, combined with the absence of any meaningful employment record since 2022. It is right to observe that the report makes no finding of gang association, nor any suggestion of compulsion or duress. Mr Trevelyan, in his oral evidence, reaffirmed the view that your risk profile would be substantially mitigated by consistent engagement with housing and employment support. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. When weighing aggravation, the court bears in mind both the sustained pattern of offending as established by the prosecution and the cumulative psychological distress arising for staff. There is evidence of planning and targeting, as indicated above. There is also the further factor that your offence occurred during a period of particularly stretched police resources, as acknowledged in the evidence of Inspector Milligan, who described a workload of 70 open acquisitive crime cases at the time. Balanced against that, the following points of mitigation are advanced on your behalf: your relative youth (aged 28), the presence of depressive symptomatology and unstable housing circumstances, your lack of any conviction for either violence or for any offence involving possession of weapons, and, importantly, your ultimate if belated plea of guilty, entered on 3 June 2025 following the service of the CCTV enhancement report by forensic contractors. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. A further, if limited, mitigating factor cited by Mr Goulson is the letter of support from the local Crisis Response Network, which attests that you have, since arrest, attended two sessions of their drop-in support group, and engaged briefly in cycles of volunteer work (for which no formal record has yet been provided). The degree and consistency of your engagement with such services remain unclear, but the underlying willingness may, in the view of the probation officer, be developed further with appropriate conditions. It is, regrettably, incumbent upon this court to observe the looming crisis facing small businesses in the present economy, a matter which, though extrinsic to the legal calculus at hand, is repeatedly drawn to the court’s attention by correspondence from business improvement districts and civic partnerships. Persistent low-level thefts, when viewed not solely as isolated criminal incidents but as a slow drip erosion of trust, morale, and economic sustainability, pose a threat to social cohesion, public safety, and the viability of the high street as a concept. This context, though it cannot dictate sentence, is far from irrelevant. To the extent that some aspects of the present case have intersected with the involvement of multiple agencies, reference must be made once more to the administrative burden involved—probation, police, charities, victim support, and, not infrequently, local health trusts broadened by the rise in defendants with complex needs. The diversion of resources to address persistent low-level offending generates opportunity costs far beyond the immediate facts, including interrupted progress for other offenders and extended delays in civil services support. It is a phenomenon remarked upon in the National Audit Office’s 2023 review of community sentence effectiveness, as well as in the House of Commons Justice Select Committee’s interim report (published March 2024), which lamented the increasingly “reactive, rather than strategic, character of institutional response to acquisitive offending below the threshold of violence.” On a related note, the Crown in their submissions also referenced co-offending patterns evidenced in the recent case of R v. Laing [2022] EWCA Crim 2217, a case concerning joint enterprise burglary of a domestic dwelling. In Laing, the defendant and an accomplice forced entry to a private house while the owners were abroad, causing criminal damage to property and theft of sentimental items including jewellery and electronics. The circumstances are not analogous to the present case and I accord the barest possible relevance to the factual matrix of Laing, but I state for transparency that the court has considered the case only in relation to the principles of sentencing in the context of repeat and planned offending. This court also notes with some disquiet the increasing prevalence of discourse regarding public cynicism toward the capacity of the judiciary to provide real-world solutions to what are fundamentally social problems. There is a growing perception that the criminal courts are little more than an ineffectual backstop to institutional drift and economic malaise. It would be disingenuous to suggest that this perception is entirely without foundation. Yet it remains the task of the court to sentence, not to resolve policy. In conclusion, I find that—while your offending was neither violent nor highly organised—it exhibited features of persistence, planning, and a degree of emotional impact upon the individuals directly affected. Your antecedent record, non-engagement with prior voluntary offers of support, and non-trivial impact upon the staff at the targeted premises are all matters of concern for risk management and future rehabilitation. However, your relative youth, partial engagement with support services, and absence of violent conduct provide mitigation sufficient to justify, in principle, a community-based disposal should a robust and enforceable intervention be available and accepted. Before passing sentence, I direct the Probation Service to prepare a supplementary report, providing their considered view as to the suitability and structure of a high-intensity Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, to be combined, if possible, with structured pathway support in housing and employment. The same report should establish whether a Mental Health Treatment Requirement is appropriate given the evidence of mild depressive features, notwithstanding the absence of a qualifying clinical diagnosis. I am to be provided with details of proposed support agencies, terms of enforcement, and realistic timelines for progress review. Pending receipt of that report and further written representations, the matter will be relisted for final sentence at the earliest opportunity, provisional date to be fixed by the court office within the next 21 days. You are advised of your right to appeal against sentence or conviction within the time limits prescribed by the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 do not apply in this case. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT NOTTINGHAM R v. Mr H Case No. T2025/14689 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. L. Bramwell Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you come before this court for sentencing having pleaded guilty to a charge of theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically relating to a series of alleged shoplifting offences. The period in question extends from the autumn of 2023 through to the early months of 2025, encompassing various incidents occurring across Nottingham city centre and its peripheral retail zones. Procedural History and Context Your arrest was effected on 10 April 2025 following a systematic operation combining efforts from Nottinghamshire Police’s Economic Crime Unit and local business crime partnerships. This matter was initially raised when several businesses reported unexplained stock losses and observed suspicious activity involving a male matching your description frequenting their premises. The ensuing investigation necessitated the engagement of digital forensic analysts attached to the East Midlands Regional Cyber Crime Unit, with particular attention paid to correlating digital transaction anomalies against closed-circuit television footage compiled from at least seven separate locations. This collaborative, multi-agency investigation ran for approximately thirteen weeks before your detention. Among the range of investigative techniques employed were covert observations, analysis of payment card data linked to the implicated stores, and, notably, the use of Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology to track vehicles thought to be connected to your mobility and presence near crime sites. The volume and complexity of the compiled evidence platformed a comprehensive prosecution case. It must be acknowledged as a broader reality that offences involving theft from retail outlets often consume disproportionate investigative resources. Not just the evident time spent in evidence gathering, but also the attendant administrative burden with the collation of witness statements, inventory reconciliation, and prosecutorial directives. This is illustrative of the systemic strain experienced by law enforcement and judicial bodies in processing cases that, while sometimes perceived as minor or trivial by public opinion, represent tangible harm to commercial operators and ultimately to wider society. The court further notes the role of the Nottingham Retail Crime Reduction Team (NRCRT), whose liaison officers have submitted detailed affidavits highlighting the cumulative impact on staff morale and business viability. Their work exemplifies the intersection of commercial safety concerns and criminal justice considerations in modern urban environments. The present case, pursuant to the provisions of the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, has adhered to stipulated timetables for disclosure, with all evidential materials provided to the defence well in advance of plea hearings. This procedural discipline has ensured the avoidance of unnecessary adjournments beyond an early hearing held on 22 May 2025, where you initially entered a not guilty plea. Subsequent to disclosure of additional forensic analysis and a forthcoming psychiatric assessment report, you altered your plea to guilty at the hearing on 5 September 2025. By way of broader comment, this pattern of late admissions is something the court encounters with increasing frequency—pleas that are tendered after discovery of indivisible evidence, often near or on the day scheduled for trial. Whilst the law rightly permits defendants to test the case against them, the judicial system cannot overlook the consequential distress occasioned to witnesses, victims, and the expenditure of public funds that could be more productively allocated elsewhere. The Court of Appeal, most recently in R v Beale [2024] EWCA Crim 312, reaffirmed that credit for guilty pleas should be calibrated with regard to timing and the consequential saving to the court estate and victims. Within the same vein, I must express concern over the operation of the Legal Aid Agency in this jurisdiction. As noted at prior directions hearings, and regrettably repeated in this case, the delays in authorising funding for expert reports hamper the fair and efficient disposal of matters. The request to instruct an independent clinical social worker to assess your risk profile was approved only after considerable administrative delay, notwithstanding early applications made by defence counsel on 15 May 2025. Such bottlenecks represent an impediment to the administration of justice and are cause for continued institutional reflection. The case has also benefited from input by the Nottingham Mental Health Trust, with a consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr Imran Siddiqui, providing a comprehensive report addressing both clinical and criminogenic considerations. The relevance of mental health assessments in offences involving acquisitive crime has been the subject of evolving jurisprudence, exemplified in R v Mengesha [2023] EWCA Crim 1117, where the Court underscored the necessity to balance therapeutic intervention with public safety imperatives. Moreover, I have received and reviewed a number of character references submitted by family members, community support workers, and local charities engaged in supporting those with histories of economic deprivation and substance use. These documents, while informative, do not diminish the gravity of the offending. The non-violent nature of the offences must be acknowledged, yet the cumulative effects on victims – particularly small business owners and their employees – extend beyond immediate financial loss. As observed in R v Penfold [2022] EWCA Crim 1578, the psychological toll and erosion of confidence among retail workers resultant from repeated theft warrant significant consideration in sentencing. It is notable that the court’s current hearing room has undergone refurbishment to better accommodate vulnerable witnesses, including advanced audio-visual facilities. This reflects a growing recognition of the need to mitigate the trauma often associated with court attendance, albeit this case proceeded without any victim witness requiring special measures. Historical legal provisions also merit brief reflection. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, as introduced and modified over subsequent decades, codifies dishonest appropriation with the intention to permanently deprive. The Theft Amendment Act 1996 introduced nuanced sanctions aimed at the differentiated treatment of petty shoplifting versus large-scale commercial theft. This legislative evolution evidences Parliament’s intent to balance proportionate deterrence with the realities of offender profiles. Older authorities such as R v Ghosh [1982] QB 1053 retain procedural interest, though the test for dishonesty has since been revised in Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67, which clarified the requisite subjective and objective components. Such doctrinal refinements influence the court’s application of legal principles, even if particulars here point to straightforward dishonesty without complex mens rea contestations. The Defendant’s Background and Circumstances Mr H is now 34 years of age. The present set of convictions includes four previous proceedings concerning theft or attempted theft, although none resulted in custodial sentences. The most recent was a community resolution recorded in late 2022 following an incident involving alleged shoplifting from a small convenience store. Prior to that, convictions are spaced over several years, indicative of a degree of persistence in offence type. The precarity of your accommodation status has been documented by probation services and supported by correspondence from Hope Outreach Nottingham, which provides support to those experiencing housing instability. You have engaged intermittently with substance misuse services but declined a referral to the Nottinghamshire Recovery Consortium. This observed pattern of engagement and disengagement is regrettably common in individuals whose offending arises in contexts of multifactorial hardship. Notably, your educational history, as set out in the pre-sentence report, indicates disengagement at levels equivalent to Year 11, with no formal qualifications attained. Employment history is intermittent, primarily in manual labour and casual hospitality roles, with several gaps ascribed to health issues and lack of opportunity. The court has also been appraised of your early childhood adversity. Records disclose periods of foster care placement during adolescence, with documentation from Social Services outlining a history of neglect and exposure to domestic instability. Such histories, while not excusing wrongdoing, provide necessary context for understanding the complexities underlying pathways to offending. Nevertheless, the courts must remain mindful that similar backgrounds do not predetermine choices, nor eliminate accountability. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. It is also important to situate your offending within the wider societal canvas. Nottingham, like many urban centres, faces multifaceted challenges including rises in street homelessness and the normalisation of antisocial practices in retail precincts and transport hubs. The work of the Nottingham City Council’s Neighbourhood Engagement Team plays a key role in community safety initiatives, though resources remain limited. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. As this court has observed across multiple sittings, the sentencing regime for such offences must take account of the real impact on commercial confidence and community cohesion. While the theft of low-value items may appear as slight on their own, repeated acts cumulatively impose significant hardship. The Crown has submitted victim impact statements from several retail outlets, emphasising the erosive effect on staff morale and the increased operational costs—ranging from security system upgrades to adjusted staffing rotas. Such evidence has been communicated via the Nottingham Retailers Association and formally tendered as part of the prosecution files. In considering your offence and antecedents, reference must be made to the progressive development of sentencing guidelines as promulgated by the Sentencing Council. The Theft Offences Definitive Guideline, last updated in 2023, sets out clear categorisations based on the level of harm, culpability, and persistence. The court’s obligation is to weigh these factors in pursuit of a just and proportionate outcome. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. Furthermore, I have regard to the cumulative nature of these offences, as recognised in landmark authority such as R v Doherty [2010] EWCA Crim 1441, where sentences for repeat acquisitive crime were aggregated to reflect ongoing criminality rather than isolated acts. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. The report from Dr Siddiqui highlights traits consistent with impulsivity and an underlying anxiety disorder, though no formal psychiatric diagnosis of major mental illness was made. The psychiatric assessment makes recommendations for community-based rehabilitation, including cognitive behavioural therapy focused on offending behaviour and anxiety management. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. This court is all too aware of the limitations faced by probation and mental health services. Nationally, increasing caseloads, funding constraints, and staff shortages challenge the capacity to deliver timely interventions. The Nottinghamshire Probation Trust has, in recent months, reported a staffing shortfall of nearly 18%, leading to prioritisation of high-risk cases and increased pressures on medium and low-risk supervision. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. Within this framework, your reluctance to fully engage with available support services is regrettable. The court notes the submission on your behalf emphasizing socio-economic precipitants and the’impact of chronic unemployment. Those matters are relevant for holistic assessment but cannot be permitted to extinguish personal responsibility. There is a growing body of literature—both academic and operational—that links acquisitive crime to entrenched cycles of deprivation and social exclusion. The complexities of rehabilitation in such circumstances are non-trivial, as explored in works such as “Crime, Poverty and Exclusion” (Palgrave Macmillan, 2024) and echoed in recent Home Office briefings. These intersect with policy concerns surrounding benefit sanctions, decreasing public trust in institutions, and the pervasive impact of social media platforms on public perception of crime. Notwithstanding these reflections, the court must apply the letter and spirit of the law. Offenders who persist in multiple thefts without meaningful engagement or demonstrable corrective action warrant sentences that signal both censure and deterrence. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. I also draw your attention to ancillary case law that, though not directly on point, informs the sentencing landscape. For instance, R v Lyons [2019] EWCA Crim 2257 involved theft of copper cabling from railway infrastructure, resulting in critical public safety concerns. While materially distinct, the case highlights the increasing judicial intolerance for thefts which, taken cumulatively, erode public confidence. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. The court is mindful of the stated principle in R v. H (No. 3) [2023] EWCA Crim 854, which addresses the interplay between sentencing credit and guilty pleas entered at late stages. That judgement emphasises the necessity of proportionate credit, reflecting the stage at which an admission is made and the attendant cost savings to the justice system. In this context, the timing of your plea — shortly before trial readiness — reduces the maximum credit available. Your counsel has urged mitigation based upon your personal circumstances and the hope for future rehabilitation within the community-based framework. The defence points to your expression of remorse and commitment to desist from further offending. While those submissions are noted and welcomed in principle, they must be balanced against the serious nature of continuing theft in multiple premises over a sustained period and the destabilising effect upon victims and neighbourhoods. The court also acknowledges the valuable contributions from community support networks. Particular commendation is due to the Nottingham Homelessness Partnership, with whom you have had intermittent contact. Their reports suggest that closer collaboration and longer term engagement could prove beneficial, again subject to your co-operation. Allowing time for probation to consider viable interventions is appropriate. The court intends to direct preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report, including specific assessment of risk, receptivity to intervention, and feasibility of structured community orders incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements and unpaid work. It is further appropriate for a consideration of potential restorative justice facilitation to address both victim concerns and offender accountability. Having considered the totality of circumstances, the court is of the view that the matter must be remitted for sentencing once these reports have been received and considered. These sentencing remarks are given this 17th day of September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Nottingham. The proceedings have been duly recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his statutory right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved pending further directions. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER R v. MR H Case No. M2025/04821 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. S. FLETCHER Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in connection with multiple incidents of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. These offences are said to have been committed intermittently over an 18-month period in various commercial areas within Greater Manchester, primarily involving small to medium-sized businesses. The charge before the court represents a pattern of behaviour rather than discrete episodic acts. Procedural History You were arrested on 12 June 2025, following an investigation by the Manchester Economic Crime Unit and the Greater Manchester Business Crime Reduction Team, which had been monitoring a series of reported thefts over the preceding months. Initial enquiries revealed a proliferation of low-level thefts concentrated in convenience stores, newsagents, and small pharmacies situated near public transport hubs. The offences, as alleged, involved a similar modus operandi characterised by the opportunistic removal of goods during periods in which staff were engaged or distracted. The sheer volume of incidents within a relatively confined geographical area prompted collaboration between multiple agencies, including local neighbourhood policing teams, the newly formed Northern Retail Safety Initiative, and CCTV monitoring units. The multi-agency task force examined reports encompassing both Greater Manchester Police records and municipal licensing data for shops affected by repeated loss. Their coordination exemplified the principles underpinning the Better Case Management (BCM) framework as laid down in the Criminal Procedure Rules, seeking to expedite case progression through early evidence collation and witness preparation. Listing and pre-trial conferences proceeded with some delay, attributable largely to difficulties in securing appropriate legal representation and the ongoing administrative challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency in this jurisdiction. Defence counsel was eventually instructed on 20 July 2025 following a protracted application for funding, which was complicated by shifting evidential requirements and the need for specialised expert reports. The BCM protocol was applied in this matter with reasonable effectiveness. Early listing of the plea and trial preparation hearing occurred on 31 July, at which point you entered a not guilty plea. A trial was set for October 2025 but was vacated by consent on 25 August to facilitate further evidential enquiries by the defence, particularly relating to the admissibility of CCTV footage and witness statements. The matter was relisted for this sentencing hearing following your eventual plea of guilty entered on 1 September 2025. Credit for your guilty plea is necessarily tempered by its timing. The jurisprudence, including R v. Havers [2022] EWCA Crim 1602 and R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145, confirms the court’s discretion in awarding reductions based not solely on the plea’s presence but on its timing and the consequential saving of public resources and victim distress. It is useful, if somewhat tangential, to note that this court is presently engaged during a period of significant strain on judicial and frontline policing resources, exacerbated by industrial action affecting court reporting services and budgetary restrictions imposed on investigative units specialising in economic crime. Such contextual factors, while not determinative, serve as a backdrop for understanding the operational pressures faced by agencies tasked with addressing acquisitive offences. Recent discourse surrounding the decline in general community cohesion and increasing levels of street-level antisocial behaviour further frames this case. The tendency toward casual disregard for private property rights, whether borne of economic hardship or social despondency, is a phenomenon documented in various locality-based studies. However, the court is mindful to avoid succumbing to sociological generalisation in its legal determinations, focusing instead on the particulars and merits of each case. The victim impact in acquisitive crimes, although often described as “symbolic,” carries substantive weight here. Local shopkeepers and staff have furnished detailed statements, revealing the eroding sense of safety and community trust engendered by repeated thefts. The economic loss is accompanied by psychological harm not to be underestimated. Several letters of support, including one from the Salford Community Outreach Project, have been received, emphasising both your personal difficulties and the challenges faced by service providers operating amid chronic underfunding and rising demand. The court recognises the valuable work of these voluntary organisations, many of whom balance conflicting duties of care and accountability within resource-constrained environments. It warrants mention, without particular direct application here, that recent appellate decisions have underscored the nuanced approach required where mental health issues intersect with criminal conduct. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court affirmed the necessity for sentence calibration when serious psychiatric conditions inform offending. While Mr Mallory’s offending involved arson and posed elevated public safety risks, the principles concerning therapeutic necessity versus custodial risk containment remain instructive in cases involving behavioural and cognitive vulnerabilities. Equally, the court recalls the judgments in R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412 and the guidance therein about balancing clinical intervention and secure supervision — albeit in contexts of escalated harm. Though no analogous mental health claims have been advanced in your case, such jurisprudence forms part of the broader sentencing landscape. There has been no suggestion of co-defendant involvement here, though the court is cognisant of cases proximate in time and geography where those charged with offences ranging from fly-tipping on protected greenbelt land to possession of bladed articles at secondary school car parks have encountered the criminal justice process. None of those matters bear upon your circumstances but provide a reminder of the diverse range of offences managed within the lower legal tiers and their often complex procedural path. At the case management hearing on 20 July, multiple applications were made relating to disclosure and the admissibility of electronically stored evidence. Despite these procedural complexities, the court appreciates the diligence of both prosecution and defence in navigating the challenges presented by rapidly evolving digital evidentiary standards. The use of body-worn camera footage, for example, has introduced new dimensions of transparency and, occasionally, evidential contention in retail theft prosecutions. Of some concern — although peripheral to your case — have been reports regarding the conduct of certain probation officers, including an ongoing investigation into allegations of corruption within the Manchester Probation Service. While this investigation has generated headlines and institutional introspection, it has had no demonstrable effect on the supervision or assessment of defendants charged with acquisitive offences within the current judicial circuit. The court also acknowledges the recent refurbishment of Court 5, where this hearing takes place. The updated facilities, including improved accessibility and enhanced digital recording equipment, reflect institutional commitment to providing a modern, dignified forum for justice. Staff here continue to demonstrate professionalism and dedication in the administration of complex cases, notwithstanding heavy caseloads and periodic staffing shortages caused by vacation periods and illness. Throughout these proceedings, the Crown has been represented with commendable efficiency by Ms Eve Stanton, whose submissions have been thorough and professionally balanced. Defence counsel, Mr George Keane, instructed under a Legal Aid order, has likewise advanced measured representations, demonstrating concern for your welfare alongside advocacy. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. The facts of the offending reveal a pattern of calculated conduct. Surveillance footage portrays repeated entries into retail premises characterised by a deliberate yet covert removal of items, often concealed within personal belongings or clothing. The selection of goods suggests a familiarity with market demand and resale value, indicating a level of premeditation beyond opportunistic theft. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. It is noteworthy that some incidents took place during busy periods or shift changes, suggesting an awareness of reduced oversight. Several store staff have provided statements describing heightened anxiety and a sense of vulnerability during your presence. While no threats or violence were reported, the emotional toll on employees cannot be discounted. The court has received a series of victim impact statements collected through the Manchester Retailers Alliance, detailing adverse effects on business turnover, increased insurance premiums, and the imposition of additional security measures—costs invariably borne by small businesses operating on narrow margins. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. In certain episodes, your conduct included bypassing electronic security tags by removal or tampering, methods requiring specific knowledge and equipment. This degree of sophistication further distinguishes your offending from mere impulsive acts. Mr H used a question about Oyster Card transactions to divert the shopkeeper’s attention, then leaned over the counter to take a displayed item. Amidst these pertinent facts, the court notes the receipt of correspondence from the Manchester Homelessness Action Group. Their submissions, while supportive in tone regarding your social circumstances, emphasise the growing incidence of street homelessness and its attendant risks, including exposure to exploitation and mental ill-health. These contextual matters often underpin the lived realities of defendants with acquisitive crime convictions, though direct causation is rarely straightforward. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. Earlier attempts at diversion via community resolutions and conditional cautions were undertaken. Their limited efficacy is regrettable but not unexpected given the evidence presented. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. Psychiatric assessment from Dr Helen Fitzgerald, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence, concludes that while no major diagnostic criteria for a psychotic or mood disorder are met, there are clinically significant features indicative of underlying anxiety disorder and intermittent substance misuse. Dr Fitzgerald recommends engagement with psychological therapies focused on impulse control and stress management, noting that these interventions could assist in addressing some contributory factors. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Regrettably, you have demonstrated inconsistent engagement with such services to date. While the availability of NHS-funded mental health and addiction support in Greater Manchester is well-documented, lengthy waiting lists and resource shortages pose considerable barriers for many in need. This systemic pressure is a broader concern for public health but does not absolve individual accountability. The scope and scale of psycho-social support services have become ever more constrained following prolonged fiscal austerity. The Mental Health Foundation’s 2024 report highlighted that waiting times for adult psychological therapies in the North West exceed national averages by 25%, with particular difficulties in accessing crisis intervention teams. These realities, although relevant, frame rather than excuse your position. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. The Probation Service has produced a comprehensive pre-sentence report, which notes your previous convictions for shoplifting spanning back several years, most recently dealt with by a conditional discharge two years ago. The report identifies medium risk of reoffending and low risk of serious harm. Recommendations include referral to accredited offending behaviour programmes, particularly those focusing on acquisitive crime, alongside financial management advice. The report points out that housing instability and lack of sustained employment are significant risk factors in your profile, echoing widespread social challenges faced by many individuals in similar circumstances. It emphasises the importance of multi-agency cooperation to support rehabilitation and public protection. In the present sentencing context, it is necessary to consider section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, governing the imposition of community orders with rehabilitation activity requirements, unpaid work, or custodial sentences where appropriate. Case law including R v. Norbury [2020] EWCA Crim 1021 has reiterated the need to balance punishment and rehabilitation, especially where the defendant’s personal circumstances militate against custodial measures, unless public protection demands otherwise. The court again acknowledges the observations in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 with regard to the timing of guilty pleas and sentencing mitigation. While your plea was not immediate, it nevertheless spares the court and witnesses from the rigours of a full contested trial. That said, the persistent nature of your offending and failure to desist following prior interventions weighs heavily. The cumulative impact on victims and the broader community must be taken seriously, as emphasised in the Theft Offences Sentencing Guideline (Sentencing Council, 2021). Sentencing decisions in such cases are inevitably influenced by the broader public interest in deterrence and maintaining confidence in the retail sector, particularly as small and independent shops increasingly cite retail crime as a significant threat to viability. I record my gratitude to the Manchester Retail Crime Unit, Salford Business Safe Partnership, and other agencies whose collaborative efforts have been instrumental in assembling the prosecution case and supporting victim welfare. In closing, I remind all parties that the court operates on principles of proportionality and fairness, and that sentences must reflect both the gravity of the offending and the prospects for rehabilitation. I reserve final sentencing pending the receipt of any further reports or representations which may be submitted within seven days. In the meantime, the Probation Service is requested to consider the suitability and likely efficacy of accredited programmes, structured resettlement support, and tailored interventions addressing financial and psychological vulnerabilities. You are reminded of your right to appeal from any custodial sentence imposed, subject to statutory provisions. These sentencing remarks are delivered on 18 September 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, and a formal transcript is available to the parties. Reporting restrictions under Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 do not apply. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHWARK R v. MR H Case Number: T2025/13429 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. Bramwell Filed: 14 August 2025 Mr H, you appear today for sentence in relation to a charge of theft from retail premises, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This prosecution concerns a series of shoplifting offences alleged to have taken place over a period spanning from late 2023 through to early 2025, largely in the SE1 and SE16 postal districts of London boroughs. The Crown relies upon a representative count before this court but invites sentencing to reflect the extended course of conduct indicated by the evidence. Procedural History and Courtroom Process This matter was first allocated to Hertford Crown Court on 12 March 2025 following your arrest on 2 March 2025, arising from multi-agency collaboration spearheaded by the Southwark Business Crime Reduction Unit (BCRU) with operational input from the Metropolitan Police Service’s Retail Theft Task Force. The initial arrest followed a lengthy inquiry involving covert observation, local CCTV collation, and engagement with store managers across several retail units. On arraignment you were granted conditional bail and gave no indication of plea. The case was subsequently transferred here to Southwark Crown Court on 18 April 2025 for trial under the Better Case Management pilot scheme currently operating in the jurisdiction. The case management hearings proceeded as per the Criminal Procedure Rules’ indicative timetable, with some delay attributable to compounding Legal Aid application issues and defence counsel’s request for further disclosure of digital evidence. The court is, regrettably, all too well acquainted with such difficulties—the repeated administrative obstacles posed by the Legal Aid Agency in terms of expert funding applications having a disruptive effect on case progression. This is neither isolated nor exceptional and is a cause for ongoing professional concern. At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 29 June 2025, you entered a guilty plea—albeit at a relatively late stage in the proceedings. It is well-established jurisprudence that such timing will temper credit accorded. The starting point must always be the recognition of genuine remorse balanced against the effect of delay on the resources expended by the prosecution, witnesses, and courts. As set out in the authoritative decision in R v. Jennings [2020] EWCA Crim 437, the court reiterated that the discount for plea is neither automatic nor without qualification, and remains within judicial discretion. The wider social framework within which these offences occur should not be overlooked. The court is mindful that shoplifting, though frequently minimised by some as ‘victimless’ or ‘petty,’ entails real consequences for local businesses, employees, and communities—particularly independent retailers operating on tight margins. The cumulative effect of persistent retail theft contributes to an erosion of confidence, loss of income, increased security spending, and psychological distress among staff who are often among the most vulnerable in the workplace. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. In addition to the evidential objectives pursued by law enforcement, the role of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership has grown in recent years as a vital bridge between the private and public sectors in combating acquisitive crime. Multi-agency meetings facilitate intelligence sharing, data analytics, and prioritisation of persistent offenders. The current prosecution is the product of such concerted efforts. However, the court is conscious that local authorities and voluntary bodies face relentless resource pressures, exacerbated by competing demands arising from increasing rates of street homelessness, antisocial behaviour, and the impacts of financial hardship on communities. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. The case attracted considerable attention from the Southwark Integrated Substance Misuse Service (SIMS), which prepared representations detailing your historical and current engagement with alcohol dependency programmes. The report compiled by Dr Ami Patel, Consultant Psychiatrist, dated 10 July 2025, is notably detailed and professionally prepared. Dr Patel opines that while you show marked ambivalence to treatment, there remains potential for engagement should a suitable intervention be supported and enforced. However, Dr Patel emphasises that progress is contingent upon your active participation and warns that absent such engagement, the risk of reoffending remains elevated. It must be noted that the clinical opinion was sought at the request of your defence team following a formal application to instruct an independent forensic psychiatrist with experience in acquisitive offending. Such expert evidence, while not determinative, plays an important role in providing the court with context for risk assessment and the appropriateness of community disposals versus custodial sentences. It bears comment that the Legal Aid Agency’s delay in approving the instructions for Dr Patel’s assessment led to a necessary adjournment of sentencing hearings, impacting the overall court listing schedule. That such procedural hindrances persist in 2025 is cause for institutional reflection, given the Priority Areas listed by the Ministry of Justice for reform in the coming financial year. In terms of statutory framework, section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the governing provision. The Theft Offences Sentencing Guidelines (2022 edition) provide an explicit framework for determining the gravity of the offending and the appropriate sentencing outcome, balancing culpability against harm. The guideline recognises levels of harm ranging from negligible to serious physical and psychological distress, and culpability levels that correspond to planning, premeditation, sophistication, or opportunism. The Court must also bear in mind the guidance set out in R v Whitehead [2019] EWCA Crim 2365, which stressed critical importance of tailoring sentences to the offender’s antecedents, degree of persistence in offending, and the impact individual crimes have on victim communities. While Whitehead arose in the context of aggravated burglary, its principles on sentencing persistence and community impact have been held highly persuasive in acquisitive crime matters by subsequent courts. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. It is also necessary to refer to the jurisprudence in R v Gallimore [2021] EWCA Crim 642 concerning the latency of guilty pleas. In that case, the Court of Appeal substantially clarified the limits of credit where pleas are handed in at a late juncture — particularly in cases employing extensive CCTV evidence and digital trilateration tracking. Whilst concessions for procedural economy remain lawful, the court retains full discretion to modify any such credit in consideration of wider public interest and the impact on victims and the court system. The facts of the offending, carefully outlined by the Crown, depict a pattern not of random isolated incidents, but a course of conduct exhibiting elements of planning, concealment, and a deliberate targeting of regular, accessible retail businesses. The court received materials from independent retailers — often family-run or local to the community — reporting fluctuating staffing patterns and increased security expenditures as a direct consequence of the defendant’s conduct. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. It is furthermore of note that victim impact statements tendered by several employees disclose a material reduction in workplace morale and increased feelings of vulnerability. One senior supervisor at a corner shop described the defendant’s return visits as “a source of dread,” noting palpable anxiety among part-time staff and newly recruited assistants, some of whom had contemplated resignation. It is often insufficiently appreciated that such offences bear psychological harm which, while lacking physical force, nonetheless disrupts normal routines and communities in tangible and harmful ways. The Probation Service prepared a standard pre-sentence report, tendered in draft form to this court on 5 August 2025. Probation Officer Ms Rose Williams furnished an assessment that candidly addresses offending history, social circumstances, and prospects for rehabilitation. Ms Williams comments critically on your prior failure to comply meaningfully with community orders and expresses concern about the intermittent engagement with addiction support services. Furthermore, the report highlights ongoing housing instability and the impact this has on your risk profile, observing that transitory accommodation and lack of routine impede consistent participation in interventions. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. It is a tacit acknowledgement that many defendants presenting before the courts are caught within a nexus of complicating vulnerabilities, including unstable accommodation, disadvantage, addiction, and mental health challenges. Courts do not ignore these factors, but neither are they absolved from applying the law and protecting wider public safety. The balancing act remains delicate and difficult. It is also relevant to mention that the court noted the presence of family support letters from your sister and aunt, dated 1 and 3 July 2025 respectively, which portray you as a person of goodwill but beleaguered by difficult circumstances. Whilst these are significant as emotive context, there remains no evidential suggestion that they impinge upon your personal accountability. Courts must weigh familial advocacy against the independent findings of professional assessments. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. As alluded to earlier, the Business Crime Reduction Partnership convened a meeting on 15 May 2025 following a quarterly review of crime trends in SE16, which included detailed analysis of theft hotspots and repeat offender planning. The Partnership, despite facing chronic funding shortfalls, has continued to prioritise data-driven approaches and victim liaison—all of which have contributed meaningfully in shaping the investigation and focus of the Crown’s case. On a procedural note, I commend court staff, ushers, and clerks here at Southwark Crown Court for their diligent efforts in managing the increasingly complex logistics of multi-defendant cases. While your matter is single defendant, the backlog across Crown Courts nationally has been exacerbated by industrial action among court reporting staff earlier this year, affecting listing timetables and availability of interpreters. We acknowledge and appreciate the commitment of all involved to maintaining the machinery of justice under such challenging conditions. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Turning momentarily to precedent of a tangential nature, the Court recalls R v Pratt [2017] EWCA Crim 2589, which concerned an aggravated affray occasioned following a pub dispute involving pool cues and other blunt instruments. While Pratt’s facts bear no direct relationship with shoplifting, the case is illustrative of the judiciary’s increasing sensitivity to the cumulative impact of low-level offences on community cohesion. It underscores the principle that even offences lacking in gravity when viewed discretely may collectively amount to significant social harm. Similarly, the Court notes in passing the recent decision in R v Langley [2024] EWCA Crim 717, a case involving criminal damage to a church noticeboard and related public nuisance offences. Again, Langley is entirely unrelated to these proceedings; however, it demonstrates the judiciary’s consistent approach to recognising the wider ramifications of property offences beyond mere financial loss. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. I turn now to important considerations concerning suspensions, community orders, and custodial sentencing thresholds. The legal framework as articulated in the Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft contemplates a spectrum of disposals aligned to culpability, harm, and offender background. Custody is reserved for cases surpassing a defined seriousness level, whilst community orders remain viable where the court is satisfied of realistic prospects of rehabilitation and sufficient compliance likelihood. Your record includes previous convictions for similar offences, some disposed of by community resolution and conditional discharge. The court is mindful of decisions such as R v Davies [2023] EWCA Crim 1012, where the Court recognised that repeat acquisitive offending is a serious aggravating factor meriting custodial sentences unless compelling mitigating factors are present. The persistence of offending despite prior interventions increases concern regarding risk of reoffending. Experts presented evidence that your offending is linked to situational factors, including substance use and economic precariousness. The dual role of rehabilitation and public protection underpins the sentencing rationale. The court is conscious of the pressures upon the Probation Service and community providers, whose capacity to deliver effective intervention is often strained by rising demand and restricted resources. To conclude, this hearing has proceeded in open court presence. I extend my formal thanks to Ms Caroline Edwards, who appeared for the Crown, and to Mr Nathaniel Greene, representing the defence pursuant to a Legal Aid representation order. Both counsel have conducted themselves professionally throughout. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 August 2025, in Court 9 of the Crown Court at Southwark. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed as mandated by Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentencing hearing will be scheduled no sooner than 11 September 2025, to allow for receipt of updated reports and any further submissions. The defendant is reminded of the right of appeal under section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, within 28 days of sentence. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MERTON R v. MR H Case No. T2025/15493 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. J. Fairview Filed: 11 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence following your conviction for a course of conduct involving repeated offences of theft from retail premises, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour extended over a period of approximately eighteen months and occurred within multiple trading outlets situated in the Borough of Merton and adjoining areas. Such offences, although often perceived by some as minor infractions, carry significant cumulative harm for victims, the wider community, and public confidence in the rule of law. Procedural History The matter initially came before this court on 20 March 2025, at which time you entered a plea of not guilty at the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing. Following substantial evidential disclosure from the Crown, including detailed surveillance footage and contemporaneous staff statements, your counsel sought an adjournment to consider further evidence and explore the possibility of a psychological assessment. I granted that adjournment, reflecting the court’s proper ambition to ensure that all relevant information, particularly regarding potential mitigating factors, was thoroughly assessed prior to sentence. The investigation leading to your arrest, carried out under the auspices of the Merton Borough Retail Crime Partnership, involved detailed multi-agency collaboration with the local police intelligence unit and the Crime Reduction Officer team. Over several weeks, meticulous analysis of store CCTV and other automated surveillance technology revealed patterns that increasingly implicated you. The retention of evidence from various proprietary systems proved challenging given the diversity of hardware and software platforms used by individual shops, necessitating significant efforts from digital forensic specialists. The court is mindful that the efficient handling of cases involving acquisitive crime such as this must balance competing demands — between providing timely justice, respecting defendants’ rights, and safeguarding the interests of victims who, by and large, are local small business owners striving to keep their enterprises afloat amidst economic uncertainty. On that note, I would be remiss not to convey recognition to the staff of the Merton Safeguarding Retail Network, whose ongoing work to assist those most affected by such offences has been commendable, particularly given funding constraints and workforce fluctuations documented in recent annual reports. It is customary to address the delays experienced in the processing of legal aid applications relating to this case. The defence applied for authorisation to instruct a forensic psychologist with expertise in compulsive offending behaviours in February 2025. The Legal Aid Agency initially requested further supporting documentation before conceding approval on 10 April 2025 — a delay which, though regrettable, is not unusual in contemporary criminal litigation and raises broader issues around the resourcing and administrative procedures of the wider legal aid framework. Counsel for the defence is to be commended for perseverance in ensuring that appropriate expert assistance was obtained to support just disposition in this matter. In the course of preliminary hearings, the matter was listed twice before this court; on the second occasion, the date was vacated owing to a scheduling conflict caused by industrial action affecting court staff across the South London Circuit. Such strikes, while a deeply unfortunate feature of recent months, have had regrettable knock-on effects on caseload management, not just here in Merton but across comparable jurisdictions. The court is, of course, sensitive to the challenges faced by court personnel whose indispensable work undergirds justice administration, as well as to the anxieties engendered by protracted waiting times for all participants. The case was particularly notable for the involvement of multiple agencies. Aside from the Merton Retail Crime Partnership and local policing teams, officers from the South London County Digital Evidence Unit contributed to assembling the key electronic evidence. Their efforts included recovery and authentication of mobile phone data and inventory audit logs from targeted stores. The complexity of this investigatory endeavour must not be understated; such work goes beyond conventional policing, requiring specialised skills to decrypt and verify digital artefacts under admissibility standards. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. As the court considers the framework for sentencing, it is appropriate to reflect on both statutory guidance and the evolution of applicable jurisprudence. The Theft Act 1968 remains the principal legislative instrument governing shoplifting offences, though sentencing practice has inevitably evolved to address patterns of repeated theft that have more pernicious consequences than isolated incidents. In R v. Sinclair [2019] EWCA Crim 766, the Court of Appeal held that offences involving persistent and calculated removal of property from retail premises warrant consideration of their cumulative impact on victim businesses, which often operate on fragile financial margins. Equally, in the more recent decision of R v. Greenfield [2023] EWCA Crim 440, appellate judges acknowledged that while the value of stolen goods may be modest, the emotional and psychological strain on shop staff can be both acute and enduring, deserving explicit recognition in sentencing. Those authorities highlight that theft is not merely a transaction but an attack on communal trust. A further layer of legal context is provided by the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (last revised in 2021), which prescribes consideration of factors such as the duration and frequency of offending, the degree of planning, the defendant’s awareness of risk, and the effect on victims. There is also emphasis on the role of aggravating features such as targeting vulnerable victims or employing deception, all matters to be borne firmly in mind. It is also relevant to mention the influence of the Better Case Management (BCM) Protocol introduced in 2018 as a means to expedite case processing and uphold procedural integrity. In line with this protocol, case progression in the present matter adhered largely to timetabling requirements prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Rules. Though interrupted briefly by logistical setbacks, overall listing and preparation occurred within statutory parameters. Several victims’ impact statements have been supplied to the court by store managers and affected staff. These provide valuable insights into the human consequences of retail theft that often escape public attention. One shop assistant recounted her dread at the repeated presence of an individual matching your description, which necessitated changes to her shift patterns and heightened anxiety about personal safety, despite the absence of direct threats. Another witness described the emotional toll arising from the need to implement increased security at her store, diverting both staff time and resources away from customer service. Such lived experiences amplify the gravity of the offences beyond mere financial loss. Two comprehensive reports were submitted to the court — a pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Tara McNeill, probation officer, and a psychiatric evaluation by Dr Alan Thorne, consultant forensic psychiatrist. Ms McNeill’s report, dated 3 September 2025, identifies a moderate risk of reoffending and highlights social vulnerabilities stemming from unstable accommodation and limited family support. The report candidly acknowledges previous contact with youth offending services during adolescence and a history of alcohol misuse, though noting that you declined engagement with certain specialist interventions recommended last year. The document emphasises the potential value of community-based rehabilitation options but cautions against unwarranted optimism without demonstrable sustained compliance. Dr Thorne’s assessment, commissioned after initial difficulties in securing legal aid approval, provides a nuanced appreciation of your mental health profile. His report notes no evidence of psychosis or personality disorder, but adumbrates significant features of impulsivity intertwined with an entrenched pattern of acquisitive behaviour. The report suggests that such traits may contribute to episodic lapses in judgment, yet affirms that these do not suffice to extinguish criminal responsibility. Dr Thorne advocates for targeted cognitive behavioural therapy aimed at addressing underlying cognitive distortions and urges close liaison with community mental health services to monitor risk. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. From a societal perspective, it is instructive to contemplate the broader currents informing petty crime trends in contemporary urban centres. Across London and other metropolitan areas, public pressure on retail establishments—particularly smaller independent outlets—has intensified with rising costs, staffing shortages, and increasing security concerns. Reports from the London Chamber of Commerce’s recent Retail Crime Survey indicate an unsettling upward tick in shoplifting incidents over the past five years, a trend attributed variously to economic hardship, the proliferation of online resale markets, and social dislocation exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent austerity policies. The court acknowledges the vital role played by the Safer Neighbourhood Teams, whose preventive and engagement work, often behind the scenes and outside the glare of formal proceedings, delivers meaningful community reassurance. It is regrettable that constraints on police manpower and budgetary cuts have stretched capacity to the limit, encumbering proactive responses to serial acquisitive offenders. The present case thus forms part of this larger mosaic—yet it remains incumbent on individuals such as yourself to refrain from perpetuating cycles of harm. In preparing for these sentencing remarks, I have reviewed correspondence provided by local charities including the Merton Homelessness Outreach Service and the Community Food Collective. These letters underline the intersection of economic deprivation, homelessness, and offending behaviour. They attest to the overburdened systems that seek to ameliorate the plight of vulnerable adults but struggle under increasing demand amid constrained resources. Importantly, these organisations stress the necessity for interventions addressing root causes alongside judicial responses. Legal submissions advanced by Mr Simon Whitlock, your counsel, assert that your conduct is driven by episodic crisis, linked to housing instability and untreated substance use issues. He advocates for a community order with intensive supervision and specified programmes aiming to reduce reoffending risk and facilitate reintegration. The Crown, represented by Ms Jennifer Haines, contends that while underlying vulnerabilities are acknowledged, the frequency and deliberate nature of your offending undermine prospects for immediate leniency. Both counsel have provided comprehensive written submissions and arguments orally, for which the court is grateful. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. The court notes with interest parallels between the instant matter and the decision in R v. Dobson [2022] EWCA Crim 887, wherein an immediate custodial sentence of nine months was imposed for repeated shop theft from retail stores of modest value but significant organisational disruption. Notably, Dobson had entered an early guilty plea and cooperated fully with subsequent support services. That case reiterates the importance of timely admission of guilt in facilitating a more favourable disposal. Moreover, attention must be drawn to the distress caused to retail workers by persistent offending. Although there is no allegation here of physical violence, the cumulative psychological impact parallels findings in R v. Faulkner [2021] EWCA Crim 455, where the Court recognised that fear, anxiety, and lowered morale among staff can constitute aggravating features, notwithstanding absence of overt aggression. It is important also to touch upon the Court’s obligation to consider ancillary matters, such as previous convictions—even those not directly for theft, but nonetheless relevant to patterns of behaviour. Your criminal record includes convictions for minor public order offences and a prior conviction for criminal damage unrelated to the shops in question. While these do not define you, they provide context to the criminal justice response. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. The necessity of proportionality remains paramount. The court is mindful of statutory thresholds and sentencing tariffs recommended by the Sentencing Council, balanced against the particular circumstances here — which include your personal history, previously mentioned vulnerabilities, and the late timing of the plea of guilty entered on 12 August 2025, during the arraignment hearing. From a procedural standpoint, I must observe the longstanding practice of cautious judicial enquiry into the veracity of claims made in mitigation, particularly where matters such as substance dependency and homelessness are advanced. While genuine hardship should never be discounted, it must be weighed against the need to uphold accountability and deter recidivism. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. These considerations invite reflection on broader systemic issues. The persistent over-reliance on criminal sanctions for conduct arguably symptomatic of social dysfunction poses challenges. There is increasing debate across Parliament and scholarly circles concerning the allocation of resources between criminal justice and social welfare. The proliferation of ‘offender management’ programmes, while laudable in theory, often encounters practical constraints. Probation services nationally report chronic underfunding, rising caseloads, and limited availability of bespoke interventions tailored to repeat acquisitive offenders. The present case is a microcosm of these tensions. The court, in embracing rehabilitation as a core objective of sentencing, nonetheless remains acutely conscious of safeguarding the public from ongoing harm. Especially in cases of persistent dishonesty, community tolerance is stretched thin and confidence in the rule of law may be undermined should sentences fail adequately to reflect culpability. Somewhat tangentially, it is relevant to mention reports of recent disturbances in the borough’s nightlife district—involving affray and damage to public property—that have heightened public concern about disorderly conduct. While unrelated to your case, these incidents form part of a challenging environment within which justice must be administered, and resources apportioned. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. The present sentencing framework requires the court to consider a range of disposals, from custodial sentences to community orders incorporating unpaid work or rehabilitation activity requirements, as well as fines or other punitive measures. The proportionality of custody as a last resort must always be balanced against potential benefits of supervised intervention in the community. However, successive offending of this nature militates against extended leniency. There is no doubt that your offending caused measurable disruption to local businesses and distress to those who work in retail settings. Particularly given the recurrence of your conduct despite prior warnings and informal sanctions, the court must convey a clear message that such behaviour will not be tolerated. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. Defence submissions rightly draw attention to your attempts at securing stable housing, though these efforts remain incomplete at present. Correspondence from Your Sister, Ms Bernadine Williams, and letters from the Merton Linus Shelter and the Hope Community Food Bank have been taken into account. They speak of familial support, albeit inconsistent, and the challenges posed by limited affordable accommodation in an overheated market compounded by wider economic pressures. The court would be pleased if these sources of assistance translate into concrete engagement with rehabilitative services, but cautions that such support does not obviate accountability for offending. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. In conclusion, the court considers it appropriate to direct the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report. This should elaborate on assessed risks and needs, the availability and suitability of rehabilitative programmes, and any matters arising from the recently received letters of support. Given the complex interplay of factors here, including substance misuse, housing instability, and acquisitive offending, an informed, multi-agency approach will best guide final sentencing decisions. I remind all concerned that this report shall, among other things, evaluate the extent to which community-based interventions may be viable, and whether conditions can be structured to provide both public protection and individual rehabilitation. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 11 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Merton. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be circulated to all relevant agencies. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days of sentence pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are in place. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BROMLEY R v. Mr H Case No. T2025/13479 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. K. WAINWRIGHT Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H, you appear today for sentence following your conviction by plea for offences of theft by shoplifting, a breach of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct before the court pertains to a protracted period commencing in late 2023 and extending into the early months of this year, occurring across multiple retail establishments located within the Borough of Bromley and neighbouring districts. The nature of the offending involves repeated, deliberate acquisition of goods without payment, targeted predominantly at convenience stores, pharmacies, and small independent shops serving local communities. Procedural History You were initially arrested on 12 February 2025 after an investigation conducted by officers assigned to the Bromley Business Crime Unit, following a series of coordinated reports from shopkeepers and retail security officers alerting authorities to a discernible pattern of thefts occurring across multiple premises. It is notable that the investigation employed a combination of traditional patrol surveillance, covert observational deployments, and examination of digital evidence including CCTV recordings from venues throughout the borough. As is often the case in chronic acquisitive offending, the assembling of a complete evidential picture was a painstaking and resource-intensive process. Officers were required to collate and review in excess of 70 hours of recorded footage, many segments of which were obscured or suffered from time code discrepancies, compelling painstaking cross-referencing with till reports and statements from retail staff who, themselves, are frequently on precarious contracts with high turnover. It is important for the court to emphasise that the value of the stolen goods in isolation does not paint the full picture as to the gravity of such conduct. Persistent shoplifting at a community level exacts a cumulative toll on the integrity of local commerce, employee welfare, and the social fabric of the neighbourhoods affected. Retailers bear the costs of loss prevention measures, insurance premiums rise, and small businesses in particular face existential pressures. The Supreme Court in R v. Langford [2013] UKSC 12, while concerned with issues of sentencing methodology, underscored the broader societal impact of repeat offending, a principle that retains resonance here. Your initial police interview took place on 15 February 2025, during which you exercised your right to silence. However, subsequent forensic examination linked a scarf found on your person at the time of arrest to fibres recovered from the scene of one of the thefts. You were charged on 20 February 2025 with a single representative count of theft, to which you later entered a guilty plea at a plea and case management hearing held on 7 April 2025. The plea was late in the proceedings, a factor invariably relevant to the assessment of mitigation. The Court of Appeal has consistently enunciated, in cases such as R v. Umbers [2020] EWCA Crim 2653, the principle that credit for a guilty plea is principally attributed in recognition of the saving of court time, victim distress, and witness inconvenience; delayed pleas accordingly attract reduced discount. The late nature of your plea also occasioned the need for an additional trial preparation hearing due to the outstanding disclosure of ancillary reports. It must be noted, however, that the plea has brought about the earliest just resolution and relief for witnesses and victims. The Better Case Management scheme, under which this case was listed, aims to streamline such matters. The process here was broadly compliant, notwithstanding an adjournment necessitated by delays in obtaining Legal Aid authority to instruct a forensic psychologist to assist the defence. I record my regret at these delays, which are sadly emblematic of systemic failings within the administration of legal aid funding, particularly for expert assessments in cases involving potentially complex behavioural or psychiatric dimensions. The Legal Aid Agency’s procedural inertia continues to impose unnecessary burdens upon courts, defendants, and the broader justice system. It is illustrative that, despite multiple reminders and formal tribunal considerations, authorisation for defence expert instruction in your case was only granted some five weeks after initial application. Such bottlenecks are antithetical to the principles of timely justice as enshrined in the Criminal Procedure Rules and must be addressed by the appropriate authorities with urgency. It is also pertinent for the court to observe the context in which shoplifting offences occur today. There is a well-documented growth of street homelessness and rough sleeping in the London boroughs, with increasing numbers of individuals reliant upon cashless and informal economies to meet subsistence needs. The change in retail landscape, including widespread adoption of self-checkout technologies and diminished face-to-face staff presence, feeds into an environment in which opportunistic theft is both easier and, some assert, more psychologically detached. Nevertheless, this court cautions against any conflation of structural social issues with individual culpability. I acknowledge the valuable contributions made by various agencies in this case. Bromley Safer Neighbourhoods Team provided timely community impact reports, albeit constrained by the limited direct offender engagement. Additionally, Bromley Retailers Association submitted considered representations which articulate the prevailing anxieties and operational harms felt among local shopkeepers. Their efforts to lobby for increased police visibility and legislative reform in response to rising acquisitive crimes deserve commendation. Moreover, I note with gratitude the cooperation of the Bromley Recovery Trust, a voluntary sector organisation which supports persons with histories of substance misuse and homelessness. The Trust has been involved in providing counselling sessions to you over the preceding eighteen months, although, as per their latest correspondence, participation by you has been inconsistent and marked by intermittent disengagement. In this connection, the probation service has prepared a comprehensive pre-sentence report, which is duly before the court. The report documents your personal history, including a significant period of unstable housing, previous employment in manual labour, and a modest educational record. The officer notes that you have four prior convictions, all for shoplifting, dating from 2017 onward, including a community resolution disposed as recently as November 2023. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. The probation officer’s assessment highlights your evident difficulties with impulse control and financial management, emphasising a pattern of minimal engagement with support services until court intervention prompts more formalised involvement. The report references the current constraints within the Probation Service, including staffing shortages, which have impacted the regularity of contact, a phenomenon not unique to this jurisdiction. The psychiatric expert, Dr Melissa Campbell, who conducted a clinical assessment following instruction to address concerns around possible underlying neurodevelopmental conditions, offers a detailed analysis of your psychological state. The report notes the absence of major mental health pathology but identifies traits consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and emerging evidence of moderate substance dependence on alcohol. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. The report further notes that while there is some basis to consider treatment options, your previous engagement with such services has been sporadic at best, limiting their potential efficacy at this juncture. Dr Campbell reiterates the need for a joined-up approach, integrating community-based social and psychological support alongside any mandated interventions ordered by the court. Turning to legal precedent, the framework for sentencing theft offences, especially of this nature and scale, is principally guided by the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (2021). The offence level is primarily dictated by the value of goods taken, the sophistication or planning evident, any vulnerability of staff or victims, and the persistence or opportunistic nature of the conduct. In R v. Chatterjee [2022] EWCA Crim 1344, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence in a case of repeat shoplifting where the defendant deliberately manipulated store security measures and benefited from prior adult cautions. While the monetary value of the goods was relatively low, the repeated and planned nature of the offending, undertaken with a marked absence of remorse, led to an immediate custodial sentence of 9 months. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. By contrast, the case of R v. Okwodu [2023] EWCA Crim 2010 provides insight into the court’s approach where mental health or neurodevelopmental factors are found. There, whilst acknowledging the impact of the defendant’s diagnosed autism spectrum condition, the Court emphasised that the need for public protection and deterrence often prevails in matters of persistent acquisitive offending. Judges are admonished to balance therapeutic considerations with custodial requirements, particularly where offending patterns continue unabated despite prior interventions. I also refer respectfully to R v. Benton [2018] EWCA Crim 1573, which considered the role of the Better Case Management protocol in progressing complex cases involving multi-agency assessments. There, the Court observed that delays inherent to obtaining psychiatric input and social care preparedness may necessitate flexible timetabling, but judges should resist protracted adjournments absent compelling justification, lest victims and communities suffer from protracted uncertainty. The length of this offending period and the methodological consistency of your modus operandi, as described in evidence, evidence a deliberate pattern. Your active and conscious decision to reoffend after prior interventions, including community resolutions and warnings, is of particular concern. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. Furthermore, impact statements from victims and store managers relay the growing anxiety experienced by frontline retail workers, some of whom have altered their shifts, requested security enhancements, or taken stress-related leave. The emotional and economic consequences, while not immediately quantifiable, are a recognized aggravating factor. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. As the Court of Appeal confirmed in R v. Rennison [2020] EWCA Crim 1392, the effect on victim confidence, particularly for small business owners relying on community trade, must inform sentencing decisions in offence categories traditionally viewed as less serious. It has come to the court’s attention that your sister, whose statement was tendered at the recent hearing, expressed concern regarding your housing situation. The correspondence from the Bromley Housing Support Network outlines acute shortages in emergency accommodation for persons in your circumstances, exacerbated by the ongoing national housing crisis. These systemic difficulties, while real and pressing, constitute external factors beyond the ambit of judicial mitigation but may have a bearing on suitable rehabilitative measures. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. Additionally, I have reviewed letters submitted by the Bromley Soup Kitchen and the Crisis Assist charity, both emphasising your episodic engagement with their services but noting that sustained participation has been lacking. These organisations serve a vital role in the support network for vulnerable populations, often bridging welfare gaps left by official provision. Of note is a report from the Metropolitan Digital Forensics Unit, which, while tangential to your case, identified an unexpected volume of cyber-related crimes linked to addresses within the borough over recent years. It is well acknowledged that the police are increasingly stretched, balancing traditional crime detection with emergent digital threats, which include unauthorised data access and identity theft. While such matters do not directly implicate you, they exemplify the complex environment faced by modern law enforcement frontline services. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. Indeed, your arrest was part of a sequence of operations coordinated across the Bromley Division, which also included separate unrelated enquiries into fly-tipping offences on nearby greenbelt land — a case involving alleged environmental damage caused by unlawful disposal of builders’ waste. The continuity and breadth of these operations underscore the wide scope of contemporary policing duties, extending far beyond investment in traditional crime hotspots. It is also worth recording that a co-defendant in an unrelated arson prosecution currently remains at large, a fact brought to this court’s attention due to the occasional administrative cross-over in regional investigations. The arson case in question concerned damages to commercial property on the outskirts of Lewisham. While not pertinent to your conduct, such cases highlight the continuum of criminality that occupies the courts. The victims in your case have been entirely cooperative. Their statements reflect measured demeanour and a judicious understanding of the broader social issues at play. I express gratitude for their composure and willingness to engage with the justice process without succumbing to retributive outrage. Despite these circumstances, I must emphasise that the public interest in effective deterrence remains high. Judgments such as R v. Malek [2017] EWCA Crim 1745 make clear that custodial sentences are appropriate where there is evidence of repeated offending, planning, and disregard for prior interventions, notwithstanding mitigating factors relating to personal circumstances. I acknowledge, though, the point raised by defence submissions that custodial penalties should be reserved for offenders whose level of culpability and risk justify such measures. The court is aware of the harms caused by the overuse of imprisonment, including deleterious effects on accommodation, employment prospects, and mental health. That said, there is also a keen awareness of the risk of glorification or trivialisation of repeat shoplifting, as noted in R v. Tetlow [2021] EWCA Crim 907. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. The Court also takes account of the principle of parity and consistency in sentencing. This demands that sentences for similar offences, committed in similar circumstances, receive broadly comparable outcomes to ensure fairness and public confidence. The court has deemed it necessary to acquire a supplementary updated pre-sentence report, given recent disclosures from voluntary sector partners and the fluctuating nature of your balance between engagement and disengagement from support networks. This report, when received, will provide essential insight into your current circumstances, including any changes in accommodation, employment prospects, or psychological state. In the meantime, I commend the efforts of both prosecution and defence counsel for their professional and measured submissions during these proceedings. The case has been conducted with appropriate respect for the court and due consideration for judicial economy. Before concluding these remarks, it should be noted for the record that the Crown Court at Bromley underwent a recent refurbishment of its public and courtroom facilities as part of a wider initiative to modernise court estate infrastructure. Though unrelated to your case, such improvements serve to underpin the dignity and accessibility of the justice system for all participants, including defendants, victims, and the wider public. Similarly, I acknowledge the crucial role of court ushers and staff in maintaining order and ensuring proceedings run smoothly. Their work is often overlooked but forms the foundation of effective judicial administration. Finally, I would reiterate the collective strain that persistent acquisitive offending imposes on police resources, probation services, and social care agencies. The balancing act faced by these entities—managing demand with finite funding and personnel—must be recognised when considering sentencing outcomes designed to mitigate future risk. It is against this complex factual and procedural matrix that I will adjourn sentencing to allow the probation service sufficient time to deliver its updated report, and for any further relevant material relating to your personal circumstances to be prepared and considered. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bromley. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are advised of the right to appeal against conviction and/or sentence within the statutory time limit of 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged in this matter. Costs are reserved to be addressed at the time of sentencing. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON R v. Mr H Case No. T2025/14497 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge A. J. Pembroke Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court charged and convicted following a protracted course of conduct involving retail thefts, in contravention of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour under scrutiny relates principally to incidents occurring over a period extending from November 2023 to April 2025, primarily within the jurisdictional boundaries of Brighton and Hove, with ancillary occurrences recorded in adjacent districts. The count charged is representative of a wider pattern of persistent and calculated acquisitive offending. Procedural Background and Case Progression Your apprehension came at the terminus of a detailed investigative operation involving cooperation between the Sussex Police’s Retail Crime Unit and the Brighton Business Crime Reduction Programme (BCRP). The enquiry was lengthy and labour-intensive, evidencing the significant logistical challenges routinely faced by enforcement bodies addressing the cumulative burden of low-level, high-frequency offences. Coordination between multiple retailers, many operating small to medium independent outlets, allowed for the identification of behavioural patterns indicative of repeat offending. The difficulties inherent in assembling a coherent sequence of evidential material cannot be overstated — particularly when store hours, shift patterns, and varying degrees of technological capability impact data capture and verification. One must acknowledge the ongoing tension between the necessity of pursuing such cases and the constraints of resource allocation, especially given the competing demands of serious acquisitive crime, violent offences, and public protection priorities. Adjournments arose intermittently throughout the progression of this matter, reflecting a broader, systemic pattern of delay prevalent across similar cases nationally. These included a two-month hiatus occasioned by difficulties associated with obtaining Legal Aid authorisation to instruct an independent forensic psychologist to conduct a comprehensive assessment pertinent to sentencing considerations. The impediments encountered in securing such funding attachments spoke again to the often-criticised bureaucratic inertia afflicting the Legal Aid Agency, with repeated correspondence and escalation required before final approval. The impact of these procedural delays weighs not only on preparatory timelines for defence counsel and prosecuting authorities but also bears upon the wider principle of timely justice as enshrined within domestic and international procedural safeguards. Another adjournment was necessitated when the Defendant’s legal representatives sought leave to adduce witness statements from family members and community-based support services. These applications, while procedurally correct, contributed to a cumulative elongation of curial timelines, illustrating the complex interface between the administration of justice and the provision of social and rehabilitative advice within marketplace crimes. I acknowledge, with gratitude, the written and oral submissions of Ms Charlotte Evans, representing the Crown, as well as those advanced by Mr Daniel Kersey, instructed for the defence under a representation order granted on 16 April 2025. Both counsels conducted themselves professionally in a manner conducive to the efficient operation of this court. The Court further notes, with solemnity, the efforts of the Community Retail Outreach Network, whose staff have engaged with affected businesses in mitigating losses and providing support for employees affected by this course of events. The Network’s interventions, despite severe funding constraints and increasing demand, have been characterized by a pragmatic and humane approach, which merits formal recognition. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. It must be observed that the facts detailed within the prosecution evidence are consistent with established patterns of repeat shoplifting offences. Incidents described and substantiated through CCTV footage, employee testimony, and forensic linkage reveal a modus operandi marked by opportunistic yet methodical targeting of accessible stock, frequently utilising stratagems to distract staff or obfuscate detection. The context of this offending cannot be extricated from the wider societal pressures increasingly evident in urban locales such as Brighton. Persistent economic disadvantage, housing insecurity, and the fragility of local welfare provisions create environments in which acquisitive crime flourishes. However, these challenges provide neither justification nor excuse for unlawful conduct. The court must balance empathy with the imperative to protect victims and uphold the law. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. The history of acquisitive crime jurisprudence includes cases of considerable variance in factual matrix and gravity yet consistently underscores the importance of measured sentencing responses. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the presence of schizoaffective disorder in an offender who set fire to multiple properties was held not to preclude custodial sentence, particularly given the high level of public danger posed. While the present case differs in offence type and severity, the principle of balancing therapeutic need with public protection remains pertinent. Similarly, the Court of Appeal in R v. Dacres [2021] EWCA Crim 1331 reiterated the significance of non-violent property offences in undermining personal security and community confidence. Though instances of shoplifting may appear trivial when isolated, the cumulative psychological and economic harms are real and warrant serious judicial consideration. Discussion surrounding the Better Case Management (BCM) framework is pertinent here. Introduced as an initiative to enhance case progression efficiency in Crown Court matters, the BCM process has encountered both acclaim and criticism. In this matter, despite procedural delays primarily attributable to administrative and funding obstacles, the case was managed within acceptable timelines relative to the norms for acquisitive offences. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. Among the aspects deserving judicial notice is the recruitment and professional dedication of retail staff in establishments frequently subjected to theft and harassment. Survey data and victim impact statements reveal increased levels of workplace anxiety, absenteeism, and economic hardship due to lost revenues and insurance premiums. This court accords full recognition to the cumulative impact these offences exert on such workers and small business owners, many of whom possess limited access to formal support mechanisms. The difficulties encountered by victims stand as a reminder that criminal offence impact extends beyond immediate financial loss to encompass emotional wellbeing and community cohesion. The contemporaneity of the offences with rising national levels of street homelessness and associated antisocial behaviour also warrants consideration. The court is aware of empirical data suggesting an uptick in visible deprivation within urban centres, presenting complex challenges to policing, social work, and housing providers. Negotiating these interlocking demands requires delicate balance; nonetheless, enforcement of property crimes remains essential to maintaining public confidence. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. The Probation Service’s preparation of pre-sentence reports in shoplifting cases faces considerable challenge amidst staffing shortages and increasing caseloads. Probation officers tasked with compiling assessments must navigate incomplete information, inconsistencies in defendant disclosures, and resource constraints. These factors inevitably impact upon the thoroughness of community risk and needs analyses. As noted by internal Ministry of Justice reports, rising demand in probation services for individuals convicted of acquisitive offences has not been consistently matched by proportional increases in support capacity, creating a structural tension between risk management and rehabilitation delivery. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. The forensic psychiatric evaluation, commissioned following repeated defence application and Legal Aid approval, comprises detailed psychometric testing and clinical interviews conducted by Dr Emily Greaves, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist. Dr Greaves’ report, dated 1 August 2025, states the absence of any major psychiatric disorder but identifies features suggestive of impulse control difficulties and mild substance misuse, notably recreational cannabis use, which the defendant described as an established coping mechanism. Dr Greaves underlines that the defendant exhibits limited insight into the consequences of offending and has declined prior engagement with community-based interventions or support groups. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. In the context of sentencing, the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline places emphasis on the seriousness of harm, culpability, and mitigating features such as appellant’s personal circumstances and early guilty plea. Credit for guilty plea accords only partially here, given its late entry at the conclusion of the pre-trial hearing. As established in R v. Lawrence [2022] EWCA Crim 1901, tardy pleas warrant reduced discount, reflecting diminished procedural economies and limited mitigation of victim distress. It is also necessary to reference R v. Latimer [2021] EWCA Crim 947, a case involving repeat shop theft with a comparable offender profile. That case upheld an immediate custodial sentence due to sustained offending, which persisted despite warnings and previous convictions, offering some instructive parallels. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The court acknowledges the defendant’s current housing situation, which includes living temporarily in a hostel provision managed by the Brighton Homeless Outreach Programme. While the volatility of such accommodation arrangements undoubtedly contributes to instability, it does not furnish immunity from lawful sanction. The local authority’s ongoing efforts to provide supported transition housing and financial advice — although strained by resource limitations — constitute a framework within which the defendant might otherwise have sought assistance. The court also notes correspondence from the Brighton Foodbank Coordination Centre, which confirms intermittent engagement by the defendant, although a pattern of sporadic attendance and vow of self-reliance is evident. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. It is appropriate to reflect, perhaps parenthetically, upon the repeated administrative burdens that schemes such as MARAC (Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference) and MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements) place on already stretched personnel in police and probation organisations. These mechanisms, while vital in high-risk contexts, generate significant procedural overhead and demand precise coordination to avoid duplication. Acquisitive offences rarely engage these arrangements but knowledge of their operational pressures offers context to the systemic pressures on personnel managing multiple interacting risks. On the question of co-defendants and associated parties, I emphasise that none have standing in these proceedings. Information about prior criminal histories of familial relations, as well as unrelated investigations, are expressly excluded from my consideration save insofar as they directly relate to the defendant’s personal circumstances. Similarly, the existence of third-party complaints lodged contemporaneously with the offence dates — including noise abatement notices served upon landlords or unrelated minor disturbances reported at neighbouring properties — have no bearing on the correctly focused sentencing exercise before this court. Finally, the court recognises, without any unilateral inference, that the impact upon the defendant of the stress attendant upon court processes is not inconsiderable but must be weighed alongside the rights and interests of victims and the public. The sentencing decision will be informed by the upcoming pre-sentence report, instructed pursuant to standard protocol. This report will set out a comprehensive assessment of Mr H’s background, offending behaviour, risk factors, and pathways to rehabilitation, incorporating recommendations for any structured interventions deemed practicable and effective. This report will also assess the potential utility of cognitive behavioural programmes designed to tackle offending-related thinking patterns, alongside evaluation of any financial advisory support needs and substance misuse services. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, the 14th of September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged pursuant to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. T2025/14593 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. C. Broadwell Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The prosecution’s case, advanced by the Crown Prosecution Service and corroborated by evidence from local retailers and law enforcement, encompasses a series of offences spanning from late 2023 through to the spring of this year, occurring predominantly within the city centre and adjacent retail precincts. Procedural Background Your matter was first brought before the Magistrates’ Court on 22 April 2025 following your arrest on 18 April 2025. The arrest itself culminated from a multi-agency operational effort, involving the Avon and Somerset Constabulary’s Retail Crime Unit, the Bristol Business Crime Reduction Initiative, and support from local CCTV monitoring centres. The coordination of these bodies aimed to address a noticeable increase in detected shopliftings within high footfall areas, which had placed considerable pressure on both policing and commercial stakeholders. Following your initial appearance, the case was committed to this Crown Court in accordance with the statutory scheme set out in Part 2 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. That decision reflected the seriousness of the allegations, the scale of offending, and the value and nature of the goods involved. The Better Case Management (BCM) regime has been applied throughout, with the listing of key procedural hearings adhering generally to the recommended time limits set out in the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR). The importance of adherence to BCM and the wider objectives of the CPR—to promote the efficient conduct of criminal proceedings and reduce unnecessary delay—cannot be overstated. It is regrettable, however, that in this case there were unavoidable adjournments related to the delayed assignment of legal representation under the Legal Aid scheme, as well as the late completion of expert reports requested on behalf of the defence. Those delays, while understandable in some respects given systemic pressures on public defence resources, have added to the elapsed time since the offences. It is well understood that Legal Aid funding decisions, oversight, and authorisation processes have become increasingly challenging of late. In particular, defence counsel in this case reported frequent difficulty in obtaining prompt approval for instructing an independent forensic psychologist, a matter that echoes wider critiques heard in courts throughout the jurisdiction. The incompleteness and slow turnaround times of such applications serve to frustrate not only defendants’ access to a fair and timely hearing but also the court’s own capacity to issue sentence expeditiously. Equally notable is the workload facing probation services, who are tasked with preparing comprehensive pre-sentence reports under increasing caseload demands. Staff shortages, budget limitations, and regional disparities in available rehabilitative programmes hamper the thorough assessment of offenders with complex needs. This systemic strain has indirect but salient consequences for the pace and quality of sentencing decisions in cases such as yours. Against this backdrop, the court records its appreciation for the conscientious efforts of those working within the public and voluntary sectors to mitigate the impact of retail crime. The Bristol Retail Initiative’s liaison officers have provided victim impact statements and participated in information sharing, despite the strain of high demand. Their work, as described in correspondence dated 5 August 2025, underscores the tangible economic and psychological effects persistent shoplifting imposes on staff morale and business viability. The facts you admit, and have been found proven beyond reasonable doubt, follow a pattern common in certain cases of acquisitive offending. Paradoxically, while low-value items may individually seem insignificant, the cumulative disruption they cause is manifestly not. It has been observed in similar cases that the strain on retail employees includes increased anxiety, altered scheduling, and a palpable sense of insecurity, factors which ripple outwards affecting community cohesion and public confidence. To situate this case in the wider jurisprudential landscape, I draw the court’s attention to a series of appellate decisions which, although concerning different factual matrices, nonetheless provide valuable commentary on the sentencing approach to theft and associated offences. The decision in R v. Carlin [2017] EWCA Crim 1234 confirmed the principle that sentence should reflect not only the immediate and direct loss suffered by victims but also the broader societal implications of persistent, calculated dishonesty targeting vulnerable community resources. In that matter, the Court of Appeal emphasised the need for proportionality tempered with deterrence. In addition, recent rulings such as R v. Denholm [2022] EWCA Crim 1998 warn against complacency in sentencing what might superficially appear as “minor” offences. Denholm concerned offences of fraudulent trading and deliberate evasion of regulatory controls, yet the court’s reflections on the erosion of trust and undermining of commercial integrity resonate strongly in acquisitive crime cases. Similarly, in R v. Mallard [2019] EWCA Crim 1145, involving theft of goods from multiple retail outlets, the court upheld a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment where recidivism, principled planning, and disregard for informal diversion were evident. That case underscored the judiciary’s willingness to impose custodial sentences even for non-violent offences when patterns of offending demonstrate ongoing risk. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. Furthermore, the sentencing framework articulated by the Sentencing Council in its 2024 revision of the Theft Offences Guideline stresses the significance of aggravating and mitigating factors such as the scale, frequency, and context of offending, along with the defendant's previous record and level of remorse. Guided by that framework, courts are directed to consider not merely the monetary loss but also the wider impact on victims and the community. The fact that in this matter your offending extended over multiple incidents, included a variety of goods commonly targeted for resale or personal consumption, and caused discernible disruption to local businesses, reflects elevated culpability within the lower tiers of the guideline. This approach echoes the rationale set out in R v. Phearson [2020] EWCA Crim 1573, which addressed similar offending involving multiple retail contexts with disproportionate community impact. In your case, the late admission of guilt—coming only after substantial evidence had been marshalled—is noted but does not attract full credit. The Court of Appeal in R v. Kingston [2023] EWCA Crim 1086 confirmed that reductions for guilty pleas hinge on prompt acceptance of responsibility, with diminished credit appropriate where pleas are delayed until trial. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. It has also been necessary to consider psychiatric and psychological assessments submitted in support of the defence mitigation. The report prepared by Dr Chantelle Mizrahi, consulting clinical psychologist, dated 10 August 2025, concluded that while there is no evidence of severe mental illness, there are traits suggestive of attentional difficulties and impulsivity. The report notes a longstanding history of episodic substance misuse, primarily involving cannabis and occasional alcohol, contributing to executive dysfunction. The report’s author emphasizes a background of precarious housing and unstable social supports, factors which, while compounding risk, do not obviate personal responsibility. Dr Mizrahi recommends engagement with supervised cognitive behavioural therapy to address impulsivity and decision-making, alongside social support interventions targeting housing and employment. Notably, the assessment cautions against over-attribution to psychological factors alone, highlighting the necessity of a holistic approach encompassing social and systemic variables. The court welcomes this perspective, aligning with contemporary principles espoused in the Criminal Justice Mental Health Review board’s latest directive of 2024. Importantly, no diagnosis of psychosis or affective disorder was made, and no suggestion of diminished responsibility under the terms of the Mental Health Act 1983 can be entertained here. That observation is consistent with the jurisprudence in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, where neither mental disorder nor reduced culpability justified mitigation in offences involving property destruction following arson. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. Correspondence received from the Bristol Probation Service, dated 2 September 2025, indicates that your engagement with voluntary agencies and probation-led support prior to sentencing has been variable and inconsistent. Your failure to maintain appointments and participate fully in preliminary interventions is troubling and reduces confidence in prospects for rehabilitation within the community. The probation officer’s report highlights systemic challenges faced locally, including staffing shortages and waiting lists for cognitive restructuring programmes and substance misuse treatment. These obstacles serve to intensify pressures on those seeking to reduce their likelihood of reoffending, but they do not absolve individual responsibility. Parallel to this, the court has received pertinent submissions from the Bristol Community Retail Alliance, which stresses the cumulative business impact of persistent theft on small and independent retailers. According to their report dated 29 August 2025, repeat shoplifting incidents in this region have resulted in loss of retail outlets and increased business insurance premiums, effects threatening the vitality of certain trading districts. Such submissions, while presenting a macroeconomic analysis beyond the remit of this court, provide valuable contextualisation of the harms caused by your actions. It is a stark reminder that acquisitive offences do not occur in isolation but intersect with broader patterns of social and economic vulnerability. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. The court is also mindful of the procedural history in this complex matter, including a period of non-cooperation preceding your eventual guilty plea. This pattern is not uncommon, as reflected in case management observations by HM Courts & Tribunals Service, wherein late admissions, though permitted as a matter of law, often lead to inefficiencies and resource strains. At the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 10 July 2025, you entered a bare guilty plea after previously maintaining your innocence. Such a plea, devoid of contextual explanation or early acceptance, is accorded only limited mitigation credit under prevailing sentencing principles, as reaffirmed in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029. This latter case concerned offences of arson endangering residents in social housing. While the specifics differ markedly, the guidance on plea timing and resultant sentence adjustment applies equally here. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. Furthermore, it merits noting that one co-defendant in a related matter, charged separately, remains currently at large, having failed to appear following bail conditions being set. Their role in separate counts of supply of Class B substances and possession of a bladed article during a school event, though not connected directly to you, provides additional illustration of the challenges faced by law enforcement in managing multi-faceted criminal networks. While the presence of co-offenders and ancillary offences is regrettable, the court’s focus remains firmly on the individual behaviour and culpability of the persons before it. In the course of this hearing, and in preceding correspondence, the defence has highlighted your difficult upbringing, citing family fragmentation and periods in local care institutions. Such background factors are acknowledged as relevant contextual elements; however, they serve neither to excuse nor to explain fully the offending. As noted in R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, complex personal histories may inform mitigation but do not displace accountability. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. Moreover, the court has reviewed letters of support addressed to the registry from various community organisations, including the Bristol Homelessness Project and the Youth Outreach Foundation, which provide testimony to your character and ongoing vulnerabilities. These documents reflect common challenges such as housing instability, limited employment prospects, and episodic mental health concerns. The voluntary sector’s role in assisting those caught in cycles of criminality is invaluable and appreciated. Nonetheless, their good offices cannot substitute for the deterrent and protective functions of the criminal justice system in cases where offending persists beyond intervention. Parallel to these considerations is the observation, often repeated in appellate pronouncements, that sentencing must walk a narrow path—balancing the legitimate aims of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. The court must further reflect on the salutary principle that a sentence must be proportionate to the offending and the offender alike. Guidelines such as those enshrined in R v. Wells [2018] EWCA Crim 567, concerning the necessity for sentences not to be arbitrary or excessive, are paramount. Yet proportion must not be equated with leniency. As the Court of Appeal has underscored in R v. Easton [2019] EWCA Crim 1214, persistent offending from those who display little regard for law or previous warnings demands firm and clear sentences to preserve public confidence. In the present matter, the persistence, planning, and repeated nature of your conduct elevate culpability beyond a momentary lapse. The impact extends beyond pure financial loss to the intangible but critical costs borne by employees’ morale, community security, and the retail sector’s viability. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. The Court acknowledges, with some reluctance, the ongoing pressure on judicial resources due to the increase in cases where delayed guilty pleas and complex procedural histories prolong resolution. These effects complicate sentencing not only for individual defendants but also impose burdens on court lists, witnesses, victims, and prosecuting authorities. This court is also aware, from reports including the recent Ministry of Justice statistics, that acquisitive crime remains a prevalent concern nationally, occupying significant police and probation service bandwidth at a time when those bodies are stretched thin by other demands including serious violence and cybercrime investigations. Whilst the current offences—predicated upon theft—do not involve violence or threats, the insidious nature of repeat shoplifting contributes to what might be described as the attritional erosion of communal trust and safety, a point brought into sharp relief in contemporary criminological debates. In conclusion, I intend to adjourn sentence to allow for the timely preparation of a pre-sentence report by the probation service. This report should provide a thorough assessment of your personal circumstances, offending behaviour, risk of further reoffending, and suitability for available rehabilitative measures. The report should incorporate consideration of the recommendations contained in Dr Mizrahi’s psychological assessment, including any appropriate targeted intervention for impulsivity and substance misuse. Additionally, the report should seek to evaluate your engagement with voluntary sector support, housing stability, and the viability of a structured community sentence option. The court will further require analysis of any mitigating personal factors alongside a detailed risk assessment to inform the eventual determination as to whether immediate custody is warranted or whether community measures, possibly with a rehabilitation activity requirement, may be adequate. These sentencing remarks are delivered this 14th day of September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. Counsel for the Crown, Ms Eleanor Franks, and for the defence, Mr Tom Godfrey, both participated fully and diligently. The court regrets the ongoing delays attributable in part to administrative and resource constraints faced by the Legal Aid Agency. You, Mr H, are hereby advised of your right of appeal against sentence within 28 days, as provided for under sections 108 to 110 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. At this time, no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs remain reserved pending further consideration. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELMONT R v. MR H Case No. T2026/04617 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. Leighton Filed: 15 November 2026 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence in relation to a charge of theft, specifically shoplifting from various retail premises, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a period extending over the course of the last two years. This court is situated within the jurisdiction of the Midlands Circuit, where such offences have seen a notable increase in volume, taxing the resources of law enforcement and the wider judicial system. Procedural Background The matter began before this court after you were apprehended on 12 August 2026, subsequent to a detailed investigation orchestrated by the Belmont Retail Crime Unit in tandem with the local Community Safety Partnership. The investigation, prompted by complaints from several independent convenience stores and pharmacy outlets, revealed a recurring pattern of theft involving similar goods taken in quick succession. Not unlike many such investigations, the initial reports were treated as discrete thefts, a notion dispelled only upon collation of evidence and repeated analysis of CCTV footage by specialist crime analysts assigned to the Intelligence Unit. It is a recurring theme within the sphere of retail crime — what appears prima facie to be a petty acquisitive act masks a more troubling phenomenon of persistent and systematic offending. This court is painfully cognisant of the heavy burden that such cases impose upon both the police and judicial infrastructure. The painstaking review of video evidence, often of poor quality or disrupted by technical issues such as timestamp errors or misaligned camera angles, forms but one layer of complexity. Moreover, securing statements from retail staff, many of whom are part-time, transient, or operating under high-stress conditions, further complicates the evidential picture. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. Throughout the course of the investigations, it became apparent that your modus operandi involved deliberate timing to coincide with moments when store staffing was at its most vulnerable, including shift changes and restocking periods, thus enabling concealment of goods under clothing or within bags with minimal risk of detection. The repeated utilisation of distraction techniques, including feigning calls on mobile phones and engaging staff with queries unrelated to purchases, indicated a degree of sophistication beyond mere impulsivity. The police apprehension was the result of coordinated efforts involving on-street surveillance, liaison with transport authorities, and utilisation of local intelligence-sharing protocols. Arrested at your residence in mid-August, you were subsequently interviewed under caution. Initial denials gave way to admissions following presentation of a recovery of stolen goods hidden within your domicile. Forensic examination confirmed item matches with those reported missing by retailers. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. It is relevant to note that your case has proceeded under the auspices of the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, aimed at expediting case progression while ensuring that evidential sufficiency is established early. The court records the cooperation between the prosecution, defence, and court staff in navigating disclosure, which was timely and, importantly, comprehensive. However, there was a regrettable delay occasioned by necessary applications for additional psychological assessment reports and an adjournment necessitated by pending evaluation from the probation service, the details of which will be expounded upon below. More broadly, the court observes with not inconsiderable concern the increasing complexity and systemic pressures faced by magistrates’ and Crown Courts alike in dealing with acquisitive crime cases. From listing constraints, intermittent staffing shortages—particularly of trained court ushers and administration officers—to the ongoing challenges posed by intermittent adjournments, often linked to Legal Aid certification, the cumulative effect contributes to longer waiting times and increased anxiety for all parties involved, including victims and witnesses. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. The Theft Act 1968, as the governing statute, defines shoplifting as the dishonest appropriation of another's property with the intention to permanently deprive. Substantial judicial consideration has been accorded to the formulation and interpretation of “dishonesty,” notably in cases such as R v. Ghosh [1982] and, more recently, Ivey v. Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67, which clarified the test for dishonesty in criminal contexts. It is pertinent also to recall the precedents set in cases such as R v. Graham [2020] EWCA Crim 875, in which the Court of Appeal emphasised that offenders engaging in systematic theft from retail premises may be subject to aggravated sentencing considerations when the offending demonstrates deliberation, targeting of vulnerable individuals (including staff) or when the theft undermines public confidence and security. Additionally, in R v. Fenwick [2019] EWCA Crim 638, the appellate court highlighted the impact of persistent retail theft on the broader economic health of local communities, noting that even low-value offences cumulatively damage small businesses disproportionately compared to larger corporate chains. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. The Crown has been represented throughout by Ms Diana Fawkes, whose submissions have been measured yet robust in underscoring the seriousness of the offences. Ms Fawkes has emphasised the aggravating factors particular to your offending, including the repeated breach of previous community disposal orders and the resultant impact on retail employees’ wellbeing and store security. We acknowledge the diligence with which the Crown has pursued the case, whilst maintaining proper procedural fairness. Defence counsel, Mr Bernard Hopewell, acting under authorised legal aid, has provided steady advocacy and has, at various hearings, sought to contextualise your behaviour within the framework of your background, mental health status, and periods of housing instability. It is noted that Mr Hopewell applied for, and successfully obtained, funding for a clinical psychologist’s report, which delayed proceedings slightly but added a valuable dimension to the court’s understanding of your circumstances. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. In this regard, the court is mindful of the overburdened state of public mental health services nationally. NHS England reports record waiting lists for psychological therapies and clinical psychiatry assessments, with many defendants facing prolonged intervals before specialist appointments can be secured. This creates a perennial dilemma for the criminal justice system, which must navigate the tension between timely adjudication and the imperative adequately to assess and address underlying health needs. The clinical psychologist’s report, authored by Dr Victoria Shen, provides a thorough evaluation of your mental state. Dr Shen observes traits consistent with impulsivity and mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety and depressive episodes, though explicitly rules out major psychiatric illness. The report indicates your sporadic engagement with voluntary support services and highlights that economic distress coupled with unstable housing has likely exacerbated behavioural issues. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. Similarly, the probation service has furnished a pre-sentence report authored by Officer Martin Lowry, which includes an assessment of risk factors and proposes available rehabilitative interventions. Officer Lowry comments on your history of acquisitive offending with emphasis on shoplifting but notes an absence of any recorded violence or threats in association with your crimes. He indicates a medium risk of reoffending, particularly given the limited uptake of proactive support offers. The report suggests that an intervention programme focusing on cognitive behavioural techniques might reduce impulsivity and criminal cognitions. It further recommends vocational rehabilitation components, including money management workshops and engagement with local housing support agencies. These assessments have informed the court’s view of both your personal circumstances and the public interest at stake. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. The court has received multiple victim impact statements from retail staff affected by your conduct. These personal accounts describe feelings of fear, diminished job satisfaction, and the need for enhanced security measures, including restricted shelf access and altered staffing rotas, at some stores. While no physical harm was caused, the psychological toll and workplace disruption are evident. Particularly poignant is the statement from a mid-career employee at a family-run pharmacy, who reported anxiety severe enough to consider early retirement. Such evidence underlines the point that shoplifting, while sometimes dismissed colloquially as a “victimless crime,” carries real consequences for individuals, families, and the local business ecosystem. The court acknowledges the measured demeanour of all victims who contributed statements, recognising the emotional resilience required to come forward. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. The broader social context must also be borne in mind. There is an ever-worsening crisis of street homelessness, particularly among young adults and those with histories of trauma or addiction. In the boroughs surrounding Belmont, rough sleeping numbers have escalated, burdening support services and creating complex challenges for criminal justice and social care professionals alike. While such factors may offer background, it is imperative that they do not eclipse accountability. Throughout the case management process, the court has noted the ongoing difficulties involving timely legal aid authorisations. Such delays, particularly in respect of expert psychological assessments and instructed defence counsel, are detrimental to the efficient administration of justice. They compound pressures on court lists and impede meaningful engagement with rehabilitative opportunities. This tribunal trusts that forthcoming reviews within the Legal Aid Agency will address systemic bottlenecks to ensure that timely access to expert resources becomes the norm rather than the exception. Meanwhile, practitioners, courts, and defendants alike remain caught in the consequences of underfunding and procedural backlog. In closing, I take this opportunity to record thanks to the staff maintaining courtroom order and administration, whose professionalism ensures the integrity and dignity of proceedings. The recently completed refurbishment of Court 6 at the Belmont Crown Court has improved accessibility and conditions for witnesses and defendants alike. Furthermore, I acknowledge the efforts of the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose multi-agency approach provides vital support to impacted retailers, facilitating information sharing and victim support despite the austerity faced at many operational levels. Turning expressly to sentencing, the principles articulated in the Sentencing Council’s guideline for Theft Offences provide a framework for proportionate punishment. The seriousness of offending is gauged not only by the value and number of items taken but by the cumulative harm, the offender’s intent, and the overall context. This court has to balance the need for punishment and deterrence with the prospects for rehabilitation. It bears in mind your previous convictions for similar thefts, your history of periodic engagement with, and sometimes rejection of, available support services, and the degree to which your actions have disrupted business operations and staff wellbeing. The authorities make clear that persistent acquisitive offending, lacking evidence of significant mitigation or change, often warrants custodial sentences to protect public confidence and deter others. Nonetheless, sentencing must be individualized and take full account of your circumstances, including mental health and housing status. Previous jurisprudence also guides the approach to guilty plea credit. As per R v Ellwood [2024] EWCA Crim 505 and the more recent decision in R v Harwood [2025] EWCA Crim 178, discounts granted for a plea of guilty should properly reflect the timing and sincerity of the admission, with last-minute pleas meriting less credit. This court is thus required to apply a measured discretion, encouraging early acceptance of responsibility but not rewarding tactical delay. I have considered all relevant case law, professional reports, victim impact evidence, and have listened carefully to the submissions made by counsel on both sides. Sentencing is adjourned pending receipt of an updated pre-sentence report, which should incorporate any further developments, including progress regarding rehabilitation engagement and housing stability. The probation service is directed to explore the availability of bespoke interventions tailored to acquisitive offending, including cognitive skills programmes and financial management support, which the court regards as potentially valuable. This adjournment also allows for any further representations that either party wishes to make in light of the material considered today. These sentencing remarks are ordered as of this date, 15 November 2026, delivered in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Belmont. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELMONT R v. MR H Case No. T2025/12387 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. W. Callaghan Filed: 18 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction arising from a series of theft offences from retail premises, contrary to the provisions of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending took place intermittently over a period extending from late 2023 through to early 2025 and involved a variety of outlets located within the Belmont metropolitan area and its environs. Procedural History Your case was initiated following reports by local shopkeepers to the Belmont Business Crime Reduction Partnership, which had noted an extraordinary increase in thefts apparently linked by certain behavioural and physical markers observable on closed-circuit television footage. The Borough Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police Service undertook the investigative lead, involving collaboration with the City Retail Liaison Team and the Forensic Evidence Bureau. You were apprehended on 15 March 2025 in circumstances that involved coordination over multiple jurisdictions, given that offences had been recorded in the wards of Westbrook, Ashford, and North Belmont. The investigatory sequence was marked by protracted surveillance, both physical and digital, including but not limited to the analysis of transport pass swipes, mobile device logs, and inter-agency data comparison intended to verify your movements in conjunction with the timing of offences. Such an operation is resource-heavy and requires careful interdepartmental communication, which, as is often the case, presented some practical difficulties due to overlapping operational periods of different task forces. It is necessary to place on record the court’s gratitude to the officers involved, who displayed commendable diligence in balancing the acute pressures of urban policing with the demands of this protracted enquiry. The investigative effort was, regrettably, hampered to an extent by delays in the collation of body-worn camera footage and the necessity to re-interview several non-compliant witnesses, which extended the time until charge. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. You attended the police station voluntarily following an earlier invitation, where you were interviewed and subsequently released pending further enquiries. Following the analysis of forensic evidence recovered from locations linked to the offences, including fibre analysis and CCTV corroboration, you were arrested and charged on 3 April 2025 with a consolidated count representative of multiple theft incidents. It should be noted that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of funding for your defence was, regrettably, far from prompt. Initial requests for funding to secure expert psychiatric assessment were met with procedural back-and-forth, exacerbated by the agency’s requirement for additional paperwork and clarification of eligibility. This contributed to a delay spanning some six weeks, frustrating both the defence and the court’s timetable. Such administrative hurdles serve only to strain an already overburdened court system. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. Following charge, the matter was listed before this court under the Better Case Management (BCM) provisions, which are intended to ensure timely progression whilst maintaining procedural fairness. This process, first introduced in the late 2010s to replace outdated pre-trial protocols, emphasises early identification of issues likely to affect the trial and allocates resources accordingly. Submissions were made on your behalf by Mr Elliot Wren, instructed under a representation order. The defence took a standard approach, seeking to place reliance on your personal circumstances, including prior adversity and reported mental health difficulties. At the initial plea hearing, you entered a conditional plea, seeking further reports before final determination. On 14 September 2025, you altered that plea to guilty. It is pertinent to observe that your initial hesitation to plead guilty is a pattern not uncommon among repeat offenders in shoplifting cases, as noted in R v. Daniels [2019] EWCA Crim 457, where the Court of Appeal recognised the interplay between denial and ingrained patterns of criminal conduct. However, in Daniels, the delay in plea was deemed to have limited mitigation effect, given the scale of evidence. We also recall the judgments in R v. Khatri [2021] EWCA Crim 811 and R v. Simmons [2023] EWCA Crim 226, which specifically addressed sentencing principles in the context of persistent acquisitive offenders. Those cases underscore the necessity for sentences to reflect not only the immediate harm but the deterrent message required for persistent misconduct, even where violence or threats are absent. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. The Court notes with respectful attention the victim impact statements collated by the Belmont Retail Consortium. These highlight the considerable emotional and economic toll experienced by employees and business owners alike. While the financial value of individual items taken may appear modest, the aggregate effect — including staff distress and loss of business — is substantial. Indeed, it is worth reiterating the findings drawn from the well-documented Research Report on Retail Crime published by the National Retail Federation in 2024, which emphasised that even low-value theft can precipitate increased operational costs leading to staff reductions and reduced opening hours. These consequences disproportionately impact vulnerable community members, including elderly shoppers and those with mobility impairments, who rely on the familiarity and accessibility of local stores. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. Dr Sarah Weir, a consultant clinical psychologist instructed by the defence, provided a detailed assessment. Her report, dated 1 October 2025, notes that you exhibit characteristics consistent with borderline personality traits and episodes of situational anxiety, though no frank psychosis or major mental illness. The report cites a history of intermittent engagement with community mental health teams but also highlights patterns of non-compliance and missed appointments. Dr Weir’s analysis discusses the psychological underpinnings of your offending behaviour, particularly in the context of impulsivity and fleeting financial crises. She highlights a lack of sustained engagement with available support services, while observing that the partial nature of your disclosure renders some clinical conclusions tentative. While the court gives due weight to this clinical perspective, it must also balance such considerations against the protection of the public and the need for deterrence. Individual vulnerabilities, important though they are, cannot wholly account for repeat offending that accumulates a significant administrative cost for law enforcement and commercial sectors. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. The pre-sentence report submitted by Probation Officer Ms Caroline Hewitt presents a thorough social and criminological profile. Ms Hewitt notes that you are currently unemployed, residing in temporary accommodation provided by the city council, and have limited family contact. She refers to prior convictions for similar offences, including a conditional discharge imposed in 2021. Ms Hewitt expresses concern about high levels of unaddressed debt, unstable accommodation, and a tendency to disengage from rehabilitative programmes. She recommends consideration of a community order with rehabilitation requirements focusing on cognitive behavioural therapy and financial management. It is relevant to note, in this context, the systemic constraints faced by probation services nationally, including staff shortages and burgeoning caseloads, which can adversely affect the continuity of supervision and support. The impact of these institutional challenges is well documented in the 2025 Annual Review of the Probation Service, highlighting that many individuals with complex needs receive fragmented intervention. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. The court is also informed that the Belmont Housing Authority has been involved with your case intermittently, although records indicate periodic reluctance on your part to engage fully with housing support workers. The precariousness of your residential situation reflects wider societal trends, including escalating homelessness rates and the deteriorating availability of affordable housing options—a topic beyond the scope of this judgment but pressing for policymakers. I acknowledge various letters of support received from community organisations, including the Belmont Food Bank and Northside Community Outreach, attesting to your recent attempts to access basic assistance notwithstanding longstanding challenges. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The relevant legislation, as reflected in statute and case precedent, centres on the Theft Act 1968 (section 1). The Sentencing Council Guideline on Theft Offences (effective from 1 February 2024) defines the approach for sentences proportionate to the offence’s seriousness, accounting for factors including planning, persistence, value, and impact. Paragraphs 3.4 and 3.5 of the guideline stress the cumulative harm caused by repeated low-level offending and the consequential necessity to impose sentences that reflect both individual culpability and general deterrence. Credit for guilty pleas, meanwhile, is set out in paragraphs 8 and 9, highlighting the relationship between timing and the extent of mitigation. The jurisprudence confirms that late guilty pleas, while meriting some credit, attract less substantial discounts than early admissions, as reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal in R v. Edwards [2022] EWCA Crim 1452. Furthermore, in R v. Matthews [2020] EWCA Crim 1586, the court emphasised that persistent acquisitive offending, even absent violence, can justifiably result in immediate custodial sentences to prevent further harm and signal societal condemnation. It is also necessary to acknowledge the court’s duty to consider the offender’s circumstances in accordance with the principle articulated in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, section 142, to ensure that sentences are proportionate and take into account rehabilitation prospects. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. The court notes, as an enduring challenge to the criminal justice system at large, the ongoing capacity constraints within forensic laboratories, which occasion delays in the processing of evidence in similar cases. The forensic backlog has been repeatedly highlighted in Parliamentary committee reports, with recommendations pending regarding increased funding and digitisation. Moreover, the rise of so-called “influencer culture” on social media platforms has, anecdotally at least, impacted certain patterns of minor offending behaviour. The allure of online notoriety and challenge videos sometimes intersects with shoplifting among young adults. While there is no direct evidence to suggest your conduct was influenced in this way, the phenomenon warrants awareness. It is regrettable that the media response to cases of this nature remains modest. As has been observed, there is a selective interest in crime reporting, with petty theft rarely capturing sustained attention except when linked to nationally notorious individuals or spectacular incidents. Lastly, I acknowledge the assistance of court staff and legal representatives in managing the often complex logistics of such cases in a judicial environment still recovering from pandemic disruptions and intermittent industrial action. Mr H, in the light of the complexity of factors identified and the serious nature of your offending, it is appropriate that sentencing awaits the preparation and consideration of a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing your risk, needs, and suitability for any rehabilitative intervention. You are hereby remanded on conditional bail pending that report, which I direct be completed within four weeks. At the sentencing hearing, I shall consider the full range of sentencing options available, including immediate custody, suspended sentences, or community orders with tailored requirements. I express appreciation to Ms Jennifer Aldridge, counsel for the Crown, and to Mr Elliot Wren for the defence, both of whom have submitted articulate written representations and oral submissions. These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge D. W. Callaghan, issued on 18 October 2025 in Court 5 at Belmont Crown Court. The hearing has been conducted in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. You are reminded of your right to appeal against any sentence imposed within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIXTON R v. MR H Case No. T2025/14637 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. GRANVILLE Filed: 17 August 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in connection with offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely retail theft, committed across multiple premises in the London Borough of Brixton and adjoining districts. The offending conduct spanned a period from November 2022 through April 2025 and involved repeated incidents of shoplifting targeting small-to-medium sized retail establishments, including but not limited to convenience stores, pharmacies, and charity outlets. Procedural History and Court Administration Following your arrest on 15 April 2025, this case has been managed under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework intended to enhance timeliness and transparency in Crown Court cases. The procedural trajectory has involved several standard hearings: an initial appearance, a plea and trial preparation hearing, and the listing of a sentencing hearing. Throughout, efforts have been made by the prosecution and defence teams to maintain compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules and to secure an effective listing to minimise disruption to the court diary and to the public. I note with some regret the recurring challenges posed by Legal Aid administration in this jurisdiction. In particular, the defence’s early application to instruct a forensic and clinical forensic psychologist with expertise in patterns of acquisitive offending encountered protracted delay. The Legal Aid Agency’s response was slow and inconsistent, leading to an unnecessary postponement of the expert’s involvement and the subsequent adjournment of this matter in late June 2025. These deferrals have placed additional burdens upon all parties, and, importantly, have delayed the process of addressing your circumstances fully and fairly. The BCM process is nowadays seen as an essential mechanism to identify evidential issues at an early stage, to facilitate disclosure, and to avoid unnecessary hearing adjournments. It is a framework for recognising that even relatively low-value theft offences can place considerable strain on the criminal justice system and that an efficient pathway is beneficial to all stakeholders. Here, the parties have endeavoured to uphold the spirit and letter of the BCM provisions, with the Crown providing timely disclosure and the defence engaging to the extent possible given resource constraints. A plea hearing held on 3 May 2025 saw you enter a not guilty plea. Subsequently, however, following the disclosure of additional CCTV evidence, statements from store management, and the inclusion of forensic analysis, a late guilty plea was tendered on 11 August 2025. This late plea, while accepted, attracts less credit than an early one and demonstrates the type of tactical timing frequently seen in this category of case. It is worth observing, as other courts have done, that delayed pleas frustrate the goal of securing procedural economy and can add considerably to the anxiety suffered by witnesses, many of whom are employees on minimal pay and with limited job security. This court does not discount the propriety of exercising one’s right to trial; however, it does maintain a firm view on the consequences of plea timing, as reflected in R v. Hamlyn [2019] EWCA Crim 354, where the Court of Appeal emphasized that “the timing of the plea, in respect of the nature of the evidence assembled, affects the discount due, not the mere fact of the plea.” The unfortunate reality—one this court contends with frequently—is the persistent tension between efficient case progression and procedural safeguards designed to protect the rights of defendants. Your case is emblematic in this regard, with no shortage of procedural activity that might strike an observer as complex given the relatively modest financial value of the items involved. The court further appreciates the role of the Brixton Business Crime Partnership and the Metropolitan Police Dedicated Shoplifting Team, whose input in collating evidence and victim impact has been noteworthy. I acknowledge their efforts in collating statements and liaising with affected retailers. The social and economic impact on these often independently run businesses must not be underestimated, even when offences appear, on the surface, trifling. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. Consideration of Legal Context and Relevant Authority It is appropriate at this juncture to reference the statutory and appellate framework within which the court operates. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive the owner of it. While shoplifting at one-time incidents is often handled summarily or diverted, repeated or systematic offending of this nature rightly receives close judicial scrutiny and may warrant custody. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences, updated as recently as 2024, draws attention to aggravating factors such as persistence, premeditation, the vulnerability of victims, and the impact on trade and employment. Attention must therefore be paid not solely to the value of the goods stolen but to the broader social and economic harms. I am mindful of the decision in R v. Gallagher [2020] EWCA Crim 1823, which examined the weight to be attached to patterns of organised retail crime. Although the facts there related largely to co-ordinated group offending and the use of deception, the Court underscored that calculated dishonesty inflicts harm beyond monetary loss, undermining confidence in retail safety and posing challenges to employers and employees alike. The analogy serves, where appropriate, to illustrate that offending which might appear isolated can, in aggregate, provoke significant disruption. The Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v. Howes [2022] EWCA Crim 1519 further reminds sentencing courts that late pleas—especially those made in the face of extensive evidence including forensic corroboration—necessarily attract reduced discounts. Howes concerned a series of aggravated burglaries in which the defendant maintained innocence until the eve of trial, negating much of the customary benefit accorded to early admissions. In similar vein, R v. Summers [2018] EWCA Crim 839 dealt with issues surrounding the willingness of co-defendants to disclose relevant material at full disclosure hearings. It was noted there that incomplete or selective cooperation prejudiced the administration of justice and undermined the legitimacy of any mitigation claim. While no co-defendants feature in the present matter, the principle that cooperation is a hallmark of credit is ubiquitous. On a different note, it is worth recording, albeit tangentially, the observations in R v. Baines [2017] EWCA Crim 902, where the Court considered the late disclosure of expert evidence in a case concerning environmental offences linked to illegal waste dumping. The case is cited not for its subject matter but for its robust discussion on procedural fairness and the necessity for timely evidence-sharing—a principle equally applicable in criminal jurisdictions to ensure transparency and equity. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. Reflections on Public Services and Institutional Burdens The court is acutely aware of the growing pressures on public services, especially in urban areas where repeated low-level offending absorbs disproportionate police and community resource. The Metropolitan Police Service, to its credit, continues to invest in dedicated teams addressing shoplifting; yet these teams operate against a backdrop of understaffing, escalating demand, and expanding remit. Digital forensics reports in this case, prepared by the Central Metropolitan Forensic Science Unit, illustrate the technical effort required to process and authenticate CCTV footage from multiple premises. Such work—once handled by discrete specialists—is now integrated into broader forensic workflows that also manage violent crime and cyber investigations, often resulting in backlogs. Moreover, the court notes that the Probation Service, already facing considerable reductions in staffing and funding, has struggled to meet expectations in cases requiring nuanced risk management in the community. The post-pandemic environment has exacerbated these challenges, prolonging wait times for assessment and intervention, further complicating sentencing options. The NHS, particularly community mental health services, remains similarly stretched. Waiting lists for psychiatric assessments exceed recommended targets, limiting the timely delivery of specialist input in criminal justice cases where mental health issues may be relevant. The recent report by the Lowndes Health Trust underlined systemic deficiencies in resourcing, treatment continuity, and multidisciplinary coordination, many of which impact defendants like you, Mr H. Correspondence from ShelterSouth, a prominent homelessness and crisis intervention charity operating locally, was received by the court. Their submission speaks to the spike in begging and street homelessness in this diocesan area, which, while not directly your circumstance, forms part of a broader environment in which acquisitive offences and social distress intersect. Such agencies work tirelessly to ameliorate hardship, yet receive minimal statutory funding—a lamentably common refrain in the sector. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. The psychiatric report furnished by Dr Helena Marks, consultant forensic psychiatrist at St. Giles Hospital, was comprehensive and professionally articulated. Dr Marks concludes that you do not meet criteria for an enduring mental illness or psychotic disorder. Instead, there was evidence of mild to moderate anxiety and symptoms indicative of depressive episodes, partly linked to chronic unemployment and social isolation. Of particular note is Dr Marks’s discussion of impulsivity traits compounded by financial insecurity, absent any frank psychopathy or antisocial personality diagnosis. The report cautiously advocates for cognitive-behavioural interventions targeting decision-making patterns and self-regulation, while acknowledging your current reluctance to engage with external services. The probation pre-sentence report, prepared by Ms Lucy Farrell, is detailed and sets out your personal history, family background, and offending pattern. It expresses concerns regarding your housing instability and inconsistent employment record, as well as a noted history of non-compliance with prior community remedies. Ms Farrell highlights your reported history of childhood disruption but cautions against overemphasis on early adversity as being determinative of current behaviour. The report stresses the importance of structured rehabilitative programmes and pragmatic case management to mitigate risk and promote desistance. It is instructive, albeit tangential, to consider the role of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 in limiting the exposure of minor convictions after specified spent periods. This legislation underscores a societal commitment to reintegration and shuns undue penal perpetuity. Nonetheless, persistent and escalating offending as seen here attenuates the relevance of spent convictions, compelling courts to act proportionately. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. Victim personal statements received from the management of a local pharmacy chain describe anxiety and apprehension among staff, some of whom report feeling targeted during your visits. This translates not merely into economic loss but diminished workplace confidence and elevated stress levels. Similarly, a letter from the Brixton Neighbourhood Watch Group draws attention to a perceived uptick in antisocial behaviour, linking persistent retail theft with a broader decline in social cohesion. Whether or not such assertions will withstand empirical scrutiny is beyond this court’s remit. However, the perception of disorder itself constitutes a significant community concern. Relatedly, reports from the Brixton BID note increased security expenditure by small businesses, including installation of CCTV, employment of private security staff, and reduced opening hours to deter theft and vandalism. While these measures serve legitimate business interests, they also represent a cost ultimately borne by consumers and tenants. The court also appreciates correspondence from the Brixton Council Environmental Enforcement Unit referencing a concurrent investigation into fly-tipping and unlicensed waste disposal in the area. Though unrelated to your conduct, these issues contribute to an atmosphere of regulatory challenge and strained municipal resources. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. The Broader Social Climate and Offender Accountability This court acknowledges the complex social and economic landscape within which this offending occurred. We are witnessing ongoing increases in street homelessness and food insecurity, exacerbated by inflationary pressures and disrupted labour markets. These phenomena engender environments where acquisitive crime may find fertile ground. Yet the court must distinguish understanding from excuse. Personal hardship does not grant immunity from the law. The Siracusa Principles—though framed in the context of international human rights—emphasise that rights may be limited proportionately to uphold public safety and order. That balancing act is the essence of judicial decision-making. Similarly, the decline of shared community values, the pervasive influence of social media, and transformations in public attitudes towards authority compound challenges for law enforcement and judicial institutions alike. The internet has altered social interaction and perceptions of consequence, where ‘influencers’ glamorise risky behaviour absent tangible accountability. The jurisprudential undercurrent is clear: the social fabric is frayed but not beyond mending. The law remains a necessary instrument for preserving order, deterring harm, and articulating the boundaries of acceptable conduct. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. Retention of Agency and the Avoidance of Determinism The court is cognisant of theoretical debates in criminology regarding determinism and free will, as well as the therapeutic jurisprudence movement emphasising rehabilitative over punitive frameworks. However, it remains a bedrock principle that individuals retain responsibility for their actions, regardless of circumstances or history. The oft-invoked narrative of the ‘Troubled Families’ paradigm is, in this context, both a caution and a challenge. While recognising the impact of family dysfunction and early trauma, the court must resist the reduction of adults to mere products of environment. There is something unduly reductive in positing that offending is predetermined by upbringing. Such determinism risks excusing behaviour that, however fraught, remains actionable within law and policy. The present case reflects clear agency exercised within a framework of conscious decision-making, repeated over an extended time interval. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. For completeness, I mention R v. O’Donnell [2023] EWCA Crim 1097, a case similarly involving repeated supermarket theft over a period of eighteen months. Despite the absence of violence, the Court of Appeal confirmed a community order with an unpaid work requirement as appropriate, with emphasis on rehabilitation. In contrast, in R v. Finch [2020] EWCA Crim 688, repeated theft involving use of threats was met with immediate custodial sentence. The paramount consideration remains the culpability, harm, and risk profile. The Theft Act 1968 offence, as charged, carries a wide sentencing potential, from fines to custodial sentences. The definitive guideline emphasises a structured approach using offence bands considering value, planning, harm, and previous convictions. Your record, Mr H, includes multiple prior convictions for similar offences, which elevate seriousness. The court must balance deterrence, rehabilitation, protection of the public, and personal mitigation. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. In light of all the foregoing, I determine that a pre-sentence report is indispensable to inform a properly tailored sentencing outcome. That report shall address risk, amenability to intervention, housing circumstances, and engagement with community resources. Any recommendations regarding attendance at accredited offending behaviour programmes, cognitive skills courses, or restorative justice initiatives ought to be carefully weighed. Consideration should be given to the potential suitability of a community order incorporating rehabilitative and punitive sanctions consonant with the overall aim of reducing reoffending. The report should also explore any necessary and feasible support for underlying vulnerabilities, including mental health and financial advice, though I bear in mind your prior inconsistent engagement. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 17 August 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Brixton. They have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript is maintained for the court record. You are reminded that you have the right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER R v. MR H Case No. M2025/08514 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge Leonard P. Ashcroft Filed: 19 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a single count of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising out of a protracted and repeated pattern of shoplifting offences within the Greater Manchester area. The offending conduct, which forms the basis of this indictment, spanned approximately eighteen months, from late 2023 through to early 2025, encompassing multiple retail environments including pharmacies, small grocery stores, and independent convenience outlets. Procedural History The matter was first brought to the attention of the police following a series of reports by retail managers within the Salford and Trafford districts, who noted a distinct rise in unidentified individuals engaging in thefts of low to mid-value consumer goods, often during peak hours but with apparent deliberate timing during cashier staff changes or outside peak store surveillance coverage. The Salford Business Crime Partnership was promptly engaged, seeking to collate evidential footage, stock discrepancy logs, and witness statements. It is worth pausing to observe that the institutional response to such low-level theft, while seemingly straightforward, is burdened by manifold operational hurdles. The Business Crime Partnership model provides a framework for information-sharing between law enforcement, retailers, and local council enforcement teams. Yet the efficacy of these partnerships is often constrained by staff shortages, budgetary constraints, and competing demands for investigative resources. Despite these barriers, in your case, the partnership functioned with a commendable degree of cohesion, resulting in the collation of a body of evidence sufficient to prompt formal investigation. The defendant was arrested on 14 February 2025, following a multi-agency surveillance initiative incorporating marked police patrols, covert CCTV monitoring, and the utilisation of Retail Crime Intelligence Units. The coordination between these disparate teams is illustrative both of advances in inter-agency collaboration, as well as the challenges facing law enforcement in addressing persistently low-level acquisitive offences amid a landscape of escalating demand for resources elsewhere. Your first appearance was made at Manchester Magistrates’ Court on 17 February 2025, where bail was granted on strict conditions including daily reporting and an exclusion zone encompassing specified retail premises identified as recurrent targets. Two adjournments followed, the first to allow the disclosure of digital evidence, and the second at the defence’s request in order to secure legal aid funding for a forensic psychiatric assessment. The latter application encountered delays notwithstanding early submission, a regrettably familiar pattern which this court has repeatedly condemned for its adverse impact on case progression and fairness to the defendant. A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 10 September 2025, where you entered a late guilty plea. It has become a regrettable hallmark of this jurisdiction that guilty pleas are often reserved until evidentiary pressure becomes overwhelming. This undermines the efficient administration of justice and imposes unnecessary burdens on prosecuting authorities, defence teams, and witnesses alike. The law decrees that a reduction in sentence credit for guilty pleas reflects not only an acceptance of culpability but also the saved expense and trauma occasioned by an early admission. Late pleas, while accepted, attract reduced mitigation, as emphasised in R v McIntyre [2022] EWCA Crim 2318. At this juncture, it is instructive to revisit some broader judicial observations on the context and impact of such offending behaviour. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v Wilkinson [2023] EWCA Crim 1547 is pertinent. That case imposed an immediate custodial sentence for a repeated pattern of theft targeting independent retailers, where the cumulative harm exceeded nominal financial loss. The sentencing judge’s remarks in Wilkinson underscored the corrosive effect of recurrent theft on communities, the psychological toll on retail staff operating under constant suspicion, and the erosion of consumer confidence. Alongside retail crime-specific jurisprudence, it is also relevant to note that this court is mindful of wider societal challenges that serve as the backdrop to such offending. The rise in street homelessness, poverty-induced marginalisation, and systemic under-provision of mental health services further complicate the landscape. Nonetheless, the criminal justice system must hold firm to principles of accountability and proportionality. In order to ensure appropriate and proportionate sentence calibration in cases of this nature, it is common practice for courts to require a detailed pre-sentence report prepared by probation officers, together with any available psychiatric expert evidence that elucidates both risk and rehabilitation prospects. These materials assist the court in mounting a response tailored to the offender’s needs and the protection of the public. Throughout the pendency of your case, Mr H, the court has received correspondence from multiple support agencies, including the Manchester Street Outreach Initiative, the local Citizens Advice Bureau, and the Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust’s community liaison division. These letters articulate the significant strain under which voluntary sector providers operate, as well as the complexities inherent in engaging individuals embroiled in cycles of offending and survival behaviours. The court commends the professionalism and commitment of such organisations, whose influence cannot be overstated, though it notes with concern the chronic underfunding and resource scarcity documented repeatedly in sectoral reports. In the course of sentencing preparation, the court notes the forensic psychiatric report prepared by Dr Fiona Marshall, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose comprehensive assessment was received on 2 October 2025. Dr Marshall’s conclusions were nuanced. While she found no evidence of major psychiatric disorder, her report highlighted traits consistent with emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and mild substance dependence. These features, she observed, may predispose towards opportunistic offending but do not absolve personal responsibility. Dr Marshall further emphasised that your engagement with support services has been intermittent and largely self-limiting. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. Turning to the particulars of the thefts themselves, the court must assess the manner and circumstances in which your offending was manifested. CCTV material, corroborated by witness testimony, reveals a pattern of deliberate behaviour utilising concealment techniques and occasional attempts to remove security devices in situ. The timing of offences frequently coincided with staff absences or periods of heightened activity designed to distract attention. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. Further observations note that on at least two occasions, you appeared to employ decoys or feigned preoccupation—such as engaging in overtly visible telephone conversations or loitering near other shoppers—to mask your intentions and evade detection. This evidences a degree of calculated conduct beyond mere opportunism. The economic loss to businesses is non-trivial, especially for small independent retailers operating on fine margins and without the benefit of large-scale insurance or loss prevention teams. Beyond direct financial impact, the psychological effect upon shop assistants was palpable. They reported feelings of vulnerability, increased workplace stress, and a reluctance to work alone during certain shifts, impacts which ripple beyond the immediate physical loss. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. I must note also, however, that despite repeated cautionary interventions—ranging from police warnings to participation in diversionary schemes—there was no enduring cessation of offending behaviour. This is a matter of significant concern, not least because it indicates a failure to internalise the consequences of previous contact with the justice system. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. This court also acknowledges the positive engagement of your legal representatives, particularly Mr David Whelan, who has diligently pursued avenues for mitigating evidence and secured adjournments to ensure adequate preparation. Mr Whelan’s commitment to your case has been noted and commended. It is worth noting for the record that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of funding applications in your matter exhibited uncharacteristic expediency, despite systemic trends to the contrary. This facilitated the timely instruction of expert witnesses and contributed to procedural compliance. Though regrettably, such efficiency remains the exception rather than the norm across the criminal justice landscape. In considering case law of direct and tangential relevance, the court refers to Duncan v The Crown [2020] EWCA Crim 2050, a case involving theft from charity shops with a complex profile of vulnerability and repeated offending. There, the Court of Appeal highlighted the importance of balancing the aim of rehabilitation with the demands of public protection, reminding sentencing judges to exercise discretion mindful of the individual defendant’s circumstances and the nature of the offending. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. It is equally important to observe the growing judicial unease with the normalization of low-level acquisitive crime in urban centres, a phenomenon that the media often under-reports or trivialises. This failure to afford due seriousness risks undermining confidence in the rule of law and emboldens recidivism. Courts must combat complacency by ensuring sentences maintain proportionality and deterrence. In the present case, despite your personal background, the conduct reflects a disconcerting persistence and recidivism. Evidence presented shows no engagement with rehabilitative programmes previously offered. Indeed, your responses have often been characterised by ambivalence or disengagement, reflecting, perhaps, the challenges faced by many navigating chronic financial insecurity and chaotic lifestyles. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. The victim impact statements submitted to the court by retail staff from three separate stores paint a consistent picture of disruption, anxiety, and a sense of betrayal. These are individuals who, while not the targets of violence, experienced harm through the cumulative effect of theft. It is imperative that such harm be weighed appropriately in sentencing decisions. The court is mindful that while immediate custody is not invariably the default in cases of theft, the totality of circumstances here points towards a structured response addressing both punishment and rehabilitation. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft and Handling Stolen Goods emphasises this dual function, noting the importance of assessing culpability, harm, and offender’s circumstances. Your age, 34, coupled with the somewhat limited but relevant prior convictions, including those for previous shoplifting offences, inform the risk assessment and sentencing approach. The probation officer’s presentence report, while not yet complete, will be critical in recommending constructive interventions, including cognitive behavioural programmes, substance misuse treatment, and employment support. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Meanwhile, I recognise with sympathy the challenges presented by modern court operations. The Crown Court’s recent refurbishment of Courtroom 5, where this hearing is held, including upgraded digital evidence presentation systems, represents welcome progress in facilitating the administration of justice in complex cases such as yours. However, inevitable pressures remain, including constrained listing availability and the knock-on effects of industrial action by court staff earlier this year, which delayed case timetabling nationally. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. In all these respects, the case exemplifies underlying systemic tensions across the criminal justice ecosystem: the balancing act between efficiency and fairness, between punishing crime and fostering rehabilitation, and between individual circumstances and societal expectations. While this court does not seek to dissect these tensions at length, it acknowledges their presence as a backdrop to the events and decisions here. Sentencing today is reserved pending receipt of the probation service pre-sentence report and any supplementary expert input deemed necessary. Upon receipt, the court will consider whether a community order incorporating rehabilitation requirements may be suitable or, alternatively, whether a custodial custodial sentence with a structured rehabilitation package would better serve public protection and individual reform. I thank counsel for their assistance in these proceedings — Ms Rebecca Morgan on behalf of the Crown, whose submissions have been clear, professional, and measured, and Mr David Whelan for the defence, whose advocacy has been diligent and conscientious. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 19 October 2025, in Court 5 at Manchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 do not apply in this case. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SHEFFIELD R v. MR H Case No. T2025/14639 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. K. Prentiss Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you are before this court charged with offences of theft from retail premises, specifically multiple counts constituting shoplifting, committed over an extended period within the Sheffield metropolitan area. The proceedings concern a course of conduct culminating in convictions under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. Procedural History and Initial Considerations You were arrested on 2 July 2025 following an investigation coordinated by the Sheffield City Centre Business Crime Unit, in conjunction with the South Yorkshire Police Safer Neighbourhoods Team and local security operatives. The catalysts for this inquiry were reports by several independent retailers noting a recurring pattern of loss attributed to a person resembling your description, which was corroborated through extensive CCTV surveillance. While retail theft remains a commonly encountered offence before this court, this case is illustrative of the significant resource expenditure required to secure evidential sufficiency, particularly in the face of protracted and methodical offending. It is worth noting here the findings in R v. Hamilton [2019] EWCA Crim 1353, which observed the cumulative effect of repeated low-value offences on both public confidence and retail business sustainability. Hamilton cautioned against an unduly narrow reading of criminality confined solely to monetary harm, stressing also the emotional and societal toll borne by communities subjected to persistent acquisitive crime. These remarks resonate deeply with the facts now under consideration. The court must also register its appreciation for the engagement of the Sheffield Business Crime Reduction Partnership. Their shared intelligence gathering and coordination played a crucial role in constructing a coherent prosecutorial narrative, proving more efficacious than in many comparable cases which suffer from inter-agency disjunction. Notwithstanding periodic under-staffing and funding constraints impacting such partnerships nationally, this instance exemplified the benefits of multi-sector collaboration. It must be acknowledged with some regret that logistical challenges—among them the withdrawal of several legal aid solicitors across the region—necessitated a series of adjournments prior to the present hearing. This court is familiar with the pressures besetting the Legal Aid Agency, particularly with respect to the approval of funds for expert psychiatric evaluations or social work assessments. Indeed, the jurisdiction continues to await reforms adequate to counteract delays that impose stress not only on defendants but also on witnesses, victims, and judicial resources. The procedural history in your matter stretched from initial charge in July through to this, the sentencing hearing in October, encompassing multiple lists including plea hearings and pre-sentence report adjournments. Such timelines are, regrettably, neither untypical nor, at present, readily ameliorable. The statutory framework under which this matter is considered remains principally the Theft Act 1968, section 1. Theft is, by definition, an offence of dishonesty, requiring proof that the defendant appropriated property belonging to another with the intent to permanently deprive. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences underlines the importance of offending behaviour patterns, the scale of loss involved, and the personal impact or vulnerability of victims. Applicable law also requires due consideration to mitigating and aggravating factors. The decision in R v. Elwood [2020] EWCA Crim 2277 is of particular note, as it addresses the issue of repeat offending in the context of low-value theft. There, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence imposed on an offender who targeted small shops over many months, highlighting the detrimental cumulative effect on victims and demographic communities. Moreover, Elwood draws attention to the necessity of a deterrent approach where prior interventions have failed to effect compliance. In construing the discretion to grant plea reductions, I have considered the jurisprudence in R v. Bentley [2022] EWCA Crim 1038, which reminds sentencing judges to make a nuanced assessment of plea timing. Early and unequivocal admissions can attract up to a one-third reduction in sentence, whereas last-minute pleas, especially those entered post-trial preparation or immediately before trial, warrant significantly smaller credit. The judge’s task is to balance the importance of incentivising guilty pleas without inadvertently rewarding tactical delay. Further afield, in R v. Meadows [2018] EWCA Crim 1594, the Court addressed the aggravating factor of offending proximate to vulnerable settings, though this element is not directly engaged in the present matter. Nevertheless, the sentencing principles laid down therein serve as a reminder that the context of offences may substantially bear on the appropriate response. The court also acknowledges the existence of the Better Case Management (BCM) procedures, operational since 2017 in Sheffield Crown Court. BCM aims to promote efficiency, reduce contested elements, and ensure timely exchange of evidence. Your case was managed according to these protocols, albeit with delays attributable primarily to Legal Aid processing and the arrangement of psychiatric assessments. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. The offences for which you stand convicted comprise a series of thefts from multiple retail shops, predominantly in the Sheffield city centre area, executed over a period of approximately sixteen months. Extensive CCTV footage, witness accounts, and recovered items corroborate the sustained and deliberate nature of your conduct. Evidence indicates that you regularly entered the premises bearing empty containers or bags, employing methods to conceal goods in a manner evincing experience with shop security measures. You are seen removing security tags on goods in some instances and exiting without presenting items for purchase. The recurrence and location of incidents suggest a degree of premeditation. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. On occasion, your accelerants included distraction techniques targeting store staff, exploiting moments of vulnerability such as shift changes or customer queues. You were observed wearing a distinctive blue hooded jacket, which featured in multiple incidents and was recovered at the time of your arrest. This personal identifier was pivotal in advancing the prosecution case. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. Several stores affected reported the cumulative effects on their operational viability, with management implementing altered staff rotas and increased deployment of security personnel. One complainant noted in a witness statement the “great distress” caused to employees fearful of confrontation or further theft. Nonetheless, there is no evidence you resorted to violence or threats in the course of offending. In reaching my determination, I have reviewed comprehensive victim impact statements prepared by both individual shop owners and representatives from the Sheffield Small Business Coalition. These documents articulate not merely the financial consequences of goods stolen but also the psychological effect on staff and community morale. Reports refer to apprehension in opening stores and the erosion of customer confidence in certain shopping areas. Of particular relevance is the psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr Imogen Wright, consultant forensic psychologist, instructed to evaluate mental health and risk factors relevant to sentencing. The report, dated 27 September 2025, is detailed and professionally composed. Dr Wright concludes there is no evidence of a major mental illness or cognitive impairment that would diminish culpability. However, traits indicating impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and maladaptive coping mechanisms linked to socio-economic adversity are observed. The report further recommends engagement with community-based substance misuse services, noting a mild dependency pattern relating to alcohol. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. The probation service provided a pre-sentence risk assessment dated 7 October 2025, highlighting medium risk of reoffending, largely attributable to entrenched behavioural patterns yet noting a stable housing situation and absence of criminal association. The report underscores the necessity of programmes aimed at improving decision-making and addressing underlying financial instability. The role of voluntary sector agencies in Sheffield merits acknowledgement here. Charities such as “Hand Up Sheffield” continue to work under considerable strain, providing vital services in food poverty relief, budgeting assistance, and mental wellbeing. Correspondence from their caseworker, Ms Helen Marks, submitted on 3 October 2025, expresses concern regarding the ongoing impact of acquisitive crime on local businesses. They similarly detail outreach efforts extending toward your case, indicating that opportunities for support were offered but not fully utilised. The court notes this with regret. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. It is also salient to record that the Sheffield Housing Partnership recently issued a noise abatement notice to the landlord of your current residence. While this has no bearing on your offending, it reflects a wider pattern of neighbourhood disturbances reported in the area. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. The court is aware that managing acquisitive offending within vulnerable populations demands circumspection. The Stroud Review (2019) emphasised the imperative of layered interventions combining enforcement with therapeutic support. Still, the expectation remains that defendants avail themselves of assistance proactively. This has not been demonstrated in your case. Moreover, in line with the practical realities observed in R v. Collins [2021] EWCA Crim 789, repeat offenders who do not sustain engagement with support services often precipitate indefinite cycles of custody and release, unmitigated general deterrence, and compromise community safety. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. You are 34 years old. The criminal record disclosed includes four previous convictions for similar offences of shop theft, the most recent dating from January 2024, resolved by a conditional discharge. Prior to that, a community order imposed in 2022 for theft offences was terminated prematurely due to non-compliance with appointment schedules. While you have made occasional assertions regarding family support and employment prospects, evidence before the court indicates that such claims are inconsistent. Your reported living arrangements are stable but modest. You reside within public housing allocated by the Sheffield City Council, with no indications of substance misuse requiring specialist care beyond that identified by Dr Wright. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. There is no evidence of gang involvement, coercion, or organised criminality influencing your conduct. Nor is there indication of coercive control or domestic abuse relevant to these proceedings. While the court recognises the profound effects of childhood trauma or adult hardship, these matters are peripheral to the specific charge before me, though they may be relevant to the tailoring of rehabilitative services recommended in the probation report. The court acknowledges the mitigating factor of your eventual guilty plea, albeit entered late in the procedural timetable, which qualifies for a modest reduction in sentence. The appellate authorities referred to earlier caution against equating such pleas with genuine remorse where they follow prolonged denial. The principles of deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection must guide the ultimate disposal. It remains true that custodial sentences for shoplifting offences should be reserved for cases of marked seriousness, including repeated breaches, substantial financial loss, or where prior community sanctions have been defied. The possibility of imposing a suspended sentence order, accompanied by a rigorous community rehabilitation requirement, remains under consideration, subject to the forthcoming pre-sentence report’s recommendations. I invite the probation service to consider options including a cognitive skills programme aimed at developing impulse control, alongside potential unpaid work requirements and financial advice services. The scope for restorative justice engagement should also be explored, though this would depend on victim consent and your willingness to participate meaningfully. There is a further point to be made about the broader context of acquisitive crime within this jurisdiction. The court, supported by the evidence provided by Miss Marks at Hand Up Sheffield and the Business Crime Reduction Partnership, is conscious of the mounting pressure such offending places on already stretched public services. The NHS mental health teams report increased waiting lists, with particular concern for individuals with complex social and behavioural needs. The Probation Service, meanwhile, struggles with caseloads expanded by rising demand, and the Legal Aid Agency’s procedural delays continue to hamper effective defence preparation in similar matters. These systemic deficiencies compound risks across the board. Regrettably, the court must also note the delays occasioned in your case by successive applications for extension of time to obtain legal aid funding for expert instruction. Multi-agency collaboration, while laudable in theory, often functions at the mercy of administrative bottlenecks. These practical realities, although external to your conduct, impact the criminal justice system’s capacity to administer proportionate and timely justice. Further procedural history denotes that a hearing scheduled for 16 September 2025 was vacated due to the late delivery of Dr Wright’s report, itself delayed by staffing shortages in the clinical psychology department of the Sheffield Mental Health Trust. This episode exemplifies the current strain on public sector services serving defendants with complex needs. It is of passing interest that during the same fortnight, an unrelated arson case involving commercial premises in Court 5 significantly disrupted listing availability, pushing other matters, including yours, further into the future. In final summary, Mr H, you have been found guilty of persistent shoplifting offences, committed with deliberate intent, over a significant period. The adverse effects on victims and local businesses are well documented. Your previous convictions and historical non-compliance with community-based orders aggravate your culpability. While the psychiatric report does not find a major mental disorder, the behavioural profile indicates areas requiring intervention. It is vital for both you and the public interest that sentencing reflects the totality of your offending and the prospects for rehabilitation, as informed by a detailed pre-sentence report. This report must explore appropriate community sanctions, including cognitive behavioural interventions and support for any contributing social factors. The court reserves final sentencing until receipt and consideration of that report. Arrangements have been made for its preparation by the Probation Service, with a listing scheduled for 28 November 2025. I thank counsel for their submissions today. I also acknowledge the care with which the voluntary sector representatives have assisted the court in understanding the community impact of your offending. These sentencing remarks are pronounced this 14th day of October 2025 in Court 6 at Sheffield Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5.

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT KENSINGTON R v. MR H Case No. K2025/14579 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. S. MERRICK Filed: 16 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced following your conviction for theft, specifically shoplifting, committed on multiple occasions during the period from November 2023 through to May 2025. Your offending primarily targeted retail premises within the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, with some incidents in the neighbouring district of Westminster. The charge arises under Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, and the case is being heard within the Crown Court jurisdiction due to the course-of-conduct nature of the offences, and the range of aggravating and mitigating factors that require detailed consideration beyond the scope of the Magistrates' Courts. Procedural Background Your first contact with the criminal justice system relating to the conduct before this court occurred when you were arrested on 8 June 2025, following a protracted investigation led by officers attached to the Kensington Business Crime Reduction Unit. This investigation was notable for its complexity, involving multi-agency collaboration through the Kensington Partnership Against Retail Crime (KPARC), which integrates local policing teams, security personnel from multiple retail chains, and representatives from the borough’s Safer Neighbourhoods Team. The investigation was initiated after a discernible spike in thefts reported at multiple shop locations, all exhibiting similar modus operandi characteristics. The collation and analysis of CCTV data, together with liaison with retail brand loss prevention managers, were pivotal in identifying you as the principal suspect. It is instructive to observe, without apology, that shoplifting offences, frequently disparaged as minor or victimless crime within popular discourse, exert a pervasive and deleterious impact on the local economy and community well-being. The loss of stock and increased security costs have repercussions for staffing, pricing, and the sustainability of local businesses. The psychological effect on employees—who are often frontline retail workers doing their best in demanding conditions—cannot be underestimated. While the court’s function does not extend to advocacy or economic diagnosis, it must underline that persistent shoplifting threatens both commercial viability and public confidence in the safety of retail environments. Your case was allocated under the Better Case Management (BCM) pilot initiative introduced in this jurisdiction to enhance case preparation efficiency and reduce undue delay. Following your initial hearing on 12 June 2025, which was conducted at Kensington Magistrates’ Court, the matter was committed to this court for trial by indictment given the aggregation of incidents and the complexity of evidence. There were two plea and case management hearings—a first on 15 July 2025, and a subsequent hearing on 29 August 2025—each of which served to identify issues for trial, organise disclosure, and consider expert evidence. The prosecution was represented by Ms Harriet Jones, who presented her case with commendable clarity and diligence; the defence was represented by Mr Lewis Grant, instructed under a Legal Aid certificate, whose submissions were thorough notwithstanding challenges encountered in securing timely funding for necessary psychological assessments. The court must express concern at the continuing difficulties presented by the administration of Legal Aid in this jurisdiction. Delays experienced in authorising funding for forensic psychiatric evaluation—requested on 5 July 2025—reflect systemic issues within the agency which, despite ongoing reforms, remain unresolved. The resulting adjournments caused avoidable postponement, placing strain on all parties and exacerbating the pressures on tightly managed court listings. Such delays jeopardise not only case progression but also the effective provision of justice, particularly for defendants with complex needs. It is hoped that the trends towards more responsive and efficient authorisations, as envisaged in recent policy reforms, will materialise with some urgency. The offence of theft is well established, both substantively and procedurally, as codified in the Theft Act 1968 and interpreted through decades of case law. The theft of goods from retail environments, while often low in individual monetary value, carries particular significance where repeated or planned conduct demonstrates persistence or opportunism. Sentencing practice recognises that the cumulative harm from serial offending undermines market integrity and community standards. The courts have grappled with the balance between punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation in theft cases. The Sentencing Council Guideline for Theft Offences (2022) provides a framework by which sentences should be calibrated according to the culpability of the offender, harm caused to victims, the offender’s previous history, and relevant mitigating factors. Particular aggravating features include the targeting of vulnerable persons—such as elderly or disabled retail staff—and the degree of premeditation or systematic planning. Mitigation touches on factors such as early guilty plea, lack of prior convictions, evidence of remorse, and engagement with support services. Notable case authority offers further guidance. The principles articulated in R v. Dunning [2019] EWCA Crim 552 affirm that repeated low-value theft with evident planning attracts custodial sentences where community measures have been ineffective. Conversely, R v. Carver [2021] EWCA Crim 1014 underscored the potential for deferred sentence or suspended custodial orders in situations where genuine effort at rehabilitation could be anticipated. Equally, cases such as R v. Fletcher [2020] EWCA Crim 2117 highlight the importance of accurate risk assessment in tailoring sentences to individual circumstances. The proposition that a guilty plea at an early stage is deserving of more substantial credit remains a consistent theme throughout recent appellate decisions. Of course, these precedents must be applied judiciously and informed by up-to-date risk and psychological evaluations. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. It bears noting that the present proceedings unfolded alongside several other unrelated Crown Court matters, including a high-profile trial involving charges of aggravated burglary and possession of offensive weapons in the adjacent Westminster Court. While entirely distinct in nature and unconnected to your case, this wider context reminds us of the range and complexity of criminal matters that flow through this tier of the judiciary. The allocation of resources within the courts reflects attempt to balance the gravity of different offences—which includes provision for the necessary time adults facing mental health issues may require. Justice is, by definition, multifaceted. The police investigation was underscored by the application of Section 18 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to obtain footage from shops’ security systems and to conduct interviews. The reliability of this evidence was not meaningfully challenged at trial, as the defence opted to contest other matters, including the claim of intent. Notably, the current case also coincided with an operational review of the Kensington Safer Neighbourhood Policing Unit, which sought to address increasing reports of antisocial behaviour and retail crime. This review highlighted the challenge of managing finite personnel amid rising community expectations — a situation familiar to many policing bodies nationwide. The diversion of investigative resources to low-level acquisitive crime, such as in this matter, has ramifications beyond the immediate case, as it impacts capacity to respond to more serious offences. The tension between individual case management and broader operational efficiencies remains a recurrent theme in public safety discourse. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. An independent clinical report was commissioned from Dr Fiona Wieland, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, which was filed with the court on 2 September 2025. Dr Wieland’s analysis was thorough and incisive, drawing upon interviews conducted over three sessions, psychometric testing, and collateral information from social service records. Her conclusions were that while you do not meet the diagnostic criteria for severe mental illness, there is evidence of a moderate depressive disorder alongside features consistent with borderline personality traits. The report notes a history of childhood adversity but emphasises your functional capacity to engage with therapeutic interventions. Dr Wieland specifically recommended consideration be given to cognitive-behavioural therapy inclusive of impulse control modules, coupled with community mental health support to reduce risk of reoffending. The probation officer assigned to the case, Ms Elaine Morgan, submitted a comprehensive pre-sentence probation report dated 7 September 2025. The report outlines a history of transient tenancy arrangements, culminating in unstable accommodation during the period of offending. It notes that while no substantial employment history exists for over two years, there is sporadic voluntary work indicative of some social capital. Ms Morgan flagged concerns regarding social isolation and inconsistent attendance at community support meetings. Her risk evaluation—a statutory requirement under the Offender Assessment System (OASys)—places your likelihood of reoffending at the medium level, and notes the absence of any discernible pattern of violence or aggression toward others. The proposed community intervention plan includes engagement with an accredited Thinking Skills Programme and a structured drug and alcohol support pathway, reflecting a holistic approach to rehabilitation. I should also note, with due respect, that the preparation of the probation report was delayed due to late receipt of full disclosure material and complexity of evidential matters. Such challenges are neither unusual nor unexpected in cases of this nature but serve as a reminder of the importance of pre-emptive and coordinated exchange of information. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. The Position of Victims and Support Agencies The court received multiple victim impact statements from retail proprietors and staff affected by your offending. These statements articulate the economic consequences, including loss of merchandise, increased insurance premiums, and expenditure on security enhancements. Equally salient are the psychological effects experienced by witnesses and frontline workers, including heightened anxiety, stress, and a reported decline in workplace morale. Several employees indicated adjustments had been made to shift patterns and store layout to mitigate risk of repeat offending, underscoring the broader disruption caused. In addition, correspondence was submitted by Kensington Retailers’ Association, which described their efforts to liaise with local authorities in developing community safety initiatives. The association, mindful of current fiscal constraints, expressed concern about the increasing scale of shoplifting incidents and called for further investment in preventive measures, including enhanced CCTV networks and public awareness campaigns. While such correspondence does not bear specifically upon your culpability, it is germane to the understanding of wider repercussions. The voluntary sector also contributed written representations. The Kensington Outreach Project sent a letter noting their experience with clients facing housing insecurity and substance misuse, some of whom have engaged in low-level acquisitive crime. Their position underscores the significance of preventative work and early intervention, reinforcing the court’s recognition of the social context that sometimes accompanies offending. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. This court recognises that notwithstanding these letters and victim statements, the perspective of those who have been harmed by your actions extends beyond immediate financial loss. It encompasses the unrest and fear generated within retail communities, and the knock-on effect on public spaces. This phenomenon is traced in literature as part of the wider trend in urban environments where increased petty crime diminishes the social fabric. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. Reviewing the statute under which you have been convicted, it is instructive to consider the legislative history of the Theft Act 1968. Established to consolidate various theft-related offences, the Act was a landmark in reforming and simplifying property crime law. Over the decades, judicial interpretation has evolved. In particular, the application of the Act to shoplifting has triggered debate over proportionality and sentencing thresholds, leading to the introduction of the Theft Mode Penalty Scheme (TMPS) in certain magistrates’ courts allowing for more flexible disposals. Nonetheless, persistent and sophisticated offending remains a matter for Crown Court consideration. The case of R v. Elliott [2017] EWCA Crim 342 is noteworthy. It involved similar offences where a defendant employed multiple accomplices to divert retail staff’s attention, systematically removing goods with intent to resell. Although the proceeds exceeded £15,000, the sentence was mitigated by early plea and demonstration of insight. This illustrates the court’s willingness to consider the full context of conduct, including rehabilitative prospects. The judgment in R v. Beckwith [2020] EWCA Crim 1076 reaffirmed that custodial sentences should not be imposed lightly in respect of volume theft but acknowledged the cumulative impact on victims and the retail economy. Beckwith involved a defendant with a lengthy theft-related record and failure to engage with community sentences, which precipitated multiple extensions of custodial time. Contrastingly, R v. Thomas [2021] EWCA Crim 887 emphasised community orders where offenders embraced rehabilitation. While none of these cases align perfectly with your circumstances, they provide a backdrop for calibrated sentencing. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. It merits mention that recent public discourse on criminal justice has lamented the increasing normalisation of minor acquisitive offences against the backdrop of economic upheaval, housing insecurity, and pandemic-related hardship. However, the court must emphasise that acknowledgement of such social realities carries no licence for unlawful behaviour. Similarly, analysis of the challenges facing public services—including overstretched probation caseloads, health sector waiting times, and diminishing social housing—illustrates structural pressures that, while relevant, do not negate personal accountability. The justice system remains attentive to rehabilitative paradigms. Yet there is an enduring tension between the ideals of therapeutic jurisprudence and the demands of public protection and deterrence. The court respects the work of practitioners and voluntary bodies in this endeavour. Their efforts, however, must be matched with personal responsibility to break cycles of offending. In this vein, the influence of “social media culture” and the prevalence of instant gratification have been advanced as contributing factors in some behavioural patterns observed among young adults. Although no direct link has been drawn to your case, the phenomenon of online dissemination of thefts and challenges to authority is a growing area of concern for police and community groups alike. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. The Crown Court at Kensington was formally established in 2002 to accommodate the increasing volume of complex cases arising from the capital's west end boroughs. The courtroom where this hearing is conducted was recently refurbished to enhance accessibility and integrate digital evidence presentation systems, reflecting ongoing efforts to modernise court infrastructure. These investments underscore a commitment to effective justice delivery amidst rising caseloads and judicial scrutiny. Unusually, on the day of today's hearing, interpreter services were requested late due to a scheduling error. While no interpreter was ultimately required, this incident draws attention to broader systemic challenges around resource allocation and administrative coordination within court settings. Recognising the work of court clerks and ushers in maintaining order and ensuring smooth operation under growing pressure is important. Their role, often unseen, is indispensable. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. The sentencing council guidelines outline a range of disposals, from conditional discharges through community orders to immediate custodial sentences, each with conditions tailored to the offender’s circumstances, past history, and risk profile. You are, presently, 38 years of age. The report indicates a medium risk of reoffending with low risk of serious harm. You have four recorded previous convictions, all for shoplifting related offences spanning a decade. There is no indication of gang affiliation or use of violence. Your engagement with support services has been sporadic. You acknowledge financial hardship and transient housing but have declined some offers of assistance, an issue addressed in both psychiatric and probation reports. The court notes your guilty plea, entered at trial, following a not guilty plea at earlier hearings. While the plea is accepted as sincere, it was not offered at the earliest opportunity and must be accorded appropriate but limited credit. The court is cognizant of the strain on public resources, including police time disproportionately engaged in low-level acquisitive crime investigations—a pattern which drains capacity from violent crime and safeguarding functions. Moreover, the impact on victims extends beyond material loss to the intangible erosion of community confidence and safety. In light of these considerations, the court is minded to explore community-based interventions where feasible, yet also must reserve the possibility of custodial sanction given the persistence of offending and repeated failure to desist following previous warnings and disposals. In conclusion, the court directs that sentencing be deferred pending the receipt of an updated pre-sentence report incorporating recent mental health input and any further representations from the defence. The probation service is asked to consider fully the feasibility of a comprehensive community order incorporating rehabilitation activity, mental health support, unpaid work, and curfew requirements, alongside conditions designed to disrupt the offending pattern. The matter is adjourned for sentence to 4 November 2025 at 10am. The hearing has taken place in open court, with counsel for both parties present throughout. I express thanks to Ms Harriet Jones and Mr Lewis Grant for their submissions, which have been professionally delivered and considered respectfully. You are hereby reminded of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days under the provisions of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 applicable in this case. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON R v. MR H Case No. T2025/13821 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge W. E. BARLETT Filed: 12 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction for theft by shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from a series of offences committed over a span of approximately fifteen months within the Brighton and East Sussex area. The offending was principally directed at a mixture of high street retailers, convenience stores, and pharmacies. This sentencing hearing marks the culmination of a procedural journey extending over seven months, featuring multiple hearings, defence applications, and a considerable volume of documentary material. Procedural History Your initial arrest occurred on 2 April 2025, following the conclusion of an extensive enquiry conducted by the Brighton Retail Crime Unit, assisted by the Sussex Police Safer Neighbourhood Teams and intelligence analysts from the County Crime Bureau. The investigation was complex, involving the harvest of surveilled footage from numerous independent and chain retail premises across several districts. Cross-reference of intelligence reports from store security teams and the Brighton Business Crime Reduction Partnership played a pivotal role. The investigatory diligence was arduous, emphasising the contemporary challenges law enforcement faces when tackling seemingly minor, yet cumulatively impactful, acquisitive offences. As is frequently the case in such matters, the inter-agency cooperation highlighted the growing burden on resources tasked with protecting retail establishments from repeat thefts. It is well recognised that while these offences may appear less serious than violent crimes or drug trafficking, they nonetheless impose a significant strain on police time, retail staff wellbeing, and ultimately consumer confidence within affected communities. The cumulative operational hours devoted to nearing twenty distinct incidents involving yourself were non-trivial and necessitated strategic tasking under the Sussex Business Crime Weekly Brief, wherein priority was accorded according to known offenders’ notoriety and repeat offending patterns. The police interview conducted on 8 April 2025 saw you initially deny involvement in any incidents beyond a single minor theft at a supermarket in central Brighton. However, inconsistencies with surveillance footage and forensic examination of clothing recovered at your residence led to a formal charge on 29 April 2025. The count was formulated as a representative charge addressing the episodes under investigation, a practice consistent with judicial efficiency when confronted with serial acquisitive offending. The matter thereafter was allocated to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management protocol, having been transferred on 15 May 2025 for trial preparation and plea consideration. It is relevant to observe that the Court has long grappled with the procedural difficulties inherent in cases of this nature. In many jurisdictions, delays and adjournments are commonplace, reflecting systemic pressures in court listings, the complexity of evidence collation, and the fluctuating availability of expert psychological and social reports. Notably, in this case, various interlocutory applications were made, including a request by the defence for a mental health assessment to evaluate the presence of any underlying vulnerabilities or notional mitigating factors. This application was granted in part, but unavoidably delayed by protracted communications with the Legal Aid Agency, whose administrative inefficiencies continue to vex criminal proceedings across the country. The delays occasioned did not stem from any fault of the prosecution but rather reflect a wider institutional struggle to marshal expertise expeditiously. Of ancillary interest, during the listing phase, there was an adjournment precipitated by a co-defendant’s material witness's failure to attend, owing to an unrelated matter involving allegations of fly-tipping on Green Belt land near Crawley by that individual. Such tangential matters, while unfortunate, underscore the multiplicity and interwoven nature of criminal proceedings which can, at times, impact overall case progression. The court nonetheless commends the professionalism displayed by all staff engaged in managing the associated administrative burden. At the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 3 September 2025, you entered a plea of guilty. The Crown acknowledges your admission, albeit at a relatively late stage in proceedings. As established jurisprudence dictates, the timing of a guilty plea is an important determinant of credit to be afforded on sentence. The Court of Appeal in R v. Griffiths [2023] EWCA Crim 1825 reaffirmed that early pleas conserve public resources and spare witnesses undue distress, whereas pleas entered near the trial date reduce the grounds for mitigation. Therefore, while your plea is properly recorded, it receives a modest credit for timing. In the course of those preparatory hearings, detailed disclosure was furnished to the defence, including witness statements, CCTV footage from venues in Hove and central Brighton, and expert documentation from the Sussex Forensic Science Centre confirming partial fingerprint matches on packaging seized from various sites. The Crown’s evidence was thus robust and coherent. It is germane to record the observations offered by the probation service in their initial report dated 6 October 2025. The report indicates that the defendant has a history of minor acquisitive offending dating back to 2017, with multiple cautions and community resolutions for shoplifting and related low-level dishonesty. The probation officer notes a lack of steady employment, intermittent episodes of accommodation instability, and a tendency to resist engagement with support services offered through local charities and council schemes. The report further highlights the defendant’s failure to participate in voluntary interventions recommended during previous court disposals. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. The Court has also received a psychological assessment compiled by Dr Siobhan Reynolds, consultant forensic psychologist, dated 20 September 2025. Dr Reynolds’ report is comprehensive and professionally composed, offering a detailed account of your cognitive functioning, emotional regulation, and risk factors. The report notes some traits consistent with mild executive dysfunction and impulsivity, but no diagnosable psychiatric disorder was established. Of note, Dr Reynolds highlights your history of sporadic substance misuse, primarily alcohol, although there was no evidence of dependency. The report recommends engagement with cognitive-behavioural interventions aimed at improving self-control and addressing the criminogenic thinking patterns underpinning your offending. In the course of judicial consideration, I again find it necessary to remark upon the benefits and pitfalls of multi-agency collaboration in cases such as this. Agencies such as the Brighton Community Safety Partnership, the Retail Crime Reduction Unit, and the Sussex Police Licensing Team offer valuable intelligence and victim support. Their joined efforts, however, are challenged by understaffing and competing priorities, particularly given the rise in non-serious offences demanding immediate attention—such as nuisance antisocial behaviour and low-risk street disorder—which frequently draw resources away from longer-term acquisitive crime enforcement. By way of comparison, the court recalls R v. Hanson [2024] EWCA Crim 667, a matter concerning aggravated burglary with grievous bodily harm that, while markedly more serious, illustrates the judicial balancing act in calibrating sentence against relative culpability and societal harm. Though unrelated, that case set precedents on the circumstances warranting custodial sentences even where mental health interventions are present, underscoring the court’s duty to weigh rehabilitation against public protection imperatives. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. It is also apposite to note procedural complexities arising during this case's listing. The venue has recently undergone refurbishments, with new digital display systems installed, enhancing the court’s ability to exhibit CCTV and other visual material to juries and counsel. This technological advancement marks progress, albeit its benefits remain partially untested under full trial conditions here. As is often the case in offences involving repeat shoplifting, the emotional and psychological toll upon retail employees cannot be underestimated. Victim impact statements submitted through the Retail Support Network conservatively estimate the cumulative financial loss to businesses exceeds £2,500. Staff report feelings of vulnerability, stress, and in some circumstances, the need to modify work schedules or modify store security arrangements in response to your behaviour. One employee’s statement, in particular, detailed an occasion on which you were observed wearing a notably distinctive jacket while exiting a premises with concealed goods, which directly contributed to your identification and subsequent arrest. The court recognises the invaluable role of victim support services such as the Retail Employees Wellbeing Project and the St. Matthew’s Charity, whose tireless contributions often go unnoticed but serve as a cornerstone of restorative justice frameworks. Their offers of facilitated dialogue and tailored counselling remain essential components of a modern justice ecosystem. It is vital to acknowledge the broader social context within which your offending took place. We live in a time marked by significant economic disparity, housing precarity, and social fragmentation—a milieu in which petty acquisitive offences have become increasingly visible. However, the court must caution against conflating systemic insecurity with licence for unlawful conduct. Indeed, the Criminal Justice System serves as a bulwark against such conflations, ensuring accountability amidst complexity. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. Moreover, the court remains cognisant of the strain placed upon probation and rehabilitative services nationally. Higher volumes of lower-level offending have contributed to a backlog in offender supervision and delays in access to behavioural change programmes. The Sussex Probation Trust has communicated its concern regarding underfunding and staff shortages, factors which invariably impact quality and consistency of offender management. Despite this, the court expects defendants to engage proactively in available support to demonstrate genuine commitment to desistance. Turning to relevant case law, the Court must be guided by the principles set out in the seminal decision of R v. Cunningham [2019] EWCA Crim 542, which reemphasised that repeated acquisitive offending necessitates a proportionate response balancing punishment and rehabilitation. In that context, a sentence of community supervision coupled with targeted interventions often presents the most efficacious means of reducing reoffending and enhancing social reintegration. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. It is also instructive to revisit R v. Davies [2020] EWCA Crim 887, a case involving multiple thefts from charity shops, where the appellant’s consistent pattern of offending despite warnings led to a custodial sentence. Although that case featured no threats or violence, the harm inflicted upon vulnerable staff and consequent reputational damage to the charity was held to be a significant aggravating factor. The court emphasised the broader community harm and deterrence considerations. Equally, in R v. Foster [2022] EWCA Crim 1196, the offender was convicted of repeated shop thefts involving electronics and personal care items. The court acknowledged mitigating factors including addiction and unstable housing but concluded that such factors necessitate, rather than negate, intervention. The custodial element in Foster’s sentence was relatively brief due to his prompt guilty plea and genuine engagement with treatment post-arrest. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. As noted earlier, this case was delayed in part due to difficulties experienced with securing authorisation for the instruction of a forensic psychologist to prepare an assessment appropriate to the defendant’s behavioural profile. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted process—characterised by repeated requests for additional documentation and shifted explanatory criteria—frustrated early resolution, drawing criticism not just from defence counsel but from the presiding judge at several procedural hearings. The court urges increased efficiency in this realm, as such delays erode not only case progress but also defendant welfare, inasmuch as outcomes are deferred and opportunities for timely intervention lost. I have reviewed a letter submitted by the defendant’s sister, Ms Bernadine H., dated 30 September 2025. The letter expresses familial concern for your wellbeing and describes efforts to secure stable accommodation and employment. While such expressions merit acknowledgment, it remains incumbent upon you to demonstrate consistent responsibility and engagement with constructive supports. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. Further correspondence has been received from the Brighton Soup Kitchen and the Homeward Bound Initiative, both voluntary-sector organisations that provide assistance to individuals experiencing financial hardship and housing instability. Their reports speak to the challenges faced by many residents, including yourself, but also stress the importance of personal accountability in overcoming adverse circumstances. Of note, the defendant’s conduct predates the onset of the recent economic downturn but has undoubtedly been impacted by associated austerity and rising living costs. Nevertheless, this court must reiterate that economic difficulty does not excuse criminal conduct. It may contextualise, but never exculpates. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. In the course of reviewing the case, the court considered various irrelevant factors which, while possessing potential legal or procedural interest in other contexts, bear no direct influence herein. These include a recent prosecution within Brighton Town involving aggravated affray following a pub altercation involving pool cues; an unrelated arson case at a commercial warehousing unit in nearby Lewes; and proceedings against a co-defendant charged with impersonating a police officer during arrest. None of these incidents involve the defendant and are noted for completeness only. Moreover, the defendant’s immediate family have, in separate court proceedings, been involved in various unrelated matters including benefit fraud and noise abatement disputes—with no material bearing on the present charges. Such extraneous details serve as a reminder of the complexity of social networks but must not contaminate judicial reasoning or sentencing. Turning again to sentencing considerations, the current offence is characterised by the sustained pattern of offending, limited remedial engagement, and the tangible impact upon both victims and local businesses. While no episodes of violence or overt threats were caused, the psychological burden upon retail staff—some of whom altered their professional roles in response—tempered what might otherwise be seen as a purely financial crime. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. The sentencing framework, pursuant to the Sentencing Council Guideline on Theft Offences, necessitates a balanced consideration of culpability, harm, personal mitigation, and the public interest in deterrence. The court must also weigh the prospects for rehabilitation, the defendant’s personal circumstances, and any previous criminal history. Mr H, you are now 35 years old, with an offending history dating back nearly a decade, punctuated mainly by shoplifting and minor dishonesty convictions. You have yet to establish meaningful periods of lawful employment and currently reside in temporary accommodation provided by the local authority. Your inconsistent engagement with support services and reluctance to embrace rehabilitative opportunities temper the assessment of your prospects. In conclusion, I shall adjourn sentence to obtain a detailed pre-sentence report which will encapsulate all relevant information and provide a framework for evaluation of available sentencing options. The report should consider the viability of community orders incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements, unpaid work, and cognitive skills training. The potential for restorative justice approaches will also be assessed. The detailed preparation of this case, the presentence assessment, and the ratification of appropriate sentence should ensure a proportionate and just outcome, consonant with the needs of public protection and personal reform. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELMONT R v. Mr H Case No. T2026/04839 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. WHELAN Filed: 14 October 2026 Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence upon your conviction by way of guilty plea to an offence of theft, specifically shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, as the court understands, extends over a significant period and involves a pattern of repeated thefts from retail premises within the Belmont and surrounding boroughs. The conduct has been examined carefully, and it is necessary to consider both the procedural history and the wider context in which these offences took place before any disposal is determined. Procedural History This matter began its journey through the criminal justice system with your arrest on 8 June 2026, following an investigation instigated by the Belmont Business Crime Reduction Unit. This unit, working in conjunction with the local police safer neighbourhood teams and retail security managers, had recorded a discernible rise in thefts from various corner shops and pharmacies in the area. Initial reports to the police, while initially recorded as isolated incidents spanning low monetary values, were later analysed collectively, revealing a telling pattern. The investigative approach relied heavily on store surveillance recordings, stock monitoring, and witness testimony, gathered over several months. The court is all too familiar with the frustrations that attend investigations of this nature. While advancements in technology have improved image resolution and data storage, the sheer volume of footage to sift through, coupled with varying store layouts and coverage blind spots, impose an onerous burden upon policing resources. Furthermore, fluctuating staff turnover among retail personnel can result in inconsistent witness statements and challenges in maintaining institutional memory. In this particular case, despite such challenges, the investigation proceeded with admirable diligence. Your interview under caution took place on 17 June 2026. On this occasion, you initially denied any wrongdoing. However, forensic examination of clothing found in your residence, which matched that worn in multiple CCTV clips, was instrumental in the subsequent charging decision. You were formally charged on 2 July 2026. The matter was moved to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management model and was listed for a pre-trial review on 25 August 2026. The Better Case Management system is designed to expedite case progression and promote early resolution. It encourages timely disclosure, encourages guilty pleas at the earliest opportunity, and facilitates appropriate pre-sentence preparation. In this matter, the parties have adhered substantially to the indicative timelines. That said, some adjournments occurred due to issues securing Legal Aid funding for expert reports, a recurring theme in many criminal proceedings of late. Of note, the court has also been informed of pressures arising from staffing shortages within the local probation service. The resultant caseload burdens may have impacted the availability of probation officers for timely report preparation. Additional nervousness among defence representatives about the adequacy of rehabilitation proposals in the suspect’s case also prolonged procedural timelines. It is necessary to underline that, despite the relatively low financial value of the stolen items, the pattern of offending cannot be viewed in isolation from the cumulative effect on affected businesses and individuals. Repeated breaches of trust damage community cohesion and impose real psychological and economic harms on those who rely on these establishments, whether as consumers, employees, or proprietors. In respect of your plea, you entered a guilty plea on 20 September 2026. The timing of the plea was relatively late, having initially pressed a not guilty plea at the earlier hearings. Late pleas, while lawful, do not entitle to automatic full credit given their impact upon court time, witness anxiety, and prosecutorial resources. The Court of Appeal, in cases such as R v. Maxwell [2024] EWCA Crim 1789, has underscored that the discount for guilty pleas must be proportionate to the timing and sincerity of the admission. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. The Crown have prepared an extensive schedule of evidence, comprising over 600 pages including CCTV transcripts, police statements, victim impact documents, and forensic analysis. This level of detail, while thorough, highlights the labour-intensive nature of prosecuting such offences. It is a reminder that these cases consume considerable public funds and human resources, despite their sometimes modest monetary stakes. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. We find ourselves, unmistakably, in an era when low-level retail theft cases have become increasingly prevalent, placing strain on multiple arms of the criminal justice system. Frontline retail staff are often the unacknowledged victims of these offences, facing not only loss of stock but also anxiety that can impact their wellbeing. Indeed, it is recorded in this case that some staff requested transfer to other locations or imposed personal coping strategies to manage workplace stress. This effect is not to be discounted. The court places on record appreciation for the work of the Business Crime Reduction Unit, whose proactive engagement with shop owners has fostered an improved intelligence-sharing network. It is regrettable, however, that similar schemes appear unevenly resourced nationally, leading to variable responses in comparable cases. On four separate visits within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same small shop and stole alcohol and tobacco products. The investigative process was complemented by reports from the Retail Support and Recovery Trust, a voluntary sector organisation providing victim support and advocacy. Their submissions to the court commented on the knock-on effect of repeated retail theft on community confidence and local economies. Such organisations, while operating under financial constraints and growing service demands, play a vital role in bridging the gap where statutory services are stretched thin. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. A psychiatric report was commissioned following an application by your defence team, instructing Dr Genevieve Harrod, consultant forensic psychiatrist. The report, dated 7 October 2026, is a detailed and professionally prepared document. Dr Harrod concludes that you do not suffer from a diagnosable major mental disorder but do exhibit features consistent with impulse control difficulties and moderate depressive symptoms linked to socioeconomic stressors. Notably, Dr Harrod highlights a lack of engagement with available community support, including substance misuse services, which is concerning given the risk factors present. Let me emphasise the court’s recognition of the broader societal context here. The mental health and social service frameworks are often overstretched, with long waiting lists for NHS psychological therapies and significant demand on third-sector organisations. Consequently, cases such as yours highlight gaps in service delivery and challenges faced by vulnerable populations. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. The probation service submitted a pre-sentence questionnaire conducted in early October 2026. The report notes your chaotic housing circumstances, lack of stable employment, and peripheral family connections. While acknowledging your expressed willingness to comply with community-based interventions, the officer expressed reservations about the likelihood of sustained engagement without additional structured support. The court also observes that, notwithstanding the strains on local authority housing provision—where temporary accommodations and emergency placements have surged in recent years—such instability cannot excuse repeated rule-breaking. The balance must be struck between understanding and accountability. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. It is necessary to reflect briefly on the relevant statutory and guideline framework. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the defining provision for offences of dishonesty in appropriation. Sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council for theft offences emphasize factors such as planning, persistence, circumstances of the victim, and value. Cases such as R v. Brewster [2023] EWCA Crim 1487 have illustrated the court’s approach to aggravating features in serial theft matters. There, despite modest individual values, the repeated and methodical nature of offending drew a custodial outcome. The Court of Appeal stressed the wider societal harm occasioned by sustained disregard of lawful boundaries. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. Further appellate decisions, including R v. Ferris [2025] EWCA Crim 913, have underscored the principle that although remedial rehabilitative initiatives remain desirable, they must not be viewed as a panacea in the face of persistent offending behaviour. The court is also aware of the extensive administrative burdens imposed on public services when dealing with multi-agency cases. Collaborative mechanisms such as Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARACs) and Integrated Offender Management panels are increasingly called upon to coordinate responses. While beneficial, these often generate additional procedural complexities and require sustained interdepartmental cooperation, which may not always be feasible within existing capacity. Mr H stated in interview that he frequently takes items, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. Despite these complexities, the current case was progressed with reasonable expedition. That said, the court acknowledges the impact of external factors, such as the recent industrial action affecting court listings nationally, which contributed to limited date availability and the need for adjournments. It is unfortunate that your legal representation encountered delays in securing necessary funding from the Legal Aid Agency for expert instruction. This carried the risk of infringing upon your right to a timely and fair hearing. The agency’s administrative processes remain a source of concern within the profession and judiciary alike, with repeated calls for systemic reform. The pleading pattern and timing here fall within a broader trend of late admissions in shoplifting cases. Whilst some may view this as tactical, it inevitably diminishes credit for cooperation. The Crown has nonetheless acknowledged your ultimate acceptance of responsibility. The court trusts this will be reflected appropriately in final sentencing calculations. The impact of your offending upon local businesses and communities should not be underestimated. Though the stolen goods’ value in isolation may seem trivial, the cumulative effect undermines local economies and the sense of security within affected neighbourhoods. The court is mindful, however, to exercise proportionality and fairness. In conclusion, the court will order a pre-sentence report to be compiled by the probation service. This report will assess the suitability of community-based orders incorporating rehabilitative and restorative elements, including potential participation in cognitive skills training and financial management programmes. It will consider whether an unpaid work requirement might be appropriate and identify supports necessary to bolster stability and reduce the risk of reoffending. The report will be requested to advise on the likelihood of your engagement and compliance, mindful of the evidence before this court. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Belmont. A formal transcript has been prepared and logged pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days of the date of sentencing under the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. No reporting restrictions under section 39 of the Youth and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 apply. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MIDDLESBOROUGH R v. MR H Case No. T2025/15347 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. P. NICHOLLS Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence in relation to the charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, representing a pattern of offending over an extended period in the district of Middlesborough and adjoining retail precincts. The offending conduct in question, as charged and now admitted, involves multiple incidents occurring between late 2023 and the early part of 2025, predominantly in small to medium-sized retailers specializing in pharmaceutical and personal care products. Procedural History You were first arrested on 12 March 2025 after a targeted investigation by Greater Cleveland Police in collaboration with the Middlesborough Business Crime Liaison Unit. The investigation followed a crescendo of concern raised by local shopkeepers who, over several months, reported loss of stock not easily accountable by natural wastage or administrative error. The Middlesborough Retail Crime Partnership coordinated efforts to collate and analyse CCTV footage, inventory shrinkage reports, and staff accounts, leading to your identification as a suspect. The process of assembling the evidence was, as is often the case, fraught with logistical and administrative hurdles. Retailers volunteered their time and commercial data, which had to be juxtaposed with police intelligence that in some instances suffered from missing timestamps and overlapping video frames. The video imagery frequently displayed the defendant wearing hooded attire, obscuring facial features, or footage was compromised due to camera angle limitations. These challenges necessitated a painstaking, iterative review of hours of material accompanied by relevant expert statements prepared by crime scene specialists analysing point-of-sale discrepancies and security sensor disruptions. Early investigative efforts benefitted from a limited, though comprehensive, community policing operation deploying ‘plain clothes’ officers to observe and record typical patterns of footfall and suspected activity in the targeted retail areas. In parallel, a partnership was established with local volunteer organisations concerned with retail staff welfare and workplace safety, responding to the emotional toll on personnel repeatedly subjected to loss investigations and alarmingly frequent incidents of intimidation from recidivist individuals. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. An initial interview under caution was conducted on 14 March 2025, during which you declined to admit guilt. Following forensic analysis of clothing seized from your residence—a dark green parka notably consistent with that worn in surveillance footage—corroborative evidence was assembled, enabling the Crown to proceed with charging you on 22 March 2025. The matter was then transferred to this Crown Court as part of the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, with the objective of effecting an efficient progression to trial or plea. The BCM regime, introduced under the auspices of the Criminal Procedure Rules, is designed to expedite the handling of cases, reducing unnecessary delay and ensuring that evidential clarity is established at an early stage. The court acknowledges that in the present instance, despite typical pressures arising from court listing congestion and, notably, a short adjournment caused by procedural irregularities with service of prosecution disclosure, all parties endeavoured to adhere to timelines, culminating in the listing of a plea and trial preparation hearing on 22 May 2025. At that hearing, you entered a not guilty plea, but following receipt of further evidence and additional witness statements from shop managers, you changed your plea to guilty at the early stages of a trial listed for 5 June. It is appropriate at this juncture to reiterate the well-established judicial position concerning discounts for guilty pleas, as underscored in R v Bennett [2023] EWCA Crim 1203. The Court of Appeal reiterated therein that the utility and fairness of plea credit rest heavily upon timing and sincerity, with late pleas, particularly those entered after overwhelming evidence arises, meriting only limited reduction in sentence. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. While the facts of Bennett concerned a more serious fraud-related offence, the principle that the sentencing discretion is diminished by delayed admissions of guilt is equally applicable to theft offences such as this one. The court also draws reference to R v Penman [2022] EWCA Crim 978, where repeated minor acquisitive crimes committed over several months, coupled with an absence of prior engagement with rehabilitative services, led to a custodial sentence reflective of public protection needs. The cited authorities underscore the judiciary’s duty to ensure proportionate sentencing that balances punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and community protection. Turning to the broader context in which this conduct occurred, I find it necessary to record the immense strain on public services tasked with addressing such offences. The Probation Service for Cleveland reports chronic staffing shortages, with caseloads frequently exceeding recommended limits, thereby impeding robust supervision of low and medium-risk offenders. This systemic challenge is compounded by significant waiting lists in mental health services, notably the Psychological Therapies Access Pathway, which has seen a 30% increase in referrals over the past year, due in large part to pandemic-related backlogs and resource constraints. I have received a letter from the Head of Probation, Ms Fiona Melrose, emphasizing these constraints and the consequent impact on efforts to engage repeat acquisitive offenders in meaningful support. Moreover, retail workers, many of whom are part-time employees with limited employment protections, have voiced persistent concerns over heightened anxiety and diminished morale caused by recurrent thefts, occasionally accompanied by verbal abuse. The Retail Staff Welfare Alliance, a voluntary sector organisation, has submitted representations outlining the emotional and psychological ramifications on employees, including instances of increased absenteeism and reluctance to work alone during closing hours. These factors, while not directly altering legal culpability, form an important backdrop to the impact of your conduct. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. This court is cognisant of the delicate balance between recognising the pressures individuals face and upholding the rule of law. Previous judicial pronouncements have acknowledged the multifactorial nature of criminal behaviour, but caution against conflating explanation with excuse. Indeed, as noted in R v Henderson [2019] EWCA Crim 583, societal and economic hardships, while relevant to mitigation, cannot absolve persistent opportunistic offending that undermines community cohesion. I must also comment upon an unfortunate but recurrent operational concern: the delays occasioned by Legal Aid authority decisions. In this matter, applications to instruct a forensic psychiatrist experienced in impulsivity-related disorders took over six weeks to process, despite the time-sensitive nature of preparatory reports. Defence counsel, Mr Simon Cranley, drew the court’s attention to this issue, which regrettably contributed to adjournment of sentencing from the originally scheduled date of 29 July 2025 to today’s listing. The Legal Aid Agency’s slow response is emblematic of a broader systemic malaise. It is a matter the judiciary continues to monitor closely, mindful that access to expert evidence is fundamental to fair adjudication. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. To provide further context on the assessment of risk and potential for rehabilitation, I wish to summarise the conclusions reached in the psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr Anita Fowles, consultant forensic psychiatrist. Dr Fowles notes an absence of any major mental disorder but reports traits consistent with impulsivity, dysfunctional coping mechanisms with respect to stress, and a mild history of alcohol misuse. The report highlights that your engagement with voluntary support systems has been minimal, despite repeated opportunities to participate in financial counselling and substance misuse programmes. Dr Fowles opines that this lack of engagement diminishes prospects for rehabilitation absent enforced intervention. On a related note, the probation officer’s presentencing report observes that you have a history of residential instability, having experienced multiple interspersed periods of temporary accommodation and brief stays with friends. While the immediate cause of your offending appears linked to economic difficulty, your refusal to engage with debt management initiatives and inconsistent cooperation with probation appointments undermine the efficacy of community-based sentences. There is also documentation noting your failure to comply with an earlier community resolution following an incident in 2022, which may give rise to concerns about compliance and motivation. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. The court has also been provided with victim impact statements from two local pharmacy managers and a small convenience store owner. These attest to significant disruption caused by your offending, including financial loss, the need to increase staff training on loss prevention, and a discernible reduction in staff confidence. One victim described heightened fears of confrontation and a palpable increase in workplace stress. Mr Cranley, on your behalf, submitted a letter detailing your personal circumstances, including the pressure of caring for a dependent family member with a chronic health condition and the disruption caused by the breakdown of your previous accommodation arrangements. While such matters may inform mitigation, they do not diminish the seriousness of your decisions to repeatedly appropriate goods without payment. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. In reviewing the overall landscape of acquisitive offending in this jurisdiction, the court is mindful of recent statistical trends indicating a modest increase in shoplifting incidents over the past two years, exacerbated by post-pandemic economic pressures and inflationary cost-of-living rises. It is also noted that the regional Business Crime Crime Reduction Group has implemented a stage-based intervention scheme designed to flag repeat offenders earlier and link them to support, but resourcing gaps have limited its reach. It may be instructive at this point to refer to the decision in R v Marlow [2020] EWCA Crim 541, where a sentence of twelve months’ custody was imposed for repeated thefts from retailer premises involving thefts of goods used in drug consumption paraphernalia. While your offending is not linked to illicit substances, the principles of assessing harm and the need for deterrence remain analogous. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Separate from your individual history, the court notes an unrelated case in which your co-defendant from a previous matter was convicted of affray during a street disturbance proximate to a community event. That conviction, while separate and not attributable to you, has nevertheless added complexity to the local policing operations and shed light on fragmented peer group influences. It further underlines the challenges authorities face in disentangling overlapping social and criminal networks. In addition, the environmental context of some incidents bears noting. The premises targeted include two independent stores that had previously been the subject of local authority noise abatement orders due to activities unrelated to the offences with which you are charged. While these administrative actions have no bearing on your culpability, they illustrate the complexity of community environments where low-level crime and civil regulatory enforcement intersect. Turning to previous case law, R v Collins [2018] EWCA Crim 2123 addressed possession of a bladed article in a school playground car park. While entirely distinct in subject and gravity, Collins highlights how the sentencing framework accommodates the presence or absence of aggravating factors such as potential for harm to vulnerable groups. This is reflective of sentencing principles that weigh the totality of circumstances rather than a narrow view of the predicate offence alone. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. In arriving at an appropriate sentence, the court observes the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline (effective from 2022), which categorises offending based on factors including the value of stolen goods, the level of premeditation, the presence of aggravating circumstances such as targeting vulnerable victims or repeat offending, and the offender’s criminal history. The guideline emphasises the importance of considering the impact on victims and on public confidence. In your case, the frequency and deliberateness of the offending, the choice of relatively vulnerable retail premises, and the prior entreaties of the criminal justice system to desist cumulatively frame the offence as more serious than an isolated, one-off theft. Mitigating factors such as the late guilty plea and your stated personal difficulties are noted but must be balanced against public protection imperatives. This court is grateful for the detailed input received from Crown Prosecutor Ms Nia Patel and defence counsel Mr Simon Cranley, whose submissions were courteous, professional, and thorough. I also acknowledge the presence of the court usher, Mr Andrew Bridges, whose management of court staff and administration ensured the smooth running of today’s hearing despite a brief delay in the arrival of the interpreter services. Although this court operates within the Crown Court tier, pleasantly housed within the refurbished Middlesborough Justice Centre opened in 2019, space constraints continue to press on operational efficiency. Cases such as this, which require substantial evidential collation and expert involvement, remind us of the crucial role the Crown Court plays between the magistracy and the appellate courts in delivering proportionate justice. In closing, I must reiterate the fundamental principle that while contextual realities and personal hardship inform judicial discretion, they do not provide immunity from lawful sanction where repeated criminality undermines social trust and the security of local communities. Sentencing will be adjourned to allow for the preparation and consideration of a full pre-sentence report, which the probation service is instructed to compile. This report should particularly address the feasibility and appropriateness of community-based rehabilitative measures, including cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to acquisitive offending, engagement with financial advice services, and monitoring for potential substance dependency treatment pathways. The report shall also consider risk of reoffending and compliance prospects to inform any decision on custody versus a community order. These sentencing remarks are made this 14th day of September 2025 in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Middlesborough. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal against sentence or conviction within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged herein. The question of costs is reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT PLYMOUTH R v. MR H Case No. P2025/13049 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. HARRISON Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge relating to theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a period from mid-2023 through to early 2025, with various thefts committed within the Plymouth area and its environs. This sentence hearing is the culmination of proceedings that have engaged multiple agencies and generated a substantial evidential record. Procedural Background Your case came before the magistrates’ court originally on 29 March 2025, where you entered a not guilty plea. Following prosecution disclosure and the preparation of a detailed evidential bundle by the Crown, the case was committed to this court by way of summary trial under the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative. The BCM framework, introduced in 2015, is intended to improve efficiency in case progression through proactive case tracking, early procedural management, and timely allocation of appropriate resources. This case was allocated to the Plymouth Crown Court centre with listing initially set for 15 July 2025. In the months that followed, the matter experienced a number of short adjournments, some arising from defence counsel’s application for Legal Aid funding to instruct a forensic psychological assessment, which was eventually authorised on 21 July. The prompt resolution of such applications remains a critical element in protecting defendants’ rights to a fair and expeditious trial, yet it remains a recurrent source of procedural frustration. Indeed, as recently seen in R v. Jalali [2025] EWCA Crim 324, the Court of Appeal lamented the systemic delays introduced by administrative rigidities within the Legal Aid framework, noting the consequent impact on both defendants and judicial timetabling. On 5 September, you changed plea and entered a guilty plea upon the cusp of trial. The Crown accepts the plea but notes it was not at the earliest opportunity. This lapse engages the principles set out in R v. Forsyth [2022] EWCA Crim 151, which clarifies that credit for guilty pleas must reflect the timing, sincerity, and impact on case management. Turning to the broader context of retail theft, this court is mindful that despite public perceptions, such offences cannot be treated lightly. As noted in R v. Stanton [2019] EWCA Crim 804, the Court observed that repeated thefts from vulnerable or small-scale retail traders have a chilling effect on both economic activity and community cohesion. The social and psychological dimensions extend beyond mere financial loss, influencing staff wellbeing and local commercial viability. The Local Business Crime Reduction Partnership in Plymouth has also issued detailed briefings on trends in uneconomic acquisitive crime. These reports draw attention to a marked increase in opportunistic theft concurrent with the economic downturn post-2021, and reference the strain placed on policing and retail security resources. It is regrettably a feature of contemporary life that such offences impose cumulative costs that ripple through communities in ways that are difficult to quantify. Mr H, the court acknowledges with thanks the contributions of Ms Ingrid Patel of the Plymouth Business Crime Unit, whose detailed evidence and liaison with affected retailers has been instrumental in securing a comprehensive prosecutorial case. Similarly, Detective Inspector Carmen Reeves of Devon and Cornwall Police is commended for overseeing a multi-faceted investigation involving covert surveillance, licensed PLG (public location gathering) operations, and digital media analysis. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. In relation to the defendant’s background, detailed preparatory reports have been received. The pre-sentence report, prepared by Officer Melinda Clough of the Devon Probation Service, offers an extensive overview of your personal circumstances, prior convictions, and current social supports. Officer Clough’s narrative highlights the challenges faced by individuals living with socioeconomic instability in the South West region, particularly within post-industrial urban areas of Plymouth. The probation report underscores the prevalence of housing insecurity and its contributory role in recidivistic offending, especially when intersected with untreated substance misuse and episodic employment. Consideration is also given to your reported history of childhood neglect and early school exclusion, gaps in which were partially addressed during a short educational placement at Dawlish Youth Centre. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. Notably, a comprehensive psychiatric assessment was appended to the probation documents. Dr Fiona Hargrave, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at Derriford Hospital, provided this evaluation following a request from the defence. Dr Hargrave’s report, dated 28 August 2025, considers the presence of several neurodevelopmental traits and moderate depressive symptoms, but concludes that no enduring psychotic or bipolar disorder is evident. She specifically notes a propensity for impulsive behaviour in response to stressors and a diminished capacity for long-term planning. Dr Hargrave emphasises that while your condition might inform some risk factors for reoffending, it does not in itself excuse criminal behaviour. The expert recommends a structured behavioural programme with an emphasis on anger management and cognitive-behavioural therapy, ideally integrated with social housing support services. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. It is important to note that such diagnostic observations are, by necessity, clinical opinions formed at a discrete point in time and do not constitute measures dispositive of culpability. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court of Appeal clarified that the presence of a mental health disorder should be factored into sentencing only insofar as it bears upon responsibility and risk to the public. The present case does not raise such issues to a degree demanding diversion or hospital order. Returning to the procedural history, it is regrettable that this matter was affected by an unrelated disruption on 14 April 2025 to court listings following industrial action by court staff, as reported in local media outlets. This was one of several staffing challenges affecting Devon and Cornwall judiciary in recent years, with recruitment and retention difficulties placing persistent strain on dispensing justice within expected timelines. Mr H, the court has also considered letters of support submitted on your behalf. These include correspondence from Ms Joy Bennett, your sister, who describes your attempts to desist from criminality and the difficulties in securing stable accommodation compounded by the ongoing housing shortage across the South West peninsula. Others include a carefully composed statement from the Plymouth Food Bank coordinator, Mr Lorenzo Edwards, who notes your intermittent engagement with food aid services but expresses cautious optimism for your compliance with community orders. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. It is worth reflecting here on the broader operational challenges faced by voluntary sector organisations. Food banks and emergency homelessness services operate under perennial funding constraints and rising demand, particularly post-pandemic. Their contributions remain vital yet under-recognised within criminal justice processes. In considering the impact upon victims, the court records with regret the statements supplied by the managers of the retail outlets concerned. These narratives attest not only to the direct financial losses incurred but also to heightened staff anxiety levels and increased security expenditure, including installation of electronic tagging systems and staff training initiatives. There is evidence that some outlets reduced staffing hours or altered shift patterns to accommodate security concerns, impacts which cascade through the local employment market. It is pertinent to observe that greater Plymouth has seen a modest uptick in shoplifting offences over the past three years, with an observable concentration in economically marginalised areas. The complexities of such crime patterns challenge police resources already dedicated to a broad spectrum of serious offences, including drugs, burglary, and violent crime. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. The court is conscious that you have a history of offending, albeit non-violent, including previous convictions for similar offences, some dating back to your youth. Over the last decade, you have encountered multiple criminal justice interventions including community sentences and conditional discharges, yet recidivism remains persistent. This history raises serious concerns as to deterrence and potential rehabilitation. One must be candid that repeat offending of this nature undermines public confidence and exacts cumulative costs not only on the individuals and businesses directly affected but on society’s collective resources devoted to crime prevention and correction. It is by no means a trivial matter that courts are increasingly called upon to address patterns of recidivism in acquisitive crime with firm but proportionate sanctions. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. This court is further obliged to note statutory sentencing guidance. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline (effective from November 2024) mandates assessment by culpability and harm categories, with emphasis on factors such as planning, repetition, use of deception, and impact on victims. Thoughtful application of these criteria is essential in balancing the objectives of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. It is also relevant to mention the framework for credit on guilty plea. As set down in the definitive ruling of R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, late pleas—those entered only after overwhelming evidence becomes insurmountable—may attract significantly reduced reductions. The guiding principle is to reward genuine responsibility taken at the earliest reasonable moment. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. I record my gratitude to counsel for their pointed and measured submissions today. Ms Emily Frost, appearing for the Crown, has highlighted the seriousness of offending and the necessity for sentencing that reflects both individual culpability and wider social deterrence. Mr Daniel Weir, for the defence, has urged consideration of your personal difficulties and the therapeutic recommendations outlined in Dr Hargrave’s report. The court also acknowledges the calm and measured manner in which court officers and ushers have conducted today’s proceedings, ensuring order and respect throughout the arraignment. It is of note that this courtroom was recently refurbished to enhance accessibility and security, a welcome investment in the administration of justice that the court applauds. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. While this case concerns repeated dishonesty, the court’s attention is drawn to the broader public safety regime in which sentences are delivered. Multi-agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), proven effective in managing offenders posing serious risks, operate alongside less formal structures such as Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC). Though your offending does not presently engage these higher-tier protocols, the interface between policing, probation, and social services remains critical. Of additional interest is the ongoing strain on mental health services within Devon and Cornwall. Waiting lists for cognitive-behavioural therapy programs extend to several months longer than recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). This capacity gap complicates timely access to interventions for offenders exhibiting traits identified in psychiatric evaluations. It is a regrettable reality that social safety nets, strained by austerity measures and shifting policy priorities over the past decade, operate at or beyond capacity. Yet the court must maintain its focus on the individual accountability and legal standards central to sentencing. In concluding, I underscore that this court is neither dispassionate nor indifferent to the circumstances that cluster around cases such as this. Poverty, mental health challenges, and lack of stable housing are factors of undeniable consequence and deserving of robust state response. But such realities do not excuse or minimise culpable criminal acts. Following consideration of all materials before the court—including the probation report, psychiatric assessment, victim impact statements, and submissions by counsel—I reserve sentencing for a date to be fixed, pending the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report. It is my intention that the report provide a comprehensive appraisal of risk, personal circumstances, and proposed rehabilitative pathways. In particular, I wish the probation service to explore the feasibility of community-based sanctions incorporating structured programmes addressing impulsivity, substance misuse, and financial management. The goal is to recommend interventions proportionate to both your offending and the protection of the public. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Plymouth. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. You are advised of your right to appeal within a period of 28 days in accordance with section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT LUTON R v. Mr H Case No. T2025/14638 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. Rutherford Filed: 9 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today to answer for a charge of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to the unlawful removal of goods from multiple retail establishments. The period of offending conducted in this matter spans from October 2023 through to April 2025, and is alleged to have taken place across various commercial districts in Luton and neighbouring Bedfordshire locales. Procedural Chronicle You were initially arrested on 12 April 2025 following the culmination of a multi-agency investigation involving the Luton Borough Police Retail Crime Unit and local trading standards officers. The investigation was instigated after a notable series of theft incidents, each involving small but cumulatively significant losses from retailers who had separately reported suspicious activity. Despite the seemingly minor value of individual thefts, the repetitive and methodical nature of the offences prompted enhanced scrutiny and coalescing of intelligence. Let the court pause for a moment to reflect on the broader institutional context within which such investigations unfold. The Retail Crime Unit, established in 2013 as a special branch within the local constabulary, has operated under fluctuating budgetary constraints and periodic realignments of priorities. Their remit, though ostensibly narrow, frequently encompasses a delicate balancing act involving the management of scarce manpower, fluctuating evidence quality, and the often competing interests of corporate and community stakeholders. The effectiveness of such units is, in part, dependent upon the willingness and capacity of retailers to engage in collaborative information-sharing. Unfortunately, the prevailing climate of economic uncertainty has led many small and medium-sized enterprises to adopt a more circumspect attitude toward reporting minor offences, fearing the administrative overhead or reputational harm that formal allegations may entail. This places greater pressure on police resources to identify and pursue offenders based on often incomplete or fragmentary data sets—a burden which, as is widely recognised, stretches frontline personnel thinly amid rising overall crime rates. Your initial interview on 13 April 2025 was conducted under caution. At that time, you denied all allegations, contesting involvement despite presentation of circumstantial evidence. Subsequent forensic analysis, however, demonstrated the presence of fibres and trace materials linking articles of clothing found in your possession with multiple reported incidents. Formal charge was preferred on 21 April 2025 with a single indictment consolidating representative counts from various premises for judicial economy. The case was swiftly transferred to this Crown Court and placed under the Better Case Management system, designed to expedite trial readiness through adherence to statutory or procedural timetables. This matter has seen the usual pre-trial hearings and disclosure applications, including several defence requests for further material that have occasioned modest delays. These have, however, been managed within tolerable parameters consistent with current judicial expectations. A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 15 July 2025. You again entered a not guilty plea at that juncture, opting to contest the evidence. Following receipt and service of supplementary CCTV evidence and witness statements indicating your movements within the implicated venues, you tendered a guilty plea on the morning of the scheduled trial, specifically on 7 September 2025. The court notes that this late change does not constitute the earliest possible acceptance of responsibility; as such, sentencing credit must be accorded with appropriate moderation in line with extant jurisprudence. The timing of pleas remains a crucial factor in sentencing decisions. The Court of Appeal in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, dealing with a series of serious arson offences, emphasized that a last-minute plea prompted by the imminent collapse of a defence, rather than demonstrable remorse or insight, attracts a reduced discount. While the gravity of the offences in Halvorsen starkly contrasts with the present matter, the emphasized principle—that timing is integral to the calculus of credit—translates. Accordingly, the court declines to treat your admission as meriting early plea credit. Additionally, precedent such as R v. Dacres [2021] EWCA Crim 1331, which involved the unlawful entry into a dwelling during overnight hours, offers insight into the consequences of upsetting the sanctuary of personal spaces. While no comparable intrusion is evident here, the underlying principle in regard to victim impact and the necessity of deterrence informs the court’s approach to your conduct. The law is clear: the dishonesty inherent in theft, particularly when recurrent and methodical, carries a public dimension that extends beyond immediate pecuniary loss. Such offending diminishes community trust, harms local businesses, and contributes incrementally to social disorder. A Note on the Court’s Physical Environment and Personnel It would be remiss not to acknowledge the recent refurbishment of Courtroom 5, undertaken over the summer recess. The improved layout affords greater comfort for all present and has been positively remarked upon by both judicial officers and counsel. The court also expresses gratitude to the ushering staff here, whose professionalism remains a constant assurance amid the often unpredictable demands of court business. Whilst the delay in seating the court clerk by a few minutes on this particular morning was inconvenient, it was nonetheless managed with characteristic good humour. Mr H, it must also be recorded with appreciation the efforts of your appointed counsel, Mr James Harland, instructed through the Legal Aid scheme. Despite systemic pressures within the Legal Aid Agency, which continue to result in frustrating bureaucratic delays and resource scarcity, Mr Harland has provided diligent representation, including the procurement of expert reports and the assembly of mitigating material. However, it is also appropriate to comment on the broader and persistent challenges faced by practitioners who must navigate an increasingly convoluted administrative landscape while ensuring defendants receive a fair and timely hearing. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. The delays occasioned by Legal Aid administrative procedures are regrettably familiar. Mr Harland’s application, for instance, to instruct a forensic behavioural analyst was initially submitted in May 2025 but not granted approval until late July following multiple requests for additional information. This delay hampered the defence’s ability to thoroughly investigate potential mitigating factors and contributed to the late plea submission. Such systemic bottlenecks are a cause for institutional concern, as they risk infringing defendants’ rights and undermining public confidence in the administration of criminal justice. A psychiatric report was commissioned from Dr Amanda Lenton, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at the Bedfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group. Her assessment, conducted in July 2025, indicated no diagnosable major mental illness, but identified traits suggestive of impulsivity and related behavioural dysregulation. Dr Lenton further noted a history consistent with mild substance misuse, primarily alcohol, which appeared to have impacted judgment and decision-making in the periods surrounding some offences. It is significant—and not altogether surprising—in light of the widespread pressures on mental health services nationally, that access to appropriate support was limited in practice. Waiting times for substance misuse interventions in Bedfordshire currently stand at over twelve weeks, owing to underfunding and staffing shortages. The court must acknowledge the consequent systemic barriers to rehabilitation while emphasizing that the existence of unmet need cannot substantiate ongoing criminal conduct unaccompanied by concerted attempts at engagement. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. A report prepared by your assigned probation officer, Ms Fiona Elder, dated 25 August 2025, provides a thorough overview of your personal circumstances and risks. Ms Elder highlights your currently unstable housing situation—temporary accommodation provided through the County Council’s Transitional Housing Scheme—with associated social vulnerabilities. The report underscores your limited employment history and the absence of consistent support networks. Nevertheless, Ms Elder notes your expressed willingness to engage with structured rehabilitative programmes and recommends a community order incorporating elements of cognitive-behavioural therapy focused on impulsivity and acquisitive offending. Additionally, the potential for a debt management and financial literacy component is identified, whose intended effect would be to reduce criminogenic pressures stemming from economic instability. It bears noting that during the preparation of this report, Ms Elder encountered several administrative difficulties, including incomplete disclosure of prior offence records due to inter-departmental IT failures. These reflect ongoing challenges within probation and criminal justice agencies regarding data integration—a problem well documented in recent parliamentary oversight committee hearings. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. The Retail Support Network, an umbrella organisation dedicated to assisting businesses affected by shop theft, has submitted victim impact statements on behalf of several local outlets. The representatives express measured, yet firm acknowledgement of the burdens imposed by repeated loss, including the diversion of limited human resources toward security and inventory management, the psychological effect on frontline staff, and the resultant pressure to curtail opening hours or even close premises. The statements, while refraining from hyperbole, paint a picture of cumulative strain. Retail workers describe feeling “uneasy” and “undervalued,” with some citing the adoption of protective measures such as locking cabinets during open hours and staff rota alterations—all in response to circumstances occasioned by offenders like yourself. Such testimony adds valuable texture to the court’s understanding of harm beyond mere financial calculations. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. During the course of the investigation, a co-defendant was identified as being implicated in parallel offences involving aggravated assault at a separate location. Although sharing a nominal link, these charges and the associated evidence bear no connection to your conduct. That individual, currently remanded in custody pending trial for violence-related offences, has no bearing upon your culpability or sentencing. Similarly, other parties connected peripherally to the retail environments where you offended—such as shop employees or landlords—have been subject to unrelated inquiries, including a neighbour’s complaint regarding noise abatement and a dispute involving a tenancy agreement. These matters, though contemporaneous, fall outside the remit of the criminal proceedings presently before this court. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. In approaching your sentence, the court is guided principally by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences, published in 2022. This framework stresses the need to calibrate sentence severity according to the degree of planning, frequency of incidents, monetary value, offender’s culpability, and the impact on victims. The guideline underscores that repeat offending elevates culpability, even when individual acts may be low in financial magnitude. Key aggravating factors include targeting of vulnerable premises, such as community pharmacies or small traders, and the use of stratagems designed to defeat security measures. Conversely, mitigating factors may comprise genuine remorse, early guilty pleas, and demonstrable attempts at rehabilitation. Case law deserves reference to the decisions in R v. Latimer [2021] EWCA Crim 947 and R v. Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754, which expound on the limitation of credit for late guilty pleas and the weight attributed to persistent offending patterns. These affirm the principle that the timing of a plea is a critical element in ensuring that sentencing reflects not only the offence but also procedural fairness and efficiency. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. The Court’s Observations on Public Safety and Rehabilitation The court is acutely conscious of the delicate balance between imposing a sentence that reflects the serious disruption caused to victims and the community, and promoting your rehabilitation so as to prevent reoffending. Society’s welfare depends as much on successful reintegration as it does on punishment. Recidivism continues to place unsustainable pressure on overstretched probation and social care services. Parliamentary reports have highlighted the growing attrition in preventive programmes, with certain participant groups receiving minimal ongoing support due to funding constraints. The consequences of this are evident in the continued cycling of individuals through the criminal justice system. Your case serves as a microcosm of these systemic challenges. The evidence before the court suggests that while no overt threats or violence were employed, your offending has had a real and repeated corrosive effect on the communities reliant on these retail businesses—not only economically, but in undermining ordinary social trust. This emphasises the need for a sentence that adequately acknowledges both culpability and the imperative of crime prevention. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. Your housing situation, presently one of tenuous temporary accommodation, is of undeniable relevance. The court is mindful of the ongoing crisis in affordable housing nationwide, exacerbated by inflationary pressures, supply shortfalls, and the aftereffects of prolonged pandemic-related disruption. Many local authorities report backlogs of hundreds of households awaiting placement, resulting in lengthy stays in short-term facilities such as hostels or converted hotels. However, it is imperative to stress that such adversity, while mitigating to some degree, cannot be allowed to obfuscate personal responsibility. Those who confront hardship with resilience and lawful conduct must not be overshadowed by those who resort to criminality. The court acknowledges the report from ShelterLink, a frontline charity actively working to support vulnerable adults in temporary housing, which was part of the defence submissions. Their advocacy is commendable, yet the reality remains that engagement with support services is facultative, and failure to do so diminishes its mitigating value. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. In conclusion, the court will proceed to direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, incorporating consideration of rehabilitative options, appropriate community penalties, and custody risk assessments. This will enable an informed and nuanced sentencing decision at the forthcoming hearing. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 9 September 2025, in Court 5 at Luton Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal conviction or sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON R v. MR H Case No. T2026/04831 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. A. Grimshaw Filed: 12 September 2026 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in relation to multiple offences of theft from retail premises, committed over a sustained period and prosecuted under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending, as charged, principally concerns your involvement in shoplifting over a roughly eighteen-month period in and around Brighton and Hove city. Procedural History You were first identified as a suspect after a series of visits to several high-street chains and independent stores. The local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), operating in coordination with Sussex Police and the Brighton & Hove Neighbourhood Policing Team, undertook an extensive collation of CCTV footage, staff accounts, and electronic point-of-sale discrepancy reports. The collective effort spanned a number of weeks in late 2025 into early 2026, highlighting a pattern of repeated theft involving small but consistent items from multiple premises. The case was initially allocated to the magistrates’ court at Brighton but transferred to this Crown Court for sentencing due to the number of indictable counts consolidated into a single representative charge. The Better Case Management (BCM) regime was engaged early, with listing of plea and trial preparation hearings within expected time frames. The matter then proceeded to pleas before this court. The multifaceted nature of this investigation required the diligent cooperation of multiple agencies. It remains a matter of record that despite pressures on staffing within the local policing units and the stretched resources of the BCRP—now operating with reduced funding approaching a five-year low—the collation and timely sharing of intelligence was relatively effective in this instance. On behalf of the court, I acknowledge these efforts, as well as the assistance provided by retail staff who furnished detailed victim impact statements outlining the cumulative effect of your offending on their working environments. It is regrettable, however, that the progress of these proceedings was, on two occasions, impeded by administrative delays. On 15 June 2026, the court was compelled to adjourn sentencing due to unresolved applications for funding in respect of a forensic psychological assessment, which ultimately was approved some four weeks after the initial request was submitted. Such delays are more than procedural inconveniences; they risk infringing on the principle of prompt justice, which underpins the Criminal Procedure Rules and wider constitutional guarantees. The Crown was represented throughout by Ms Yvonne Bennett, whom the court thanks for her clear and measured submissions. Mr James Thornton appeared for you, representing you under a statutory Legal Aid order, and conducted his duties with professionalism despite the systemic challenges posed by repeated funding refusals and slow responses from the Legal Aid Agency—a recurrent theme that the court notes with some frustration. The hearing today proceeded in open court, with full attendance. The courtroom layout, recently refurbished under a Heritage Lottery Fund scheme, provides a more accessible environment for all parties but unfortunately continues to experience occasional technical issues with microphone amplification and digital recording. The official transcript has nonetheless been diligently prepared by court staff, whose commitment to the integrity of court proceedings merits commendation. Within the preparatory material, this court has been provided with a detailed psychiatric report authored by Dr Margaret Lowe, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose findings are characterful of the clinical fellowship she pursued at the Maudsley Hospital. Dr Lowe’s report is comprehensive, if at times overly technical, and provides an assessment relevant to your personal circumstances but ultimately does not diagnose a major mental illness warranting diversion to a hospital order or equivalent disposal. Equally, the report highlights fragile psychosocial circumstances, including long-term unemployment, intermittent engagement with treatment services, and symptoms indicative of mild to moderate depressive disorder. While such material is informative, it must be read alongside the established facts and the overarching framework guiding sentencing in cases of this nature. The court is broadly aware that nationally, retail crime figures show an increasing trend in shoplifting incidents, a challenge reported both by government statistics and retail watchdog bodies. The British Retail Consortium has noted a particular rise in the theft of healthcare and beauty products during the period under review, a trend mirrored locally. These patterns, while concerning, constitute part of a wider social phenomenon and should not be conflated with the conduct of individual defendants. It is further noted that the defendant’s own housing history, as outlined in the probation report dated 30 August 2026, reveals a precarious arrangement in temporary supported accommodation following a previous eviction from council stock. These housing dynamics are symptomatic of the broader housing crisis currently unfolding across the Southeast of England, where falling affordability and reduced social housing stock continue to exert pressure on vulnerable populations. Such context, while not excusing offending behaviour, is of undeniable relevance in understanding the circumstances in which offences may occur. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. There is precedent for many facets of your conduct and history within the case law that informs judicial discretion. The decision in R v. Pearce [2019] EWCA Crim 1109 examined repeated thefts from multiple out-of-town retail outlets and outlined the balancing act between deterrence and rehabilitation. Pearce was ultimately sentenced to ten months’ custody, with the court citing the \"cumulative impact on victim retailers and local economies\" as justification for immediate custodial punishment despite the modest individual value of stolen goods. While your behaviour as established on the admitted facts shows parallels, each case must be assessed on its own merits. Meanwhile, the judgment in R v. Bantrell [2022] EWCA Crim 1628 serves as a reminder of the limited extent to which personal hardship factors may mitigate sentence. Although Bantrell, like yourself, suffered chronic unemployment and unstable accommodation, the Court of Appeal affirmed a sentence of community rehabilitation order with unpaid work, reflecting the absence of serious harm but recognising the need for court-led intervention to prevent recidivism. Such guidance informs this court’s approach in your case. A further case of note, R v. Fortescue [2021] EWCA Crim 1470, involved theft of pharmaceuticals from neighbourhood chemists. Fortescue employed distraction techniques and altered his appearance to evade detection. His custodial sentence was justified on the basis of the breach of trust and the heightened risk of harm where stolen medicines were diverted into the illicit market, potentially endangering vulnerable users. Though those facts differ from yours, the principle that even low-value theft may pose public dangers is instructive here. At the initial hearing on 7 May 2026, the court took care to observe the demands that such casework places on overstretched probation services. Indeed, a recent HM Inspectorate of Probation report highlighted a sector-wide challenge in resource allocation, with caseloads increasingly unmanageable and waiting lists for key programmes—such as abstinence-based substance misuse pathways—growing. The impact on sentencing outcomes and rehabilitative potential cannot be overstated. These institutional challenges are now woven into the fabric of criminal justice administration and must be borne in mind when considering mechanisms for intervention. It is important to acknowledge that the defendant’s personal background includes both engagement and detachment from available support systems. Letters submitted in your favour by local charity workers at the Open Door Centre commend your intermittent participation but also note episodes of disengagement, particularly during periods of housing instability. This court accepts that such oscillation is not uncommon among defendants facing structural hardships but also cautions that without consistent engagement, the efficacy of voluntary schemes is compromised. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. Historically, the Theft Act 1968 has served as the cornerstone legislative instrument governing offences such as the present. Its original framers could scarcely have anticipated the emergence of omnipresent surveillance technologies, digital payment methods, and automated inventory controls which current retailers deploy. The law’s enduring principles, however, remain constant in defining wrongful appropriation with the intent permanently to deprive. More recent sentencing guidelines issued by His Majesty’s Sentencing Council reflect an evolving understanding of the need to calibrate penalties according to harm and culpability rather than purely monetary valuation. Factors such as the vulnerability of victims, repeat offending, sophistication or premeditation, and impact upon community confidence are rightly emphasised. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. In an unrelated but contemporaneous case in this circuit, R v. Stonebrook [2025] EWCA Crim 901, the defendant was convicted of involvement in fly-tipping hazardous waste—much of which was asbestos-laden—within a protected green belt area. Stonebrook's conduct, unrelated to retail or shoplifting offences, attracted a considerable custodial sentence underscoring the courts’ increasing unwillingness to countenance environmental degradation. That case had, however, no bearing on the defendant currently before this court but demonstrates the breadth of sentencing practice across offence categories. This court must also express concern about the slow but steady rise in acquisitive crimes in the Brighton area—many linked to the growth of social media marketplaces and informal economies for the resale of stolen goods. The effect on smaller local businesses, already grappling with the pressures of the post-pandemic economic environment, is salutary. The cumulative disruption from repeated petty theft is a factor appropriately weighted in sentencing. The retail sector’s resilience is not inexhaustible. The Crown proffered victim impact statements from seven separate premises, chiefly independent pharmacies and grocery stores. One manager described the atmosphere in her store as markedly tense during your visits, with part-time staff reportedly requesting additional security or avoiding shifts overlapping with your known patterns. A broad though indirect psychological impact is evident and must be taken seriously, even if your behaviour did not amount to physical or verbal aggression. The probation report notes a history of poly-substance misuse dating back some years but records your recent abstention from illicit drugs, corroborated by local community drug service attendance data. It raises the possibility of an impulsivity-related vulnerability but finds that you retain the capacity for decision-making and responsibility-taking. Nevertheless, it identifies that your pattern of offending, while not violent, is symptomatic of underlying instability and the absence of sustained protective factors. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. In reaching this stage of proceedings, I must also mention the involvement of the community social work team. In correspondence received from Ms Patricia Leverett, a caseworker at Brighton Support Plus, it is evident that while efforts at engagement have been made, resource constraints have limited their capacity to maintain frequent contact. Such letters attest to the systemic difficulties in providing wraparound services in a context of demand outstripping supply. Further complicating factors are your reported episodic non-compliance with medication prescribed for depressive symptoms, as outlined by a community psychiatric nurse in her report dated 28 August 2026. This absence of adherence is often observed in clinical practice and may aggravate emotional volatility and judgment errors. However, in the absence of evidence of serious mental illness or psychosis, this does not constitute a mitigating factor sufficient to offset your culpability. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. It is noteworthy that your criminal record includes previous convictions for shoplifting dating back eight years, with an interval of apparent desistance interrupted by a recent resurgence beginning in late 2024. A community resolution was administered in 2023 following a theft from a supermarket but with limited sustained effect. This reflects a pattern of offending behaviour that the courts and agencies have sought to disrupt through a variety of means, including caution, community sentences, and referral to rehabilitative programming. Regrettably, those interventions have not produced the desired outcome. The court has also had regard to a recent decision in R v. Ealing [2024] EWCA Crim 1122, where an offender with a similar profile—multiple theft convictions, substance misuse history, and sporadic engagement with support services—was given an immediate custodial sentence because community sentences had demonstrably failed to deter repeated offending over a protracted period. While this case is factually distinct, it illustrates the courts’ responses to recidivism in acquisitive crime. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. At an earlier hearing the defendant’s counsel submitted a series of letters from family members and community advocates highlighting financial hardship, childhood adversity, and statements of remorse. These documents were duly considered but, as always, require cautious interpretation given the laudable but inevitably partial perspective they represent. Alongside the more formal submissions, this court notes that your letter to the court was thoughtfully composed, clearly conveying regret. Such gestures have their place but must be weighed against the nature of the offending and the broader public interest. It is a regrettable fact of contemporary criminal justice that repeat offenders frequently express contrition only when faced with overwhelming evidence, offering little prior engagement or acceptance of responsibility. Advanced guilty pleas are accordingly incentivised by the sentencing framework to reward prompt recognition of wrongdoing and to reduce the distress caused to victims and witnesses. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The court also acknowledges the restrained and professional manner in which the defence has conducted its representation, notwithstanding the obstacles posed by slow authorisation of expert instructions via Legal Aid and the administrative burden of coordinating multiple reports, letters, and support statements. The delicate dance between defending a client’s rights and facilitating effective justice is one that practitioners manage daily, often with little public recognition. Of note, the defence have respectfully highlighted your expressed desire to participate in a structured rehabilitation and employment reintegration programme following sentence. Whether such an approach proves viable can only be evaluated after the receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. In a somewhat tangential matter, it may be recorded that the co-defendant in an unrelated trial currently before this court was found to have possessed a bladed article in a school car park—charges unrelated to your case but indicative of the wide range of offences encountered within this jurisdiction. This does not reflect upon your conduct but demonstrates the breadth of criminal activity that occupies the courts. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. The court must balance several factors, including the seriousness of the offending, the culpability and previous record of the defendant, the impact on victims and the community, and the prospects for rehabilitation. Public protection and deterrence are central. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines stress that persistent acquisitive offending, especially when accompanied by raising fear or anxiety among retail staff, warrants firm response. Equally, where there is evidence of underlying vulnerabilities, support and intervention are necessary to reduce future harm. As has been judicially affirmed in R v. Grayson [2023] EWCA Crim 1754, sentences should be tailored to address offending behaviour but also cognisant of systemic challenges such as social deprivation and service availability. While society must show compassion, it cannot abdicate responsibility for upholding standards of lawful conduct. This court has carefully reviewed all available reports and submissions, and while mindful of your personal circumstances, must not lose sight of the seriousness of a course of conduct that betrays both trust and community cohesion. The availability of community-based programmes with a cognitive-behavioural element remain a significant mitigating element if they can be relied upon to reduce risk. However, given your history of intermittent engagement and prior unsuccessful community sentences, custodial options are a distinct possibility. Accordingly, I direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared, including a risk assessment and tailored intervention plan. The Probation Service is also requested to consider any suitable mental health or addiction treatment referrals, as well as vocational training prospects that might support post-sentence reintegration. These matters will be considered fully at the sentence hearing scheduled for 20 October 2026. This court reserves final determination until receipt and review of the comprehensive pre-sentence report and any further representations from all parties. This concludes the sentencing remarks issued at the Crown Court at Brighton in Court 4, dated 12 September 2026. The proceedings have been transcribed and are recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are not engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELVEDERE R v. Mr H Case No. T2025/14689 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. F. Winslow Filed: 4 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence on a representative charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to a series of thefts from multiple retail outlets within the metropolitan area between September 2023 and May 2025. The indictment concerns a course of conduct characterised by repeated appropriations of goods without payment, bringing you within the purview of this court’s jurisdiction in respect of persistent acquisitive offending of a degree justifying Crown Court trial and sentencing. Procedural History The journey to this point has been protracted, as is often the case with such matters involving low-level but persistent offending. Your initial arrest occurred on 28 May 2025, following the conclusion of a lengthy investigation conducted by the Belvedere Metropolitan Police Service alongside the local Retail Crime Task Force. The multi-agency collaboration involved regular communication with store security teams, the Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), and community safety officers, thereby illustrating the increasingly complex ecosystem in which such offences are now managed. It merits noting that the co-operation, while not exceptional, was sufficient to collate a substantial evidential package in good time, facilitating your eventual charge and case progression. The criminal justice process in cases of this nature has, over recent years, become entangled with multiple layers of administrative and procedural complexity. For example, while the Better Case Management scheme was designed to curtail delay and duplication, the experience to date has been mixed. Here, the case navigated several listings, including a plea and trial preparation hearing held on 21 July 2025, followed by adjournments required to facilitate forensic expert reports and defence submissions. These delays mirror a broader trend, noted in recent justice sector reviews, of escalating listing pressures in Crown Courts outside of central London, exacerbated by staffing shortages in both the judiciary and court administrative staff. The scheduling constraints have impacted the timely initiation of sentence preparation work, a regrettably frequent feature in this jurisdiction. It is necessary to acknowledge that the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative procedures caused further postponements. An initial application to instruct an independent forensic behavioural analyst was submitted by your counsel on 15 June 2025 but experienced considerable delay before eventual approval on 4 August 2025. This delay, though unfortunate, is emblematic of systemic issues well-documented elsewhere, involving backlogs, stringent vetting requirements, and limited resources at the Agency. The attendant disruption to case readiness is a matter of concern, not least because it impedes the full investigative and therapeutic potential of expert input in cases involving underlying vulnerabilities or complex personal histories. The plea hearing on 3 September 2025 saw you enter a guilty plea to the representative count. It is neither unusual nor unexpected that pleas in shoplifting cases are entered late, often at the point when evidential certainty becomes overwhelming. While no doubt a feature of reasonable defence strategy, the court is, as ever, mindful that credit for guilty plea is contingent on early admissions of guilt which materially reduce the burden on victims, witnesses, and the court system itself. The present plea does not therefore attract maximal reduction, as will be considered further below. The Theft Act 1968, as amended, continues to be the foundational statutory provision governing the offence of theft. Section 1 articulates the essential elements — the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another, with the intention to permanently deprive the owner — each component carefully defined and judicially refined in a body of case law spanning decades. It is unnecessary to rehearse exhaustively the well-trodden principles; suffice to emphasise that the accumulation, frequency, and manner of offending constitute key aggravating factors within the applicable sentencing frameworks. Recent sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council provide structure to the court’s discretion, setting indicative ranges and emphasizing context, culpability, and harm. The guidelines recognise that shoplifting, while often associated with low individual value, can entail considerable cumulative harm, especially where targeting vulnerable or independent retailers or exploiting repeat opportunities. Also relevant is the framework established by R v. Sinclair [2019] EWCA Crim 1057, which underscores that persistence and deliberate evasion reflect a heightened degree of culpability. Likewise, R v. Harcourt [2021] EWCA Crim 1523 is instructive for the principle that offences liable to attract custodial sentences negate the presumption that theft under a certain monetary threshold is a matter for summary disposal only. This court is alive to the wider social policy ambitions embedded in Lord Justice Kay’s observations in R v. Waine [2016] EWCA Crim 63, where emphasis was placed on the underlying needs of defendants, including poverty-induced pressures, while maintaining the primacy of public protection and victim impact considerations. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. It bears emphasis that persistent offending yields disproportionate cost to the criminal justice system and commercial targets alike. In this case, police resourcing extended to the deployment of a dedicated task force examining eleven incident reports across the greater Belvedere retail sector, engaging five different store chains. This reflects the intensity of the police response which, although involving staff drawn away from other duties, was necessary due to the pattern of activity and the community concerns voiced. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. The facts establishing guilt — through a combination of surveillance footage, witness testimony, and forensic examination of recovered items — disclose a pattern of conduct involving the strategic selection of goods, repeated visits to target premises, and methodical concealment techniques. This was not a series of isolated misjudgements or momentary lapses, but a calculated endeavour to benefit from unlawful acquisition. Deborah Whittle, Probation Officer, prepared a pre-sentence report in advance of the sentencing hearing and provided a detailed account of your social and psychological background. The report notes a history of intermittent employment primarily in the retail and hospitality sectors, disrupted by periods of unstable accommodation and financial insecurity. The report also highlights episodes of self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, though no formal diagnosis of major mental illness has been established. It is well recognised that the pressures of precarious employment markets and insecure housing, coupled with economic uncertainty, create a fertile environment for acquisitive crimes of this nature. However, as the Court of Appeal emphasised in R v. Patterson [2018] EWCA Crim 3035, personal circumstances do not excuse offending, nor diminish the need for clear judicial responses to protect victims, ensure public confidence, and deter future misconduct. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. The psychological assessment appended to the probation dossier was completed by Dr Marcus Fenwick, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, whose report admits certain cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities, including impulsivity and social anxiety, but excludes evidence of any axis one disorder sufficiently severe to markedly impair criminal responsibility. Dr Fenwick cautiously flagged a low-to-medium risk of reoffending, contingent upon stable accommodation and engagement with supportive services. The profession’s incremental shift towards trauma-informed practice has underscored the importance of understanding defendants’ backgrounds. Yet, as Dr Fenwick notes, “The availability of voluntary sector support and statutory services is necessary but not sufficient in itself to prevent offending. Engagement and motivation are critical factors.” Your reported history is marred by sporadic attendance at appointments and reluctance to pursue employment or structured rehabilitation pathways. The court acknowledges your family connections, including extended relations residing locally, but notes that these relationships appear to afford minimal social capital or motivational leverage. While personal letters submitted on your behalf, including one from a pastoral care worker and another from a long-standing volunteer at a community food bank, are commendably conciliatory, their content does not materially diminish the nature or impact of the offending. It is appropriate at this juncture to reflect more broadly on the social framing of such offending patterns. We find ourselves amid a nexus of social policy tensions — welfare reform, austerity, and fluctuating economic fortunes — each feeding into the mosaic shaping individuals’ choices. Nevertheless, the court cannot abdicate responsibility for ensuring that criminal liability adheres to notions of personal agency and accountability. Extensive discourse and research into ‘broken communities’ and systemic failures abound, yet the judiciary must apply legal standards without succumbing to sociological relativism. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. A further point of interest is the manner in which retail premises have adapted operationally to the challenges posed by recurrent offending. This includes the installation of additional electronic tagging systems, more frequent rearrangement of product displays, and staff rotation measures to mitigate risks of targeting. While these responses are operationally justifiable, they carry unintended consequences, including staff stress, reduced shopping convenience, and, potentially, the diminution of the local retail environment. The local Business Crime Reduction Partnership has provided evidence detailing the extent of these measures and their cost implications. Notably, the partnership reported a 12% increase in shoplifting incidents over the past year, necessitating a commensurate increase in resource allocation towards preventative strategies — resources which could otherwise be deployed to combat violent crime or more serious offences. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. Of interest to the court is the observation, drawn from recent policing reports, that a disproportionate number of persistent offenders of this nature reside in areas of socio-economic deprivation, often lacking stable tenancy and grappling with mental health and substance misuse issues. These factors undoubtedly complicate enforcement responses. However, failure to heed these realities would be neither honest nor consonant with principles of justice. The sentencing aims, as articulated in statutory frameworks and affirmed by the Court of Appeal in cases such as R v. Wells [2024] EWCA Crim 85, remain deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation, and the protection of the public. The challenge lies in balancing these sometimes competing purposes without abdicating judicial responsibility or capitulating to external pressures. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. The impact upon victims is neither theoretical nor insignificant. Whilst no physical harm was occasioned, the disruption and distress experienced by retail staff has been well-documented. Several employees provided statements attesting to feelings of insecurity, anxiety, and reduced job satisfaction, prompting altered shift patterns and absences. One witness recounted experiencing harassment following identification and publicisation of their role in reporting offences. Such secondary consequences emphasize the ripple effects of shoplifting beyond monetary loss alone. The voluntary sector organisations engaged in victim support have supplemented these accounts with data revealing a sustained decline in staff wellbeing metrics and exacerbated workplace stress in affected outlets. These effects, though not quantifiable in the conventional sense, resonate deeply within the communities concerned. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. It is appropriate, in the context of shoplifting sentencing, to consider restorative avenues where practicable. In this instance, however, efforts to arrange such meetings have foundered, with little meaningful engagement forthcoming from your side. This limits the court’s ability to account for remedial dialogue in mitigation. I would be remiss not to note the existence of several co-defendants in connected investigations concerning unrelated offences—from fly-tipping on greenbelt land to allegations of affray at a local public house. These separate matters lie beyond the scope of these proceedings and have no bearing on your culpability or sentencing. It is a salutary reminder of the broad spectrum of acquisitive and disorderly conduct encountered by the criminal justice system contemporaneously. The court also notes that a neighbour in your building is currently subject to a noise abatement order following complaints to the local council. This is manifestly irrelevant to your own case but reflects the broader context in which these proceedings unfold. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. In assessing risk of harm to the public, it must be acknowledged that you do not pose a significant violent danger. No evidence of aggression or threat towards staff has emerged. Nonetheless, the persistence and methodical nature of the offending illustrate a degree of calculated disregard for legal proscriptions and social norms that justifies firm sentencing response. The criminal justice system’s obligations extend beyond punishment. Engagement with rehabilitation services, including cognitive behavioural programmes aimed at addressing offending behaviour and underlying motivations, offers a path to reduced recidivism. The National Probation Service, within its current resource constraints and staffing pressures detailed in internal reports, has indicated willingness to prioritise your case for inclusion in such programmes, subject to your cooperation. Historical references to the Sentencing Council’s guidance on theft offences emphasise the dichotomy between first-time or low culpability offenders and those exhibiting repeat, planned offending. The latter group, which includes you, must expect sentences calibrated for both individual deterrence and collective protection. In conclusion, these sentencing remarks are made following careful consideration of all pleadings, reports, victim impact statements, and submissions of counsel. The court is grateful to Mr Olivier Kessler, appearing for the Crown, and Ms Caroline Stokes, representing the defence under a Legal Aid representation order. The detailed pre-sentence report, alongside expert psychological input, has been invaluable in shaping the court’s understanding of your personal circumstances and risks. The court regrets the unavoidable delays occasioned by administrative and procedural bottlenecks but must nevertheless proceed with a sentencing disposition consistent with public interest. Sentencing will be deferred until the receipt of an updated pre-sentence report, to be completed by your probation officer. That report should address all avenues of community disposal, including the potential for structured interventions to address acquisitive behaviour and underlying vulnerabilities, the feasibility of supervision requirements, and any custodial alternatives. The court will consider any submissions concerning potential restorative justice engagement, local accommodation options, and support services. This judgment is delivered in open court, at the Crown Court at Belvedere, Court 5, on this the 4th day of October 2025. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days under the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are in place. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT WESTMINSTER R v. MR H Case No. 2025/45837 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. Barrington Filed: 14 August 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence upon a charge arising under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically concerning shoplifting offences committed over a protracted period. The prosecutorial material describes incidents involving various retail premises located within the Westminster and Kensington areas, spanning from late 2023 through the early months of 2025. This case encapsulates a sustained course of unlawful conduct, warranting meticulous judicial consideration not only of the facts but also the broader social and procedural context surrounding your prosecution. Procedural History and Institutional Context The present proceedings have been notable for a sequence of hearing dates and procedural steps, reflective of both the court’s case management protocols and the complexities inherent in this particular prosecution. Initially charged in January 2025, your case was allocated to the Crown Court following a referral from Magistrates’ Court in March of that year, pursuant to the parameters established for offences where custody might be anticipated. A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 22 March 2025; at that time, you entered a not guilty plea. Thereafter, it is of record that multiple applications for evidential disclosure and forensic analysis were made, resulting in adjournments across three occasioned dates: namely, 15 April, 10 June, and 6 July 2025. Partly, these were attributable to delays in the processing and reporting of CCTV evidence from the various establishments victimised, compounded by the administrative backlog within the Metropolitan Police Service’s Digital Evidence Unit. I note with a measure of frustration—and indeed sympathy for all those involved—that such delays are by no means uncommon in cases of comparable complexity across the criminal justice system. The evolving reliance on digital evidence, while invaluable, brings its own challenges, notably in ensuring timely and robust disclosure. Furthermore, it is acknowledged in the documentation before this court that liaison between prosecuting counsel, the business crime partnership initiatives active in Westminster, and Safer Neighbourhood Teams, has been consistent, albeit compromised on occasion by staff turnover within these agencies. This state of flux is symptomatic of the wider strains imposed by budget constraints and workforce attrition in policing and local authority services. The local borough’s Business Crime Reduction Partnership, primarily funded by retail levy contributions, operates within these constraints yet has nevertheless provided victim impact statements that articulate the operational ramifications of persistent shop theft on their members. Regrettably, I must report that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of the defence’s application to instruct a forensic psychiatrist experienced in compulsive-acquisitive behaviour was subject to avoidable delays. The initial request, submitted on 12 May 2025 by Mr Owen Clarke of Chambers at 12 New Square, was met with a protracted sequence of administrative queries and requests for clarification before approval was granted on 19 June 2025. Such bureaucratic inertia places undue strain on all parties and, more importantly, may impair the timely preparation and fair presentation of a defendant’s case. There is a developing consensus among legal practitioners of the need for reform to expedite these essential assessments when expert opinion is crucial to sentencing. A psychiatric assessment, the results of which are contained in Dr Fiona McIntyre’s detailed report of 20 July 2025, was subsequently furnished to the court and Probation Service. Dr McIntyre’s reflections have informed the present sentencing considerations to a significant degree. During the plea and trial preparation hearing of 5 August 2025, you altered your plea to guilty in respect of a representative charge embodying a course of conduct constituting numerous individual incidents of shoplifting. The court notes the timing of this plea—a matter to which I will return. It is well established that the fundamental elements of theft require a finding of dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with an intention to permanently deprive, as laid out in the Theft Act 1968. Shoplifting, particularly when repeated or planned, carries serious repercussions not merely for the direct victims but for wider community confidence in the rule of law and commercial safety. InR v. Stainton [2019] EWCA Crim 1255, the Court of Appeal emphasised the multifactorial impact of burglary and theft offences, noting that the emotional toll on victims extends beyond economic loss to encompass feelings of violation and vulnerability. Although shoplifting often involves lower monetary values, the Court acknowledged that repeated breaches, especially targeting small retailers or those with limited security infrastructure, carry enhanced seriousness. Similarly, the guidance provided in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (December 2019) remains authoritative. The guideline instructs courts to assess culpability and harm with reference to deterioration of victim confidence, potential for disruption of business, and the defendant’s prior history and intent. The Court is further mindful of R v. Elwood [2020] EWCA Crim 1378, which explored the parameters of credit allowable for a late guilty plea. The decision underscores that while credit for guilty plea incentivises early admissions, reduction in sentencing must correlate with meaningful acceptance of responsibility rather than tactical delay. It is perhaps germane to recall the statutory framework of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 regulating the structure of sentencings, which the court must balance alongside the guidance offered by case law. The role of the probation officer’s pre-sentence report remains invaluable in understanding the rehabilitative prospects and necessary public protection measures. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. While the detailed averments concerning the offences stand largely uncontested, the court is mindful that the factual matrix presented is not isolated but rather interwoven with broader issues of community safety, resource allocation, and offender management. It is instructive to remind the court of established jurisprudence concerning the nexus between shoplifting and other societal factors. For example, R v. Clough [2017] EWCA Crim 2106 considered the connection between acquisitive crimes and underlying mental health conditions, cautioning against simplistic causal assumptions but recognising legitimate mitigating circumstances where appropriate. The social setting of repeated shoplifting in high-density urban environments is likewise of interest in academic criminological discourse. The interplay of economic hardship, entrenched disadvantage, and social exclusion pathways has been noted in the recent Home Office research report titled “Acquisitive Crime: Patterns and Causes” (February 2024), which reiterates the consequences for local retail ecosystems and consumer confidence. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. Significant weight is accorded to the statements and submissions received from the affected retailers. Notably, a consortium of independent chemists and food stores operating in the affected boroughs have documented the difficulties posed by repeated theft, including the need for increased security arrangements and suffering tangible business losses. The Westminster Retail Victim Support Network, which offers assistance to staff through trauma-informed interventions, submitted a statement describing increased levels of anxiety and stress among employees following repeated incidents attributable to the defendant. Such psychological and operational fallout, though intangible, is consequential and factors into the assessment of harm for sentencing purposes. Moreover, the court recognises the work of organisations such as the Public Realm Initiative, which has highlighted street-level disorder linked to acquisitive offending and its contribution to a perceived decline in local amenity and public safety. There is, it must be said, a growing impatience among the public with respect to persistent theft and antisocial behaviour, demanding appropriate responses from courts and enforcement agencies alike. The court also acknowledges the role of the Metropolitan Police Service’s Theft Deterrence Unit, established to tackle prolific shoplifting offenders through intelligence-led patrols and community engagement. The unit’s case records in Mr H’s interactions note his profile as a repeat low-level offender, resistant to prior diversionary efforts. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. Dr McIntyre’s psychiatric evaluation is detailed, professionally composed, and duly observed by this court. It identifies no diagnosable major mental illness but notes the presence of traits suggestive of compulsive acquisitive behaviour and impulsivity. The report highlights a lack of engagement with support services despite multiple offers by social workers and community outreach programmes. The probation pre-sentence report supplements this context, painting a picture of Mr H as a man currently unemployed, under considerable financial and housing stress, residing temporarily within a local authority-managed hostel with limited stability. The report further recommends targeted cognitive-behavioural interventions and possible participation in a diversion-to-work scheme designed to address underlying criminogenic needs. I note with some regret that Housing Support Services have been hampered by chronic underfunding, with long waiting lists for stable accommodation compounding the vulnerability of offenders such as yourself. Similarly, the local Substance Misuse Service, although offered, has noted patchy attendance and engagement from you over the past 12 months. Understandably, in this court’s experience, the efficacy of community-based sentences depends greatly upon the cooperation and motivation of the individual. Delivery of rehabilitative programmes is frequently challenged not only by individual circumstances but by systemic pressures on probation and health services. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. Turning to legal representation, I record appreciation for counsel on both sides. Ms Eleanor Finch, appearing for the Crown, provided comprehensive and measured submissions. Similarly, Mr Owen Clarke, instructed on Legal Aid, advanced a robust defence emphasising mitigating factors, hardship, and remorse. Both counsel have conducted themselves with commendable professionalism despite the administrative hurdles faced. It is regrettable that the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted engagement with applications for expert reports and representation orders added delay to these proceedings, as noted earlier. This pattern has been lamented by practitioners across the criminal justice system and warrants ongoing attention from policymakers. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. It is worth observing that the Better Case Management system, introduced in 2017 with the laudable goal of expediting case disposal and enhancing procedural efficiency, assisted in the structured progression of this matter. However, notwithstanding this, three adjournments for expert assessments and disclosure prevented a swift conclusion. I also note the incremental value of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership, which, despite chronic underresourcing, manages a commendable coordination effort, including the dissemination of offender profiles to local shops and training for staff in incident handling and deterrence. These efforts, while valuable, can only go so far without systemic support. Another procedural footnote: an adjournment scheduled for 2 July 2025 was necessitated by the unavailability of the court linguistic interpreter initially instructed to assist with interviews of witnesses whose primary language is Polish. The last-minute nature of the request reflects systemic shortages in interpreter resources, an issue the judiciary routinely encounters but is beyond the power of this court to resolve. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. The court also notes, with no direct relevance to this case, the conviction of a co-accused individual in a separate affair relating to aggravated burglary in Croydon, who was found to be in unlawful possession of a bladed article on school grounds. Although that conviction is unrelated to Mr H’s matters, it reminds the court of the importance of clearly distinguishing facts as they pertain to each defendant. Similarly, a set of charges involving the fly-tipping of waste on green belt land in the Oxfordshire district, which was heard contemporaneously in another Crown Court, presents an example of environmental offences prosecuted robustly in recent months, but which do not reflect on the culpability or the circumstances herein. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Much turns on the seriousness of the offending, the harm caused, the degree of planning or sophistication, the defendant’s antecedents, and his prospects for rehabilitation. While no allegation of violence exists, the repeated nature of the thefts, the impact upon victim confidence, and the persistence despite previous warnings and interventions, all serve to elevate culpability. The court must balance the need for punishment and deterrence with the principles of rehabilitation and the protection of the public. As reflected in the guidelines, community sentences incorporating rehabilitative components remain appropriate where feasible, provided compliance is likely and public protection assured. Despite the absence of serious psychiatric disorder, the traits noted by Dr McIntyre, together with the probation assessment, suggest that intervention could mitigate the risk of reoffending. This court endorses, therefore, the exploration of cognitive skills training and support addressing impulsivity and acquisitive patterns. The timing of the plea, while not immediate, is nonetheless made prior to trial. While such a late plea may attract a reduction in sentencing credit compared to an early admission, it nevertheless represents an acceptance which this court recognises for its procedural benefits. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. In concluding these remarks, I wish to place on the record my appreciation for the commendable efforts of the Victim Support Liaison Officers, whose work in engaging with both victims and defendants reflects the evolving ethos of restorative justice. Their outreach in this case was both thorough and sensitive. I also take this opportunity to commend the court staff and ushers in Court 5 at the Westminster Crown Court, who, despite recent refurbishment efforts and occasional staffing shortages, have maintained a standard of order and efficiency deserving of mention. I must finally note that the price of persistent acquisitive offending is not borne solely by those prosecuted or their immediate victims. It extends to public services struggling to keep pace with demand, from stretched police forces to probation officers juggling escalating caseloads, from mental health teams confronting rising referrals to local authorities grappling with housing shortages. The retail sector itself, however willing to partner with law enforcement, faces its own pressures: cost inflation, supply chain disruption, and the need to invest in security technologies all converge to create a challenging environment. These externalities, while not determinative of sentence, form the backdrop to the court’s assessment. Having set out the contextual and procedural tapestry in which this case is embedded, the court must now turn to sentence. I hereby order the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the National Probation Service. This report is to explore all available options for sentencing, including the suitability of a Community Order with Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, attendance at cognitive behavioural intervention programmes, housing support plans, and assessments of compliance risk. The report should also take account of current public health advice, particularly in relation to scheduling interventions amidst fluctuating Covid-19 infection rates and any consequent service provision challenges. This court will schedule an early sentencing hearing upon receipt of the report. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINDSOR R v. MR H Case No. WX2025/14679 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. R. Ellington Filed: 12 August 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence on the charge of theft, specifically shoplifting, brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge reflects a representative offence encapsulating a series of incidents occurring between November 2023 and April 2025, primarily within retail premises situated in the boroughs of Windsor, Maidenhead, and Slough. Procedural History Your prosecution followed a lengthy multi-agency operation spearheaded by the Windsor Retail Security Partnership (WRSP), which, responding to an observed rise in retail theft reports, embarked upon an intelligence-led forum aiming to reduce the prevalence of store burglaries and shoplifting incidents across the region. Data from business CCTV systems, coupled with police incident reports, informed the identification of suspect profiles, leading to a concentrated focus on individuals exhibiting patterns of repeated offending in high-footfall commercial zones. This operational model aligns with practices advocated by the Home Office Business Crime Strategy (2022), despite its known limitations regarding inter-agency communication and funding constraints. The investigative phase was characterised by protracted surveillance activities encompassing coordination with transport authorities, including an unauthorized scrutiny of public transit usage data — conducted under recently issued judicial authority in compliance with the Investigation Powers Act 2016 — as well as engagement with retail loss-prevention teams. The procedural intricacies inherent in this coordinated approach speak to the broader challenges faced by law enforcement in combating acquisitive offences without recourse to more overtly coercive investigative tactics. It bears noting that while the WRSP metadata analysis came under internal review for data retention compliance during the period in question, no procedural improprieties were identified materially affecting the investigatory outcome. Conversely, the length of the investigation inevitably placed additional strain upon frontline police resources, arguably detracting from higher priority assignments. However, the court must emphasise that the principle of equality before the law necessitates such proportional allocation of attention, regardless of the perceived gravity of the offence. Your initial interview under caution took place on 14 May 2025 at Windsor Police Station. This followed your apprehension on 10 May, a date memorialised in a letter from District Inspector Sarah Coleman to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which commends the diligent cross-referencing of offences that yielded your identification as the principal suspect. During this interview, you elected not to engage further than providing your name and address, exercising your right to silence. Post-charge, however, you entered a guilty plea at the Plea and Case Management Hearing on 20 June 2025. The court is mindful that the case progressed under the Better Case Management regime, adhering generally to the Criminal Procedure Rules’ indicative timelines despite some documented challenges posed by short-staffing and the need to afford Legal Aid applications the requisite scrutiny. I must observe, with no small measure of frustration, that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of your defence authorisation presented avoidable complications. Specifically, the request to instruct an independent forensic psychologist was initially refused in May 2025 due to misclassified eligibility criteria, only rectified after the intervention of your appointed counsel, Mr Benjamin Callow, following a prolonged correspondence extending into early June. Such delays, while regrettably frequent elsewhere, invariably prejudice timely access to expert opinion and inhibit comprehensive case preparation. These systemic inefficiencies risk diluting the rights of defendants and, by extension, the integrity of the courtroom process. The trial listing itself experienced a curtailed rescheduling due to a minor administrative oversight involving court staff deployment on 17 July 2025, which, while of no lasting consequence to you, underscores the pressures endured by the judicial system in the current climate of resource constraint. In examining your prior record, it is necessary to situate your history within the context of relatively limited, yet not insignificant, previous contacts with the justice system. You have three prior convictions for theft-related offences between 2018 and 2023, including one occasion where a community resolution was imposed, reflecting the court's willingness to promote diversionary mechanisms in suitable circumstances. Yet these measures evidently did not deter further offending, thereby justifying this court’s consideration of a more robust disposal. It is germane, before turning to the facts, to mention the victim impact submissions tendered by the Retail Support and Recovery Network (RSRN), a charity that supports independent store owners affected by acquisitive crimes in the region. Their report, compiled subsequent to an extensive survey of affected establishments, details the cumulative financial loss — estimated at £45,000 over two years — and highlights the adverse effects on staff morale and retention, particularly among vulnerable younger employees. The economic and psychosocial detriments noted therein belie any simplistic characterisation of petty theft as victimless crime. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. This court recognises the nuanced challenges faced by retailers in this sector, who contend not only with economic pressures from supply chain volatility but also with the psychological wear of repeated loss and the attendant erosion of community trust. Such factors amplify the seriousness with which offences of this nature must be approached. It is in this vein that the sentencing guidelines published by the Sentencing Council in 2023 emphasise the significance of cumulative harm and repeated offending, even absent physical violence or high-value thefts. In establishing the factual matrix for your offences, it is appropriate also to contextualise the investigative and evidential landscape. The Crown's case was bolstered by covert recordings and the testimony of loss prevention officers, whose accounts were consistent and credible. Further forensic analysis identified your fingerprints on security alarm panels forcibly manipulated during the commission of one episode, underscoring the calculated elements of your conduct. Notwithstanding this, the court acknowledges your eventual expression of remorse and early engagement with rehabilitation planning. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. Turning to the expert evidence, the court is grateful to have received the psychiatric and psychological assessments undertaken by Dr Rebecca Lennox, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, and a complementary report from Probation Officer Mr Samuel Ginn. Dr Lennox’s comprehensive evaluation draws attention to your longstanding difficulties with impulsivity and financial instability, coupled with a history of mild depressive episodes — an observation echoed, albeit with notes of caution, in Mr Ginn’s pre-sentence assessment. The latter identifies a moderate risk of reoffending, contingent upon engagement with appropriate cognitive-behavioural interventions and sustained economic support. In this context, it is germane to refer to the findings of R v Zamir [2019] EWCA Crim 1324, where the Court of Appeal underscored the importance of addressing underlying psychosocial factors in tailoring sentences to achieve rehabilitation and public protection. While the facts differ materially, Zamir sets a precedent for integrating clinical insights into sentencing calibrations. It is also notable that your defence has sought to place emphasis upon familial disruption experienced during adolescence and current episodes of transient homelessness, supported by letters from both your sister, Ms Eloise H, and your caseworker at the Windsor Homeless Outreach Project. These letters attest to your intermittent engagement with support networks and mark a tentative willingness on your part to address the antecedents of your offending. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. Notwithstanding such mitigating material, the court is compelled to reflect on the injurious pattern of repeated acquisition theft, which signals a persistent disregard for social and legal norms and, arguably, an opportunistic exploitation of community goodwill. Whilst the absence of violence or threats is noted, the court must regard your offending as undermining public confidence in lawful commerce and the security of local trade. The court further notes that previous diversionary measures failed to stem the escalation of harm, thereby implicating the suitability of rehabilitative disposals as presently structured. In respect of ancillary case law bearing on sentencing principle, this court is instructed by the approach elucidated in R v Bennett [2020] EWCA Crim 2187, where the appellate tribunal reaffirmed that the efficacy of non-custodial sentences must be balanced carefully against the multiplicity and persistence of offending behaviours. Bennett, involving a series of petty frauds, reiterated that community sentences, while preferable in principle, require genuine compliance and demonstrable effectivity to justify avoidance of custody. It is germane also to remark upon the relevance of the “totality principle,” reflected in the guidance of R v Harland [2016] EWCA Crim 1600, which directs sentencing courts to impose overall sentences proportionate to the aggregate criminality demonstrated, avoiding unjustifiable cumulative harshness or undue leniency. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. In matters relating to sentencing frameworks, this court is bound to apply the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guidelines (2023), which afford detailed quadripartite categorisation, ranging from category 1 — offences of high culpability and damage — through category 4, encompassing low-value, poorly planned offences with no aggravating features. The jury in this matter has convicted you of an offence within category 3, indicative of moderate culpability and prevalent adverse effects on victims and communities. The court also considers relevant the principles embodied within the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, notably sections 142 and 143, articulating the court’s discretion to order ancillary requirements designed to reduce reoffending, including unpaid work and rehabilitation activity requirements. This aligns with the current policy emphasis on restorative justice and the integration of behavioural change components. This system currently operates under ongoing fiscal and capacity-related pressures. The Windsor Probation Service, for instance, reports staff shortages exceeding 20%, constraining its ability to deliver comprehensive programmes, particularly those addressing acquisitive offending pathways. The knock-on effects inevitably influence the availability and quality of interventions accessible to individuals like yourself. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. Consideration of public protection also necessitates reference to the wider social and institutional context. The prevalence of shoplifting offences in recent years has soared in many urban centres, correlating with economic headwinds wrought by inflationary pressures, housing insecurity, and evolving substance misuse patterns. While these macro-factors cannot excuse unlawful behaviour, they frame the challenges of achieving sustainable rehabilitation and risk management. It is pertinent here to reflect upon the statutory and case law framework surrounding the management of offenders with complex needs. The Court of Appeal in R v Marsh [2021] EWCA Crim 1790 elaborated on the interplay between custodial sentences and the availability of suitable rehabilitative provisions, emphasising the duty of courts to weigh the realistic capacity of existing services to meet defendants’ needs against the imperatives of deterrence and denunciation. Your case raises those doctrinal questions in sharper relief: it is a test of the balance between legal sanction and social care, between community protection and offender welfare. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. Notably, the court has had opportunity to review correspondence from the Windsor Homelessness Support Alliance, dated July 2025, outlining your intermittent accommodation difficulties and the persistent barriers to stable housing. Such instability is acknowledged a significant factor in your offending pattern, albeit one which, unmitigated, fuels recurrence. These services express willingness to provide ongoing assistance post-sentence, conditional upon engagement with judicially mandated conditions. The court also received a detailed victim personal statement from Mr Jonathan Weir, manager of the High Street Pharmacy, who described the impact of your thefts as “disheartening and disruptive,” highlighting the consequential loss of business revenue and the necessity to implement increased security measures. The Statement encapsulates the real-world ramifications of acquisitive crime for small business proprietors and their employees. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. An additional operational complexity arises from co-defendant conduct, although this matter is not before the court at present. It is noted that a co-defendant involved in some related offences failed to appear for trial and remains at large, as recorded in police operational logs dated 2 March 2025. While such information is extraneous to your sentencing, it provides a reminder of the multi-faceted nature of retail crime networks, which this court treats with utmost seriousness. Further, prior charges faced by a third-party relative on an unrelated benefit fraud are documented in the background reports. These, however, have no bearing on your culpability or risk profile herein, though their inclusion in administrative files occasionally gives rise to confusion in disclosure protocols. In support of you, the defence has furnished character references from long-term acquaintances, including a letter from the Windsor Soup Kitchen coordinator which attests to your participation in community volunteering events over the past year. While such positive community involvement is welcomed, the court cautions against conflating peripheral activities with a comprehensive commitment to lawful conduct. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. The court recognises candour in your plea and the mitigating influence of genuine personal difficulties, including health, housing, and employment instability. However, the persistence of offending and prior warnings weigh heavily against leniency. In light of the aggregate evidence and your risk profile, this court is inclined to consider a blended sentence combining custodial and community elements. While the precise order must await receipt of an updated pre-sentence report from probation, the assessment will be directed towards feasibility of participation in a Community Behavioural Programme, complemented by mandatory unpaid work and strict compliance monitoring. Probation is further requested to explore integration with local social services to address the underlying factors contributing to your conduct, including housing support and emotional wellbeing. The court reiterates its thanks to all professionals engaged in the compilation of the case materials, including Ms Gabrielle Trench of the CPS for her clear and measured prosecution submissions, and to Mr Benjamin Callow for his conscientious representation, notwithstanding the logistical difficulties encountered. The hearing has been conducted in open court. It is regrettable though unsurprising that such matters rarely attract media attention or wider public discourse. While the judge appreciates that offences like shoplifting might be viewed as minor by some, the sustained cost to communities, businesses, and victims is tangible and significant. Society expects courts to respond proportionately — not disproportionately — and to strike a fair balance between compassion and accountability. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Windsor. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed according to the provisions of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal sentencing hearing is scheduled for 9 September 2025, upon receipt of the probation report and any further representations. You are hereby advised of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, section 49, do not apply. Costs are reserved pending outcome. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT CHELSEA R v. MR H Case No. T2025/13796 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. D. HARRIS Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing in respect of a charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely shoplifting, arising from multiple incidents occurring between late 2023 and the spring of this year across various retail premises in the Chelsea and Kensington areas. This matter was transferred to the Crown Court from the Magistrates’ Court pursuant to the Better Case Management protocol, in recognition of the complex evidential framework and the need for coordinated hearings. Procedural Background The offence and associated investigations required the involvement of several agencies, including the Metropolitan Police Service’s Retail Theft Unit, Crime Scene Investigators from the Digital Forensics command, and the City-wide Business Crime Reduction Partnership. The initial referral was made following complaints and loss reports from several independent retailers and chain pharmacy stores situated along King’s Road and the surrounding commercial districts. In the course of the investigation, extensive CCTV footage, taken from eleven different locations, was gathered and analysed. This process proved laborious and time-consuming due to the fragmented nature of the footage and the low-light conditions prevailing during many of the incidents. While the general expectation is that such visual evidence is easy to collate and review, in reality, this is often far from the case: footage is frequently corrupted, time-stamps unreliable, or angles insufficient for clear identification. Nevertheless, in this instance, a meticulous, day-by-day review was ordered, revealing a pattern of conduct that warranted formal charges. The case was initially listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 10 April 2025 before the Senior District Judge, at which you pleaded not guilty. Adjournments followed, notably owing to the late production of expert reports and complex applications for legal aid concerning the commissioning of a psychiatric assessment. Unfortunately, these delays reflect a disturbing trend within the Legal Aid Agency, where authorisations for timely funding are often prolonged, impeding the swift administration of justice. This is far from an isolated instance and continues to place stress on both defence practitioners and court timetabling. The court received and considered a psychiatric report by Dr James Albright, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, formally instructed to evaluate your mental health status, risk profile, and potential for rehabilitation. I owe thanks to Dr Albright for his detailed and professionally prepared assessment, which was shared in draft form on 21 August and finalised shortly thereafter. The report is summarised in relevant parts below. In addition, pre-sentence probation assessment has been initiated but remains incomplete at this stage due to the need for further clarifications concerning your housing and employment history. It is expected that it will be finalised in advance of sentencing, but it would be remiss of the court to delay these remarks unduly while seeking comprehensive input. Therefore, these sentencing remarks should be read as provisional. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 established the framework within which multi-agency collaboration in cases such as this operates. In particular, the role of the Business Crime Reduction Partnerships has been developed extensively in recent years, producing varied results. While some schemes have succeeded in reducing repeat offending among identified ‘prolific shoplifters,’ the efficacy is often compromised by resource constraints, fragmentation of responsibilities, and incomplete data sharing. Indeed, the Partnership responsible for the Chelsea district has endured significant staff turnover over the past 18 months, with a lag in both intelligence collation and enforcement liaison. Nonetheless, remarkably, in this case, timely reports and actionable risk assessments were produced, which reflects credit on the professionals involved. In cases of acquisitive crime, the courts routinely consider precedents set by appellate authorities. For example, in R v Huddleston [2019] EWCA Crim 2567, the Court reiterated that the sentencing approach must balance the financial impact, psychological harm to staff and retail owners, and the offender’s culpability. Although Huddleston concerned a single theft from a large department store, the principles of deterrence and proportionality in sentencing remain applicable. Furthermore, references to R v Spencer [2021] EWCA Crim 1091 illustrate how persistent shoplifting, when escalating in frequency and boldness, can warrant custodial sentences despite relatively low monetary values. Spencer’s offending extended across numerous boroughs and exploited vulnerabilities in store security systems, amplifying the seriousness beyond the face value of goods taken. It is likewise pertinent to observe the developments occasioned by the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences (February 2024 revision), which underline the importance of the offender’s intent, previous convictions, and the scale of disruption caused. The guidance stresses that repeated offending should attract increasing severity to achieve meaningful deterrence. These wider contexts provide the necessary backdrop against which the facts must be considered. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. Those familiar with the pressures attending modern policing are doubtless aware of the increasing claims upon police resources presented by so-called ‘low-level’ crime. Yet, they are neither low-impact nor low-consequence if left unchecked. The National Police Chiefs’ Council, in its 2023 report on retail crime, highlighted the operational strain posed by repeated thefts, not least due to the disproportionate amount of investigative time such cases require. Notably, these offences often occupy the same officers who are attempting to deal with violent crime and serious gang-related matters. The operational emphasis on a swift response to organised or violent crime is therefore undermined if persistent petty offences such as shoplifting absorb significant manpower and investigative expertise. At the same time, the victims — often small businesses with delicate profit margins — suffer tangible economic harm and psychological distress, which can have knock-on effects on local communities and employment. The case also coincides with the recent efforts of the Metropolitan Police Service to enhance digital forensic capabilities, aiming to better manage the backlog of electronic evidence from CCTV and smartphones. But this expansion has brought to light the difficulties of adjudicating on evidence requiring advanced technical interpretation, increasing both costs and case duration. This court is, moreover, conscious of the persistent challenges confronting healthcare services, notably mental health. Over recent years the National Health Service has published sobering audits about protracted waiting times and a chronic lack of access to community mental health teams. The Mental Health Act 1983, as amended, sets out thresholds and protocols for intervention but does not grant carte blanche to detain or treat without clear justification. It is relevant that the probation and psychiatric reports note your engagement with mental health services has been sporadic. In the wider societal domain, the court notes with concern the rising prevalence of street homelessness and associated vulnerabilities. Urban centres have seen a marked increase in individuals sleeping rough, as chronicled in recent government and independent sector analyses. This reality adds a complex overlay to many acquisitive offences: they occur in a milieu where despair, addiction, and economic hardship intersect, often manifesting in behaviours that, while unlawful, are also symptomatic of broader social failures. Notwithstanding this, the court cannot overlook that coercion, duress, or compulsion have not, on the material before me, been established as causative factors in your offending. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. It is important, however, to temper this understanding with the recognition that not all offending inspired by hardship is immune from sanction. The courts have consistently rejected the notion that economic deprivation excuses dishonest behaviour. Were it otherwise, the rule of law would swiftly erode. Attention is nevertheless drawn to submissions made on your behalf regarding mitigating factors, including certain personal circumstances and the possibility of underlying psychological drivers. Counsel for the defence has persuasively argued that these factors merit consideration not only in mitigation but in the design of an appropriate sentence that prioritises rehabilitation. The court is thankful to have before it a letter from your sister, Ms Bernadine Clarke, dated 7 August 2025, detailing your prior difficulties and family dynamics. This letter, while heartfelt, provides no substantive explanation for the offending itself but does highlight a degree of familial support. Also forthcoming are letters from two charities — the West Chelsea Food Bank and the Riverside Shelter Network — both of which have worked with you intermittently. Their staff have offered nuanced observations about the challenges you face, balanced against concerns about risk and compliance. The voluntary sector's role in cases such as yours remains invaluable. Charitable organisations operate in a space characterized by limited funding, volunteer reliance, and the unpredictable nature of human need. Their capacity to provide lifelines where statutory services cannot reach is frequently remarkable and deserves institutional commendation. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. I pause here to register my appreciation for those who serve in these capacities: the social workers, outreach coordinators, and volunteers whose commitment often goes unheralded. Their input aids the justice system’s grasp of complex social realities, informing sentencing decisions that might otherwise be impoverished. Similarly, the role of probation officers is significant and challenging. Since the establishment of the National Probation Service in 2014, and its subsequent restructuring in 2020, the landscape of offender management has shifted considerably. Resource constraints and high caseloads impose severe pressures upon probation practitioners, who nevertheless strive to balance enforcement with rehabilitation. I note the particularly helpful preliminary input from Ms Latifah Harrison, your allocated probation officer. Conversely, it must be acknowledged that the Probation Service faces ongoing critical challenges, including staff shortages and vacancies, which affect continuity and efficacy of supervision. From the outset, this court emphasises that sentencing principally considers your culpability, the gravity of the offending, and the need to uphold public confidence. To that end, I have considered the impact upon victims. Though the thefts did not involve assault or threats, several staff members have reported increased anxiety and feelings of vulnerability, one writing of being uncomfortable returning to work due to recurrent customer thefts. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. You will be aware that repeated targeting of pharmacy counters or display units not only imposes direct financial loss but also creates tangible fear among employees. Empirical studies in retail criminology indicate that such patterns produce a cumulative detrimental effect on workforce morale, turnover, and absenteeism. This dimension adds weight to the aggravating factors of your offending. The Crown has further provided victim impact statements from the management of three affected premises. These describe not just monetary loss but adjustments to staffing rotas, introduction of costly security equipment, and a palpable diminution of the welcoming atmosphere that forms the bedrock of community retail. Whilst no violence was reported in connection with your conduct, there is no suggestion that you presented with a benign or neutral demeanour. CCTV established instances of overt confidence or confrontational posture when challenged. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. Turning now to the legal framework applicable to your sentencing, section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the cornerstone statute. The act defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft (issued February 2024) lays down a coherent structure for evaluating harm, culpability, and relevant mitigation. It recognises that even low-value thefts can be serious where multiple offences, persistence, or targeting of vulnerable victims are involved. By way of precedent, I further consider the authority of R v. Cawthorne [2020] EWCA Crim 1883, where the Court cautioned against disproportionate leniency in serial shoplifting offences. The Court endorsed sentences designed to disrupt repeating patterns and deter recidivism, stressing the broader message conveyed to the community. It must also be noted that possession of a bladed article in a school car park, as examined in R v. O’Sullivan [2018] EWCA Crim 726, bears no direct bearing on this case but is referenced herein as an example of distinct typologies which require differentiated sentencing approaches. Similarly, R v. Donnelly [2017] EWCA Crim 2814, concerning criminal damage to a church noticeboard, while dissimilar in offence nature, reminds us of the principle that emotional and symbolic harm can justify custodial sentences even in the absence of physical injury. The current General Preventive and Deterrent Scheme within this jurisdiction suggests that the imposition of custodial terms should be reserved for cases demonstrating heightened culpability or clear risk of reoffending, especially where community-based sanctions are unsuitable. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. The psychiatric report by Dr Albright, while not evidencing serious mental illness, indeed points to traits of impulsivity and episodic substance use. These findings suggest a degree of vulnerability warranting consideration within a rehabilitative framework but do not excuse criminal behaviour. Reference is drawn to the Sentencing Council’s guidelines on mental health and substance misuse, which stress that whilst such factors should inform sentencing, they rarely constitute mitigating features sufficient to offset seriousness absent demonstrable causal impairment. Your age, currently 35, and prior convictions, which include several for theft-related offences, indicate a pattern of recidivism that compounds sentencing concerns. The previous community resolution issued in 2022 appears to have been ineffective in modifying behaviour. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. The court is aware that your current accommodation is within council-provided temporary housing and that your employment status remains precarious. Social and economic instability can both precipitate and perpetuate offending behaviour but, as noted, neither constitutes a legal excuse. The phenomenon of defendants invoking family breakdown, historic trauma, or socio-economic deprivation as principal explanations is a recurrent theme before this court. While personal history inevitably shapes context, adult responsibility remains paramount. A striking yet relevant observation is the enduring influence of legacy policy initiatives such as the Troubled Families programme, which intended to tackle intergenerational criminality through multi-agency intervention. Although its implementation was uneven and controversial, the programme left a trace on public and professional discourse, particularly regarding explanation of offending. The risk, however, is that such narratives may foster determinism rather than accountability if misapplied. The court records its thanks to counsel on both sides for careful and comprehensive representations. I also recognise the assistance of court staff and ushers in maintaining an orderly proceeding despite the disruptions occasioned by interpreter service delays earlier today. The physical accommodations of Court 5, recently refurbished with updated security features and aural enhancements, have facilitated an environment suitable for the thorough hearing of sensitive matters such as this. As a point of interest, the courtroom layout mirrors developments across many Crown Court centres aimed at improving witness visibility and ensuring a clear line of sight for judicial officers. These improvements, while seemingly peripheral, contribute materially to the quality of justice. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. The Crown submits that the cumulative effect of your offending, the repeated breaches of informal disposals, and the disruption to victims justify a custodial sentence of immediate imprisonment. The defence, on the other hand, urges the court to consider a community order incorporating intensive supervision, cognitive behavioural therapy, and substance misuse treatment. I remain mindful that sentencing must be proportionate, reflective of the offender’s circumstances, and informed by up-to-date reports on risk and rehabilitation potential. In concluding these remarks, I emphasise that sentencing will be postponed pending receipt of a full pre-sentence report, which I direct the supervising probation officer to prepare forthwith. The report should address risk of reoffending, suitability for community interventions, and accommodation stability. It should also consider the potential for engaging you with local services focusing on financial advice, mental health support, and vocational training. In preparing this report, the probation service is instructed to liaise effectively with the aforementioned charities and family contacts wherever practicable. Such engagement is vital to produce an accurate and holistic assessment. These sentencing remarks are delivered on 14 September 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Chelsea. Proceedings are transcribed and recorded per the requirements of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to all relevant authorities accordingly. You have been advised of your right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved pending sentence. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTFORD R v. MR H Case No. T2025/15429 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. E. THOMPSON Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you are before this court for sentence following your conviction on a charge relating to shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a period from early 2023 through to June 2025 and involves multiple retail establishments situated within the Hartford metropolitan area and the adjoining boroughs. The incidents collectively indicate a prolonged and deliberate course of criminal behaviour, targeting stores frequented by members of the community and employing methods designed to evade detection. Procedural Background You were first brought to the attention of law enforcement on 15 May 2025, during the course of an investigation initiated by the Hartford Retail Crime Alliance. This consortium encompasses representatives from local retail chains, municipal policing, and community safety officers, aimed at addressing the apparent surge in shop thefts within the city centre. The Alliance’s intelligence gathering was catalysed by a discernible pattern of similar thefts occurring across various outlets, with a consistent description of a male suspect matching your physical characteristics, including distinctive apparel noted by multiple eyewitnesses. The investigation subsequently expanded to incorporate surveillance footage analysis, witness interviews, and digital forensics. It is, unfortunately, common that such offending unfolds behind a veneer of ordinariness, with frequent recourse to techniques enabling the offender to blend innocuously among shoppers. The judicial system is frequently confronted with the challenge of assembling evidential packages from incomplete or fragmentary sources, notably when video recordings are of limited quality or when victimised businesses lack the resources to mount comprehensive investigative initiatives. Despite advances in technology and collaborative policing efforts, it remains the case that offences often require a concerted commitment of time and expertise to marshal sufficient proof to meet the criminal standard. This procedural reality speaks less to the seriousness of each individual incident, and more to the cumulative strain placed upon our criminal justice institutions when confronting persistent acquisitive offending. In the present case, one remarks that the Hartford Retail Crime Alliance’s coordinated efforts represent an instance of effective inter-agency cooperation, albeit one that required sustained vigilance and the pooling of information from multiple retail outlets. The initial charges were brought against you on 2 July 2025, subsequent to your arrest on 30 June, following an operation involving uniformed officers, plainclothes detectives, and technical specialists engaged in CCTV footage enhancement. The application of digital enhancement techniques, though now commonplace, remains a resource-intensive process, often necessitating specialist personnel whose availability is limited by competing demands in other priority areas such as violent crime and counter-terrorism. It warrants acknowledging that this case proceeded under the Better Case Management (BCM) procedures established pursuant to amendments to the Criminal Procedure Rules in 2020. This regime aims to expedite case progression, identify key issues at an early stage, and reduce unnecessary adjournments. It is a point of professional satisfaction to note that the relevant parties – police, prosecution, and defence – complied with pre-trial disclosure and scheduling expectations to a commendable degree. The plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 15 August 2025 before this court, at which you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequently, evidence was served including multiple staff statements, enhanced video materials, and seizure records of items recovered in your possession at arrest. The reluctance of some defendants to admit guilt early in the proceedings is a familiar, albeit regrettable, feature of modern criminal practice. While the law appropriately permits defendants to contest charges until proven, the consequences for victims, witnesses, and court resource are tangible and significant. The judiciary is mindful of the guidance established in authorities such as R v. Faraday [2022] EWCA Crim 2489, which emphasises the importance of timely pleas in ensuring the efficient conduct of trials and the sparing of victims from protracted distress. The court will apply that principle in the assessment of any mitigation for your eventual plea. There is also merit in briefly reflecting on the historiography of the Theft Act 1968 itself. Enacted at a time when retail trade and the consumer environment were undergoing profound transformation, the statute sought to balance the interests of proprietors with the rights of accused individuals in a manner consistent with evolving societal standards. Throughout its application, jurisprudence has grappled with delineating the boundaries between inadvertent misappropriation, necessity-based conduct, and intentional dishonesty. While such considerations are of academic interest, the present matter is plainly situated within the sphere of deliberate, recurrent offending. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. In considering the factual matrix, it must be stated that the offences spanned a variety of retail outlets, including both independent high-street businesses and larger chain stores. There is evidence that you exploited staffing patterns, including times when fewer employees were on duty, and utilised accessories such as bags or outerwear to conceal items. Surveillance footage depicts a blend of opportunism and calculated conduct. The temporal distribution of offences reveals multiple incidents in quick succession, indicating a sustained readiness to engage in illegal activity despite prior interventions. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. Turning to relevant case law, the Court is invariably guided by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences (2020), which provides structured criteria for assessing culpability and harm. Aggravating factors pertinent to the present case include the frequency and deliberate concealment of stolen goods, evidence of planning, and the deleterious impact on victim businesses, many of which operate on tight margins and rely heavily on local custom. It is appropriate to mention decisions such as R v. Conway [2019] EWCA Crim 1210, which addressed repeat shoplifting with an emphasis on the persistence of offending and the need for deterrence. There, the Court of Appeal underscored that the cumulative effect of repeated shop thefts may warrant custodial sentences, even when individual episodes involve low monetary value. Likewise, R v. Cartwright [2017] EWCA Crim 254 affirmed that the psychological effects on retail staff and the erosion of trust within communities are relevant sentencing considerations. It is also notable that in R v. Daltry [2021] EWCA Crim 497, the Court dealt with an offender exhibiting a similar pattern of behaviour, who repeatedly exploited self-service checkouts to conceal goods and avoid detection. The court emphasised that the sophistication of such modus operandi may elevate the seriousness of offending. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. This case was remanded for a psychiatric evaluation at your counsel’s behest. The assessment was conducted by Dr Sheila Markham, a consultant forensic psychiatrist with extensive experience in acquisitive crime and impulse control disorders. Her report, dated 5 September 2025, confirms the absence of major mental illness but identifies traits consistent with moderate impulsivity and features suggestive of mild anxiety and low mood. Dr Markham noted that you denied problematic substance misuse, though acknowledged some episodic alcohol use. Of particular note was your reluctance to engage consistently with community support services, which Dr Markham characterises as a barrier to effective rehabilitation. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. The impression conveyed by the psychiatric report is one of potential vulnerability, albeit insufficient in itself to diminish moral blameworthiness. The court also reviewed a pre-sentence report prepared by probation officer Helen Wilkins. Her report, dated 10 September 2025, references your prior convictions for theft and summary offences spanning the last decade, none involving violence or sexual offending. The report highlights difficulties including periods of unstable housing, intermittent employment, and a limited support network. Importantly, it records your failure to comply with previous diversionary programmes, including a community order with an unpaid work requirement imposed in 2021. A salient point within that document is the probation officer’s observation of local service pressures. The current shortage of probation officers, with caseloads exceeding recommended limits, complicates the delivery of tailored supervision and offender management. These systemic constraints present obstacles to rehabilitation planning but do not absolve offenders of responsibility for their actions. It must be said that funding and resources available for community-based interventions in acquisitive crime remain limited, despite growing demand. This is a chronic issue documented in multiple reports from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation and underscored by Parliamentary Select Committees. This court notes the commendable but stretched efforts of local voluntary sector organisations who aim to support offenders facing financial hardship, chaotic lifestyles, and addiction challenges. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. Among victim impact evidence considered was a statement from Ms Karen Doyle, proprietor of a small pharmacy, who detailed the economic and emotional toll wrought by repeated thefts. She lamented both direct loss of stock and the indirect effects of staff anxiety, increased security expenditure, and the tarnishing of community reputation. Similar sentiments were echoed in correspondence from the North Hartford Business Improvement District, which cited a rising prevalence of retail crime as a factor contributing to declining footfall and attendant risks for urban regeneration efforts. The court also had regard to a letter from the Hartford Citizens’ Advice Bureau, outlining the broader social context including employment challenges and welfare changes affecting individuals in your demographic. While such perspectives provide important context for policymakers and social planners, they can neither excuse nor justify unlawful conduct. It is a fundamental tenet of the criminal justice system that individual accountability remains paramount. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. This court further notes the enduring challenges faced by those residential landlords who provide accommodation to tenants with complex needs. In this context, a letter from your housing association notes prior noise complaints unrelated to your tenancy, reflecting broader issues in multi-occupancy properties. Though tangential to the offence before me, these factors underscore the difficulties encountered by front-line public services in maintaining environments conducive to stability and rehabilitation. The court acknowledges that your personal circumstances have been complicated by periods of homelessness and social isolation. These are recognized risk factors for engagement in acquisitive crime, as numerous criminological studies attest. Nevertheless, distinctions must be drawn between causal influences and excuse. Courts are vigilant to the risk of romanticising hardship. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. Turning now to the matter of sentencing. The Theft Act 1968’s sentencing framework establishes a range of custodial and community disposals proportionate to the offence’s harm and culpability. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines provide structure but leave room for judicial discretion informed by individual circumstances. It is not the function of this court to impose sentences motivated by retribution alone, but neither does the court seek to gloss over the seriousness and impact of repeated dishonesty. The appropriate balance must encompass punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public. R v. Westwood [2018] EWCA Crim 1552 stresses the utility of community sentences equipped with tailored interventions to address underlying causes and reduce recidivism in acquisitive offending. However, that approach depends on genuine engagement. Where offenders persist with offending despite previous warnings and community-based disposals, as your record shows, the prospect of custody is heightened. The court remains conscious of the well-documented mental health pressures endemic within the criminal justice population, as highlighted in NHS England’s 2024 report on service provision and unmet need. While the present psychiatric assessment does not indicate major pathology, the mildly elevated risk of impulse-driven offending is relevant to structuring rehabilitative interventions. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. I have had the benefit of submissions from Mr Julian Forbes, who appeared on your behalf, and Ms Rachel Morgan for the Crown. Mr Forbes urged consideration of a community order incorporating an accredited offending behaviour programme and structured drug and alcohol support should it be deemed appropriate following further assessment. Ms Morgan correctly emphasised the necessity of sanction commensurate with the persistent nature of the offending and the real, quantified harm endured by local businesses and staff. The court acknowledges the unacceptably frequent delays in funding authorisations for expert assessments in criminal cases. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted determination process has, regrettably, contributed to adjournments and increased anxiety for all participants. Recent Parliamentary debate has called attention to this systemic issue, urging reform to enhance efficiency and responsiveness. In matters of court management, I note that this case was delayed due to a short staffing period occasioned by the industrial action undertaken by regional court clerks earlier this year. Such challenges remain a constant undercurrent within our justice system, impacting timeframes and resource allocation across all tiers of courts. It is also relevant to underline that the premises affected are serviced by a combination of local CCTV schemes and private security patrols interconnected via a central command room operated by the Netherbridge Service Partnership. This layering of security is indicative of retailers’ increasing attempts to deter theft and antisocial behaviour. While technologically impressive, it has not eliminated offending, highlighting the limitations of surveillance absent effective social and enforcement policy. In light of the evidence and reports received, I shall direct the preparation of an up-to-date pre-sentence report. The probation service is instructed particularly to consider the viability of a community order incorporating elements of unpaid work, cognitive-behavioural therapy focusing on criminal thinking patterns, and comprehensive reintegration support addressing employment and housing stability. This court also encourages relevant agencies to explore appropriate mental health interventions aligned with Dr Markham’s observations, while recognising the limits imposed by insufficient capacity within NHS community provision and local counselling services. The sentencing hearing today has been conducted fully in open court. I commend the professionalism of all legal representatives involved, and of courtroom staff who have ensured smooth proceedings despite environmental limitations and intermittent equipment malfunctions. In conclusion, Mr H, you face a sentencing decision that must reflect the seriousness of your repeated conduct; the harm caused to victim businesses and their employees; your personal circumstances, including the mental health factors assessed; and the overarching interests of justice and public protection. The matter stands adjourned for the pre-sentence report to be prepared and lodged, with sentencing to follow on a date to be fixed shortly thereafter. You are reminded of your right of legal representation, appeal, and the importance of cooperating fully with all required assessments. These sentencing remarks are issued on this 17th day of September 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Hartford. Proceedings have been recorded and are transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities for recording and future reference. You are advised of your right to appeal against any sentence imposed within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. BRLSC-2025-14690 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J. MONTGOMERY Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H, you stand today for sentence following your admission to a charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically shoplifting. The incidents concern a series of offences occurring over an extended period, from October 2023 through March 2025, within the wider Bristol metropolitan area. The offending involves multiple retail premises and has prompted serious consideration of both your personal circumstances and the wider implications of your conduct. Procedural History This matter commenced with your arrest on 29 March 2025, following an operation conducted by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary Retail Crime Unit. That arrest was not a spontaneous event but rather the result of a protracted investigatory period spanning approximately four months. During that time, officers, with support from local council enforcement teams and the Bristol Business Crime Reduction Partnership, engaged in extensive data gathering, surveillance deployments, and witness interviews. Such collaborative policing strategies are emblematic of contemporary approaches to addressing acquisitive crime, albeit often challenged by resource constraints and fluctuating staff availability. It is a matter of public record that police forces across England and Wales face considerable pressure from rising crime figures alongside demands to prioritise investigations of greater immediate threat to life and property. The resources allocated to retail crime, while significant, must therefore be judiciously deployed, focused on offenders whose repeated conduct causes persistent harm both financially and psychologically to business proprietors and their employees. On a procedural note, it merits mention that the management of your case has predominantly aligned with the objectives set by the Better Case Management initiative as promulgated under the Criminal Procedure Rules. Notwithstanding a modest delay occasioned by the adjournment required to allow for completion of psychiatric assessment and associated reports, the listing of your plea and trial preparation hearings occurred within the prescribed time frames. I wish to acknowledge the efforts of all professional staff involved in case management, particularly members of the crown prosecution service team assigned to this file, whose coordination facilitated the expeditious compilation of evidence packages. Delays affecting some cases, understandably, arise from the ongoing workload pressures experienced in the courts. These pressures have been exacerbated by staffing shortfalls and, on occasion, industrial action across various public services during the past year. The knock-on effect on timely listings and adjournments is well documented, and this court notes with some concern the cumulative impact such interruptions have on defendants, victims, and the administration of justice. The Legal Aid Agency, whose role in facilitating access to expert reports is essential in cases such as this, has unfortunately been a source of delay. Your defence applied for funding to obtain a psychiatric evaluation from Dr Mariam Schäfer, consultant forensic psychologist, on 22 April 2025. That application did not receive formal authorisation until 10 June 2025, an avoidable lag that hindered pre-sentence considerations and lengthened an already protracted process. Such administrative bottlenecks represent a systemic challenge that ought to be addressed if the justice system is to serve all parties efficiently while safeguarding individual rights to representation and fair hearing. In addressing the facts of the case, it is necessary to first observe that your initial plea at the plea and trial preparation hearing, conducted on 3 July 2025, was not one of guilty. Upon receiving a comprehensive disclosure bundle that included unredacted CCTV footage, store manager statements, and forensic evidence correlating items seized at your arrest to the incidents under scrutiny, you entered a plea of guilty on 14 August 2025. The timing and circumstances surrounding this late admission of guilt engage the court's attention in relation to pena plea credit. Decisions in authority, notably R v. Norton [2022] EWCA Crim 1158, confirm that while the law encourages early pleas, the ultimate function of sentencing credit must serve justice and reflect genuine responsibility rather than mere tactical advantages. Part of the evidence relied upon in this case included witness testimony from Mrs Linda Prescott, a retail operations manager responsible for several convenience stores impacted by the offending. Mrs Prescott described the impact of repeated thefts on staff wellbeing as notable, including increased anxiety among shopfloor personnel and the imposition of stricter store procedures — some of which materially affected customer service levels. I acknowledge the forthrightness of these victim statements submitted through the Victim Support Service. It must be emphasised that offences presenting low in monetary value may nonetheless occasion significant psychological distress and economic cost beyond the immediate loss. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. Courts face the challenge of balancing empathy for individual mitigating circumstances with the equally important public interest in effective deterrence, accountability, and protection of communities. Recent jurisprudence underscores that acquisitive offending, when habitual and repetitive, conveys a risk to societal cohesion disproportionate to the individual offence value. It is worth recalling the decision in R v. Wilson [2023] EWCA Crim 756, which reaffirmed the Court's stance that terms of custody are justified where repeat offending is not arrested, especially where offenders demonstrate limited engagement with rehabilitation pathways. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. In the course of preparing for this hearing, this court has had the benefit of the pre-sentence report compiled by Probation Officer Miriam Langley, dated 30 August 2025. Ms Langley’s report provides a detailed examination of your personal history, social circumstances, and potential risks, including an analysis of previous convictions, family background, and engagement with community services. The report indicates your current accommodation as a privately rented flat in South Bristol, with no reported cohabitants. It further notes sporadic employment history with gaps associated with reported mental health crises. The report comments on your prior convictions, including three counts of shoplifting dating back to 2019–2021, culminating in a community order which was reportedly breached. While noting your stated motivation linked to financial hardship, the probation officer remarks that your efforts to seek assistance from social welfare services appear inconsistent at best. Your current attitude reflects ambivalence concerning previous intervention efforts, a factor contributing to an assessed medium risk of reoffending. Your prior sentence history is augmented by an arrest in 2020 for possession of a bladed article in a public car park adjacent to a secondary school. The circumstances in that matter resulted in a fine and conditional discharge but did not progress to conviction. This incident is referenced solely for completeness, as there is no suggestion of connection to the instant offending. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. An independent psychiatric report was prepared by Dr Mariam Schäfer following a clinical assessment on 12 July 2025. Dr Schäfer offered a carefully considered opinion, concluding there is no diagnosable major mental illness. She noted evidence of stress-related mood fluctuations and traits consistent with anxiety, but no pathology requiring hospitalisation or specialist forensic intervention. Importantly, she observed an absence of formal substance misuse assessments, an omission the court regrets but which reflects waiting list delays in NHS community mental health services in the area. Dr Schäfer recommended referral to local psychological support groups and stress management programmes as part of any rehabilitative plan. These healthcare service gaps reflect broader systemic pressures on the public mental health system, which the court duly notes without attributing responsibility to the defendant. The NHS has, across multiple domains, endured underfunding and protracted waiting times, impacting patient care and community outcomes. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. Apart from your personal history, the court acknowledges written submissions from the Bristol City Homelessness Outreach Charity, which has provided ancillary support to you and others in circumstances of housing precarity. Their letters attest to the considerable workload borne by voluntary and statutory agencies grappling with the overlapping crises of street homelessness, welfare system deficiencies, and escalating demand for low-threshold services. They candidly report that client engagement remains a persistent challenge in this sector, with many individuals oscillating between access and withdrawal from offered programmes. It would be remiss not to record appreciation for the professionalism and dedication of such agencies, whose role in reducing reoffending and promoting reintegration is critical, albeit hindered by constrained funding and capacity limits. Their material, while acknowledging the seriousness of your conduct, urges a measured response oriented towards rehabilitation rather than only punitive sanction. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. It also bears mentioning that your sibling, Ms T, is currently subject to unrelated proceedings in a magistrates' court in neighbouring South Gloucestershire, concerning allegations of benefit fraud. While bearing no connection to your case, this aspect has been referenced by defence counsel as part of a broader contextual submission regarding family dynamics. The court records this for completeness but does not regard it as mitigating or otherwise relevant to your culpability or risk assessment. Equally, the landlord of your accommodation was reportedly served a noise abatement notice in April 2025 for disturbances emanating from another tenant’s flat. This has no bearing on your behaviour or circumstances but is noted as an incidental matter arising during the course of pre-sentence enquiries. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. The Crown have made reference to a recent case, R v. Chandler [2024] EWCA Crim 891, where an offender was sentenced to immediate custody following a conviction for aggravated criminal damage involving the destruction of a listed church noticeboard. The incident involved the use of spray paint to affix political slogans and resulted in repair costs exceeding £5,000. The judgment emphasised the societal harm caused by attacks on community heritage assets and the necessity of custodial deterrence. While clearly distinct from your case in terms of subject matter and gravity, the authorities cited serve as a broader illustration of the courts’ approach to offences engendering public disquiet and the erosion of shared values. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. Your counsel has advanced mitigatory submissions concerning your previously reported experiences of childhood trauma and ongoing struggles with economic instability. These are taken seriously and have indeed been reflected in the pre-sentence report. It is apparent that multiple challenging factors shape your life narrative. However, as is well established, personal adversity, while informing appropriate levels of compassion in sentencing, does not absolve an individual from responsibility. R v. Hemsley [2021] EWCA Crim 1547 reiterates the principle that mitigating factors must be balanced against the protection of the public and the imperative to deter persistent offending. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. The court notes with concern that there is no evidence of engagement with drug or alcohol treatment programmes, despite recent local authority referrals to the Bristol Integrated Substance Misuse Service (BISM). This is a salient point given the known association between substance misuse and acquisitive crime. That omission may indicate a degree of denial or disengagement with potential sources of help. Moreover, prior breaches of community orders instigated for related offences underline a persistent failure to comply with court-mandated rehabilitation. This pattern is significant and substantially informs the court’s assessment of risk and the likely need for a custodial element in the sentence to follow. In addressing these matters, the court must also consider section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which requires sentences to be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the offender's culpability. It must balance punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. The sentencing guidelines published by the Sentencing Council for theft offences articulate key factors for consideration. These include the value of goods taken, frequency and duration of offending, the use of deception or planning, the impact on victims, and any prior criminal record. Importantly, aggravating features such as vulnerability of victims, targeting of community resources, and disruption to business activities must be weighed. In that regard, the cumulative impact of your offending on retail staff morale and business viability is not trivial. The necessity to alter working patterns, implement additional security measures, and the emotional toll upon those affected must weigh heavily in the court’s considerations. While raw financial loss may be moderate, the ripple effects penetrate more deeply. It is worth recording the court’s awareness of the mounting challenges faced by frontline retailers countrywide. The trend of repeated shoplifting has contributed to a decline in local business confidence and is a factor in some chains reducing their presence in urban centres. This is a matter of social import beyond purely legal dimensions. Finally, I thank counsel for their submissions delivered with due diligence. Ms L. Griffin, who appears representing the Crown, provided a clear and detailed outline of the prosecution case. Mr P. Knight, instructed on your behalf, offered comprehensive mitigation and sought to highlight the systemic issues influencing your offending. The court is grateful also to the ushering and administrative staff in Court 6 at Bristol Crown Court, who, despite the pressures imposed by ongoing reductions in staffing and the older court building’s maintenance requirements, maintain order and facilitate smooth proceedings. Today’s remarks are delivered in open court pursuant to protocol. A formal transcript shall be produced in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5, and a record maintained within the court file. In accordance with standard practice for cases involving contested sentencing issues, especially those with unresolved questions about suitability for community-based rehabilitation, I will defer final sentencing. This is to allow the probation service to complete a supplementary report, including an updated assessment of your compliance prospects and detailed recommendations for structured interventions. The report will particularly address possibilities for mental health support, substance misuse treatment, cognitive skills development, and structured community sentence options including unpaid work. The court has noted the observations from the charitable sector and the mitigating material submitted. While these carry weight, the overriding objective remains the promotion of public safety and effective offender rehabilitation balanced with appropriate recognition of culpability. Accordingly, sentencing is adjourned to the date fixed on 10 November 2025, by which all reports and representations shall have been received and considered. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT WESTMINSTER R v. MR H Case No. WMT/2025/13842 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J.B. Fenwick Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for theft from multiple retail premises, specifically shoplifting offences committed over a protracted period. The charges fall under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 and reflect a pattern of persistent acquisitive offending across several boroughs within the Greater London area. Procedural Background You were first arrested on 10 March 2025, subsequent to a cumulative investigation involving the Westminster Borough Police Retail Crime Unit, supported by local trading standards officers and the newly formed Westminster Business Theft Reduction Partnership. The investigation, as detailed in police witness statements and suspect interviews, arose from a series of incidents reported by various retail outlets noting a consistent modus operandi and cross-checking images from security cameras. Such procedural cooperation, while indicative of improved inter-agency liaison efforts in some respects, has, regrettably, not yet reached the level of full efficiency this court might hope for. Frictions between statutory bodies and designated retail partnerships persist as a theme in recent Crown Court cases, often extending case durations and complicating the evidential chain. It is regrettable to note that similar patterns of under-resourced and incremental responses to retail crime are commonplace. The proliferation of small-scale shoplifting is a vexed challenge to policing and retail management alike. Surveillance systems frequently provide only partial solutions; the graininess of footage, often combined with intermittent lighting or camera angles, tests the patience and skill of those attempting to assemble coherent narratives for prosecution. Detection is a laborious process involving hours of footage review, corroborated by employee interviews, often of staff working without the benefit of full training or authorised time off to assist investigations. This case, however, benefitted to some degree from the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol instituted nationally under Criminal Procedure Rule 3.13, designed to improve case preparation and reduce avoidable delays. The relevant case progression hearings observed statutory timelines, notwithstanding some minor adjournments caused by procedural applications and defence requests for expert assessments. The record before the court reflects your initial plea of not guilty entered at the plea and case management hearing held on 22 April 2025. Subsequent disclosure of further evidence, including forensic examination reports and additional CCTV footage, prompted your reconsideration. It was only on the morning of the scheduled trial on 14 August 2025 that a guilty plea was entered, following an adjournment to permit the defence to submit supplementary mitigation material. This late admission of guilt is noted and will be considered accordingly in the sentencing exercise. It is worth pausing to observe that late pleas of this nature are all too often the product of tactical calculation rather than genuine contrition. This phenomenon not only prolongs proceedings but strains the judicial and prosecutorial resources dedicated to the fair and speedy administration of justice. The decision in R v. Pearce [2022] EWCA Crim 87 emphasises that while credit for guilty pleas is a feature of judicial discretion, the timing of such pleas is of critical importance. Pleas entered at the earliest practicable moment are encouraged and attract more substantial discounts. Conversely, pleas advanced only after overwhelming evidence disclosure or trial readiness invite reduced credit. This court applies that principle here. In addition, it is necessary to consider the authority of R v. Stokes [2023] EWCA Crim 184, in which the Court of Appeal reaffirmed the importance of considering the broader consequences of delayed pleas, including the impact upon victims, witnesses, and the public’s perception of judicial efficiency. While the case before me does not involve violent or serious injury offences, the recurring financial and psychological impact on retail staff should not be underestimated. The often unseen toll — anxiety, reduced morale, and fear of confrontation — is well documented in victim impact statements supplied by affected premises. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. The importance of maintaining an understanding of the operational context for the offences is undeniable. Nationally, shoplifting remains a significant concern for retail businesses, frequently resulting in increased shrinkage, higher prices for consumers, and the closure of small independent outlets exposed to disproportionate economic vulnerability. The evolving jurisprudence surrounding theft offences includes, somewhat tangentially, cases such as R v. Hardwicke [2019] EWCA Crim 1097, where the Court considered the implications of sophisticated modus operandi involving accomplices and logistical planning over multiple jurisdictions. While these factors do not apply here, mention is warranted for completeness and to illustrate the wide spectrum of offending behaviours encountered in Crown Court. Furthermore, the court notes the decision of R v. Kensington [2020] EWCA Crim 2101 concerning aggravated theft in licensed premises; that example underscores a differing severity narrative not germane to this matter but reminding us all of the particularities which may aggravate certain theft cases. The court also acknowledges the accumulating strain on the Probation Service, which over recent years has faced substantial caseload increases while confronting national staffing deficiencies and resource limitations. Such pressures impinge upon the availability and timeliness of reports, as well as the capacity to deliver effective rehabilitation. Reflecting upon this landscape contextualises, though does not excuse, the sometimes sparse support reports submitted here. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. Further complicating modern criminal justice processes is the administrative burden posed by multi-agency collaboration. For example, Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), commonly engaged in cases involving violent or sexual offending, impose procedural demands including multiple risk assessments and inter-agency case conferences. Although MAPPA is not applicable in this matter, similar bureaucratic challenges are echoed in information-sharing frameworks designed for acquisitive crime prevention, such as the Business Crime Reduction Partnerships. In your case, the liaison between police, retail security, and community safety teams operated in a largely compliant manner but experienced the customary delays in information flow. An ancillary detail worthy of note, but not directly relating to your activities, concerns a co-defendant originally implicated during early investigations who remains at large following failure to appear for pre-trial hearings. His unrelated subsequent charges and current fugitive status serve only as a historical footnote and neither mitigate nor aggravate your offending. The court regrets any confusion that may arise from the multiplicity of cases intersecting at the investigative stage. Some readers might be interested to know that the court facilities themselves have recently undergone refurbishment, including installation of enhanced digital recording equipment and improved witness facilities. Though peripheral, these improvements reflect ongoing institutional investment in the justice system’s infrastructure. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. The court has reviewed extensive submissions from victims, including representations from the Guildford Street Retail Association and independent charities supporting victims of retail theft. These representations highlight the cumulative impact on frontline employees, many of whom are young, low-paid, and vulnerable to intimidation. One victim impact statement described emotional distress which led to symptoms consistent with work-related anxiety disorder — a fact that underscores the real human cost of offences too often dismissed as “minor.” The Retail Support Network, a voluntary organisation operating within the Westminster area, continues to provide advice and support to affected businesses, including access to loss prevention training and assistance with insurance claims. Turning to reports compiled by clinical experts, the court considers the psychiatric evaluation prepared by Dr Helen Simmonds, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, dated 1 September 2025. Dr Simmonds notes that while you do not suffer from any major psychiatric disorders, there is evidence of impulsive personality traits and mild depressive symptoms, exacerbated by prolonged unemployment and unstable housing circumstances. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. Though not determinative, these observations are relevant to the assessment of personal mitigation and to the identification of potential avenues for rehabilitation. Dr Simmonds recommends engagement with cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) focusing on impulse control and decision-making processes. In addition to the psychiatric report, the court received the pre-sentence report (PSR) prepared by Probation Officer Miss Clara Dunne. The PSR elaborates on your background, including your history of prior convictions — primarily for similar shoplifting offences — and your pattern of non-engagement with voluntary support services. It also draws attention to your intermittent employment history and your current absence from stable accommodation, living instead in temporary lodgings maintained through local authority housing assistance. This instability is a known risk factor for recidivism. While the PSR is thorough and professionally prepared, its recommendations are necessarily constrained by your limited cooperation. The report advises that community-based interventions, particularly those combining rehabilitative elements with structured supervision, may offer some benefit. Miss Dunne highlights the availability of specific accredited programmes aimed at addressing acquisitive offending but notes that engagement will be key. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. It is a matter of concern to the court, as to the Crown, that multiple earlier attempts at diversion and community resolution have failed to prevent a relapse into offending conduct. Indeed, it would be remiss not to recognise the challenging position retail staff find themselves in, caught on the frontline of repeated attempts to relieve commercial premises of goods without payment. Reference might be made in passing to the case of R v. Middleton [2021] EWCA Crim 587 regarding the significance of persistent reoffending in scheme design, though Middleton concerned shoplifting in multiple stores across the North West region and involved far higher-value items than those in the present case. That case serves as a broad reminder for sentencing authorities to account for the cumulative nature of offending over time, especially when dealing with repeat offenders. The court further notes the impact of current pressures on the National Health Service, particularly in mental health provision. Waiting times for psychological therapies can stretch to months or even years. While the justice system must be cognisant of these limitations, this reality cannot excuse refusal to engage with alternative support services, such as those offered by third-sector organisations. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. The role of victim liaison officers should be acknowledged. Officers assigned to similar cases undertake what can only be described as thankless work: supporting victims, coordinating witness statements, and facilitating restorative justice discussions where appropriate. Such officers continue to work under staffing shortages and competing demands from other crime types, including violent crime, serious fraud, and public disorder. Their efforts have contributed meaningfully to the victim impact statements presented in this matter. Moreover, it is relevant to mention, though not in any way to bear on the facts here, that a related environmental prosecution concluded last month in the nearby Greenford Magistrates’ Court. That case concerned the fly-tipping of construction debris in protected greenbelt land, an offence which, while unrelated, demonstrates the breadth of challenges faced by enforcement agencies balancing resources across competing priorities. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. A note on the administration of Legal Aid is prudent and, with regret, necessary. The system designed to ensure access to justice continues to face criticism for frequent delays and inconsistent application of funding approvals. In this case, the defence’s application for funding to instruct a forensic psychiatrist was significantly delayed, ultimately resolved only after intervention from the court. Such procedural inertia undermines defendants’ rights to fair representation, prolongs proceedings, and exacerbates the strain on already congested listing timetables. It is, however, proper to commend the resolute efforts of the defence counsel, Mr Marcus Feldman, who has conducted a professional and diligent representation. Mr Feldman’s submissions on your behalf were measured and articulate, highlighting, inter alia, personal hardship and the cumulative psychological effects of social disadvantage. Equally, Ms Rachel Dunham, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, presented clear and focused arguments reflecting the gravity of the offences. An observation on public perceptions of theft offenses is warranted. There remains, regrettably, a dangerous undervaluation in some quarters of crimes of this nature — perhaps encouraged by their frequency and apparent triviality. Yet the cumulative harm wrought by persistent shoplifting extends beyond individual proprietors to damage confidence in local commerce and community wellbeing. Societal attitudes towards such offences can be shaped by media narratives, online commentary, and increasingly, social media platforms where trivialisation can proliferate unchecked. While this is beyond the court’s remit, its impact on deterrence and rehabilitation is reflected in sentencing principles. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. Such facts as I have reiterated, alongside the expert and probation reports, indicate a sequence of offending presenting a real concern for both the immediate victims and the community broadly defined. Your history of previous convictions and your demonstrated unwillingness or inability to desist despite prior interventions weigh heavily. It is plain that the offences before the court — though by no means on the scale of significant breaches such as armed robbery or serious drug importation — have nonetheless exerted a material impact on the operations of the affected businesses. Market complementation schemes, community safety initiatives, and retail vigilance campaigns all rely on the goodwill and active participation of those involved. When that is undermined through persistent criminality, the ripples extend to employees, shareholders, and customers alike. This court acknowledges the increasing complexity of the criminal landscape, which now involves, inter alia, cybercrime rings targeting e-commerce platforms, gangs exploiting technological vulnerabilities, and international networks trafficking stolen goods. None of these is present here. However, the precise nature of your offences does not diminish their consequence; indeed, the threshold for public protection and deterrence applies at all levels. The starting point for sentencing remains the Theft Act 1968 and the relevant Sentencing Council guidelines issued for offences of dishonesty. The guideline sets out offences across a spectrum from lower to higher culpability and harm. Your offences fall within the lower to medium range for both. The sentencing objectives — punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, protection of the public, and the making of reparation — guide the court’s discretion overall. Given the persistent nature of your offending, the risk of reoffending carries weight. That risk, combined with limited mitigation save for late guilty plea and personal difficulties, informs a calibrated approach. The court is mindful of the custodial threshold as explained in R v. Clarke [2019] EWCA Crim 754, which reaffirmed the importance of considering whether community-based sentences can deliver sufficient punishment, reduce risk, and effect rehabilitation without the collateral consequences of imprisonment. However, repeated similar offences often edge the balance in favour of immediate custody to mark the gravity of behaviour and incentivise change. It is well established, per R v. Winn [2022] EWCA Crim 440, that credit for guilty plea is discretionary and subject to timing, sincerity, and the saving of court time. An early plea, entered before evidence is fully marshalled, merits more substantial discounting than a last-minute admission. I will accordingly commission a detailed pre-sentence report addressing these considerations comprehensively. The report will assess risk, vulnerabilities, attitude to offence, and advise on potential interventions in custody or the community. In conclusion, the court recognizes the multifaceted nature of shoplifting offences: seemingly minor in singular incidents, but cumulatively taxing on victims, services, and societal cohesion. Effective sentencing must balance acknowledgement of personal hardship with the necessity of public protection and deterrence. These sentencing remarks are handed down this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at Westminster Crown Court. Proceedings have been duly recorded in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal transcript will be filed accordingly. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged in this matter. Costs remain reserved pending final sentencing. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE KINGSTON CROWN COURT R v. MR H Case No. KT2025/14329 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Eleanor J. Fairclough Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence arising from a charge of theft by shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This matter has been presented against the backdrop of a series of incidents extending over the past eighteen months and involving multiple retail outlets in and around the Kingston-upon-Thames area. The facts as proven are reflective of persistent and deliberate acts of acquisitive offending, the gravity of which merits careful judicial attention. Procedural History and Case Progression To recount the procedural path to this hearing: you were initially arrested on 13 February 2025 following a coordinated investigative effort spearheaded by officers of the Greater London South Crime Unit working in concert with the Kingston Business Crime Reduction Partnership. This multi-agency initiative embraced the ideals of intelligence-led policing with a focus on chronic retail theft offenders. Although shoplifting is often deemed a low-level offence by the general public, the resources marshalled to identify and apprehend you were substantial, involving surveillance operations, CCTV collation, and witness interviews. It is important to underscore the cumulative impact of such offending on the operational capacity of policing teams who are, regrettably, overburdened by the manifold demands of general law enforcement, ranging from violent crime to cyber-enabled fraud. Initial police interview took place on 18 February 2025, at Kingston Police Station. During this interview, you exercised your right to silence. However, compounding evidence, including footwear impressions and store security footage, resulted in your charge on 22 March 2025. The case was allocated under the Better Case Management (BCM) system, with listing for a plea and trial preparation hearing scheduled on 7 July 2025. The BCM initiative, now firmly entrenched across the circuits, seeks to mitigate delays evident in pre-2010 practices by imposing structured timetables, requiring early disclosure, and fostering prosecutorial and defence cooperation. While the aspirational aims of BCM are universally recognised, in practice cases such as this one still encounter adjournments due to funding applications or expert report acquisition delays. It is worth remarking that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of funding applications in this case was notably protracted. Despite timely submission of requests by your legal team on 15 March and 28 May for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist specialising in addiction and impulsivity, formal authority was only granted on 12 August 2025. Such delays have become regrettably commonplace and impose a tangible toll on the fair administration of justice, increasing stress for defendants and burdening court fixtures. The court will be making inquiries as to whether systemic improvements can be introduced to prevent similar instances in the future. Representations have been made on your behalf by Mr Oliver K. Trent, instructed under Legal Aid. I record my thanks for his considered submissions and his patient efforts to engage with the numerous agencies involved. Ms Fiona Caldwell appears for the Crown and, as ever, I note her professional diligence in managing the prosecution file within the tight time constraints imposed by scheduling demands. Discussions at the plea and trial preparation hearing permitted the Crown to set the scene regarding the evidential position and the prospect of securing a conviction should the matter proceed contested. Your eventual guilty plea was entered on 3 September 2025, a date shortly before the trial window but notably later than the earliest possible opportunity, a factor that will bear upon any credit for plea discount. The court must remind itself that while a plea of guilty generally merits a reduction of sentence to reflect remorse and proceedings saved, where pleas are entered late—particularly after disclosure of comprehensive evidence and detailed witness statements—the discount must be prudently moderated. This principle was lucidly articulated in R v Diamond [2023] EWCA Crim 781, where the Court of Appeal confirmed that any credit for guilty plea should be tempered where the defendant’s admission arose from tactical considerations rather than genuine acceptance of responsibility. A further procedural note: this case was listed in Court 4, which underwent recent refurbishment to better accommodate vulnerable witnesses. Unfortunately, a scheduled hearing in May 2025 was vacated due to the unforeseen and regrettable absence of an essential court clerk, causing rescheduling to August. While such disruptions should be minimised, this reflects the real-world pressures under which court administration staff operate. The charge against you is governed by section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. In this jurisdiction, shoplifting, while often trite in appearance, is acknowledged as carrying significant consequences for victims — both individual and commercial — and broader community confidence. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (July 2021 edition) provides detailed frameworks informing the court’s decision. It requires that factors such as the value of the goods, the degree of planning, any aggravating elements such as repeat offending or targeting vulnerable victims, and the impact on those affected be fully considered. Moreover, the guideline emphasises that sentencing should be proportionate and, where appropriate, utilise community-based disposals armed with rehabilitative resources. Of particular note is the case of R v Whelan [2022] EWCA Crim 1258, where the Court considered the sentencing of repeat shoplifters targeting pharmacies, highlighting the combined effect on victim vulnerability and public trust. Whelan emphasised that even relatively low monetary values could necessitate custodial measures if offending was persistent and wilful. In R v Greenwood [2019] EWCA Crim 492, the court clarified that the presence or absence of violence is not determinative but the psychological impact upon victims and the community must not be underestimated. Equally, in R v Thomas [2020] EWCA Crim 982, when personal mitigation was found limited, an immediate custodial sentence was upheld for an offender who demonstrated no genuine remorse and breached previous statutory orders. Furthermore, the environmental context in which offences occur is relevant to culpability. In R v Canfield [2021] EWCA Crim 2077, the court observed that offences in areas of high social deprivation or near protective social service facilities may aggravate harm and attract sterner penalties where targeting appeared deliberate. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. Amongst important contextual matters, the court is mindful that your offending took place not only in large retail supermarkets but also in smaller independent local shops. Independent shops often lack the robust security apparatuses of larger chains and rely greatly on goodwill and community trust. The burdens imposed by repeat theft on such enterprises extend beyond accounting losses and may jeopardize business viability, employment, and local economic health. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. A further consideration is the operational pressures faced by the various public services in this jurisdiction. The Kingston Safer Neighbourhood Team has reported significant resource strain due to simultaneous demands from violent crime, road traffic collisions and recent public disorder events arising from protracted industrial dispute protests affecting local transport corridors. Such resource diversification inevitably impacts their prioritisation of “non-serious” offences, yet shoplifting investigations continue as a vital preventive measure. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. The Crown has made cogent submissions on the cumulative effect of your conduct. Repeated entries into the same premises, seemingly timed to coincide with periods of reduced staffing or shift changes, indicate a deliberate and planned modus operandi. The court has also received written statements from several shop staff expressing increased anxiety and distress. Many have altered their working patterns or taken steps to avoid lone shifts as a result of your activities. While there is no allegation of physical aggression, the psychological impact on these individuals is not insignificant. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. Several volunteer organisations have contributed representations in this matter, including the Kingston Rescue Outreach and Community Support Team (KROCS), which offered assistance to individuals facing homelessness and poverty in the area. KROCS staff have provided evidence of the systemic difficulties endemic to the locality, highlighting long waiting lists for social housing, the rising cost of living, and significant mental health service backlogs impacting potential vulnerable offenders. These observations resonate with wider national concerns regarding the fracturing of community networks and the attendant rise in street-level acquisitive crime. Nevertheless, as noted in R v Oakes [2023] EWCA Crim 525, context and circumstance do not diminish individual accountability. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. Your pre-sentence report, prepared by probation officer Sarah Mann, dated 10 September 2025, is a detailed and professional appraisal of your background, character, and risk profile. The report notes your history of unstable accommodation, sporadic employment, and a pattern of substance misuse dating back several years. It records your partial engagement in a previous community order for theft-related offences and outlines a moderate risk of reoffending. The report further recommends consideration of referral to a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) programme addressing acquisitive offending and impulsivity, alongside continued addiction support through local NHS provision. Ms Mann remarks upon your inconsistent compliance with earlier interventions and urges caution in relying on positive prognosis alone. It is noted that you have declined to participate fully in substance misuse counselling to date. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. In addition, the court acknowledges the expert evidence obtained from Dr Rhian Morris, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, appointed pursuant to the defence application authorised on 12 August 2025. Dr Morris’s report, dated 1 September 2025, offers the view that while you do not meet criteria for major mental illness, there are identifiable traits consistent with borderline personality disorder, marked impulsivity, and intermittent episodes of low mood. It is further stated that your history of alcohol misuse has contributed to episodic disinhibition, which may have exacerbated offending behaviour. Dr Morris stresses the importance of multi-disciplinary management and expresses guarded optimism about potential benefits from engagement in specialist personality disorder services. The report cautions, however, against over-optimism given your history of poor attendance at appointments. Treatment adherence remains the decisive factor in both risk reduction and rehabilitation. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. It is instructive to place the present matter within the wider jurisprudential landscape. Acquisitive offending, while traditionally classified as low-level crime, has become increasingly scrutinised for its broader societal costs. Recent scholarly analyses published in the Journal of Criminal Justice Studies have circulated observations on the shifting dynamics of retail crime, noting technological evolutions in surveillance and self-service checkout, alongside adaptive tactics employed by offenders, including strategic concealment techniques and deliberate exploitation of staffing vulnerabilities. Court records also reveal that co-defendants in related regional cases have displayed a disparate range of offending behaviours, including possession of offensive weapons and public order offences during retail theft incidents. Such facts, while peripheral to your conduct, illustrate the complexity of the operational environment in which enforcement occurs. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. Notwithstanding these observations, the court must resist the temptation to conflate distinct individuals’ conduct or to allow collateral fact patterns to cloud precise sentencing considerations. Your offending must be addressed on its individual merits and circumstances. The Crown has urged the court to impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness of a continuing course of conduct, the cumulative detriment to victims, and the need for deterrence. The defence mitigation foregrounds your personal difficulties, partial compliance with previous orders, and expressed willingness to engage with rehabilitative programmes. In accordance with the Sentencing Council guidelines, mitigation is limited. The late plea reduces but does not extinguish plea credit. Personal circumstances, while troubling, do not amount to a sufficient cause for leniency in light of the persistence and planning evident in your offending. The court treats seriously the impact upon victims, the strain on public services, and the clear risk of recurrence absent robust intervention. The probation report and psychiatric assessment both signal the necessity of structured, community-based rehabilitative input. Custodial sentences should not be imposed lightly but remain a valid and sometimes necessary component of the sentencing spectrum in cases where public protection and deterrence demand it. I am accordingly deferring final sentencing to allow for receipt of an updated pre-sentence report which can consider any progress with service engagement, address the feasibility of bespoke programme referrals, and inform proportional sentencing options. This report should also consider risk of harm to the public and any ancillary matters warranting ancillary court orders. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 6 of Kingston Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. A formal transcript has been prepared and will be provided to all parties. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal conviction and sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs remain reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON R v. MR H Case No. B2025/13459 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge W. F. KENDALL Filed: 14 November 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following a conviction related to theft from retail premises, a matter prosecuted under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending was committed over a period extending from late 2023 through to early 2025, predominantly in the city centre of Brighton and surrounding suburban shopping areas. This court is aware that repeat offending of this nature places considerable strain not only on the victim businesses but on entire community networks of safety, commerce, and neighbourhood cohesion. Procedural History You were first brought to the attention of police authorities in late November 2024 after a string of reports from multiple retailers within a concentrated retail corridor. This led to a joint operation spearheaded by the Sussex Business Crime Unit in concert with the Brighton Safer Neighbourhood Team and representatives of the Business Improvement District (BID). Over several weeks, the investigation employed a multi-modal approach incorporating analysis of security footage, spot checks by city council enforcement officers, and liaison with the Brighton Retail Crime Prevention Partnership. It is important to note that the use of closed-circuit television (CCTV) as a primary investigative tool is subject to real-world limitations: coverage is often partial, quality inconsistent, and, as is frequently the case, the sheer volume of footage reviewed necessitates considerable officer time that could otherwise be allocated to crimes of higher severity. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. The investigation was compounded by challenges common to acquisitive crime cases: witnesses with fragmentary recollection, inconsistencies in reported stolen items, and turnover of store personnel. It was not until December 2024 that you were identified as a suspect, following both direct observation and corroborative evidence from retail loss prevention teams. You were arrested on 16 December 2024 and you subsequently elected to provide a written statement—initially denying involvement. This denial was tested and undermined by forensic examination of clothing items retrieved from your residence during a warrant executed on 17 December, which matched fibres and residues observed in multiple shoplifting incidents. The matter was initially listed at Brighton Magistrates’ Court but transferred to the Crown Court for trial due to the volume and complexity of evidence. A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 20 February 2025, at which you entered a not guilty plea. On 4 September 2025, on the first morning of your trial in Court 4, you changed your plea to guilty against the advice of counsel. This late plea is pertinent to sentencing considerations. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. Delays were occasioned by a number of procedural matters. Defence counsel initially made an application for funding through the Legal Aid Agency to instruct a forensic psychologist with specialist knowledge of repeat acquisitive crime. The Agency’s protracted response cycle, involving requests for further information and bureaucratic challenge, caused a postponement of court proceedings by approximately six weeks. Such delays are regrettable and not unique; they underscore the administrative burdens now confronting Legal Aid and its impact on timely justice. The court hopes that forthcoming reforms will mitigate these procedural inefficiencies. Turning to the legal framework, the Theft Act 1968’s section 1 defines theft succinctly as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive the owner. This seemingly simple definition belies the complexities courts face when assessing repeated offences within a given period, particularly those constituting a course of conduct. Sentencing must balance the discrete nature of individual acts against their cumulative effect. The Sentencing Council guideline for theft offences, promulgated in 2022, provides a detailed framework for assessing harm, culpability, and mitigating factors. Items are categorised primarily by value and vulnerability of victims; the deliberate selection of small independent retailers—as with your case—is considered an aggravating factor by virtue of the disproportionate impact of losses and fear caused. Additionally, the guidance emphasises that persistent offending escalates the seriousness beyond the nominal value of stolen goods. The court has also reviewed relevant guidance contained within the foreword to the Sentencing Council document, where it is acknowledged that sentencing “must be proportionate to harm caused and the offender’s culpability, recognising the cumulative impact of repeated offending”. The careful calibration required is echoed in case law. In R v. Lambert [2023] EWCA Crim 1052, the Court of Appeal confronted a series of shoplifting offences involving multiple community pharmacies and independent grocers. The defendant was found to have methodically planned occasions to enter premises during predictable lulls, employing concealment tactics and evasion. The Court found that disruptive acquisitive offences could have a “chilling effect” on local trade and warranted a custodial sentence of 14 months, particularly where there was an absence of genuine remorse or engagement with rehabilitative services. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. Further precedent was considered in R v. Cole [2020] EWCA Crim 870, involving a defendant who had participated in importing substantial quantities of counterfeit branded goods through parcel freight. Though the offence was unrelated to shoplifting, the court in Cole advanced the principle that a defendant’s culpability and moral blameworthiness must be assessed holistically, including their contribution to organised crime and exploitation. Such reflections are tangential to the instant matter but nonetheless informative in framing judicial response to layered patterns of dishonesty. The court is mindful of the broader sociological and systemic context in which offences like these occur. We are living in a time marked by increasing economic precarity and social dislocation. Rises in street homelessness, often entwined with untreated mental health issues, substance dependency, and fractured support networks, present significant challenges to public institutions. However, this court must also observe the strain placed on retail sectors by persistent theft. Small businesses operate under perpetual financial pressure, often absorbing shrinkage without recourse to insurance or compensation. There is a human cost: anxious staff who may face verbal abuse or feel unsafe, scheduling alterations to avoid lone working, and a sense of erosion of the communal trust fundamental to healthy commerce. It is imperative that sentencing reflects not only abstract legal principles but tangible community impact. The Sussex Police Retail Crime Unit reports that retail crime accounts for a significant proportion of daily calls. The administrative burden this imposes on limited resources diverts attention from violent crime and serious organised offences. Local policing is, regrettably, caught in a difficult balance — addressing low-level offending with disproportionate resource allocation is unsustainable. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. It is to be noted that your case demonstrates elements that activate the Business Crime Reduction Partnership protocols. This partnership, which incorporates police, council licensing services, retail security teams, and community safety officers, seeks to intervene early and reduce the repeat victimisation of retail premises. As is often the case, the efficacy of this multi-agency approach relies heavily on timely intelligence sharing, sustained funding, and frontline officer availability, factors which vary considerably by district. Brighton’s scheme, while ambitious, has faced challenges including recent cutbacks to its budget and staff turnover. That said, the involvement of the Retail Crime Prevention Board here has resulted in some coordinated interventions, including bespoke training for staff at affected stores on recognising distraction techniques commonly employed by persistent shoplifters. In your case, the psychiatric assessment conducted by Dr Amanda Spencer, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided a detailed clinical picture. Dr Spencer’s report, dated 22 October 2025, draws attention to a background of emotional instability and early adverse experiences, but finds no diagnosable psychosis or severe personality disorder. Instead, the report emphasises traits of impulsivity, intermittent depressive symptoms, and mild substance misuse—principally alcohol. Dr Spencer notes that your engagement with recommended community mental health services has been sporadic, characterised by missed appointments and limited insight into the consequences of your behaviour. The report underscores that while psychiatric illness is not a main driver of your offending, there exists a risk profile involving social isolation and financial instability. Submissions from probation echo these findings. Your allocated probation officer, Ms Kim Abbott, highlighted that you have been non-compliant with previous community orders imposed in 2022, were noted to have failed to sustain regular employment since 2021, and currently reside in unstable housing, provided through a temporary placement scheme. Such instability compounds the risk of recidivism, particularly when combined with limited social supports. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. You have made reference in correspondence to your estranged relationship with your family, though attempts to verify engagement have been inconclusive. Your previous dependence on informal networks of support was reportedly bounded by episodes of conflict and disconnection. This court recognises the complex personal dynamics at play but weighs them cautiously when considering personal responsibility. I must again commend the patience and professionalism of the probation service in this case, which continues to manage extensive caseloads and systemic staffing shortages. The recent recruitment drive aimed at bolstering intermediate-level officers is hoped to improve supervision levels, but the backlog remains substantial. Victim statements presented through the Brighton Retail Crime Partnership articulate the extent to which your offending has eroded staff confidence and operational viability. Retail managers detailed alterations to store opening hours and security measures implemented explicitly in response to theft fears. One statement, from Mr Leonard Simeon, manager of a community grocer on Western Road, indicated that staff turnover had increased following your visits, citing emotional exhaustion among employees. Such human consequences, although intangible, underscore the broader harm resultant from acquisitive crime. The Retail Support Network—a voluntary group providing advisory and restorative services to victims—submitted a letter recognising the ongoing challenges of engaging with perpetrators at this level of criminality. They emphasised that the trauma experienced by retail employees from persistent theft is often underestimated and rarely visible to the public. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. I acknowledge the courteous conduct of counsel during these proceedings. Mrs Caroline Forster, representing the Crown, delivered submissions reflecting a balanced appreciation for the mitigating evidence alongside the need for deterrence. Mr James Warren, appearing under a representation order, advanced a cogent mitigating case drawing upon your difficult circumstances, late entry of plea, and absence of violence. This courtroom itself was refurbished earlier this year following grant funding. The improved lighting and acoustics have enhanced the environment, though it remains staffed by the same diligent usher team who have maintained calm order throughout a crowded and busy session today. It is worth noting that this case was listed at several points in the last six months and was twice postponed due to Covid-19-related staffing shortages, reflecting the burden placed on criminal justice resources since the pandemic and ongoing public sector workforce constraints. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Having reviewed all materials and submissions, I return to the salient principles. Your offending constitutes a sustained course of dishonesty, with clear evidence of planning and repeat engagement in theft at multiple premises. Such persistence demonstrates significant culpability. The harm occasioned extends beyond mere financial loss. The psychological impact on employees, the disruption to business operations, and the drain on public resources must be recognised. Your history of previous convictions for similar conduct is a material aggravating factor, as is your failure to desist despite warnings and prior community measures. The mitigation acknowledged includes your current personal difficulties, your late plea of guilty, and some degree of cooperation with supervision since arrest. Nevertheless, the multiplicity of offences and the breadth of impact temper the extent of credit granted. This court is conscious of evolving sentencing frameworks emphasising rehabilitation and desistance. A pre-sentence report will be critical in assessing appropriate community-based interventions, including cognitive behavioural programmes and structured employment support. It should also explore financial management assistance and engagement with substance misuse services. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. It is incumbent upon the probation service to explore whether a community order inclusive of rehabilitation activity, unpaid work, and a drug and alcohol treatment requirement could be feasibly complied with in your circumstances. The risk to public confidence and safety inherent in repeated acquisitive offending requires a proportionate and carefully tailored response. Custodial sentences, while sometimes necessary, should be a last resort when community sanctions are unlikely to succeed. The court acknowledges the challenge of balancing punitive and rehabilitative aims in cases underpinned by complex social and psychological factors. Notwithstanding, public protection, accountability, and deterrence remain fundamental. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 November 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The record of conviction will be forwarded forthwith to relevant authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. No costs are presently ordered. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER R v. Mr H Case No. M2025/14578 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. E. Carrington Filed: 3 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence regarding offences of theft from retail premises, insofar as they arose over an extended period within the Greater Manchester area. The charges before the court represent a culmination of your conduct classified under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, involving acts committed from approximately mid-2023 through into early 2025. They predominantly relate to persistent shoplifting incidents at various retail establishments clustered around both urban and peri-urban localities. The procedural history in this matter is itself emblematic of the complexities faced by modern criminal justice processes in the domain of acquisitive crime. You were apprehended on 19 February 2025 following a protracted investigation led by the Manchester City Retail Crime Partnership, in conjunction with the Greater Manchester Police’s Economic Crime Unit and supported by private sector security providers. This inquiry was precipitated by an uptick in reported instances of stock shrinkage across a selection of medium-sized department stores and convenience outlets, which had established internal protocols to flag repeat incidents matching a specific suspect profile. The intersection of private-sector asset protection and public law enforcement in such cases brings to the fore a number of operational considerations, notably the fragmentation of ownership structures across retail chains and variations in security infrastructure. While some locations benefit from sophisticated electronic tagging systems and extensive CCTV coverage, others rely largely on manual observation and point-of-sale audits, complicating evidence gathering and case continuity. Furthermore, the resource constraints faced by investigatory teams tasked with assembling prosecution cases in these low-value but high-volume offences cannot be overstated. I must take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation for the staff of the Manchester Retail Crime Partnership. Their meticulous collation of internal loss prevention records, combined with collaboration with frontline policing officers, facilitated the assembly of the evidential base in a manner that prevented otherwise foreseeable delays. It is a testament to the commitment of all parties involved that this matter has progressed to trial without the chronic procedural stasis seen elsewhere. It is nevertheless a salutary reminder of the administrative burden imposed by even low-level offending on an overstretched criminal justice system. You were interviewed under caution at the Manchester Custody Centre on 20 February 2025. Initially, your responses were equivocal, with a number of denials and vague references to mental health difficulties. Nonetheless, the police investigation was buttressed by CCTV imagery captured across multiple premises and corroborated by witness statements. Your defence team utilised the Better Case Management (BCM) framework to elicit disclosure of prosecution materials and to ensure adherence to case preparation timetables. The BCM protocol, which has been in place since 2014, was designed to enhance the efficiency of pre-trial processes, emphasising early guilty pleas and thorough case management hearings. While generally effective in streamlining proceedings, its demands often expose weaknesses in agency cooperation and evidential readiness, yet this case represents something closer to the ideal. Petitioners and defendants alike face a multitude of challenges navigating the contemporary court system. Among these are the ongoing pressures exerted by funding constraints in the Legal Aid regime. Indeed, I am compelled to express a degree of frustration with the inconsistent and protracted approval process surrounding applications for expert psychiatric assistance submitted on your behalf. The delay in instructing the consultant forensic psychiatrist — Dr Gabrielle Whitman — required repeated interlocutions over a six-week period before clearance was obtained. Such bureaucratic impediments impede not only efficient case resolution but also risk undermining the principle of fair trial. The court is in earnest hopes that the Legal Aid Agency will review its administrative procedures to prevent repetition. Moreover, it is notable that your plea of guilty was entered belatedly on the morning of the scheduled trial. This, regrettably, is a regrettably frequent occurrence in matters involving acquisitive offending. While the law affords defendants the option to contest charges up to the point of conviction, late pleas diminish the opportunity for the court to confer the full benefit of mitigation. The case law is plain on this issue. In R v. Beckett [2019] EWCA Crim 1333, the Court of Appeal emphasised that credit for plea must correspond to not only the fact of a plea, but also its timing relative to the progression and strength of the prosecution evidence. Similar principles were reaffirmed in R v. Pritchard [2022] EWCA Crim 579, where limited guilty plea credit was upheld due to plea timing. I pause here to address the broader societal context in which offending of this nature should be situated. The incremental escalation of low-level acquisitive crime, particularly in underserved communities, places substantive pressure on retail businesses and by extension the wider local economy. There remains a notable pattern of store closures attributed, in no small part, to persistent shrinkage. The economic repercussions extend beyond immediate financial loss, affecting staff job security and consumer confidence. The court is also mindful of the psychological impact experienced by frontline retail employees, a group disproportionately exposed to the stress of repeated theft incidents and resultant operational changes. In an era marked by significant social disruption, and concomitant strains on public services, one observes a marked increase in street homelessness and drug dependence within the localities overlapping retail centres. These factors contribute to a complex mosaic of vulnerability and opportunity, both influencing and compounding patterns of acquisitive crime. Critically, courts must resist the temptation to conflate causation with justification; while social context informs sentencing discretion, it does not excuse breach of law. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. The facts of this case situate themselves firmly within this established framework: a series of calculated, recurrent thefts involving deliberate concealment of goods, timed to coincide with staff absences or momentary distractions. Your conduct evidences a modus operandi honed over months, employing misdirection and concealment devices designed to subvert detection. Such behaviour requires a measured response. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. The well-established principles set forth by the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft are instructive. The importance of assessing culpability and harm requires close examination of patterns of behaviour, propensity for reoffending, and underlying motivation. While financial loss in individual instances may be modest, cumulative harm to retail businesses, staff wellbeing, and community order is material. I note too the guidance in R v. Fairbanks [2021] EWCA Crim 744, where the Court stressed the detrimental public impact of recidivist shoplifting within deprived zones. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. The court has had the benefit of a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Whitman, who conducted a thorough assessment over several consultations in custody and at the appointed clinic. The report is both detailed and professionally composed. It reasonably concludes that you suffer no serious mental disorder but identifies traits consistent with adjustment disorder and chronic anxiety symptoms. Importantly, it notes a background of unstable housing, bouts of intermittent substance misuse, and a history of traumatic childhood experiences, though it carefully delineates these from direct causal links to offending. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. The report offers a degree of optimism regarding your amenability to targeted psychological interventions, recommending consideration of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to address impulsivity and decision-making deficits. Parallel to this, the probation service has submitted a pre-sentence report highlighting challenges concerning your accommodation status, employment history, and limited engagement with rehabilitative programmes. These agencies note the chronic under-resourcing of mental health and social care services, which serves as a constraining factor on effective support provision. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. Notably, your previous contact with probation services has been sporadic and marked by non-attendance, a pattern unfortunately replicated in many cases of persistent acquisitive offending. The probation report additionally raises concerns about a tendency to understate the seriousness of your conduct, which may impede compliance with future court-imposed conditions. This aligns with known obstacles faced in enforcing community sentences, particularly in relation to offenders with unstable personal circumstances. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. In considering the wider criminal record, you have previous convictions principally comprising offences of shoplifting and minor public order incidents. There is no suggestion of violent conduct or organised criminal association. Previous court interventions have included conditional discharges and community orders, yet these have yielded limited behavioral change. The present offending thus represents a clear breach of prior assurances and court recommendations. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. This court is conscious that the circumstances of your upbringing and current vulnerability are part of the background that may speak to mitigation. However, justice must maintain its central focus: protection of the public, deterrence, and rehabilitation. The law does not operate in a vacuum seperate from social realities but calibrates its responses to reoffending risks and the imperative of public safety. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. I note with interest the submissions made by counsel on behalf of the Crown and defence. Ms Helen Bowers, prosecuting, succinctly but firmly outlined the collective impact on the victims—small business owners and staff—whose statements reveal not merely loss but also a corrosive effect on the sense of security and community cohesion. Mr Owen Childress, representing you, advanced a plea for leniency grounded in your personal circumstances and a purported readiness to engage fully with rehabilitative measures post-sentencing. Before addressing sentencing options, I reflect upon the evolving case law in this domain. The decision in R v. Mayfield [2023] EWCA Crim 888 underscored the appellate courts' continued emphasis on tailored rehabilitation, especially in cases where psychiatric or psychological factors are implicated. It provides useful guidance on balancing custodial sentences and community orders with sufficiently robust supervision and therapeutic support. However, the same authorities affirm that persistent or escalated offending necessitates a firm punitive response. In R v. Cornwall [2020] EWCA Crim 577, the Court reaffirmed that repeated acquisitive offences warrant sentences that commensurately reflect the cumulative impact and the need for deterrence, notwithstanding the absence of physical violence. While community sentences remain a vital tool, the threshold for immediate custody may be met where prior interventions have failed and the risks of ongoing harm are judged to be significant. It has been brought to the court’s attention that the legal framework surrounding sentencing has undergone subtle but important adjustments, including the introduction of structured sentencing options enhanced by rehabilitative conditions such as the Rehabilitation Activity Requirement and Mental Health Treatment Requirements. These innovations seek to address root causes without defaulting to incarceration, where appropriate. The Crown and defence are in agreement that a pre-sentence report is indispensable to inform a proportionate approach. Such reports serve a crucial function in appraising risk, identifying suitable interventions, and providing the sentencing judge with a comprehensive corpus of information through which to balance competing interests. The wider statutory and policy context cannot be ignored. The strain placed on probation staff by expanding caseloads, reduced budgets, and complex offender profiles represents a salient challenge. Similarly, mental health services remain under significant pressure, with waiting times and thresholds creating barriers to timely treatment. These systemic issues do not excuse individual offending but frame the environment within which sentencing decisions must be situated. Added to this is the reality of the enduring backlog in the Crown Court system, exacerbated by recent disruptions including industrial action and pandemic-related effects. Delays in the administration of justice inevitably impact defendants, victims, and the public alike, underscoring the value in expeditious resolution of cases where possible. The case has also been marked by a series of adjournments, notably due to the late provision of expert reports and the need to allow the Legal Aid Agency to authorise private instructions for psychiatric examinations. Such procedural episodes illustrate perennial challenges in balancing defendant rights with the public interest in effective case management. Turning briefly to ancillary matters, I note that reference has been made to prior unrelated family court proceedings involving a sibling of the defendant which, while unfortunate, bear no relevance to the case at hand. Similarly, the landlord of the property where you currently reside has been the subject of a noise abatement notice unrelated to these proceedings. These facts serve as contextual background but do not bear upon the assessment of culpability or risk. I also observe, without comment on evidentiary weight, that a co-defendant linked to unrelated charges of affray and possession of a bladed article remains at large, an issue peripheral to this matter but illustrative of the complexities in multi-agency policing efforts in the locality. The public interest demands that the sentencing outcome not only reflects the seriousness of the offending but also serves to maintain confidence that repeat acquisitive crime will not be tolerated or minimized. This court must exercise its discretion in accordance with established principles, ensuring that decisions are fair, proportionate, and informed by the full factual matrix. At this juncture, I adjourn sentencing to allow the probation service to compile a comprehensive pre-sentence report encompassing not only your personal circumstances and offending history but also an assessment of your current risk profile and prospects for rehabilitation. This will be supplemented, as necessary, by input from relevant health and social services. I direct that all efforts be made to expedite the preparation of such reports, in recognition of the court’s duty to administer justice without unnecessary delay, mindful always of fairness to all parties concerned. These sentencing remarks are made this day, 3 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. The record of these proceedings has been formally recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Mr H is advised of his rights to appeal pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and under the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, should he elect to do so, within the statutory 28-day period. No reporting restrictions have been applied pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Matters of cost are reserved to the final sentencing hearing. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON R v. Mr H Case No. T2025/14739 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L. Archwell Filed: 15 August 2025 Mr H, you are before this court today for sentence relating to offences of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct occurred over an extended period spanning from September 2023 to February 2025, involving multiple locations across the city and surrounding boroughs. Procedural History Your first appearance at this court took place on 12 March 2025. The matter was originally listed before the Magistrates’ Court at Lewes, but the seriousness of the charges and the amount involved necessitated committal to the Crown Court for disposal under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme instituted in 2016. I record, with some relief, that this case was processed within the indicative time limits mandated by the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR), albeit with a short adjournment that was sought by the defence to allow for further disclosure requests. The Better Case Management system, as established by CPR Part 3, mandates early identification of issues, timely disclosure, and efficient listing of hearings. While the system aims to reduce delay and avoid unnecessary adjournments, reality often falls short. In the course of this case, the court witnessed an amicable but protracted process with diligent engagement from all parties. I acknowledge and thank counsel for their consistent cooperation despite the often cramped listing schedules affecting the Crown Court registry. The availability and clarity of evidence was initially constrained by incomplete CCTV footage from certain premises, which only became centrally available following liaison between separate local policing units and the city council’s Business Crime Reduction Partnership. This multi-agency collaboration, while laudable in principle, revealed the ongoing challenges faced by institutional partners in managing fragmented information streams and disparate data formats. There was also an unfortunate and avoidable delay occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted consideration of the defence application for expert psychiatric evaluation. Initial requests submitted on 7 May 2025 were not approved until mid-June, resulting in a truncated timetable for the defence expert. Such recurrent administrative bottlenecks warrant continued scrutiny and reform, given their impact on the timely delivery of justice. You initially pleaded not guilty at your first hearing on 12 March but entered a guilty plea on 1 July 2025, just days before the scheduled trial window. The court observes with some concern that this late admission of guilt, while now accepted, deprived witnesses of the relief of avoiding the ordeal of trial preparation and attendance. Credit for a guilty plea is apportioned in accordance with the guidelines set out by the Sentencing Council and the established common law on this matter. The Court of Appeal in R v Hamer [2021] EWCA Crim 1441 has emphatically reminded sentencing courts that the timing of a plea is critical to determining the degree of discount, with earlier pleas meriting greater credit in recognition of the procedural economy and expression of genuine remorse. Late pleas entered at the lump-sum point of inevitable conviction carry significantly reduced credit. It remains necessary to remind all parties that the goal of sentencing is not merely to respond to the crime but to reduce reoffending and protect the public. Repeated acquisitive offending is regrettably linked to entrenched criminal careers and often exacerbated by unmet vulnerabilities, social deprivation, or mental health challenges. One cannot discuss such cases without reference to the expanding body of domestic and comparative case law that grapples with the nuanced boundaries between culpability, welfare considerations, and the demands of public protection. For instance, in R v. Wilkes [2019] EWCA Crim 334, the court dealt with an individual exhibiting complex needs and multiple supporting interventions. While that case involved drug-related acquisitive offences rather than straight theft, it is instructive in suggesting how a court might calibrate sentencing to reflect both risk and reformative potential. Similarly, it is worth recalling the dicta in R v. Weatherill [2020] EWCA Crim 496, where the Court of Appeal emphasised that repeat shoplifting, while often viewed tritely by the public, inflicts real harm upon small business owners, erodes community confidence, and places burdens on an already strained criminal justice system. In the course of this case, the court received and considered a number of witness statements and victim impact reports. I commend the patience and professionalism of retail staff and managers who repeatedly encounter the anxiety and disruption caused by opportunistic theft. It is a misconception to regard such offences as victimless — they have tangible ramifications for employees’ sense of safety and the financial viability of small enterprises. Moreover, this court notes with appreciation the work of the Brighton Business Crime Partnership, which has endeavoured to provide both procedural assistance and moral support to affected businesses amidst rising crime rates. Their submissions underscore the cumulative toll even “low-value” theft imposes on shop floor morale, staff turnover, and security measures. The defendant resides within the city borough and has no registered employment. Attempts were made by the Probation Service to engage you with community-based support initiatives, although these were somewhat hampered by your inconsistent cooperation. Similarly, input from the mental health services was facilitated following instruction of a forensic clinical psychologist, Dr Sally Brant, whose report was received just prior to sentencing. Dr Brant notes the absence of a formal psychiatric diagnosis but remarks upon traits consistent with impulsivity and limited capacity for future planning. She also highlights an underlying history of substance misuse and social instability. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. I turn now to the detailed facts as proven at trial or admitted through your plea. The conduct represents a patterned and repeated approach, rather than an isolated lapse. This sustained offending involved deception, disguise, and actions calculated to avoid detection. The modus operandi included concealment of goods in clothing and the deactivation or removal of security tags. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. The court heard evidence that at times you conducted offending in the presence of other individuals who were either known associates or casual acquaintances. This raises questions about potential ancillary influence or encouragement, though no charge was brought against any purported co-offender. The wider issue of co-defendant involvement is well exemplified in other cases, such as R v. Partridge [2022] EWCA Crim 682, where complex networks of opportunistic thieves coordinated their approaches to avoid suspicion. No such extensive conspiracy was found here, but courts remain alert to signs of organised involvement as an aggravating factor. On four separate visits within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same small shop and stole alcohol and tobacco products. The court also considers the impact on local business proprietors, some of whom reported recoding losses in the several hundreds of pounds over the period of your activity. Security enhancements, including the installation of additional CCTV and staffing adjustments, were deployed, further straining operational budgets and staffing resources already affected by post-pandemic economic pressures. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. Often neglected in sentencing are insights from frontline workers who experience an erosion of safety culture. The reports submitted on behalf of the employers document heightened anxiety and diminished job satisfaction among staff who feared confrontation or reprisal. This is regrettably paralleled by an uptick in aggressive incidents, including verbal threats and occasional physical altercations unrelated to the present defendant yet contributing to an overall climate of fear. It is within this backdrop that community safety partnerships strive to contain wider antisocial behaviour and its attendant harms. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. The submissions filed by your legal representatives highlight certain mitigating matters, including a history of childhood instability and educational disruption. Reference was made to a letter from a longstanding family friend, Ms Joanne H., testifying to your early struggles with housing insecurity and episodic neglect. There was also mention of the impact of longstanding socio-economic deprivation on your educational outcomes and personal self-efficacy. The psychological report, while not evidencing a diagnosable condition, acknowledges deficits in impulse control and emotional regulation which may be relevant to your offending profile. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. However, any such mitigation must be balanced against the persistence of offending despite prior warnings and attempts at early diversion. Over recent years you have accumulated several previous convictions and community resolutions for related conduct. Your previous sentencing history includes a custodial order for an unrelated offence of criminal damage committed in 2021, which underlines a pattern of defiance towards authority. The impact of such antecedents upon current sentencing is well settled; see for example R v. Stevens [2019] EWCA Crim 827. It must also be remembered that credit for late guilty plea is necessarily limited under the established framework. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. Parole and probation officers involved in preparing precursor reports have noted your sporadic engagement with allocated support services. That is regrettable, given the array of community resources at your disposal through the local authority and voluntary sector. Agencies like the Brighton Outreach Network and SafeSpace Brighton have been proactive in extending offers of assistance. Copy correspondence received from SafeSpace highlights their repeated invitations to you for counselling and financial advice, all of which went unanswered. The probation officer references the burdens faced by frontline staff who, amid chronic underfunding and high caseloads, strive to maintain continuity in supervision and rehabilitation. The strain on such resources is well documented in government reports and parliamentary inquiries. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. In considering the appropriate sentence, this court is guided not only by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences (2020) but also informed by jurisprudence on culpability and harm from the Court of Appeal. The categorisation of offending within these guidelines hinges upon factors such as frequency, sophistication, the value of goods stolen, and the consequent effect upon victims. Even though the aggregate monetary loss here might be considered modest in absolute terms, the constellation of aggravating features — including repeated offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, and failure to respond to prior sanctions — legitimise a firm approach. The court is mindful of the principle of proportionality enshrined in section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which demands balancing retributive, preventive, and rehabilitative objectives. In assessing the line between community-based sanctions and immediate custody, the nature of the offending pattern and the demonstrated disengagement from support services weigh heavily. It is a serious challenge to balance the need to foster rehabilitation with the imperative to deter, particularly in cases exhibiting entrenched recidivism. The court also gives due regard to the increasing body of evidence linking cognitive behavioural interventions with reductions in offending among acquisitive criminals. The Probation Service’s forthcoming pre-sentence report will therefore consider the extent to which such programmes, perhaps combined with financial counselling and substance misuse support, might be feasibly integrated into any community order. It is rare for a case of this sort to be resolved without some degree of custodial sentence, but the final determination must await all relevant reports. This court also regrets the absence of media coverage of this case, depriving the public of insight into the broader social harms occasioned by what some may deem “minor” offending. Transparency remains a cornerstone of democratic justice, even when headlines are marked by the lack of sensationalism. The reality of criminal justice is often more humdrum but no less vital. In closing, I record my thanks to the Crown prosecution advocate, Ms Elaine Barlow, and to your counsel, Mr Thomas Fenton, both of whom have ably represented their respective clients and navigated the procedural complexities herein. I further acknowledge the patient and diligent service of court staff, ushers, and clerks, whose efforts underpin the administration of justice amid often heavy caseloads. I reserve sentence pending receipt and consideration of a detailed pre-sentence report, encompassing assessments from probation and liaison with mental health and social care providers. You are reminded that this court expects full engagement with any rehabilitation activities ordered and that failure to comply will attract swift and robust response. The court will give due consideration to all relevant aggravating and mitigating features and is particularly interested in learning whether a tailored community sentence might feasibly reconcile the competing objectives of public protection and rehabilitation. Further hearing is provisionally listed for 16 October 2025 in Court 5 at Brighton Crown Court. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities for registration. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing pursuant to section 108(1) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged here. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANSFIELD R v. MR H Case No. T2025/13479 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. F. MERRICK Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced in respect of theft, committed through a series of shoplifting offences, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct covers a protracted period spanning some fourteen months and involves multiple retail properties within the Mansfield, Ashfield, and Newark districts. Though ostensibly low-value in each individual instance, the pattern of repeated offending and the cumulative impact on victims and local community business cannot be overstated. Procedural Chronology and Case Management Your arrest occurred on 1 May 2025, following a prolonged investigation initiated by the Nottinghamshire Police Economic Crime Unit in conjunction with the Mansfield Business Crime Forum. The case owes its progression in no small part to the vigilance of store personnel and the local authorities' increasing investment in specialist crime reduction strategies. Detection arose from the collation of observational intelligence, cross-referenced CCTV content, and itemised inventory reports over an extended interval. Naturally, such investigations are resource-intensive affairs, requiring considerable manpower deployment, digital forensic analysis, and logistical co-ordination with non-police partners. As has been noted in numerous similar cases, this collaborative effort between the public and private sectors, while often heralded as exemplary on paper, struggles against persistent systemic pressure points—swelling caseloads, overstretched staff, and bureaucratic impediments. It would be remiss not to acknowledge that these practical realities inevitably shape the nature, timeliness, and outcomes of such adjudications. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. Legal Aid proceedings in this case proved protracted. Early applications for funding to retain an independent forensic psychologist, to assist in forming a complete clinical picture of the defendant, faced multiple refusals and requests for clarification from the Legal Aid Agency. This introduced avoidable adjournments. The court reiterates its concern over the frequently encountered delays attributable to Legal Aid administration, which compromise defendants' rights to expedition and undermine the operational efficiency of the criminal justice system. These issues are emblematic of a national challenge, well-documented and yet persistently unresolved, which calls for systemic reforms beyond this sitting. During preliminary hearings convened between June and August 2025, the court observed intermittent absences of prosecution witnesses due to operational reassignments within police units, alongside administrative disruptions caused by nationwide staff shortages in Probation Service teams. The multiplicity of such peripheral obstacles serves as a sobering reminder of the fragile interdependencies upon which effective criminal justice discourse rests. It is also worth noting that the court’s registry recently underwent refurbishment of its public waiting areas—a comparatively benign development amidst more pressing institutional strains yet testament to the ongoing commitment to providing a dignified environment. I record formally my thanks to Ms Caroline Jenkinson, appearing on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, whose precise and measured submissions have advanced the prosecution case with commendable clarity. Likewise, I acknowledge Mr Dominic Yeats, instructed on your behalf via a Legal Aid order, whose advocacy has been diligent, notwithstanding the endemic systemic pressures described above. The defence’s application for a pre-sentence psychiatric evaluation was eventually facilitated with the generous cooperation of Dr Andrew Lascombe, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose report will be further considered in due course. The court notes the difficulties encountered by the defence team in securing interpreter services on two separate occasions, an issue regrettably common in courts handling complex or resource-heavy caseloads. Additionally, the presence of Court Usher Ms Matilda Rowe merits mention for maintaining courtroom order despite the scheduling pressures and intermittent delays. Such recognition is not perfunctory but an acknowledgment of the essential human elements underpinning the judiciary’s work. We are all witnesses to an era marked by growing societal challenges; the ongoing effects of economic austerity, the fragilities within public health provision, and a complex interplay between social deprivation and crime. Mansfield, like many post-industrial towns, grapples with rising levels of street homelessness exacerbated by supply-constrained housing markets and deteriorating social supports. While such contextualising factors cannot excuse unlawful conduct, they form an unavoidable backdrop against which offending patterns must be understood. A leading report published by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies in 2023 highlighted that repeat shoplifting offences often intersect with chronic homelessness, untreated addiction, and minimal access to mental health support. These are alarming trends, but not insurmountable ones, provided that agencies collaborate effectively and resources are allocated rationally. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. It is also incumbent upon this court to observe that community responses to retail crime remain a balancing act. The Mansfield Local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (LBCRP), resilient despite funding constraints, has pioneered a series of non-punitive interventions, including offender engagement panels and retailer education programmes. These initiatives have been cautiously successful in diverting some low-risk individuals from custody and encouraging sustainable desistance. Yet, there persists a growing public weariness with persistent low-level crime—the kind often perceived as “victimless” but in reality deeply corrosive to local enterprise and community cohesion. Turning to authorities, in R v. Thornley [2019] EWCA Crim 1027, the Court upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant convicted of a prolonged series of shop thefts totalling in value over £3,000. Despite the absence of violence, the Court stressed the broader social harm and the undermining of public confidence in civic order. While the facts in Thornley differ in terms of scale, the principle that repetitive dishonesty undermines retail security and public trust remains pertinent. In R v. Sidhu [2021] EWCA Crim 1407, a case concerning cumulative theft from multiple charity shops across Leeds, the defendant's clinically significant personality disorder was considered in mitigation. Nonetheless, the Court emphasised that psychiatric diagnoses do not confer impunity and that sentences must reflect the totality of offending with a view to deterrence. Dr Lascombe’s report, whilst noting certain personality traits and stress-related vulnerabilities, did not diagnose any grave psychiatric disorder. Further, in R v. Gilmour [2017] EWCA Crim 1235, a defendant’s attempt to claim credit for a late guilty plea in a string of thefts was scrutinized. The Court made clear that the timing and circumstances of a plea are essential to determining credit entitlement, especially where a plea is entered only after the preponderance of evidence becomes indisputable. That principle governs this case, to which I will return. The Court’s understanding of the relevant background narrative is as follows. Your offending spanned a period from February 2024 to April 2025, during which you repeatedly entered a range of retail premises, including supermarkets, pharmaceutical dispensaries, and small convenience shops. The offending bears hallmarks of calculated conduct, with evidence indicative of repeated concealment of goods under clothing and in personal bags, use of distraction techniques directed at shop staff, and frequent return visits to the same stores. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. It is clear from CCTV and witness accounts that you did not shy away from employing a range of tactics to avoid apprehension. On multiple occasions, you were observed removing security tags with implements brought for this purpose, altering packaging to mislead scanning devices, and exiting through emergency exits when unobserved. Notably, on one incident, you were recorded wearing dark, non-descript clothing and a face covering, an escalation that suggests an awareness of and willingness to circumvent detection. Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. Although no direct threats or violence were used, the impact on retail staff has been profound. Several have reported increased anxiety and feelings of vulnerability during shifts. Changing working patterns, the imposition of restrictive store protocols, and sometimes the shortening of employee hours have all been attributed to the disruption caused by your actions. These ancillary consequences, though perhaps intangible, weigh heavily in the balance of culpability. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. There is further evidence before the court that after previous warnings, informal community resolutions, and invitations to participate in diversion programmes, you resumed such conduct within a matter of months. This cycle of offending, intervention, and relapse compounds concern over your receptiveness to rehabilitative efforts. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. Correspondence with the Mansfield Probation Office confirms your inconsistent attendance at appointments and limited engagement with offered support services. Local homelessness charities also report a sporadic relationship with outreach teams, despite clear vulnerabilities. Victim statements submitted on behalf of several affected businesses speak of lost revenue, reduced staff morale, and increasing pressure to invest in additional security measures, including CCTV, security personnel, and electronic tagging systems. Such expenses, borne entirely by small business owners already operating within tight margins, have cumulative knock-on effects on local employment and community wellbeing. Indirect victims also include local customers, who face reduced store hours or diminished choice owing to the shuttering of vulnerable outlets. Dr Lascombe’s report makes clear that whilst you do not suffer from acute mental illness, there is evidence of low-level substance dependency and a personality profile characterised by poor impulse control and pronounced emotional dysregulation. He observes that these factors may have exacerbated your vulnerability to social and economic pressures, yet also notes that you have demonstrated limited insight into the consequences of your actions. The report adds that motivational readiness for change appears minimal at present, with a need for intensive psychological intervention should meaningful rehabilitation be sought. It is a matter of public record that government and NHS services dealing with addiction and mental health are under considerable strain nationally. Waiting lists for outpatient psychiatric support exceed average targets by several months in this region, and while these systemic deficits are well recognised, they cannot be permitted to operate as a general excuse for defaulting adult behaviour. To place responsibility solely with overstretched services is to shirk the personal accountability that this court must uphold. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The Probation Service's Presentence Report further highlights the socioeconomic challenges facing you, including precarious housing conditions and intermittent family support. Despite these factors, and notwithstanding various local schemes aimed at diverting individuals engaged in acquisitive offending towards training or employment, compliance has been patchy and inconsistent. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. The cumulative effect of such behaviour is to diminish the credibility of community interventions designed to reduce reoffending. That is regrettable. It burdens an already overstretched probation system tasked with administering complex caseloads often numbering well beyond recommended limits. It is not lost on this court that those caseloads contain a diverse range of individuals, many of whom engage earnestly with their orders, yet outcomes vary widely and are influenced by numerous external factors. Adjunct Observations on Wider Criminal Justice Pressures It warrants brief mention that this case has been listed for sentence following adjournments occasioned partly by national strike action among legal professionals and court staff, as well as partial disruption caused by competing trials involving serious sexual offences in Court 4. These events, though external to your matter, illustrate the real-world pressures that compound the administration of justice and accentuate the importance of procedural efficiency when possible. Also of passing note: one co-defendant named in an unrelated matter about fly-tipping was arrested concurrently but was not connected with your offences in any legal or evidential respect. The unrelated charges involved deposition of construction waste on designated green belt land at Bowthorpe. This serves only to underscore the variety and complexity of enforcement duties borne by local police forces. In framing an appropriate sentence, the court is guided by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences. This guidance insists on a multifaceted analysis encompassing the culpability of the offender, the harm caused, any aggravating and mitigating features, and the overarching principles of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. Your offending is assessed as persistent and calculated, exhibiting a pattern of deliberate deception and evasion. While no physical violence transpired, the psychological and economic harm to victims is real and significant. Your previous convictions for similar conduct, though not recent, demonstrate a relevant history that cannot be overlooked. The question of whether to impose immediate custody, a community order, or a suspended sentence hinges on these factors, as well as your prospects for compliance and rehabilitation. Your late guilty plea is noted, although it was entered only after disclosure of compelling evidence. As per the guidance elucidated in R v. Fentham [2020] EWCA Crim 542, the degree of plea credit reflects not merely admission but timing and sincerity. I am also cognisant of the fact that community safety includes the preservation of workplaces as secure environments and the maintenance of consumer confidence in local markets. Persistent theft erodes these foundations and, by extension, social cohesion. Finally, it merits restating that your circumstances, including housing insecurity and possible substance dependency, while undoubtedly challenging, do not diminish the gravity of your conduct. Nonetheless, these factors must be balanced fairly and justly against the need to foster rehabilitation and prevent reoffending. I will accordingly direct the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report, incorporating current information from relevant support agencies, including the Probation Service and addiction treatment services. That report should explore the feasibility and advisability of community rehabilitation requirements and specify which interventions might best address the criminogenic needs identified in your case. I remind all parties that no final sentence will be imposed today pending receipt and consideration of this report, supplemented as appropriate by any further representations from the Crown or Defence. These sentencing remarks are tendered this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Mansfield. A formal transcript of these proceedings will be compiled in line with the requirements of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and subsequent sentence will be duly communicated to the pertinent agencies for administrative follow-up. You are hereby advised of your right to appeal this sentencing decision within 28 days, as governed by the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, section 49. Matters of costs remain reserved, pending final determination. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT EASTBROOK R v. MR H Case No. E2025/12547 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. Cartwright Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct as charged concerns a pattern of behaviour observed over a protracted period across a number of retail premises within the Eastbrook and surrounding boroughs. This court has before it detailed evidence and submissions pertaining to those matters. Procedural History The matter came before Eastbrook Magistrates’ Court on 26 April 2025, where initial pleas were entered, and the case was committed to the Crown Court in accordance with the established protocols for cases involving multiple counts and the potential for custodial sentencing. It is relevant to note that the custody threshold was engaged due to the repetition and circumstances of the offences alleged. At magistrates, bail conditions were imposed; these required your residence at a fixed address and a prohibition on entering specified retail premises, measures aligned with the public interest in preventing further offending pending trial. As is frequently encountered in cases of this nature, the investigative process was marked by coordination between several agencies, including the Eastbrook Business Crime Partnership, local policing units, and licensing authorities. The case was subject to the Better Case Management initiative, which seeks to encourage early case resolution and streamline pre-trial procedures. The plea and trial preparation hearing was listed for 15 July 2025 but was adjourned to 12 August due to a late application by the defence to instruct a psychiatric expert, a request which the Legal Aid Agency initially delayed processing until urgency was established by the court. The challenges encountered in securing such funding raise important systemic issues regarding timely access to expert evidence, which the court records with regret. During the hearing of 12 August, you entered a plea of not guilty, asserting various defences, including mistaken identity and challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. This necessitated the setting of a trial date. However, on 5 September 2025, immediately before the trial commenced, you changed your plea to guilty. The court notes this last-minute change and the implications it bears on credit for plea in sentencing. The court’s experience with similar cases acknowledges that late pleas, while entirely permissible and within the rights of defendants, impose significant burdens on the court process and the witnesses who attend, often necessitating extensive preparation for what ultimately becomes unnecessary contested proceedings. The jurisprudence on credit for guilty pleas, including the important guidance established in R v. Jakobsen [2018] EWCA Crim 159, clearly articulates the parameters within which such credit may be responsibly granted. This court is also mindful of the observations in R v. Tisdale [2019] EWCA Crim 320, where the appellate court underscored the link between the timing of a plea and the degree of discount applicable, emphasising the importance of genuine acceptance of responsibility over tactical decision-making prompted merely by evidential weight. The principle remains sound and is applied here with careful attention to the circumstances of the plea. The court is grateful for the representations made by counsel on both sides. Ms Felicity Drake, for the Crown, presented a carefully constructed submission as to the aggravating impact of persistent acquisitive behaviour on retail business morale and security staffing. Mr Oliver Trent, on your behalf, set out mitigating factors pertaining to your personal circumstances, including housing instability and reported challenges with substance misuse, while also candidly acknowledging the late nature of the plea. It is appropriate, before proceeding further, to register the court’s appreciation for the input of the Eastbrook Retail Victim Support Scheme, whose detailed impact statements have provided valuable insights not merely into immediate financial loss but into the broader psychological effect on retail employees. Their evidence aligns with the modern understanding, supported by criminological research, that the trauma induced in such contexts can be significant, notwithstanding the absence of physical harm. The evidence base further benefits from the psychiatric report authored by Dr Elaine Morley, a consultant forensic psychiatrist engaged to assess your mental state and risk profile. Her report is comprehensive, weighing historical and contemporaneous clinical records alongside your own account. While no major diagnosis of psychotic or mood disorder was made, significant findings in relation to impulse control, emotional dysregulation, and features of dependent personality traits were identified. Dr Morley also noted indications of long-standing polysubstance use, which, while not meeting diagnostic thresholds for dependence, nevertheless materially impairs judgement and increases vulnerability to relapse. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. The court is aware that shoplifting disproportionately affects small and independent retailers, for whom even minor losses can be existential threats. This impact transcends mere fiscal measures, encompassing the costs of increased security, staff turnover, and the erosion of community confidence. A recent annual report by the Retail Crime Analysis Group (RCAG), though principally focusing on metropolitan centres, highlighted that repeat offenders are responsible for a disproportionate fraction of shrinkage across retail sectors — particularly in pharmacies and convenience stores. It must also be recognised that the legal framework governing sentencing in theft cases directs courts not solely to focus on the monetary value involved but also on the offender’s culpability and the degree of planning and premeditation. Section 142 of the Sentencing Act 2020, while not yet fully tested in appellate courts, provides statutory reinforcement for penalising recidivist conduct aggressively. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. The court is not unmindful of the strain placed on probation services in the current fiscal environment. Reports from the Ministry of Justice indicate a persistent shortfall in available qualified practitioners, leading to caseloads well above recommended limits. This systemic pressure inevitably circumscribes the scope and frequency of contact with service users, potentially impairing rehabilitative effectiveness. Such realities, while extrinsic to individual culpability, frame the context in which sentencing and post-sentence supervision occur. It should also be noted that the Legal Aid Agency’s processing of applications for psychological assessments and representations remains inconsistent. Delayed authorisations in this case reflect a regrettable pattern, as highlighted in the regional review of funding mechanisms for criminal defence work published in March 2025, which called for urgent reforms to prevent undermining defendant rights and case progression. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. The court further notes the relevance of domestic violence statutes, strictly speaking unencompassing this case, yet illustrative through comparators in terms of harm and sentencing principles, as found in R v. Calder [2022] EWCA Crim 1287. Although the cases differ markedly in facts and culpability, the judiciary’s approach to recognising patterns of behaviour and escalating consequences remains consistent. Turning to the substance of the case, the facts as established by the Crown and accepted in your plea are as follows. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. The items stolen, while individually of modest value, represent collectively a significant economic loss to the shops involved. Moreover, the manner in which the thefts were conducted betrays a calculated approach. Evidence includes the use of bags reportedly modified to defeat detection systems, the timing of thefts to coincide with staff breaks or low-visibility periods, and the alleged use of distraction techniques upon store employees. 17 August 2025 saw the production of victim impact statements, not only from the proprietors of affected stores but also from employees, one of whom described fluctuating anxiety levels and altered work patterns in response to your repeated presence, including requests to avoid lone working on shifts. The psychological ramifications for low-wage workers in such circumstances are well-documented and impose a further dimension of harm. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. This was not mere opportunism. The pattern demonstrated points to sophisticated offending. The court must consider that, contrary to some offenders who commit momentary lapses, you exhibited persistence despite prior warnings, previous community resolutions, and informal interventions by police liaison officers. It is helpful at this juncture to reflect on the jurisprudence concerning theft by shoplifting involving repeated offending. The unreported case of R v. Denning [2019] EWCA Crim 764 is instructive, where the Court upheld a sentence of 18 months for a defendant who engaged in a similar modus operandi, involving multiple thefts from pharmacy chains whilst evading detection through the use of disguises and accomplices. Although it is acknowledged that the evidence here does not establish co-conspirators, the calculated nature of the offending calls for an appropriately robust response. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. In relation to public safety and risk, the psychiatric assessment suggests that you do not pose a risk of serious physical harm to others. However, the report highlights elevated risks of reoffending tied to the underlying impulsivity and substance misuse issues. The Probation Service has confirmed that historically, engagement with supervisory programmes has been sporadic. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Careful consideration must also be given to the representation offered on your behalf as to mitigating circumstances. The letters of support submitted by family members and voluntary agencies indicate that you suffer from housing insecurity, with residence shifting between temporary accommodation and family homes. The challenges posed by this instability are acknowledged by the court as legitimate factors impacting behaviour and wellbeing. However, the balance to be struck between understanding and accountability necessarily prioritises prevention of criminal conduct and protection of the public interest. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. The court recognises the efforts of the Eastbrook Housing Support Service, which has sought to engage with you regarding sustainable tenancy and budgeting advice. Nevertheless, such support remains conditional upon your continued participation, which has been inconsistent to date. It cannot be doubted that the system faces considerable demand. As noted in the Housing and Homelessness Annual Review 2024, the scarcity of affordable housing places acute pressures on vulnerable residents, leading, as often as not, to health deterioration, social dislocation, and, regrettably, risks of offending. Similar pressures have been illuminated within substance misuse frameworks. The Eastbrook Recovery Partnership has reported an increased caseload with waiting periods averaging six months for targeted community-based interventions. Early engagement is critical, and this court hopes that any custodial term imposed will be accompanied by access to such services to reduce the risk of reoffending. From the standpoint of sentencing guidelines, the overarching principles guiding theft offences remain: the culpability of the offender, the harm caused, and the impact on victims and community confidence. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Definitive Guideline, last updated in 2024, emphasises that persistent offending with deliberate planning is an aggravating feature warranting custodial sentences in accordance with the offender’s antecedent record and the offence category. Notably, community resolutions previously arranged in your case failed to deter repeated offending. This fact weighs heavily in delivering a message both to yourself and to the wider public that sustained criminal conduct cannot be overlooked or treated indulgingly. The court is conscious, too, of the wider societal picture. Eastbrook has experienced an increase in acquisitive crime in the last financial year, pressurising the policing and judicial resources available. Such cases constitute a significant portion of court workloads and are often cited by local businesses as deterrents to investment and economic stability. The Business Crime Reduction Partnership here, while proactive, operates in an environment of scarce funding and outreach limitations. The relationship between acquisitive crime and social deprivation is intricate but not deterministic. Judicial sentencing must recognise mitigation without forfeiting the need for effective deterrence and rehabilitation. This balance is delicate amid wider concerns about overcrowding in custodial facilities, as outlined in the Justice Inspectorate’s report of June 2025, which underscores the necessity for community-based alternatives where appropriate. Whilst your late guilty plea is noted and will attract some reduction in sentence, the court is alive to the fact that a plea entered merely a few days prior to trial represents a lesser degree of credit than one made at the earliest available opportunity. In conclusion, this court will request a detailed pre-sentence report to assess the suitability of sentencing options, with particular emphasis on proposals for interventions aimed at addressing impulsivity, substance use, and housing stability. It is essential that any sentence imposed prioritises public protection while offering a realistic prospect of rehabilitation. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at Eastbrook Crown Court. The proceedings are transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be communicated to relevant authorities. You are reminded of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to sections 108 and 109 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No specific reporting restrictions are engaged under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON R v. MR H Case No. B2025/14062 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. CARMICHAEL Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of charges brought under the Theft Act 1968, specifically concerning offences of shoplifting. The charges reflect a repeated pattern of offending over a protracted period, involving several retail establishments across Brighton and nearby coastal towns. The indictment, though formally a single representative count, encapsulates conduct spanning from early 2023 through to April of this year. Procedural and Contextual Background The court notes the procedural journey that this case has followed, occasioned in part by the complexities often attendant upon multi-site acquisitive offending. You were first apprehended on 13 May 2025 after an intelligence-led operation by the Sussex Retail Crime Task Force, supported by various multi-agency partners, including the Sussex Police Digital Investigation Unit and local council community safety officers. This investigation, protracted and resource intensive, drew upon an array of evidence types including digital recordings, transaction histories, and mobile device data secured under judicial authorization. What merits recording at the outset is the manner in which cases such as this give rise to extended investigative and prosecutorial demands disproportionate to the apparent scale of individual incidents. That is in no way a reflection on the probity or dedication of the agencies concerned; indeed, these bodies are to be commended for their ongoing vigilance. Nevertheless, the pursuit of repeated low-value thefts, albeit cumulatively significant, places real strain upon public resources already stretched across numerous competing demands — from tackling serious violent crime to attending to cyber-enabled fraud. The deployment of officers and analysts to canvass hours of CCTV footage, cross-reference duty rosters, and process evidential exhibits is considerable. In considering your case, I must also observe the broader social and economic milieu in which such offending occurs. The phenomenon of acquisitive crime intersects with and is influenced by factors including economic deprivation, unstable housing, substance misuse, and limited access to welfare support. These factors do not mitigate culpability but provide important context in informing the court’s approach to sentencing and rehabilitative opportunity. It should be noted that delays in the progress of the case have occurred, attributable in part to procedural adjournments and, regrettably, obstacles within the Legal Aid system. Defence counsel experienced protracted waits for funding authorizations to instruct a forensic psychologist and to obtain a detailed pre-sentence report, a regrettably frequent occurrence that impedes timely resolution. The court trusts that systemic improvements will be forthcoming to reduce such impediments. The case was listed initially for trial on 7 August 2025, following a plea and trial preparation hearing in June at which you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequent evidence, including additional CCTV material and procurement of digital records, precipitated your change of plea to guilty on 28 August, mere days before the scheduled contested hearing. The timing of your change of plea is pertinent to the issue of credit for guilty pleas. It is regrettable but not uncommon that defendants choose to delay acceptance of responsibility until overwhelming evidence is placed before them. The Court of Appeal has consistently held that while credit is appropriate for guilty pleas, the degree of discount reflects the timing and the degree of cooperation from the outset. See R v. Hawkins [2023] EWCA Crim 2174 and R v. Milton [2024] EWCA Crim 503. In setting out these remarks, I have had the benefit of written submissions from Ms Emma Walcott, representing the Crown, who has ably presented the aggravating features relating to the persistence and planning in your offending. I also acknowledge submissions made by Mr Oliver Dyer, your counsel, appearing under a representation order, who has candidly acknowledged the challenges in this case and sought mitigation with respect to your personal circumstances. I also record my appreciation for the goodwill and professionalism shown by front-line retail staff impacted by your conduct, as evidenced in victim impact statements compiled by the Brighton Retail Forum. These accounts highlight not merely economic losses but stress and anxiety experienced by employees routinely subjected to suspicion and scrutiny. Their perseverance amid limited corporate support underscores the human cost of repeated shop thefts. The sentencing of offences such as this draws on a broad corpus of appellate authority which, while not directly analogous in all respects, provides useful frameworks for assessment. An instructive precedent is R v. Tindle [2022] EWCA Crim 1236 where the appellant was convicted of multiple counts of shoplifting conducted with a modicum of sophistication, involving the use of bags with concealed linings to evade detection. The Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence of 10 months, noting the cumulative harm and the currency of repeat offending. Similarly, R v. Strachan [2021] EWCA Crim 1743 reviewed sentence proportionality in acquisitive crime, emphasising the necessity of deterrence and the protection of small independent retailers, which suffer disproportionately from shrinkage and labour costs arising from persistent theft. Cases concerning associated acquisitive crime, such as R v. Lindsey [2023] EWCA Crim 889, addressed the interaction of persistent theft with mental health factors, concluding that while mental health challenges warrant consideration, they do not ordinarily negate the necessity for custodial sentences where offending behaviour demonstrates calculated or frequent conduct. It is, furthermore, a matter for note that the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft (2020) firmly places repeated and planned offending within the higher harm brackets, even where individual thefts involve low value. Aggravating features include targeting vulnerable premises, deployment of concealment methods, and disregard for previous warnings. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. Procedural delays here are instructive of systemic pressures. For example, the delay of over six weeks in securing Legal Aid funding for expert psychological assessment not only frustrated case progression but risked compounding the distress of victims keen for resolution. Similarly, the court is aware of ongoing staffing shortages within probation services nationally, leading to delays in compiling risk assessments or preparing community-based intervention plans. The court acknowledges, with regret, that the demands placed on public services have increased markedly in recent years. The Sussex Probation Region reports caseload increases of 22% since 2021, with proportionate reductions in staffing levels due to budgetary constraints. This impacts the capacity to supervise medium- and high-risk offenders, and threatens the availability of programme places designed to reduce reoffending. Moreover, housing insecurity remains a pressing challenge. Brighton and Hove City Council data indicates a 14% increase in temporary accommodation placements over the last 18 months, reflecting wider issues affecting the South East. The strained capacity of homelessness services undermines attempts to stabilise individuals’ circumstances, often leading to cyclical offending patterns. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. An important consideration is your personal background. You are 34 years old, with a modest employment record interrupted by significant periods of joblessness. You have no allegations or findings of gang involvement or organised criminality, and there is no evidence of coercion or exploitation by third parties. However, the court notes a history of previous convictions for theft-related offences, including two prior cautionable matters relating to shoplifting at similar premises. Despite interventions by local community policing teams and voluntary organisations offering support services, you have failed to desist. It is necessary to consider assessments prepared by clinical experts. A report compiled by Dr Sarah Dunlop, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, following comprehensive interviews and psychometric testing conducted in July 2025, indicates no presence of major mental illness but identifies traits of impulsivity and some difficulties with emotional regulation. Dr Dunlop’s report includes: “…the defendant exhibits low distress tolerance and limited coping strategies when faced with environmental stressors, notably financial insecurity. His offending appears to be opportunistic, influenced by transient mood fluctuations rather than deeply entrenched antisocial attitudes.” The report suggests potential responsiveness to cognitive skills interventions but recommends close supervision to mitigate risk of reoffending. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. The court also has before it a pre-sentence report filed on 10 September 2025 by Probation Officer Mr James Elwood. This assessment emphasises the risk of further acquisitive offending absent robust rehabilitative engagement. The report observes: “Given Mr H’s history and apparent absence of stable accommodation, the likelihood of reoffending is elevated. Without effective support addressing both practical needs and cognitive distortions underpinning his offending, recidivism remains a significant concern. However, Mr H has expressed a tentative willingness to engage with programmes should they be made accessible.” Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. The court further notes correspondence from the local branch of the Retail Victim Support Network, highlighting the disproportionate burden on smaller retailers, many of whom have reduced staffing or closed during quieter trading hours due to fears of recurring theft. Their letter describes this as “a slow attrition of local economic vitality,” and underscores the cumulative emotional toll on employees, some of whom suffer from anxiety and sleep disturbance. It is a notable societal development that offences previously regarded primarily in financial terms carry broader implications for community cohesion. The fear induced in workers, and the erosion of trust between retail staff and members of the public, contributes to an atmosphere inimical to social and economic wellbeing. An unfortunate but related consequence documented in recent policing reports is the rising incidence of confrontations arising from theft interventions. Although no such escalations have been attributed to you, the court must take care to deter reintegration of offenders who might inadvertently provoke harm. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. The court also observes the persistence of a broader narrative regarding social marginalisation, frequently invoked to contextualise repeat offending. While recognizing the importance of situating offences within an individual’s circumstances, this court rejects any notion that such factors reduce criminal accountability. As noted in R v. Allanson [2019] EWCA Crim 1023, the Court reminded sentencing judges to balance empathy with the imperatives of justice and public protection. The mere presence of socio-economic disadvantage does not excuse deliberate, sustained breach of the law. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. There is, lamentably, an increasing appearance of mental health pressures intersecting with acquisitive crime. National Health Service reports indicate that waiting times for adult psychotherapies often extend to months, particularly in regional centres. Funding and capacity limitations have a tangible impact on access to timely clinical interventions, thus intersecting with criminal justice outcomes. Although your psychological assessment does not reveal diagnosable illness beyond personality features, it is regrettable that multi-agency collaboration is hampered by resource scarcity, affecting joint support planning. The court reiterates its gratitude to the professionals engaged in supporting you thus far and acknowledges the written statements from staff at the Brighton Renewal Centre, a voluntary sector organisation providing housing advice and budgeting support. Their feedback documents both efforts made and challenges encountered in fostering engagement. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. It is worth noting, if only peripherally, that this jurisdiction, historically home to the now-discontinued Brighton Crown Quarter, has seen extensive reform in its court estate over the past decade. The transfer of certain hearing types to designated sessions elsewhere has altered scheduling availability, contributing marginally to delay. Such operational considerations, while tangential, reflect the shifting landscape in which criminal proceedings unfold—a landscape characterised by both modernisation and complex logistical demands. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. The sentencing framework in this case is, therefore, one which requires both consideration of the gravity of the offending and recognition of your personal circumstances. The courts must send a clear message that deliberate and repeated shoplifting, demonstrably planned and executed across multiple sites, is a serious breach warranting sanction. At the same time, it must direct appropriate interventions to support desistance where possible. I have reviewed the applicable statutory provisions, including sections 1 and 7 of the Theft Act 1968, and have regard to the Sentencing Council guideline on theft (effective from 2020). My approach accords with the aim to reduce reoffending and protect the public, balancing punishment with rehabilitation. In mitigation, your age and previous employment history are noted, alongside the absence of violent behaviour or threats during incidents. Your guilty plea, though entered late, avoids the trauma and expense of a contested hearing, albeit diminished credit is warranted by the timing. The evaluation of risk and amenability to treatment indicates a potential benefit in a structured community sentence incorporating cognitive skills work. This would seek to address offending-related thought patterns and enhance coping mechanisms. However, given the scale of offending and prior warnings, a custodial sentence cannot be excluded pending further report. Accordingly, I direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared with particular focus on suitability for an accredited offending behaviour programme, housing stability, and access to financial and psychological support. The report shall also consider the feasibility of a probation-led supervision order incorporating unpaid work and rehabilitation activities. Should the risk profile suggest, an assessment for electronic monitoring may also be warranted. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Brighton. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities for administrative purposes. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEEDS R v. MR H Case No. L2025/14739 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. Langworth Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a charge of theft, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct in question took place between November 2023 and June 2025, predominantly within retail premises across Leeds city centre, as well as some outlying districts within the metropolitan area. The procedural history of this matter is somewhat protracted. You were initially arrested on 2 July 2025, subsequent to a referral from the West Yorkshire Police Retail Crime Investigation Unit. This Unit acts collaboratively with the Business Crime Reduction Partnership, various local stores, and dedicated crime prevention officers within the force. The investigation, to which a considerable quantum of resources was deployed, relied upon the careful cross-referencing of surveillance data collected over an eighteen-month period. As is now well understood, incidents of retail theft can, of course, have deleterious consequences disproportionate to their monetary value, and the efforts to bring such offenders to justice necessarily entail painstaking collation of fragmented evidence. You appeared first at Leeds Magistrates' Court on 7 July 2025, where you entered a plea of not guilty. The case was then committed for trial due to the value and volume of evidence and disposition of the indictment. A plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 29 August 2025. It was at that hearing, after full disclosure and review of the evidence, that you entered a guilty plea to the counts on the indictment. The timeline here is to be noted. A guilty plea at an advanced stage presents specific considerations in terms of sentencing credit. The Court of Appeal in R v Craine [2019] EWCA Crim 1283 has clarified that the utility of the plea is primarily measured against its timing and the impact on witnesses and court resources. While you do receive some credit for the change of plea, it cannot be at the highest level granted for early admission. It is worthwhile adding that, in the wider context, the judiciary is all too familiar with the pressures placed upon frontline policing and intelligence services tasked with investigating acquisitive offences. For instance, as per the findings of the 2024 National Retail Crime Report, such resources are often diverted from serious or violent crime investigations to address the UK’s growing challenges with persistent shop theft. The strains on personnel and budgetary limitations underscore the gravity with which this court regards offending of this nature, even where injuries or serious violence are absent. The legal framework governing your sentence is primarily found in the Theft Act 1968 and the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (effective since February 2023). The guideline directs that the court evaluate the harm, culpability, and circumstances of the offender. Particular attention is paid to offences involving repeat offending, commercial impact, and emotional harm caused to victims and staff. It is pertinent to recall rulings in appellate authorities such as R v Freeman [2022] EWCA Crim 1051, wherein the Court upheld a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment for repeat shoplifting offences involving the targeted theft of high-value cosmetics and pharmaceutical items. The offender demonstrated a pattern of behaviour accompanied by a deliberate exploitation of vulnerability in retail environments. Similarly, R v Tolley [2020] EWCA Crim 1998 provides guidance concerning the imposition of community orders with unpaid work as an alternative in certain shoplifting cases, emphasising the importance of addressing underlying criminogenic needs through community rehabilitation. This case, among others, informs the multi-faceted approach recommended by probation services and cognate national bodies. At the case management hearing on 18 August 2025, the court adjourned sentencing to allow for reports from both the Probation Service and an independent psychiatric assessment. The Probation Service is widely known to be under significant operational pressure, exacerbated by increasing caseloads and staff shortages nationally, which regrettably can result in delays to the preparation of detailed, person-centred reports. I acknowledge this context, though such constraints cannot excuse the absence of necessary information critical to the sentencing decision. The psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Samuel Hargrave, a consultant forensic psychiatrist with over fifteen years’ experience in adult mental health and criminal justice, offers a considered and nuanced view. Dr Hargrave concludes that you do not meet the diagnostic criteria for a major mental disorder affecting criminal responsibility. He notes traits consistent with episodic low mood and features of an emotionally unstable personality disorder, though not of sufficient severity to impair culpability. The report highlights a history of sporadic engagement with substance misuse treatment services, noting an apparent reluctance to maintain consistent contact, despite referrals. It must be said that while this clinical input is informative, it does not, in this case, diminish personal accountability. It is a fact universally acknowledged that mental health vulnerabilities do not constitute a carte blanche exemption from prosecution or punishment, save where such conditions substantially impair cognition or volition. The court is enjoined, indeed, to balance welfare considerations against public safety imperatives. The expert’s observations, combined with probation assessments and other evidence, assist in forming an enlightened view in that regard. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. In outlining the factual matrix, the court acknowledges that the offending was neither isolated nor the result of a transient lapse. On the contrary, the evidence before me points to repeated entries into multiple retail outlets over an extended timeframe. The approach was characterised by deliberate concealment and careful evasion of detection, including the use of bags and outerwear to obscure stolen items, as well as feigned phone conversations to distract staff. Such conduct denotes a degree of sophistication and premeditation that aggravates culpability. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. Of note, the prosecution have also adduced evidence that, at times, your behaviour prompted heightened security measures within certain premises. Staff rotations were altered, additional monitoring was employed, and in one particularly telling instance, a lone store assistant felt compelled to resign owing to stress and anxiety exacerbated by your return visits. This underlines the psychological impact on vulnerable store employees, an aspect well-recognised in recent sentencing practice guidance. The court is grateful for the victim impact statements provided by these employees and by the management teams of the affected premises. Such statements convey the genuine disruption and distress occasioned by persistent theft, extending beyond mere financial loss. It is a regrettably common refrain that retail workers face an increasingly hostile and insecure workplace environment—a fact borne out by recent reports from the Retail Trust charity and other industry bodies. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. It is important, in the interests of completeness, to acknowledge that while no physical violence was directed at any individual, the threat of escalation is a chilling and recurring concern. The potential for confrontation between shop staff and offenders remains a persistent tension in retail crime. In this regard, the court recalls the cautionary stance adopted in R v Mallory [2018] EWCA Crim 2184, whereby the presence of a commitment to non-violence does not necessarily mitigate the overall seriousness when considered within the full constellation of offending. Funding for your defence has been provided under a standard representation order, though with regrettable administrative delays. The Legal Aid Agency’s increasingly complex authorisation systems have introduced procedural bottlenecks, impeding timely instruction of expert reports and support for vulnerable defendants. Such systemic issues have been the subject of recent Parliamentary scrutiny and several independent reviews. Though exogenous to this specific case, these delays bear upon the efficient progress of litigation and, by extension, the administration of justice. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. The pre-sentence report compiled by probation, by Ms Fiona Rathbone, a senior probation officer with twelve years’ experience, provides a detailed assessment of your background, risks, and rehabilitative needs. Ms Rathbone notes your history of accommodation instability, periods of unemployment, and fractured family relationships. She highlights longstanding struggles with alcohol misuse and intermittent engagement with community services. The report emphasises a moderate level of risk of reoffending, primarily linked to lifestyle factors and poor impulse control. Ms Rathbone recommends engagement with an integrated Thinking Skills Programme, alongside substance misuse counselling, should a custodial sentence not be deemed necessary. She also stresses the importance of stable housing as a precondition for effective rehabilitation—an issue of considerable public policy concern given the pressures on local authority housing provision. The court is aware that demand currently outstrips supply, with many applicants reliant on temporary or unstable arrangements. I recognise the efforts of charitable organisations such as Leeds Housing Aid Network, which operate under severe resource constraints yet provide invaluable assistance to individuals in need. The court has received letters from such groups, which commend your limited but sincere attempts at engagement, while urging all agencies to coordinate support for reintegration and desistance. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. This court must also address the wider societal backdrop. Urban centres in England, including Leeds, have seen an unfortunate rise in begging, street homelessness, and antisocial behaviour over recent years. These phenomena often intersect with acquisitive crime, though it is vital to avoid simplistic or determinist assertions of causality. Offending remains a matter of personal choice and responsibility within the constraints of circumstance. The court is mindful of the persistent narrative of “broken communities,” a term that, while evocative, can serve to obscure the individual agency and capacity for change. Authorities tasked with maintaining order and protecting public safety must balance compassion with firmness. The increasing normalisation of low-level shop theft, particularly when carried out repeatedly by the same individuals, risks eroding the social compact and the rule of law. This court cannot overlook that reality in favour of facile explanations. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. Turning briefly to relevant case law, the decision in R v. Havers [2022] EWCA Crim 1602 remains instructive. There, the Court of Appeal underscored the need for sentencing to reflect both personal culpability and the broader community impact, particularly where there is evidence of a repeated and premeditated pattern of theft involving vulnerable retail operations. A sentence of immediate custody was affirmed in that case, reinforcing the message that repeated acquisitive offending must be met with appropriate deterrence. In R v. Haswell [2021] EWCA Crim 1754, the Court held that late pleas of guilty offered little mitigation where the accused had previously maintained a not guilty plea despite overwhelming evidence, resulting in compressive sentences with limited reduction. Although your plea was not at the very last minute, the timing nonetheless tempers any discount here. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. Other appellate authorities, such as R v. Latimer [2021] EWCA Crim 947, distinguish between custodial and community sentences based on individual circumstances, including prospects of rehabilitation. However, Latimer also emphasises that the persistence of offending despite warnings and interventions weighs heavily against more lenient disposal. That principle is engaged where, as here, prior diversion has failed to deter further theft. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. There are no indications of co-offenders or complicity by third parties. Your defence has not advanced any claims of coercion or undue influence. You have denied involvement up to the point of the guilty plea but otherwise made no attempt to dispute the well-documented evidence. In relation to the impact of these offences on the victims and their businesses, the court recognises the careful and measured manner in which the store employees who provided statements have expressed themselves. Their descriptions of distress and diminished sense of workplace security are to be taken seriously. While monetary loss attributable to individual thefts may be modest, the cumulative toll is significant, affecting operational hours, staffing, and morale. The Court notes the Courtroom’s newly refurbished bench and improved hearing technology, introduced earlier this year to enhance judicial efficiency and witness confidence. The usher team, whose efforts in maintaining order and assisting vulnerable witnesses are valued, deserve thanks for their professionalism throughout this hearing. Thank you are also due to Ms Stella O’Connor, who appears for the Crown, and Mr James Vosper, who represents you pursuant to a Legal Aid representation order. Despite systemic challenges, both have provided comprehensive submissions and have acted with propriety and diligence. In considering the appropriate sentence, the court is bound to balance the severity of the offence, your personal circumstances, any mitigating factors, and the public interest in deterrence and rehabilitation. The court is also conscious of the ongoing difficulties faced by services attempting to support offenders such as yourself—be they probation providers, substance misuse services, or housing support charities—all grappling with demand that outstrips finite resources. Acknowledging this, it must be underscored that the law applies equally regardless of circumstance. While the presence of hardship or vulnerability may inform the nature of intervention, it cannot pale the gravity of repeated calculated offending. In light of all of these considerations and in accordance with established sentencing practice, I will reserve sentence pending the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report addressing current circumstances and the suitability of rehabilitative measures. This report shall specifically examine your engagement with local support services, capacity for compliance with community orders, and any assessed risk to the public. The report is to be prepared expeditiously and served upon the court and parties no later than 12 November 2025, when this matter will return to be listed for sentence. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at Leeds Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT EASTCHESTER R v. MR H Case No. E2025/14091 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge K. R. ELDRIDGE Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence having been convicted of offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely shoplifting from several retail premises over a protracted period. The offending conduct extended across a timeframe from mid-2023 to early 2025 and took place within the jurisdiction of Eastchester and the neighbouring boroughs. Procedural History and Court Context The present matter came before the Magistrates’ Court on 10 March 2025, when you were initially charged with three counts of theft. At that initial hearing, your legal representatives indicated an intention to contest the allegations, resulting in a transfer of the case to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme. The application of BCM reflects the judiciary’s intention to deal efficiently and fairly with cases involving multiple linked offences or where evidential complexity is anticipated. It is pertinent to observe that the BCM process involves a series of procedural steps aimed at early identification of issues, timely disclosure, and fixing of trial dates. The administration of this framework is not without its difficulties. While the Criminal Procedure Rules provide indicative timeframes and best practice, systemic challenges such as court capacity constraints, staffing shortages, and increased listing pressures have meant that many cases face delays. This case underwent adjournments on three separate occasions, two of which arose from issues related to defence counsel’s availability and Legal Aid authorisation for expert reports, and one occasion due to the late filing of victim impact statements. These operational realities are regrettably widespread, not unique. The court recognises the strain placed upon scarce resources throughout our criminal justice system, especially within Crown Court centres serving diverse and densely populated areas. Cases involving acquisitive offending frequently compete for listing with more serious matters of violence or fraud, and these competing priorities inevitably influence scheduling. On 29 May 2025, a plea and trial preparation hearing was held, at which stage you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequently, however, following the service of further evidence and discussions with your legal team, a change of plea was entered on the first date of trial proceedings on 15 September 2025. The matter has been presented to this court by Ms Felicity Maynard, prosecuting counsel of the Crown Prosecution Service, and Mr Julian Bennett represents you on behalf of the defence, operating under a representation order. The court records its appreciation of their respective professionalism during what has otherwise been a lengthy and procedurally complex matter. It is necessary to record, with some frustration and regret, the protracted delays occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency in approving funding for the instruction of an independent psychiatric expert. Initial applications were submitted on 21 April 2025 but were met with requests for further clarification and, ultimately, a multi-week wait prior to approval being granted on 18 June 2025. Such delays are detrimental to the expeditious administration of justice. They impede comprehensive assessment of offender risk and needs and hinder robust defence preparation. These procedural impediments, well-documented both anecdotally and in official reports, remain a source of systemic concern within the criminal justice community. The court trusts that continued reforms are pursued with vigour to minimise recurrence. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. Shoplifting is a category of theft often treated lightly by the public but nonetheless is taken seriously by the courts, especially where offending is persistent, planned, or causes demonstrable harm beyond immediate financial loss. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences draws attention to relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. Aggravators include, inter alia, the persistence of offending behavior, targeting of vulnerable victims or premises, use of deception or manipulation, and failure to demonstrate remorse. Mitigating factors may include early guilty pleas, genuine remorse, and demonstrable attempts to make reparation or undergo rehabilitation. Several authoritative appellate decisions provide further context. In R v. Paterson [2019] EWCA Crim 2047, the Court emphasised that repetitive shoplifting, despite warnings and diversionary measures, evidences a conscious disregard for statutory prohibitions and community norms. That case involved a defendant who had been convicted of shoplifting twenty-six times over five years, with the Court upholding a community order with a significant unpaid work requirement as necessary deterrent. Similarly, in R v. Marshall [2022] EWCA Crim 1318, the court considered the intersection of mental health and acquisitive crime. Although the defendant suffered from a diagnosed personality disorder, repeated breaches of prohibitory orders led the Court to conclude that community sentences with mental health intervention components were appropriate, rather than immediate custody. These cases serve to remind that sentencing must be calibrated to individual circumstances and the overarching aim of protecting the public while encouraging rehabilitation. The court has received several written victim personal statements from affected retailers, coordinated through the Eastchester Retail Crime Forum and the local Neighbourhood Policing Team. These statements convey the material and psychological toll on staff, including increased anxiety, reduced morale, and changes in operational practices such as the fortification of premises and altered staff rotas to mitigate repeat offences. The Retail Crime Forum, operating under the auspices of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership, continues to play an important role in information-sharing and support for victimised businesses. The court commends their diligent efforts, despite the acknowledged pressures of limited funding and personnel shortages. Such partnerships represent a critical mechanism for frontline crime reduction and victim engagement. It is further noted that liaison with social services and housing agencies confirmed your unsettled living circumstances. You were residing in temporary accommodation provided via Eastchester City Council’s housing support unit during much of the period under consideration. The volatility inherent in such arrangements is well-known to the court and the Probation Service, often correlating with increased vulnerability and offending risk. The court takes this opportunity to remark on the recent refurbishment of Court 6, where these proceedings have transpired. The enhanced accessibility features and upgraded digital recording systems mark a welcome improvement to the trial environment, aimed at facilitating clearer communication and more efficient case management. Regrettably, the interpreter services scheduled for the day of the plea hearing experienced last-minute shortages, causing a delay of over forty-five minutes. Such disruptions, while infrequent, nevertheless introduce avoidable anxiety and inconvenience for all parties and speak to continuing recruitment challenges at a national level. The Probation Service continues to grapple with caseload pressures, notably impacting timely report preparation and offender supervision. The present case illustrates this strain, with the pre-sentence report commissioning delayed until after the guilty plea owing to competing priorities across Eastchester’s probation teams. In considering the procedural backdrop, it is worth noting the cooperation extended by Ms Sandra Latham, your assigned supervising officer, whose detailed notes and engagement with local support charities provide a valuable perspective on your circumstances. Her letter submitted to the court is a thoughtful document highlighting both your difficulties and instances of positive engagement. The facts of the case are as follows: Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. The investigation leading to your arrest on 2 March 2025 was initiated following complaints received by the Eastchester Police Retail Unit, alerting them to a series of suspected thefts from multiple pharmacies and convenience stores. This triggered a coordinated operation involving mobile patrol units, undercover surveillance, and analysis of CCTV footage from various retail outlets over a 10-week period. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. The modus operandi identified was consistent: entering premises during busy periods, using a standard-issue reusable bag to conceal items, and often conducting mock phone conversations to deflect suspicion. In addition, on two verified occasions, you were recorded removing security tags without consent, in what can only be described as a premeditated endeavour to evade detection. Several aspects of your conduct distinguish these offences from spontaneous or opportunistic shoplifting. The repeat nature of the offences, the selection of high-demand goods, and awareness of store layouts indicate planning and a degree of sophistication. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. While no physical confrontation or threats were recorded, evidence from victim impact statements indicates a palpable sense of unease among store employees, some of whom reported feelings of stress and apprehension when working alone due to your repeated visits. Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. You have four prior convictions for theft-related offences, all shoplifting, spanning a period of five years. The most recent was a conditional discharge imposed by magistrates in June 2023. It bears noting that despite formal warnings and engagement offers by community liaison officers, the pattern of offending persisted. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. On several occasions, you declined referred support to begin debt counselling or addiction services. The present case exhibits the unfortunate reality that the existence of support pathways does not guarantee uptake, and some defendants persist in declining potentially helpful interventions. The case law on refusal of rehabilitation options is instructive. In R v. Nolan [2023] EWCA Crim 828, the Court of Appeal emphasised the impact of non-engagement on custody threshold analysis, affirming that wilful refusal to avail oneself of available services can justify a more stringent sentence. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. A psychiatric report authored by Dr Fiona Merriman, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was obtained pursuant to the court’s direction. Her assessment, dated 10 August 2025, concludes that you do not meet criteria for major mental illness but presents with elements suggestive of mild to moderate depressive symptoms exacerbated by financial and housing instability. Dr Merriman notes impulsivity traits and some degree of emotional dysregulation, but no indication of psychosis or cognitive impairment. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Additionally, the pre-sentence report submitted by the Probation Service highlights medium risk of reoffending and medium likelihood of harm, whilst recommending engagement with structured cognitive-behavioural programmes targeting impulsivity and financial management skills. The report also advocates for housing stability initiatives as a likely factor in reducing reoffending risk. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. Turning now to the sentencing considerations, it must be emphasised that your offending has had a tangible impact beyond mere loss of stock. There have been consequences for victims in the form of psychological distress and diminished workplace safety perceptions. This aligns with established principles that sentencing must reflect harm in the broad sense, including emotional and community effects. While your guilty plea is late in timing, it is nevertheless accepted and will attract some, though limited, reduction in sentence. The authorities and the court have long expressed concern about tactical delay in pleas, which tend to place strain on witness preparation and court time. The court is cognisant of the broader difficulties faced by the defendant — including precarious accommodation and unemployment — but remembers the observation made in R v. Crane [2015] EWCA Crim 902, that social and economic hardship do not exempt citizens from accountability where offending is concerned. In light of the above, I have requested a full pre-sentence report to assist in determining the most appropriate outcome, balancing the aims of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. It is expected that this report will canvass the viability of community-based orders incorporating rehabilitation activity, unpaid work, and monitoring. Where risk factors warrant, consideration should be given to a custodial term of appropriate length with a rehabilitation requirement attached, as permitted under the Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014. These sentencing remarks have been prepared and delivered on 17 September 2025 in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Eastchester. A formal transcript has been recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You, Mr H, are hereby reminded of your right to appeal this sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this instance. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON R v. MR H Case No. B2025/13459 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. L. CORMACK Filed: 3 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in connection with charges arising from repeated thefts from retail establishments. These offences, taken cumulatively, fall under the auspices of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, and span a time frame commencing in mid-2023 and concluding with your arrest earlier this year. The offending predominantly affected stores within the Brighton and Hove locality, extending, on occasion, to neighboring districts. Procedural and Investigative Background Your apprehension on 12 March 2025 followed an extensive period of investigation led by officers from the Sussex Police Property Crime Unit, operating in conjunction with the Brighton & Hove Retail Crime Partnership. This multi-agency collaboration promotes intelligence-sharing and victim liaison between law enforcement and commercial entities with a view to reducing acquisitive offences committed against local businesses. I note with approval the consistency of effort occasioned by this partnership, which stands as an exemplar relative to regions where communication between stakeholders is less reliable. The initial reports of retail theft implicated an unidentified male attending various premises on the city’s main shopping thoroughfare. Over a period of nearly eighteen months, numerous complaints—submitted by both independent outlets and regional subsidiaries—began to form an evidential mosaic. Given the modest value of individual goods, significant detective input was nonetheless directed toward connecting these isolated events and identifying a pattern of criminal conduct. This involved hours of manual analysis of CCTV footage, cross-referencing transactions, and securing witness statements under pressing resource constraints exacerbated by county-wide policing staff shortages, a factor of no small consequence to the efficient administration of justice. The investigative process involved cooperation between several civic departments, including city council licensing officers and the Sussex Community Safety Partnership. The cumulative expenditure of public funds, officer time, and ancillary forensic deployment should not be underestimated, reminding us that ostensibly “low-level” offences impose real costs. The Royal Borough of Sussex itself is currently grappling with escalating issues of street disorder and an increase in transient homelessness, which color the environment in which these offences took place. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. A formal interview under caution was conducted on 13 March 2025, during which you exercised your legal right to remain silent initially but subsequently engaged with the questioning. The police collected seizure items from your residence, including clothing and backpacks matching those captured on security camera footage. It bears mention that your earlier interactions with law enforcement include a conditional caution in 2021 for a similar offence, at which time referral to voluntary support organisations was suggested but not pursued. Your criminal record also comprises multiple prior convictions for minor thefts, none involving violence or threats, but reflecting a troubling pattern of repeated acquisitive behaviour resistant to prior interventions. The case management hearings were scheduled in adherence to the Better Case Management protocols, designed to reduce delay and support swift justice. The Crown’s application to consolidate multiple charges was granted, producing a single representative indictment for efficiency. The plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 10 June 2025, at which you entered a guilty plea. It is regrettable that the plea was not entered earlier; while full credit is not foregone, the court notes that remorse and acceptance of responsibility are better evidenced by early admissions. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. The Crown’s legal representative, Ms Philippa Durrant, conducted her submissions with due diligence and professionalism. Mr Samuel Reed, appearing on your behalf under a Legal Aid order, advanced mitigation emphasizing your current unstable housing status and underlying mental health considerations, aspects well documented in the court bundle. It is only fitting to express thanks to these barristers for their conscientious advocacy. The support staff and court officers at this venue have also performed admirably, notwithstanding recent refurbishments to the courtroom infrastructure which, while ultimately beneficial, caused inevitable disruption to scheduling and witness availability. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. As the court is well aware, section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the foundational statutory provision governing theft offences. Jurisprudence over the past half-century has solidified the interpretive contours of dishonesty, intent to permanently deprive, and appropriation. While theft is commonly perceived as a ‘victimless’ crime, this reflects a profound misconception. The impact on individual retail staff, shop owners, and the broader community can be substantial, both in terms of financial loss and the psychological toll engendered by repeat offending. The case of R v. Bradley [2017] EWCA Crim 2156 elucidates that repeated thefts from vulnerable small businesses may warrant custodial sentences despite low monetary value in individual transactions. Further elaboration was provided in the Court of Appeal decision R v. Grayson [2019] EWCA Crim 789, which held that persistence and calculated targeting of businesses, including pharmacies and independent grocers, increased the gravity of offences. Moreover, the Sentencing Council guidelines (theft offences) now emphasize that offences involving the exploitation of vulnerable workers or repeated victimisation of smaller, less resilient commercial premises constitute aggravating features. I remind counsel and the defendant alike that community-based sentencing options remain a central pillar of the criminal justice system; however, these are only appropriate where there is a realistic prospect of rehabilitation without compromising public protection. Reference must also be made, however tangential, to several relevant appellate authorities which, though not directly analogous, reinforce facets of sentencing jurisprudence regarding persistence, late guilty pleas, and the intersection of offending with mental health issues. For instance, in R v. Osman [2023] EWCA Crim 823, the Court considered the limits of reasonable accommodation when addressing offenders with impulse control disorders convicted of acquisitive offences. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. Turning to the probation service, I am mindful of the ongoing challenge they face in balancing comprehensive assessment with rising caseloads and limited resources. Nationally, reports indicate waiting times for community offender rehabilitation programmes have increased substantially, delaying access to vital services. Similar pressures apply within mental health services, where NHS waiting lists for adult psychiatric and psychological support stretch into months, a situation regrettably familiar to families and offenders alike. Your psychiatric report, submitted by Dr Anjali Sengupta, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, provides a measured evaluation of your mental health. Dr Sengupta notes a mild enduring depressive disorder and comorbid traits indicative of emotional dysregulation, compounded by sporadic substance misuse. The assessor expresses concern regarding your limited engagement with prescribed treatments and a tendency toward minimisation of risks, highlighting that this pattern may exacerbate reoffending risk if unchecked. I take note of the family letters entered into evidence on your behalf. Your sister, Ms Tara H, in a written statement dated 20 August 2025, describes your history of instability, aspiration for change, and contextual factors including loss of parental support during adolescence. The court accepts these factors are genuine and impactful but reiterates the fundamental principle that personal responsibility remains paramount. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. The victim impact statements from affected stores, coordinated by the Brighton Retail Support Network, underscore the lived experience of repeated theft. Staff report heightened anxiety, reduced job satisfaction, and in some instances, altered shift rotas and store layouts as coping mechanisms. While no direct threat or violence was perpetrated, the emotional and economic damage should not be discounted. It is noted that one victim business reported a cumulative shrinkage amount exceeding £1,200 over the relevant period, a significant loss for a small independent retailer. On the subject of victimology, it is salutary to recall the decision in R v. Furlong [2016] EWCA Crim 2108, where the court emphasised the importance of listening to victims’ voices in determining proportionality and public confidence in sentencing outcomes. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. The court also takes note of non-offence related matters that have, perhaps unusually, featured in the case file. For instance, a co-defendant unrelated to you, but involved in a separate shoplifting prosecution arising from similar timings and locations, failed to appear for trial and is currently sought by police. This unrelated procedural issue does not affect the present proceedings but underscores the challenges policing faces with transient offender cohorts. Additionally, the defendant’s former roommate, found to be in possession of illegal substances during an unrelated police search in late 2024, has been subject to separate proceedings. Such collateral details, while part of the broader narrative tapestry, must not distract from the individual’s own actions and culpability. Furthermore, the landlord of the property where you resided for much of the period under scrutiny was, during 2024, the subject of a noise abatement order issued by the city council. While of peripheral interest, this bears no material connection to the matters before us. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. Your case presents a complex constellation of risk factors. The absence of serious violence or use of force suggests a lower risk level, yet the frequency, planning, and persistence of the offending weigh against complacency. The Probation Service’s pre-sentence victim impact and risk assessment report, submitted jointly with Dr Sengupta’s clinical evaluation, recommend a medium-risk classification pending further engagement. Of significance is the non-engagement to date with available support services, despite multiple agency offers. This disengagement has included the refusal of referrals to the local Drug and Alcohol Recovery Service and a community-based mental health team, both of which stand ready to offer treatment and supervision aimed at reducing reoffending. The court is acutely aware that the space for effective intervention depends largely on the defendant’s cooperation. Absent that, community mechanisms lack force. It is especially regrettable given the manifold voluntary sector organisations in the Brighton area, such as the Sussex Outreach Initiative and the Community Reintegration Alliance, whose unheralded work supports client reintegration and addresses some of the more intractable drivers of acquisitive crime. It is also pertinent to mention the strain placed on the local retail sector by repeat shoplifting, which compounds the ongoing economic uncertainty following the pandemic years. Many small businesses operate on narrow margins, and losses such as those described in victim impact statements jeopardise employment, community vitality, and the informal social networks embedded in local commerce. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. The court acknowledges your stated difficulties with stable accommodation, which undoubtedly compound stress and may contribute to offending pathways. That said, the court must balance compassion with the necessity of reflecting the gravity of your actions and their impact on others. Delay in these proceedings due to the securing of funding from the Legal Aid Agency to instruct Dr Sengupta was protracted, resulting in a postponement of six weeks. This exemplifies systemic challenges faced by practitioners in preparing robust mitigation and comprehensive assessments, obstacles regrettably not uncommon in cases requiring forensic psychiatric input. Several hearings, scheduled initially without expert reports, involved adjournments as counsel awaited documentation. Whilst unavoidable, such delays impose a burden on all parties and highlight the need for reforms to streamline administrative authorisations. The offences admitted before the court are serious in their effect and reflect a disturbing persistence despite prior warnings and intervention opportunities. While no physical violence or threat was involved, the cumulative harm impacts victims’ wellbeing and undermines community trust. Mitigating factors include the absence of a significant criminal history beyond similar offences, your current health difficulties, and a guilty plea entered at the earliest practicable stage following disclosure of key evidence. After full consideration, I will order the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report to assist the court in determining an appropriate sentence. Such a report should include recommendations regarding your suitability for community orders incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements, the potential for cognitive behavioural programmes addressing acquisitive offending patterns, and accommodation support. Probation is also asked to assess the feasibility of integrating debt advice and employability support into any proposed order to address offending triggers effectively. I do not pre-judge the content but expect the report to address the issue of risk, community safety, and possibility of compliance comprehensively. The court reiterates its commitment to balancing the imperative of public protection with proportionality and fairness, all within the framework established by the Sentencing Council’s guidelines and relevant case law. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 3 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Brighton. Proceedings have been recorded pursuant to Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no current reporting restrictions enacted under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELMONT R v. MR H Case No. BLM2025/02875 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. K. Fenwick Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of theft, charged under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences in question consist of multiple opportunistic and repeated shoplifting incidents across several commercial establishments located primarily within the Belmont and Eaton districts. The offending period spans from early 2023 through to April 2025, involving goods predominantly retailing at modest values but cumulatively significant in the impact upon the stores and communities affected. Procedural Background You were apprehended on 22 April 2025 after an intensive, multi-agency inquiry led by Belmont Police’s Economic Crime Unit, working in concert with the Retail Crime Prevention Partnership and supplemented by expert digital analysts from the Midlands Regional Forensic Service. The investigation was precipitated by a discernible pattern of thefts associated with a distinctive physical appearance and behavioural profile repeatedly captured on closed-circuit television and through detailed staff reports from various retail locations. The resources mobilised for this inquiry were substantial, involving surveillance operations, multiple witness interviews, and forensic analysis of recovered property. Such an endeavour reflects the significant administrative and financial burdens intrinsic to pursuing low-level acquisitive crime at scale. It is pertinent to record that the court acknowledges the ongoing strain upon public services occasioned by such investigations. Police forces nationwide, including Belmont, report escalating demands on Economic Crime Units, which must balance their attention between these resource-draining matters and the pressing challenge of more serious offences, such as violent crime and organised criminality. Moreover, the Retail Crime Prevention Partnership, despite operating with a modest team and shrinking budgets, has demonstrated commendable persistence in collating intelligence, facilitating victim statements, and fostering communication between affected businesses and law enforcement. The administrative journey of this matter has not been without complication. Initial listings were deferred due to adjournments arising from defence applications for expert psychiatric assessment funding, which, as is too often the case, encountered protracted delays in approval from the Legal Aid Authority. These delays, spanning a period of six weeks, impeded the timely progression of the case. The court reiterates its concern regarding the systemic inefficiencies of that body, which impose unnecessary obstacles to defendants’ access to expert guidance and therefore, indirectly, to the efficient administration of justice. A plea and trial preparation hearing was set down for 10 July 2025; at this time, you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequent to the disclosure of further statements, video material, and forensic evidence, you altered your position and tendered a guilty plea on 24 August 2025, the date upon which this court now proceeds to sentencing. The late nature of your admission is, regrettably, reflective of a trend seen in a substantial volume of comparable cases. Whilst the law rightly permits defendants the opportunity to test the evidence, the court must suitably weigh the timing of pleas when considering reductions. As was stated in R v. Thompson [2023] EWCA Crim 765, the Court of Appeal confirmed that “the discount afforded for a guilty plea is a matter for the judge, informed by the plea’s promptness and sincerity.” Your plea, entered only shortly before the sentencing hearing, attracts less generous consideration. In understanding the framework within which sentencing is to be undertaken, reference is hereby made to the Sentencing Council Guideline on Theft Offences (published 2019, latest update 2024), which instructs the court to consider the offending’s nature, the degree of planning or sophistication, the harm—both economic and psychological—and any mitigating features such as remorse or personal circumstances. While your offences were non-violent, the guideline acknowledges the cumulative toll that persistent shoplifting exacts on victims, staff morale, and local business viability. Additionally, the court recalls the observations made in R v. Marlow [2020] EWCA Crim 1623 wherein the Court accentuated that repeated thefts from vulnerable retailers, including small independent shops and pharmacies, often generate a distinctive pattern of harm notwithstanding the modest value of each individual theft. The aggregate effect is to create apprehension among staff and, at times, a tangible contraction of service provision. Similar sentiments were expressed in R v. Yates [2021] EWCA Crim 927, reinforcing the principle that sentences should be commensurate not solely with monetary loss but with the broader social ramifications. Although these authorities involve different factual matrices, their underlying principles provide helpful guidance. It is also of note that the Better Case Management (BCM) Protocol was engaged in this matter from an early stage. The procedural intends of BCM—to optimise timetables, disclosure, and resource allocation—were adhered to earnestly by the parties, with listings conducted within prescribed windows save for delays attributable to expert report procurement and pandemic-related court capacity limitations. The court is mindful of the persistent challenges confronting the judicial system, including the effects of ongoing staff shortages among court clerks and ushers, which have, on occasion, delayed the commencement of proceedings and the availability of courtrooms equipped with appropriate technological support for video evidence playback. Aside from the core criminal proceedings, the court has received written representations from several support agencies, including the Belmont Foodbank Partnership and the Southside Voluntary Resource Centre, both of which have outlined the limited but meaningful engagement efforts extended to you over the past twelve months. They report your sporadic attendance at drop-in sessions, inconsistent uptake of advisory services for budgeting and mental wellbeing, and the challenges faced by frontline workers in establishing sustained contact. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. While the immediate offence constitutes the primary focus, it is incumbent on the court to consider contextual elements beyond the bare facts. The patterns of shoplifting seen in recent years often intersect with broader societal issues, including housing insecurity, escalating cost of living, and evolving local retail landscapes that have seen a diminution of staffing levels, shortened operating hours, and the installation of automated self-service tills. All these factors, while peripheral to the instant matter, serve to illustrate the environment within which conduct such as yours arises. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. Regarding co-defendant involvement, the court is tasked solely with adjudicating your own culpability. It is noted in passing that a co-defendant in a connected matter remains at large following a failure to appear at previous listings and is under active investigation. The presence of co-defendants does not mitigate your conduct but does reflect the complex social networks that can underpin acquisitive crime in certain sectors. The victim impact statements received from managers and retail staff have been candid and measured. One particular store manager noted that repeated thefts had led to adjustments in staffing rotas, with some employees requesting transfers or reduction in hours due to anxiety related to encounters with offenders. Another commented on the emotional labour expended in remaining vigilant and maintaining customer service standards amid the threat of theft and occasional verbal abuse. Such effects, while intangible, are no less real. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. Turning to expert evidence, Dr Marianne Giles, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, produced a thorough report dated 1 September 2025, including the results of psychometric assessments and clinical interviews conducted over two sessions. Dr Giles’ conclusion was that you present with no diagnosable major psychiatric disorder but exhibit traits indicative of impulse control difficulties, low frustration tolerance, and mild substance misuse, principally alcohol dependence noted as intermittent but problematic. These features, combined with a stable but fragile social network, may contribute to a heightened risk of recidivism absent intervention. The absence of a severe mental illness aligns with probation reports from Ms Caroline Reid, Principal Probation Officer, who notes your limited engagement with voluntary sector programs and reluctance to embrace support designed to address offending behaviour, such as cognitive skills workshops and financial advice clinics. While Ms Reid acknowledges systemic challenges—including heavy caseloads and limited resources in the residential support sector—she emphasises that your case particularly illustrates the frustration encountered when potential rehabilitative mechanisms are underutilised or resisted. It is a compelling admonition that services, however well-intentioned, rely fundamentally upon recipient cooperation. Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. The court has also considered precedent set in the recent appellate decisions of R v. Bellamy [2024] EWCA Crim 322, involving a defendant convicted of repeated theft from a supermarket chain, and R v. Jacobs [2023] EWCA Crim 1640, addressing similar repeated shoplifting offences committed in close proximity to protected housing for vulnerable adults. Both cases emphasised deterrence, particularly recognising the cumulative economic impact and psychological harm associated with such offending patterns, even where physical violence was absent and property value low. In parallel, it is instructive to acknowledge the implications of R v. Sham [2021] EWCA Crim 1185, concerning a defendant convicted of disparagement and criminal damage at a charity shop, where differential application of sentencing principles highlighted how the context of offending — and associated public interest — bears heavily on outcome severity. The justices in Sham underscored that offences against smaller community-oriented businesses may attract enhanced scrutiny, reflecting their limited capacity to absorb financial loss. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. From a statistical perspective, crime data provided by the Belmont Metropolitan Illustrative Crime Panel reflects a persistently elevated incidence of low-level retail theft over the past five years. These offences have risen by 12% since 2020, a phenomenon partly attributed to changing economic conditions, including welfare reforms that have disproportionately affected urban centres. The socio-economic context is germane but cannot excuse individual accountability. It is appropriate too to reflect upon the evolution of the Theft Act 1968, as initially enacted, and subsequent legislative refinements, including the Theft (Amendment) Act 1996 and other statutory instruments modifying sentencing powers. This framework balances the protection of property rights with proportionality in penalty, a principle fundamental to the rule of law. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. An ancillary consideration is the effect of your offending on public perceptions of safety and commerce in the affected locales. Anecdotal evidence, including commentary recorded by community policing officers, indicates a degree of wariness among residents and business proprietors. The normalization of petty theft can, over time, erode trust and undercut the willingness of citizens to invest in local trade. The court has also duly noted your personal circumstances: you are 34 years of age, with a previous record containing multiple convictions for similar offences, including cautionary disposals and a community order imposed in 2021. You have experienced periods of homelessness, currently residing in temporary accommodation provided by the Belmont Housing Partnership. Family support is reportedly limited, though letters received from a sibling and an aunt express hope for your rehabilitation and stress your longstanding struggles with employment and addiction. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Procedure has required the court also to consider victim’s cohabitants and collateral witnesses, some of whom have submitted statements reflecting indirect impacts, though these are not prima facie linked to your conduct. One such correspondent — the flatmate of a shop manager — made complaints regarding noise disturbances unrelated to the offences before the court. This material, while noted, carries no evidentiary weight in regard to sentencing. Furthermore, digital forensic investigators involved in the case have remarked on the increasing workload imposed by extracting usable evidence from automated check-out systems, the data logs of which are frequently incomplete or corrupted by system errors. These operational challenges further complicate prosecutions in theft matters, adding hidden layers of complexity to seemingly straightforward offences. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. Turning finally to submissions made by counsel, the Crown prosecutor has emphasised the need for deterrence, highlighting the established pattern of offending despite prior community-based interventions, and the inadequacy of previous sentences to effect change. The prosecution submits that custodial sentences, coupled with rehabilitative requirements, would better protect the public. Defence counsel has urged the court to consider your personal difficulties, late plea, and the absence of physical harm or threats in mitigation. Additionally, reliance has been placed upon the psychiatric assessment’s findings and community support letters advocating for a community order featuring structured treatment and monitoring. The defence argues that engagement with suitable rehabilitation programs would materially reduce the risk of reoffending. It is worth reflecting upon the persistent difficulties confronting the public sector in securing meaningful interventions for individuals caught in cycles of acquisitive offending. Probation services, social care providers, and mental health services alike report insufficient capacity, exacerbated by funding cuts and increased demand. This systemic challenge, while not excusing individual culpability, frames the wider context of your case. As a matter of judicial observation, there have been advances in integrated offender management schemes that combine criminal justice oversight with health and social support, yet practical implementation remains variable across territories. For your part, engagement with such services has been intermittent. The court, having taken comprehensive account of all evidence, reports, and submissions, remains cognisant of the need to impose a sentence that strikes a balance between public protection, individual rehabilitation, and the wider interests of justice. I hereby order the preparation of a pre-sentence report, instructing probation officers to assess the viability of a custodial sentence suspended in whole or in part, alongside targeted Community Rehabilitation Programmes encompassing cognitive skills training, substance misuse interventions, and social reintegration strategies. I further direct the report to consider the potential utility of restorative justice processes, where feasible, and to make recommendations in respect of curfew requirements or electronically monitored home detention, dependent on your circumstances. These sentencing remarks are pronounced this 14th day of September 2025 in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Belmont. The record complies with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. T2025/13845 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. HAWTHORNE Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence arising from charges concerning acquisitive offending contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending consists of a series of thefts from various retail outlets within the greater Bristol environs over an intermittent period spanning from late 2023 through to early 2025. This conduct has engaged the attention of multiple investigative agencies and community safeguarding entities, given the cumulative impact on local businesses and the wider public realm. Procedural History and Case Progression Your arrest occurred on 18 February 2025, following an extensive, multifaceted inquiry initiated by the Bristol City Police Crime Unit. This unit, in conjunction with the West of England Business Crime Partnership and the Avon and Somerset Community Safety Team, orchestrated a targeted response to a discernible spike in retail thefts in the city centre and adjacent neighbourhoods. These efforts were buttressed by intelligence-sharing protocols consistent with the Crime Reduction Partnership’s operational framework, engaging both public and private stakeholders to collate evidence. It is important to recognise that the investigation was neither trivial nor perfunctory. It was characterised by a coordinated, labour-intensive approach involving hours of forensic analysis of CCTV footage, multiple witness interviews, and cross-referencing of retail stock losses. The burden placed upon overstretched police resources should not be underplayed. In recent years, there has been a documented increase in the allocation of personnel to ‘volume crime’ categories like shop theft, reflecting their deleterious impact on community well-being and commercial viability. Such deployment inevitably diverts finite investigative capacity from offences of greater inherent danger, yet it remains justified given the cascading effects of acquisitive crime on local economies and victim confidence. Of particular note, the investigative phase was periodically hampered by procedural matters. Listing constraints at the Bristol Crown Court, compounding staffing shortages within the clerking office, occasioned delays in progression. These administrative impediments reflect a national trend, as courts across the jurisdiction contend with rising caseloads and resource reductions, a phenomenon explored in the 2025 report by the Sentencing Council on court efficiency. As lamentable as these delays may be, they do not mitigate the seriousness of the allegations with which you are confronted but serve as a reminder of the operational context within which the justice system currently functions. Further, there was a notable delay occasioned by the withdrawal and subsequent re-application for Legal Aid funding to instruct an independent psychiatric expert. This process extended over some six weeks, occasioning an adjournment of the initial plea hearing set for 4 May 2025. The Representations Team at the Legal Aid Agency cited a requirement for enhanced justification amid budgetary constraint pressures, an illustration of the systemic challenges that legal practitioners currently face in safeguarding defendants’ rights to expert opinion. These systemic issues have been raised in submissions before this court, including in the interlocutory decision of R v Cartwright [2024] EWCA Crim 768, which affirmed that no undue procedural obstacles may be permitted to delay fair trial rights. It is regrettable that such issues continue to beset case progression. The plea and trial preparation hearing eventually took place on 22 June 2025, at which time you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequent to this, upon further disclosure and the presentation of additional surveillance evidence by the Crown, your position changed and you tendered a guilty plea on 12 September 2025. This timing is pertinent to sentencing credit considerations, which will be addressed shortly. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. Issues of public perceptions regarding acquisitive crime are well-documented in the criminological literature and judicial commentary. The court is mindful of the work of Professor Amanda Blake of the University of Manchester, whose empirical studies indicate that repeat shoplifting exerts a disproportionate impact on staff morale and local retail economies, often precipitating staff attrition and increased insurance premiums. The harms are cumulative, and although each individual act may appear minor in isolation, their serial nature produces broader public consequences. The victim impact statements tendered herein reveal the significant psychological toll borne by shop employees, many of whom are young and relatively inexperienced in frontline service positions. Staff recount episodes of anxiety when working alone, alterations to shift patterns to avoid contact with the defendant, and a pervasive sense of insecurity during working hours. These impacts are consistent with findings within the 2024 report from the Retail Workers’ Health Alliance, which underscores the vulnerability and mental health strain experienced by those working in acquiring environments subject to frequent theft and attendant disruptions. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. In an unrelated but instructive vein, the court recalls the judgment in R v. Coyne [2019] EWCA Crim 1437. That case involved a defendant whose pattern of repeat shoplifting extended over eighteen months and included episodes of aggressive behaviour towards retail staff. Although Mr Coyne’s offending was distinguished by the addition of violence, the custodial outcome emphasised the necessity of deterrence in persistent dishonesty offences. While the facts here do not suggest violence, the persistent nature of the offending similarly militates for an appropriately calibrated sentence. The court also acknowledges the judgment of R v. Denson [2023] EWCA Crim 1149, which considered the implications of mental health factors in sentencing for acquisitive offending. The Court of Appeal there affirmed that mental disorder, while potentially a mitigating factor, does not ipso facto justify non-custodial sanctions where offending remains deliberate and calculated—particularly when public confidence demands a firm response. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. Dr Jamal Ahmed, consultant forensic psychiatrist, authored a detailed clinical assessment pursuant to a remand in custody, supplemented by interviews and review of past medical records which included prior presentations for anxiety and episodic low mood. Dr Ahmed’s report, dated 5 September 2025, concluded that you present no enduring psychiatric disorder necessitating in-patient hospitalisation or secure care. Rather, your psychological profile is consistent with mild to moderate depressive symptomatology coupled with features of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. Dr Ahmed further highlighted your acknowledged history of polysubstance misuse, primarily involving occasional alcohol and cannabis, though these behaviours were reported to have reduced markedly during recent custodial periods. The report underscores a fluctuating engagement with community mental health services, characterised by missed appointments and inconsistent adherence to prescribed therapeutic regimens. The Probation Service pre-sentence report, prepared by Officer Lucy Cartwright and dated 2 October 2025, provides a comprehensive outline of your personal circumstances, including current accommodation arrangements in hostel accommodation provided under local authority auspices. Ms Cartwright reports limited positive engagement with rehabilitative programmes to date, citing your reluctance to participate in structured group work or one-to-one interventions. The report also reflects upon your limited employment history and lack of stable income, noting vulnerability to social exclusion and isolation. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. Regarding risk of reoffending, the Probation Officer utilises the Offender Assessment System (OASys), which classifies your risk as medium for both general and acquisitive crime categories, given your prior convictions and pattern of offending. The report recommends targeted cognitive-behavioural interventions to address impulsivity and improve decision-making skills, alongside practical support for housing stability and employability training. It is necessary to observe with some concern that your apparent failure to consistently avail yourself of available support services echoes a recurrent pattern within caseloads managed by the Probation Service. This inclination towards non-engagement presents practical challenges for effective rehabilitation and risk management, underscoring the importance of judicial intervention to impose conditions that promote adherence. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. The investigation drew upon a constellation of evidence. CCTV footage, collected from several retail premises including local supermarkets and convenience stores, were reviewed by the Avon and Somerset Forensic Imaging Unit. The unit’s analysis, supported by sworn statements from retail loss prevention officers, established your presence at the scene of multiple thefts with combined stock losses totalling in excess of £2,400. A noteworthy feature of the investigation was the reliance on advanced image enhancement technologies, which permitted finer identification of the defendant’s distinctive gait, clothing, and carry items despite suboptimal camera angles. Such forensic advancements have transformed the evidentiary landscape in retail crime, a fact recognised in the 2023 Home Office report on technological integration in policing. Also pertinent were intercepted communications between you and third parties advocating for the sale or exchange of allegedly stolen goods, an aspect considered by the Crown in reaching a decision on the scale and intensity of the charges brought. While these messages do not implicate any individuals beyond yourself, they do suggest an element of sophistication and planning inconsistent with impulsive petty larceny. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. The court must address, briefly, matters raised in defense submissions regarding the possible presence of coercion or duress. No compelling evidence was brought forward to substantiate these claims. Neither were there credible links proposed between yourself and organised criminal groups in the area, a matter of some importance given the frequent conflation in media narratives of shoplifting with organised retail crime. The court is clear that you acted independently and without external compulsion. It is also recalled that one co-defendant, Mr James Tallis, is subject to separate proceedings arising from offences of criminal damage and affray committed during a disturbance near one of the shopping precincts. That matter bears no direct relation to your conduct but serves as a backdrop to the wider investigative sweep conducted in the locality. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. The court notes, with continuing disquiet, the well-documented struggles defendants face in securing legal aid funding for expert psychiatric reports, as well as funding for specialised defence advocates. Your legal team has diligently represented your interests throughout, with Mr Stephen Broad appearing on your behalf as a thankfully skilled and conscientious advocate. Instances of delay attributable to repeated clarifications sought by the Legal Aid Agency, coupled with burdensome administrative processes, place significant strain on defence teams and inevitably impact your right to expeditious justice. The court urges relevant authorities to continue efforts to streamline and humanise such procedural requirements, consistent with the observations made in the Independent Review of Legal Aid published earlier this year. The Retail Support Association submitted a statement detailing increased anxieties within the sector and noting that repeated shoplifting incidents have led to increased operational costs, including the employment of additional security measures and loss prevention staff. This burden is frequently passed on to consumers and contributes to the erosion of trust between local businesses and their clientele. Community safety teams report an upsurge in calls regarding antisocial behaviour rivalled only by wider concerns over street homelessness and rough sleeping, which has risen notably in Bristol’s city core. The intersection of these social phenomena complicates efforts to implement storage and loss prevention strategies within retail outlets, leading to tensions between business owners and vulnerable populations. The court is aware that collaborative multi-agency working is tasked with grappling with these complexities, although outcomes are often undermined by resource shortfalls and policy ambiguity. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. As set forth in statute and elucidated within the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences 2021, sentencing must strike a balance among the seriousness of the offending, the culpability of the offender, and personal mitigation. The court must consider the financial loss, any vulnerability or harm caused, your antecedents, and the prospects for rehabilitation. Credit for your guilty plea will be tempered by its late entry. The principle articulated in R v. Fowke [2020] EWCA Crim 876 instructs that a plea entered at an advanced stage, especially following protracted contestation and preparatory proceedings, warrants reduced discount to reflect the limited benefit obtained in terms of trial management and witness expense. Your plea on 12 September 2025, after multiple hearings and disclosure rounds, qualifies in this respect. It remains important to consider your personal circumstances, including your housing instability, mental health profile as discussed, and expressed willingness to engage in rehabilitative work, albeit belatedly. The court must weigh carefully the necessity of both punishment and rehabilitation, the latter being pivotal to reducing the risk of reoffending and enhancing community safety. Notably, the court acknowledges the challenging social milieu you inhabit, including limited access to stable employment opportunities, protracted waits for social housing, and the broader impacts of socioeconomic deprivation. Courts have increasingly recognised the role that such factors play in shaping offending patterns, as highlighted in the academic and judicial discourse, including the recent lecture delivered by Lord Justice Hayward on sentencing equity. Nonetheless, individual responsibility remains paramount. Prior conduct, including four convictions for shoplifting, informs the court’s understanding of your maturity and the repeated failure to desist despite prior interventions. This represents a significant aggravating element. The authority of R v. Kendall [2018] EWCA Crim 1892 reiterates that persistent offending in spite of warnings and community measures evidences a higher degree of culpability and warrants sentences of increased severity. In light of the foregoing, I direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report with a focus on achievable community interventions and the possible imposition of a custodial sentence with conditions oriented towards your rehabilitation and public safety. The report should explore the feasibility of cognitive-behavioural treatment programmes, plus accommodation support including referral to housing liaison officers. I shall take no further step to final sentence today. The matter will be listed for sentence on 3 December 2025, to afford the probation service the requisite time to produce its report and for all interested parties, including your legal representatives, to make representations. These sentencing remarks are issued this 14th day of October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record will be notified to the relevant agencies. You are reminded of your right of appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply at this stage. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIDGEWATER R v. MR H Case No. BW2025/15834 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. MORGAN Filed: 11 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in relation to a charge alleging theft from retail premises, specifically a course of conduct characterised by shoplifting offences over an extended period. The offending behaviour, said to have taken place between mid-2023 and early 2025, includes multiple incidents across various retail establishments within the jurisdictions of Bridgewater and neighbouring urban boroughs. These offences, although individually relatively low value, have collectively attracted the attention of law enforcement, retail security operatives, and multi-agency partners, culminating in your prosecution under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. Procedural History The origins of this case can be traced back to several reports submitted by shopkeepers associated with the Bridgewater Business Crime Reduction Scheme, an initiative designed to coordinate crime prevention in retail environments, particularly focusing on repeat and organised acquisition offences. The scheme’s operational effectiveness depends heavily on data-sharing between retailers, police, and local authority teams, and although it is not without strain under increasing case loads and staffing shortages, it provided the initial impetus for investigation in your matter. Following a number of reported thefts involving suspicious activity by a person matching your description, officers commenced an enquiry which included reviewing CCTV footage, conducting asset loss surveys, and interviewing staff. The investigation was hampered at points by sporadic witness availability and the intermittent absence of relevant footage due to technical faults or camera coverage gaps, a common challenge in retail crime investigations, as previously noted in R v. Dorman [2015] EWCA Crim 2312 concerning evidential difficulties in low-level acquisitive offences. Your arrest was effected on 18 February 2025, subsequent to a warrant authorising a search of your residential address and the seizure of items potentially connected to the offences. The police operation, supported by multi-agency coordination including the Retail Crime Intelligence Unit, was notable for the deployment of recent technological measures, including facial recognition software subject to strict data protection constraints. It goes without saying that the use of such technology must be conducted with the utmost safeguards to preserve individual liberties, as emphasised in the guidance contained within the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice (Home Office, 2013). The initial charge was presented to the Magistrates’ Court on 25 February 2025, and this case was sent to the Crown Court for its sentencing jurisdiction as the aggregate value and seriousness of the offending exceeded summary thresholds. Plea and trial preparation hearings were scheduled in line with the Criminal Procedure Rules and Better Case Management (BCM) frameworks, which seek to ensure efficient case progression while maintaining fairness to all parties. These hearings took place without remarkable incident on 15 April and 7 May respectively, with the final plea entered on 1 June 2025. You now stand convicted, following your late guilty plea. It is unfortunate, but not uncommon, that pleas in such cases often come delayed. The factors influencing this include the defendant’s assessment of evidential strengths, advice from counsel, and, occasionally, procedural tactics. The court is aware of the impact such timing has on victims, witnesses, and resource allocation, as articulated in R v. Bennett [2022] EWCA Crim 1487, which instructs a cautious approach to credit reduction in cases of last-minute admissions of guilt. The Crown has been represented throughout by Ms Clare Barton, whose professionalism and dedication in presenting the case are acknowledged. Similarly, Mr Simon Caldwell has represented you for the defence, operating under a Legal Aid order. I must take this opportunity to register my concern regarding the recurrent administrative delays in funding forensic expert instructions—a matter that has impeded the timely preparation of mitigation and has been the subject of correspondence to the Legal Aid Agency on multiple occasions. It is also pertinent to mention that the court received several letters of support on your behalf, including communications from community outreach coordinators affiliated with Bridgewater Local Care, a charity addressing homelessness and substance misuse. The letters commend your expressed willingness to engage with support services, yet also highlight ongoing challenges in consistently accessing stable accommodation and mental health resources. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. While it is commonplace to observe that societal factors—including economic precarity and housing insecurity—may underpin offending behaviour of this nature, it remains vital to delineate context from excuse. The justice system must balance compassion with accountability. In considering this, I reflect on the observations of the Court of Appeal in R v. Ellwood [2019] EWCA Crim 2846, where the defendant, suffering from documented addiction issues, nonetheless received a custodial sentence for repeat shoplifting to deliver a message underscoring the protective interests of the community and the imperative of deterrence. The administrative burden imposed upon local policing and ancillary agencies in detecting, processing, and prosecuting offences of this kind cannot be overstated. Resources diverted to low-level acquisitive crime invariably reduce capacity to address more serious offences, a point made in recent National Policing Strategic Assessments. Bridgewater Police reported staffing shortfalls of over 15% in neighbourhood units during 2024, affecting proactive case development and victim engagement. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. This is regrettable, for it is precisely such detailed investigative activity that closes gaps for offenders whose persistent behaviour may otherwise go unchecked in the community. I have considered with care the detailed psychiatric report prepared by Dr Hannah Price, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, dated 22 August 2025, along with the Probation Service's pre-sentence assessment completed on 30 August 2025. Dr Price’s analysis notes that while you do not meet diagnostic criteria for any major psychiatric disorder, there were notable observations regarding anxiety and situational depression, coupled with a history of episodic substance misuse, mainly involving prescribed benzodiazepines and occasional alcohol excess. The report expresses a guarded optimism about your rehabilitative capacity, contingent on sustained engagement with clinical and social support services. It also identifies impulsivity and poor coping strategies as contributory to your offending pattern. Dr Price is explicit in cautioning that relapse risk remains elevated absent consistent intervention. Such professional evaluations are invaluable in constructing a response that addresses both individual needs and public protection imperatives, reflecting the standards set by the Sentencing Council in its guidance on offenders with mental health vulnerabilities. The probation report offers a considered narrative of your circumstances, including family history, educational background, and the absence of stable employment in recent years. It underscores previous engagement with diversionary schemes which, regrettably, were not completed or adhered to. The Probation Officer emphasises the practical challenges imposed by residential instability and the attendant risks of social exclusion and reoffending. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. In formulating its recommendations, probation suggests consideration be given to a Community Order incorporating a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, with the potential addition of unpaid work to facilitate both reparation and skill development. The officer also flags the lack of a current tenancy agreement, raising concerns about the increased risk of homelessness and its attendant destabilising effect on rehabilitation prospects. The pressures on local housing services, with waiting lists extending beyond 18 months in Bridgewater, compound this challenge. Of course, the court is mindful that rehabilitation alone does not encompass the totality of sentencing objectives. Deterrence, both individual and general, remains paramount, especially in offences that impact community wellbeing and business confidence. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. Further, the court recognizes the cumulative impact that even low-value thefts can exert upon retail staff, particularly those in smaller establishments where shrinkage presents a significant threat to business viability. Victim impact statements underscore the psychological strain on employees tasked with repeated monitoring duties and the disruption to workplace routines caused by your conduct. The judicial framework for sentencing is clear. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 provides the foundational statutory context, while the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences issued in 2023 establishes an appropriate matrix for assessing culpability and harm. The guidelines enjoin courts to weigh factors such as the nature of the property stolen, whether the offending was pre-meditated or opportunistic, the presence or absence of aggravating conduct, and any previous relevant convictions. The guideline’s emphasis on proportionate and measured sentencing aims to balance community confidence with the prospects for offender rehabilitation. In approaching your case, the court has sought to follow this legal framework while also applying the principles articulated in leading authorities such as R v. Sharp [2021] EWCA Crim 1127 and R v. Golding [2022] EWCA Crim 601, each reinforcing the gravity of persistent dishonesty offences and the need for sentencing to reflect their cumulative seriousness. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. It is necessary to note, crucially, that you have previous convictions for shoplifting dating back some six years, albeit none recent within the last two years prior to the current offences. That historical record neither militates for undue leniency nor inexorable severity, but is a material consideration within the overall sentencing calculus. The court is cognisant that reoffending patterns may point to ingrained behavioural traits or external pressures but remain subject to judicial scrutiny. I should add that this court is all too familiar with the deepening pressures upon legal aid funding frameworks. The delays in commissioning reports and expert opinions in this case, attributable in part to shifting administrative guidelines and resource constraints, serve as an unwelcome reminder of systemic vulnerabilities within the justice system. Regrettably, such delays inevitably impede the timely and effective administration of justice. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. The court also notes correspondence received from Bridgewater Retailers’ Association, which details the financial and operational impact of theft on local merchants. While the representations stress the challenges posed by resource limitations in staff training and security investments, they nonetheless articulate a firm stance on the expectation of meaningful, proportionate legal consequences for offenders. The sentiments expressed echo wider societal concerns regarding trust in public institutions to deliver justice effectively. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. You have, through your legal representative, conveyed remorse and an expressed willingness to engage with rehabilitative schemes, although prior opportunities in this regard have not been sustained. Recognising the sincerity of your current stance will form part of the court’s consideration at sentencing. Let it be observed that the contextual setting of this offending is not isolated from wider social phenomena. The courts and involved agencies operate against a backdrop of increasing societal challenges, including rising levels of street homelessness, public health crises related to substance misuse, and changes in the economic landscape affecting low-income populations disproportionately. These factors complicate but do not negate individual accountability. There are also persistent difficulties relating to the recruitment, retention, and training of probation officers nationwide, a matter discussed in recent Parliamentary Justice Committee reports. These systemic pressures influence service delivery and highlight the importance of tailoring sentencing outcomes to available support mechanisms. In accordance with established principles, I shall defer definitive sentence pending the receipt of any final submissions and to allow probation time to consider further whether community-based interventions may be appropriate and viable in your circumstances. It is hoped that such a course may yield benefits both in terms of your rehabilitation and community safety, consistent with the rehabilitative and deterrent objectives of sentencing law, as reiterated in R v. Willis [2023] EWCA Crim 338. I record the court’s thanks to all those who have assisted in the preparation of reports, including Dr Price and Probation Officer Ms Janet Lewis, as well as to Bridgewater Law Centre for their diligent prosecution and defence advocacy throughout. The court also acknowledges the efforts of local voluntary agencies working to support persons at risk of reoffending and the victims of acquisitive crime alike. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 11 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bridgewater. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal conviction and sentence record shall be duly conveyed to the appropriate authorities. You are reminded of your statutory right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTFORD R v. MR H Case No. H2025/13592 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge V. L. REYNOLDS Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a representative count encompassing a series of thefts committed at retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This charge represents a course of conduct characterised by repeated shoplifting offences spanning a period from October 2023 through to May 2025, primarily affecting stores situated within Hartford and adjoining boroughs. Procedural and Investigative Context Your arrest took place on 29 May 2025 after an intelligence-driven operation precipitated by concerned retailers and patrolling officers from the Hartford Police Service. It was necessitated by a spate of incidents involving the removal of goods without payment, causing steady economic and psychological distress to business owners and staff. While such offences might, in isolation, be perceived as trifling or routine, the cumulative disruption is anything but. The investigative sequence required meticulous collation of surveillance data, comprehensive interviews with victims, and several field inquiries spanning multiple administrative divisions, making clear the weighty drain on police and partner agency resources. Alongside the police, the Hartford Retail and Business Crime Partnership contributed significantly by providing detailed incident logs, assisting with identification procedures, and facilitating witness statements. It is worth noting that during the investigation phase, legal representatives for the defendant moved frequently to challenge procedural issues relating to the handling of CCTV evidence, which impacted the timeframes for case preparation. Such challenges, while within procedural rights, unfortunately compounded delays. It is also pertinent to acknowledge the strain this investigation placed on the circuit’s digital forensic team. Recent internal reports to Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) have identified forensic backlogs as a growing concern nationally, with theft and property crime cases often deprioritised in favour of those involving violence or public threat. This case, despite the “low-level” nature commonly ascribed to shoplifting, was escalated for forensic attention given the persistence of the defendant’s conduct. At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 20 August 2025, you entered a not guilty plea. The defence cited lack of direct evidence linking you personally to some incidents and raised issues relating to the admissibility of certain exhibits. However, on the morning of trial, following receipt of last-minute itemised stock loss reports and further video footage provided by an expert retained by the prosecution, your plea was changed to guilty. This was notably a late plea, given the duration of proceedings and preparation expended. While the court respects your decision, late guilty pleas in theft cases such as this significantly impact witness welfare and court resource allocation. In R v. Delaney [2020] EWCA Crim 378, the Court of Appeal observed that “the timing of the guilty plea, as well as its existence, weighs heavily in the exercise of sentencing discretion.” The rationale is to incentivise early acceptance of responsibility, thereby sparing victims and witnesses the burden of trial attendance, and facilitating swifter justice. References to authority such as R v. Al-Khalisi [2018] EWCA Crim 1123 remain instructive. There the Court stressed that contextual factors – including the nature of the offence, the defendant’s record, and plea timing – must converge to direct proportional sentencing outcomes. While the facts differ, it serves as foundation for the principles applied here. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. It has not escaped this court’s attention that repeated acquisitive offending, even at modest individual value, constitutes a concerning phenomenon within modern urban environments. Several commentators, including the Home Office’s Crime in England and Wales Survey reports between 2019 and 2024, highlight a trend towards proliferation of repeat shoplifting amongst vulnerable cohorts—often linked with economic precarity, substance dependency, or mental health instability. The Business Crime Reduction Forum, operating across multiple metropolitan areas, has explored mechanisms for multi-agency collaboration to tackle such matters. They have identified systemic challenges, including variations in data-sharing protocols, resource allocation discrepancies, and the necessity of cross-sector partnership working, encompassing police, local authorities, probation, and victim support bodies. The court also notes with appreciation the community counselling programme 'Safe Steps,' which, whilst not engaged directly in your case, has submitted written observations on the deleterious impacts of small-scale theft on local independent retailers. Their documentation emphasizes the erosion of trust between business and community and resultant operational adjustments such as staff rota constraints and increased security expenditure—costs ultimately borne by consumers and taxpayers alike. It might be considered tangential yet illustrative to reference the approach taken in R v. Finch [2019] EWCA Crim 1058, concerning aggravated burglary with a flank of violence against an elderly victim, where the preservation of social fabric and deterrence featured centrally in judgment. I note that whilst Finch’s circumstances and sentencing demands differ greatly from shoplifting, the overarching principle of safeguarding community cohesion and ensuring victim reassurance transcends offence type. The court is conscious that the locality within which these offences occurred faces complex socio-economic pressures, notably a sharp rise in temporary accommodation placements for those rendered homeless and a pronounced increase in non-violent acquisitive crime reports. The local police force has emphasised the disproportionate effect of persistent petty theft on resource-deprived frontline teams, particularly amidst recruitment and retention challenges documented extensively in the national policing workforce census. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. Victim impact statements submitted through the Hartford Retail Crime Partnership amplify the broader consequences beyond mere loss of goods. One proprietor of a small pharmacy recounted how repeated theft occasions led to increased anxiety for staff, who at times felt threatened despite no explicit acts of violence occurring. Adjustments such as installation of additional surveillance cameras, controlled shelf access, and workforce reductions, although protective, represent diminished service quality to the local population. These responses also bear financial implications, contributing indirectly to the upward spiral of retail shrinkage, closure of outlets, and decreased economic vitality within the affected precincts. The Retail Support Alliance, a charitable entity tasked with aiding retailers impacted by crime, provided written submissions reflecting similar concerns. Their caseworkers detail instances where staff health deteriorated due to chronic stress and insecurity, resulting in absenteeism and turnover. Such consequences, while not eliciting sympathy for criminal conduct, underscore the rippling effects of seemingly minor thefts on workplace wellbeing and community stability. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. Your counsel has submitted a psychiatric report from Dr Josephine C. Harrow, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, dated 7 September 2025. Dr Harrow notes an absence of diagnosable mental illness but records features consistent with depressive symptomatology exacerbated by chronic unemployment and housing instability. The report remarks on impulsivity and suboptimal coping strategies, particularly in relation to financial crisis moments. Dr Harrow expresses concern over your limited engagement with voluntary community resources, despite multiple offers from connected agencies including Hartford’s Debt Advice Network, JobPath Outreach, and StepForward Counselling Services. It is observed that your ambivalence to structured support diminishes prospects for sustained desistence and complicates post-sentence rehabilitation planning. The probation assessment, jointly informed by offender manager Ms Fiona Gallagher and Dr Harrow’s input, categorises you as medium risk of harm and reoffending, citing specific acquisitive crime and impulse control concerns. The report recommends consideration of community order options incorporating cognitive behavioural therapy aimed at addressing offending related attitudes, alongside mandated financial management and counselling sessions. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. General Reflections on Legal Aid and Case Progression The court would be remiss not to acknowledge recurring systemic impediments related to Legal Aid provisions, which unfortunately feature in this case’s chronology. Initial applications for funding expert reports vied with procedural delays, including protracted correspondence exchanges and revised documentation requests by the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative offices. Such delays hamper timely resolution and place burdens on defendants, practitioners, and the judiciary alike. The regrettable resistance of authorities to streamline such processes has been lamented in professional circles and is frequently canvassed as a target for reform in justice sector discourse. Similarly, staffing deficits within the Probation Service—a matter well-documented in the National Offender Management statistics—have had indirect effects on timely case management. High caseloads and turnover rates impede the preparation of robust pre-sentence reports and obstruct availability for bespoke interventions. While this is not the defendant’s responsibility, it influences the availability of rehabilitative options relevant at sentencing. The court also notes, provisionally and without prejudice, the emergent discussions on the decentralisation of certain acquisitive crime interventions from custodial to community frameworks, a transition advocated in successive Home Office pilot programmes and parliamentary select committee reviews. The practicality and efficacy of such models are still subject to rigorous scrutiny. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. Analysis of Precedents Relating to Similar Offences This court draws upon the collective wisdom imparted by several authorities germane to the circumstances of this matter. Foremost among them is the judgment in R v. Steadman [2022] EWCA Crim 887, wherein the Court upheld a sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment for repeated thefts from local convenience stores. The Court emphasised deterrence and the protection of vulnerable victims in affirming the severity of the punishment. This case is instructive in underscoring that persistence and premeditation elevate culpability even when individual sums stolen are modest. In R v. Choudhury [2017] EWCA Crim 1021, which involved a defendant with a pattern of repeated theft from charity shops coupled with attempts to frustrate surveillance, the Court of Appeal recognized the profound impact on staff morale and the integrity of charitable work, directing that such factors bear substantial weight in sentencing considerations. Furthermore, in R v. Nolan [2018] EWCA Crim 303, attention was drawn to the cumulative effects of theft offences on fragile businesses during economically strained periods, notably advocating for a robust stance to discourage relapse and preserve public confidence. These authorities provide the framework within which this court’s sentencing discretion is exercised today. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. Considerations Regarding the Defendant’s Personal Circumstances It cannot be overlooked that you are currently 34 years of age with a limited but relevant criminal history comprising three prior convictions for shoplifting between 2018 and 2021. You report no current employment, residing in temporary accommodation assigned by the local housing authority following recent eviction proceedings. No evidence of organised crime involvement or association with outlaw groups has been adduced. Your personal statement, tendered via your solicitor, portrays a narrative of escalating financial difficulty and social isolation, punctuated by family relationship breakdowns and the onset of depressive episodes. While this context attracts a degree of judicial empathy, as consistently affirmed in sentencing guidelines and appellate rulings, it cannot substitute for accountability. The presence of hardship and mental health complaints complicate but neither excuse nor exonerate repeated rule-breaking. There has not been, however, significant demonstrable engagement with support services. Outreach efforts by Hartford Homelessness Support and the local Mental Health Trust indicate invitations extended to you without reciprocal uptake. This unwillingness, whether stemming from scepticism, stigma, or personal circumstances, raises concern about realistic rehabilitation prospects absent custodial intervention. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Additional Remarks on Court Operations and Listing Challenges Curiously, the progression of this case has been affected by external factors unrelated to either party, notably an extended strike among court clerks in the summer months of 2025, coupled with a regional industrial action by legal professionals in the preceding calendar quarter. These events contributed to the postponement of several procedural hearings, with consequential pressure on court lists leading to scheduling reallocations. The courtroom itself underwent refurbishment at the turn of the year, which while enhancing the facilities, temporarily restricted available sessions in this jurisdiction. Staff changes within the Crown Prosecution Service, including the recent appointment of Ms Felicity Park as lead prosecutor for theft offences in this region, have also introduced a degree of operational flux. Although peripheral, these factors collectively illustrate the complexities entwined with administering justice efficiently in an already resource-limited environment. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. Having considered the totality of the evidence, reports, and submissions, it is clear that the offences committed by you constitute a repeated disregard for the law, with tangible harms to individual victims and the community at large. While your guilty plea is welcomed, the lateness of its entry limits the extent of credit the court may find appropriate. Sentencing must balance the public interest in deterrence, the protection of victims and businesses, and the overarching aim of rehabilitation. The current national sentencing guidelines for theft offences prescribe an approach that accounts for the frequency, value, and impact of the criminal conduct, as well as aggravating and mitigating factors specific to the defendant. In this case, subject to the forthcoming pre-sentence report, full consideration will be given to the potential for a community order incorporating structured rehabilitative elements, cognizant that your current social circumstances and engagement with support services appear fragile. Alternatively, the possibility of a custodial sentence reflecting the seriousness and persistence of the offending remains under contemplation. I note, with regret, the cumulative impact of repeat acquisitive offending on the strained resources of retail and justice services alike. It is incumbent upon all participants in the justice system to confront such patterns with clear-eyed resolve. The court will strive to impose a sentence that vindicates societal values and acknowledges personal circumstance without losing sight of deterrent necessity. The sentencing hearing will be resumed pending receipt of the pre-sentence report and any relevant further representations. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Hartford. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. No order is made as to costs at this stage. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. T2025/05931 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. F. DUNBAR Filed: 14 August 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence on a charge of theft, specifically the unauthorised removal of goods from retail premises, commonly known as shoplifting, committed over a span of time in the city and its environs. The charge pertains to a sustained series of thefts contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour stretches from mid-2023 through early 2025 and was concentrated largely within the commercial centres of Bristol and neighbouring towns, targeting a variety of shops including independent grocers and pharmacy outlets. Procedural History Your case was initially lodged at the Bristol Magistrates’ Court on 22 January 2025. Adjudication was deemed suitable for the Crown Court due to the cumulative seriousness and pattern of offending and its reflection in the volume of evidence. You were first interviewed under caution on 5 February 2025, during which you denied stealing, despite multiple witnesses and CCTV identification placing you at the scenes. Following the submission of incontrovertible forensic evidence including possession of stolen goods located at your residence and automated facial recognition linkage to shop security systems, you were formally charged on 15 February 2025 with a single representative count. It is worthy of note that this case was allocated to the Crown Court’s business court list pursuant to the Better Case Management (BCM) guidelines, designed to ensure expeditious handling of cases, avoid unnecessary delays, and assist in early plea resolution. The initial plea and trial preparation hearing was listed for 13 March 2025; however, it was adjourned upon defence application for the preparation of a psychiatric evaluation. Adjournments due to attempts to secure Legal Aid authorised funding for that report contributed to a delay, as did intermittent strikes among court administrative personnel in April and May. The psychiatric report was ultimately completed and filed on 10 July 2025, with the formal sentencing hearing scheduled for today. The Strategic Policing and Crime Board of Avon & Somerset Police have reiterated the strain placed upon local policing by repeat low-level offending such as shoplifting, emphasising the resource allocation challenges this constitutes amidst ongoing priorities concerning organised crime and serious violence. This court registers those observations, mindful of the broader environment within which such offences arise. It is necessary to express some consternation regarding the performance of the Legal Aid Agency over the course of these proceedings. The defence’s request for funding to instruct a clinical forensic psychologist with expertise in compulsive acquisitive crime was not conferred until delayed administrative exchanges had endured for over five weeks. The knock-on effect was a protracted overall timetable for case progression, extending well beyond the normalisation envisaged in the Criminal Procedure Rules and the judiciary’s directives on proportionality. Similar claims of agency inefficiency, affecting the timeliness of expert reports and representation, have been the subject of recent Parliamentary Select Committee inquiries. There is growing recognition that the procedural bureaucracy built into the allocation of Legal Aid funds can, in many instances, constitute a barrier to the timely delivery of justice. One hopes that this case, among others, serves as a reminder of the need for systemic review and reform. The role of multi-agency partnerships should also be recognised. The Bristol Retail Crime Prevention Partnership cooperated closely with the Avon & Somerset Police Safer Neighbourhood Teams. Incident reports were collated, and briefing notes issued to frontline staff in affected retail outlets. This allowed a modicum of preventative effort, including reconfiguration of high-value product placements and staff training on recognising common diversion tactics deployed by repeat offenders. While not perfect, coordination between public and private actors appears at least functional in this instance. Furthermore, representations from the Bristol Community Support Network—who provide assistance and outreach to vulnerable individuals at risk of entrenchment in criminality—were also received and reviewed by the court. Their approach to you was characterised by sustained engagement, though ultimately hampered by inconsistent participation on your part. Turning to relevant legal principles, it is appropriate to note the primary sentencing guidelines reflected in the Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences promulgated by the Sentencing Council. This document, which has been in force since 2019, sets out the framework for assessing culpability and harm, including the nature and duration of the offending, the sophistication of planning involved, and the impact on victims. The guideline makes clear that careful calibration is required to distinguish between opportunistic, one-off theft, and a protracted course of conduct akin to what is alleged here. I also take judicial notice of the decisional history elucidated in R v. Fairbairn [2022] EWCA Crim 850, which dealt with repeated assaults linked to a burglary series, and R v. Jennings [2021] EWCA Crim 432, concerning the theft of aviation parts—a matter unrelated to the present charge, but significant for its legal discussion on intention to permanently deprive. Neither case is factually on point, but their legal ratios on intent and seriousness provide useful context. In R v. Philips [2020] EWCA Crim 1083, the Court of Appeal considered a defendant who committed multiple thefts involving theft of plants from commercial nurseries, underscoring how repeated theft from niche outlets can heighten culpability. The sentence of twelve months’ imprisonment, upheld on appeal, was viewed as warranted given the cumulative economic and psychological impact. Similarly, the court is mindful of the ruling in R v. Atwood [2017] EWCA Crim 2246, where the defendant was convicted of fly-tipping significant quantities of industrial waste in protected woodland—a regulatory offence with physical and environmental consequences distinct from shoplifting, yet notable for the Court’s articulation of harm to community interest in shared public resources. A regrettable, yet unavoidable, observation is that in jurisdictions such as this one, delays caused by external factors such as industrial action, heavy workloads on digital forensic teams, and overwhelmed psychiatric services have increasingly become routine features in the management of criminal cases. These systemic pressures warrant careful reflection, for they bear directly on the administration of justice and equitable treatment of defendants and victims alike. It has also come to the court’s attention that unrelated proceedings involving an associate of yours—a former flatmate, now on trial for benefit fraud—are taking place contemporaneously. While entirely separate, the co-location of familial or social contacts in various judicial processes can complicate public perceptions, reinforcing the necessity for clear delineation between distinct matters. Further tangentially, the court was informed of the recent conviction of a man accused of affray in a public house near Bristol city centre, where a pool cue was wielded during an altercation. Though no factual link to your offences exists, such events contribute to the general climate of community safety concerns considered in sentencing ethos. On 11 March 2025, a co-defendant charged alongside you in an associated but entirely different matter failed to attend court and was declared at large by warrant of arrest. That circumstance is regrettable but wholly unconnected to your case, which proceeds in isolation. In preparation for the sentencing, a pre-sentence report was ordered at an earlier hearing, with a focus on assessing your risk of reoffending, support networks, housing status, and potential for rehabilitation. The report, filed on 8 August 2025, was prepared by Probation Officer Miss Jenna Clarke, a practitioner with considerable experience in the field of theft and acquisitive crime. Miss Clarke reports that you are currently unemployed, residing in temporary accommodation provided by Bristol City Council. You have four prior convictions for shoplifting dating back over the past decade, with the most recent prior to these charges occurring in 2022, when you received a conditional discharge. The report also notes sporadic engagement with support services, including financial counselling offered by the local charity “Hand in Hand” and attendance at a drug and alcohol advice clinic, which you declined to pursue further. An independent psychiatric report was also tendered from Dr Malcolm Bellamy, consultant forensic psychiatrist, based on assessments conducted in May and June. Dr Bellamy concluded that you do not meet criteria for a major mental disorder, but identified moderate depressive symptoms, notable impulsivity traits, and evidence of substance misuse predominantly involving alcohol. The report expressed concern regarding your low motivation for change and poor insight into the consequences of offending. Importantly, the assessment advised that custodial sentence supervision might be necessary to ensure compliance with planned interventions. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. It is necessary here to set out briefly the offending of which you stand convicted. The facts reflect a calculated series of actions committed over numerous occasions. The overall pattern betrays no injustice in holding you accountable for a deliberate and repeated course of conduct. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. Your offending is particularly noteworthy for the choice of premises targeted. The majority are small, locally owned businesses lacking the security infrastructure of larger chains. That these ventures represent vital community resources must not be overlooked. The harm done to proprietors extends beyond mere financial loss to include significant anxiety and a sense of violation. I observe that the court received written victim impact statements from four independent shopkeepers, including a pharmacist who detailed the psychological strain experienced by staff following repeated theft of over-the-counter medicines, leading to increased staff turnover and decreased morale. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. The sophistication of your conduct is evident. Multiple items were concealed using layered clothing, shopping bags, and backpacks, sometimes during periods of heightened store activity such as school runs or lunchtimes. Such tactics are consistent with offending profiles seen both in police intelligence and academic research on retail crime. The court has also reviewed the findings of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership meeting held on 20 June 2025, which outlined coordinated mitigation attempts deployed at affected premises. These included increased CCTV coverage, staffing adjustments, and community liaison efforts. The persistence of offending despite these measures underlines the deliberate and intentional nature of your conduct. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. Your actions did not entail threat or violence, but that does not diminish their seriousness. The cumulative distress imposed upon those who work in vulnerable settings cannot be measured solely in pecuniary terms. Notwithstanding these infractions, there is no evidence to suggest your conduct escalated to possession of weapons or involvement in organised shoplifting gangs. This contrasts with cases such as R v. Barnett [2019] EWCA Crim 1127, where defendants operated as part of highly organised theft rings engaging in fencing and distribution of stolen goods. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. The impact on community cohesion and local economies is subtle but profound. Reports from the City of Bristol’s Business Improvement District underscore how persistent theft discourages investment and incentivises closures in affected neighbourhoods. A report dated 12 May 2025 emphasises that retail shrinkage due to theft was responsible for an estimated 3% reduction in footfall in certain areas over a 12-month period. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. Furthermore, evidence indicates that you made use of distraction techniques on numerous occasions, engaging store employees in conversation or feigning interest in other products while purloining goods elsewhere. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Despite a prior community resolution issued in 2022 following earlier shoplifting charges, you resumed similar offending within months, displaying a regrettable failure to desist. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. The probation report notes that you have neither secured nor consistently maintained employment over recent years. Employment, of course, is a significant protective factor against reoffending. This absence magnifies concerns that a custodial sentence might be necessary to engender meaningful rehabilitation. The report also highlights the impact of housing instability on your circumstances. The difficulties faced by the Bristol city housing strategy are well documented: high demand, low supply, and extended waiting lists conspire to leave many vulnerable persons in precarious accommodation or temporary placements. Yet, these systemic pressures are persistent and, while relevant as context, do not absolve individual responsibility for criminal conduct. The court is mindful of the growing visibility of homelessness across urban centres, including visible clusters in the city centre and the encampments along Cumberland Basin. While your situation does not amount to entrenched rough sleeping, the precariousness of your housing contributes to the context. Dr Bellamy’s psychiatric report recommends cognitive behavioural interventions focusing on impulsivity management, as well as alcohol use disorder treatment, preferably delivered in conjunction with probation-supervised programmes. The report also acknowledges that your engagement to date with such measures has been minimal. It must be emphasised that no formal diagnoses of psychosis or major affective disorder were found. Prior legal issues relating to possession of controlled substances and public order offences received from prior convictions have been marked by relatively minor culpability and no history of violence. Further afield, this court has noted the sentencing of recent cases involving serious harm, including R v. Fletcher [2025] EWCA Crim 754, which involved aggravated burglary with injury in a separate jurisdiction, and R v. Owens [2024] EWCA Crim 305, concerning large-scale drug importation. Neither bears on the present case save to demonstrate the broad range of offences prosecuted across Crown Court listings. Similarly, this court’s own lists have included unrelated matters such as arson offences damaging commercial storage units in Courtroom 4, as well as fraud cases involving identity theft and mortgage deception—diversions from the immediate facts but illustrative of the diverse workload shouldered by the criminal justice system. The submissions made on your behalf by Mr Alex Thornton, your instructed defence counsel, were careful to emphasise your relative youth at the commencement of the offending series, the impact of instability in your early childhood, and your expressed desire to engage with rehabilitative opportunities. Mr Thornton drew attention to the enclosed character references and letters of support from the local drop-in centre “Hope House,” where you have attended sporadically over the past year. The Crown, represented by Ms Faith Massey, correctly emphasised the ongoing harm to vulnerable retail staff and proprietors, and highlighted your prior history and the persistence of offending after non-custodial interventions. The Crown requested a custodial sentence commensurate with culpability and harm consistent with sentencing principles laid down in the Theft guideline. Relevant case law bearing on credit for your guilty plea must be addressed. As noted in R v. Clarke [2023] EWCA Crim 1274, late pleas entered after substantial trial preparation warrant reduced credit. While the exact timing and circumstances of your admission permit some but not full mitigation, the court is mindful of the impact this has had on witnesses and court resources. This court is cognisant of the wider phenomenon of ‘late guilty pleas’ in similarly situated cases. While legally permitted and procedurally fair, they have a tangible impact on the economy of court sittings and the emotional and logistical burden on victims and witnesses. Sympathy for difficulties encountered by defendants must not obscure these realities. In sentencing you today, careful consideration will be given to the statutory framework under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, especially sections 142 and 153 relating to custodial sentences and community orders. The court seeks to balance punishment, deterrence, public protection, and reformative opportunities. Given the evidence of recurrence and refusal or failure to engage meaningfully with community-based interventions previously, it is likely that custody will feature in the ultimate sentence. However, the pre-sentence report and psychiatric evidence may identify appropriate rehabilitative or treatment conditions to be embedded where possible, even within custodial settings. This court also notes, in a more peripheral sense, ongoing discussions around regulatory frameworks governing the retail sector, including calls for increased security measures and legislative changes to support small businesses. While these policy matters are of public interest, they are beyond this court’s remit in the sentencing exercise before me. The hearing today has occurred in open court, with all parties in attendance, including legal representatives for both prosecution and defence. I thank Ms Massey and Mr Thornton for their professional conduct and measured presentations, which have facilitated the fair and orderly progress of proceedings. Court staff, ushers, and registrars are also acknowledged for their assistance. I reserve final sentence until such time as a full pre-sentence report, including any updated psychiatric or psychological evaluations, can be received and considered. This is to ensure that the sentence imposed is proportionate, informed, and capable of addressing both the individual circumstances of the defendant and the wider needs of public safety and community reassurance. These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge G. F. Dunbar, issued on 14 August 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been duly transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days, consistent with the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No specific reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON R v. MR H Case No. B2025/08431 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. P. MERRICK Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction for shoplifting offences committed over a sustained period in the Brighton and Hove area. The charges relate to a series of thefts from retail premises, within the ambit of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, involving multiple incidents spanning the course of approximately fifteen months. Procedural History Your case came before the Crown Court following a magistrates’ court committal on 2 May 2025, having previously been subject to detailed investigation and evidence gathering largely coordinated by the Brighton Retail Crime Reduction Unit. The prosecuting authority has indicated that this prosecution represents a representative count that encapsulates your course of offending conduct. Initial offence reports were submitted during early 2024 and were collated by a range of small independent shops and larger chain supermarkets in central Brighton. The case file prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service was comprehensive, containing DVD copies of surveillance footage, statements from retail staff and loss prevention officers, as well as expert analysis of recovered property. This court notes with some approval that Better Case Management (BCM) protocols were applied diligently in the management of this case. The case progression officer assigned to your matter, Ms Violet Traynor, has provided written confirmation that key milestones were met without breach of the Criminal Procedure Rules timetable. Initial prosecutor disclosure occurred within 21 days of your first appearance, and there were no unnecessary interlocutory hearings or adjournments save for those occasioned by the absence of your instructed solicitor on two occasions, which resulted in short delays. The court is aware, however, that such efficiency is not always the norm in retail theft cases, which often see significant delay due to the heavy administrative burden on officers, the often fragmentary nature of evidence, and repeated challenges in securing legal aid funding for appropriate expert reports. The present case has proceeded with commendable speed by those standards — an approach which merits acknowledgment. One must also bear in mind the considerable challenges involved in prosecuting offences largely characterised as low harm but high volume. The Brighton Retail Crime Reduction Unit continues to operate in an environment where resources are diverted to emergent violent crime and drug enforcement activity, making their prompt attention to repeat shoplifting offences all the more notable. Your initial plea at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 27 July 2025 was not guilty. This court, having reviewed the record, notes multiple adjournments between arraignment and plea entry—owing primarily to the late commissioning of psychological assessments and your legal team’s efforts to gather relevant background information. The latter included a complex set of correspondence with local housing support agencies, meant to establish your accommodation status and related vulnerabilities. A contested trial date was set for 14 October 2025; however, at a preparatory hearing on 9 September, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to the single representative count, following the submission of new forensic evidence by the Crown. This late plea is regrettably not uncommon in cases regarding persistent acquisitive offences. An observation is warranted here concerning the nature of the credit discount available for late pleas. As this court recently determined in R v. Wembly [2025] EWCA Crim 3486, the principle remains firm that the timing of a guilty plea is a critical factor in the exercise of sentencing discretion. That judgment reinforced that a plea entered at the eleventh hour—particularly one following the decisive collapse of a defence argument or the crystallisation of an unassailable evidential case—must attract significantly less credit than an early admission made with due regard for the interests of victims and the judicial process. In addition to the foregoing, the court must address systemic procedural concerns. The Legal Aid Agency’s handling of your representation has been cause for considerable frustration. Requests for authority to instruct an independent forensic accountant and a psychiatric expert were subjected to protracted review periods, with initial refusals followed by repeated clarifications extending over a fortnight. Such delays create avoidable tension within the case timetable and impose unnecessary burden on all participants. The experience narrates a broader, troubling pattern across the criminal justice system: administrative delays increasingly threaten the right to a fair and timely hearing. Practitioners know all too well the consequence when resources vanish behind tangled authorization systems rooted in over-zealous fiscal gatekeeping rather than thoughtful case management. We find ourselves, unmistakably, in an era marked by persistent staffing shortages across the Probation Service. National statistics reveal caseloads frequently exceeding recommended thresholds, impairing the quality and timeliness of offender assessments. Local services in Brighton report particular difficulties with recruiting and retaining experienced officers, meaning that pre-sentence reports arrive late or with narrow assessments. Although this matter is relatively straightforward by comparison, the court notes with concern that the risk assessment segment of the pre-sentence report will require careful scrutiny once received. This court is aware that housing instability contributes materially to the complexity of cases such as yours. The ongoing crisis of street homelessness within Brighton, a city experiencing acute pressure on affordable housing stock, informs both the social context and the practical realities of attempting rehabilitation. The absence of sustained, secure tenancy exacerbates vulnerability, perpetuates exposure to risk, and potentially impairs compliance with community orders. Charities such as Seaside Shelter and Brighton Hope have submitted written representations outlining the tenuous nature of local support networks — resources that continue to be stretched well beyond sustainable limits. The Crown Prosecution Service notes that, despite multiple warnings and interventions by local authority outreach workers, there is little evidence of sustained engagement on your part with the social care system. This court concurs that the willful rejection of assistance compounds concerns around future risk of reoffending. In reviewing the body of relevant appellate authority pertaining to the sentencing of repeated theft-related offences, this court is mindful of the established principles articulated in R v. Lindsay [2017] EWCA Crim 1253, which held that repeat offending, paired with disregard for prior community resolutions or suspended sentences, typically justifies escalation in sentencing severity. In Lindsay, the court underscored the diminished tolerance for ongoing acquisitive conduct that adversely impacts the confidence of retail workers and the wider public. Another instructive authority is R v. Calder and Pete [2019] EWCA Crim 1430, where the Court of Appeal emphasised the necessity of imposing sentences that reflect not just the immediate financial loss but also attendant emotional harm, including anxiety and fear experienced by store employees subject to repeat targeting. Although those defendants were involved in aggravated circumstances including threats of violence and involvement in organised crime, the sentencing judgments impel courts to weigh cumulative impact seriously. Prior case law relating to unrelated offences also percolates through the context. For instance, in R v. Daniels [2018] EWCA Crim 1897, a defendant convicted of fly-tipping on protected environmental land was sentenced to eighteen months’ imprisonment despite the comparatively modest monetary value of material unlawfully dumped. The Court emphasised the broader symbolic and ecological damage wrought. This precedent, though unrelated in subject matter, reaffirms the judiciary's increasing preference for measured and proportionate custodial responses where systemic disregard for norms is evident. Proceedings in this court will also take into account the fact that your co-defendant in an earlier proceeding, Ms Taylor, was convicted of an unrelated offence involving possession of indecent images of children, which, while criminally grave, bears no direct connection to your conduct or culpability here. Any inference that may be drawn about your character from association is not entertained by the court. While the defendant’s extended family history includes references to disputes involving noise complaints levied against the landlord of your current accommodation — particularly notices served for alleged anti-social behaviour and nuisance — these matters are tangential to the offences before the court, and do not bear on sentencing considerations. It is imperative to maintain analytical clarity concerning personal history and offence-specific conduct. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. Turning to the nature of the offences themselves, surveillance evidence, sworn witness statements, and expert inventory assessments converge on a depiction of repeated entries to retail premises during opening hours, with the acquisition of multiple goods including branded over-the-counter medications, cosmetics, and confectionery. The approach on each occasion was marked by evasion of store security measures and a degree of premeditation underscoring your knowledge of the premises, schedules, and layout. The regional Public Health Observatory has recently published findings highlighting the significant prevalence of opioid analgesic misuse within Brighton. This is relevant context given evidence in this case of involvement with pharmacy outlets featuring restricted medicine cabinets. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. The Police Intelligence Bureau has additionally filed an analytical report noting a 17% increase in retail theft offences within the Brighton district over the past two calendar years, with sharp spikes reported during festive periods and school holidays. This trend amplifies the social impact of individual offending and informs the court’s broader appreciation of community harm. Your modicum of criminal history, as indicated in your presentence report, includes a series of prior convictions primarily consisting of theft and disorder offences. These date back over a decade, with the most recent conviction occurring in 2022 and resulting in a community order with unpaid work. The current offending, notably, represents a breach of that community order’s implicit expectations and conditions, although the court acknowledges that this previous sentence did not include an activity requirement. Additionally, there is some tender material from your family — including a letter from your sister — seeking to illustrate mitigating factors related to longstanding difficulties with accommodation and sporadic mental health problems, including diagnosed anxiety disorder. These supportive documents have been admitted and considered pursuant to application by defence counsel. It is regrettable, however, that comprehensive psychiatric evaluation was delayed due to the failure of initial statutory funding applications, resulting in the late commissioning of a consultant psychiatrist’s report from Dr Hans Olivieri of Brighton and Sussex NHS Trust. Dr Olivieri’s detailed assessment, appended to the pre-sentence report, elucidates borderline personality features coupled with impulsivity but indicates no psychotic disorder or severe mental illness requiring inpatient treatment. The report explicitly advises caution in attributing causative significance to diagnosis in the context of your offending. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. In respect of risk and rehabilitation, the probation report notes that you have demonstrated low engagement with prior community resources, including substance misuse clinics and mental health outreach teams. Your compliance with the conditions of past supervision has been erratic, and the risk of reoffending is assessed as medium. The likelihood of a successful outcome from a tailored cognitive behavioural programme, including the accredited Thinking Skills Programme, is reported as moderate but contingent on your acceptance of support. This court supports any such interventions that foster rehabilitation and reduce future harm. Among wider public services, the Brighton Safer Neighbourhood Team has also provided a community impact statement affirming that shoplifting contributes to erosion of public confidence. It refers to heightened anxiety not only among staff in target stores but also among customers who have reported seeing repeat offenders in and around shopping precincts. This sentiment emerges despite the ostensibly minor nature of each individual theft. The court further notes with appreciation the voluntary contributions of the Brighton Retailers Recovery Network, whose outreach encompasses victim support, advice on crime prevention, and advocacy for affected small businesses. Their restrained and factual submissions emphasize the need for effective sanctions that deter future offending, while also encouraging rehabilitation. The court also commends the WorkWell Brighton initiative, which offers vocational training aimed at preventing exclusion from the labour market—particularly for individuals with histories akin to yours. It bears mentioning that at a hearing scheduled on 15 July 2025, the court was obliged to adjourn due to the late arrival of necessary interpreter services for a witness whose primary language was not English. While this disruption caused inconvenience, it reinforced the court’s commitment to ensuring fair access and procedural propriety for all parties. During consultation with the witness service, it was noted that some retail employees affected by this offending had recounted experiences of distress and sleep disturbances, although none sought medical treatment. Victim impact hearings in comparable cases, such as R v. Dawson [2024] EWCA Crim 2028, affirm that the psychological sequelae of repeated theft cannot be discounted. At the sentencing hearing, counsel for the defence, Mr Jonathan Pryce, instructed via legal aid, developed a position centered on your challenging social circumstances, low-level mental health difficulties, and purported intention to cease offending. Ms Harriet Donnelly for the Crown emphasised the cumulative impact of your conduct, the breach of prior conditions, and the necessity of promoting public confidence through an appropriate custodial threshold. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. The court also references authority from administrations regarding the limitations of suspended sentences in cases of persistent acquisitive offending. The Sentencing Council's guidelines explicitly state that such sentences have limited efficacy where previous non-custodial measures have failed and where the likelihood of reoffending remains high. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. The court is mindful of the evidence concerning your financial situation. The pre-sentence report confirms your current unemployment and a lack of formal qualifications, though there is some indication of prior manual employment. The report notes a lack of consistent engagement with JobCenter Plus or other employment support programmes over the past year. The local Department for Work and Pensions has provided correspondence confirming your receipt of Universal Credit, albeit with interruptions attributable to intermittent contact failures with advisers. This aspect, while beyond immediate judicial control, feeds into the nexus of need and opportunity that frames your offending environment. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. Academic literature on the impact of social media on offending behaviour is replete with discussion about glamorisation, trivialisation, and the impulsive mimicry of peer conduct. The court takes no direct factual basis of such influence in this case, yet it cannot ignore the cultural milieu in which many offenders, including yourself, operate. The rise of platforms such as TikTok and Instagram has accelerated the circulation of content depicting transient defiance of rules, sometimes rationalised as acts of survival or protest. Whether or not these factors contributed is speculative, but the court references them as part of the broader societal context. As to the reported incidence of co-offending, this court notes with particular concern the evidence in R v. Hardwick [2023] EWCA Crim 1234, involving group shoplifting coordinated via mobile phones. That case underlined the enhanced culpability and community harm arising from organised patterns of acquisitive offending. The instant case lacks direct evidence of co-offenders, but the point remains salient for the sentencing exercise. The political backdrop against which these proceedings unfold is equally noteworthy. Government policy emphasises the dual aims of punishment and rehabilitation, with a growing emphasis on diversion, community orders, and early intervention schemes. Yet, paradoxically, the resources to fully realise such initiatives remain inadequate. The Brighton local authority budget has faced year-on-year cuts exceeding 15%, as documented in the Annual Local Government Finance Settlement of 2024-25. Such fiscal austerity increasingly hampers services designed to prevent crime and support offenders. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. In considering your prospects for rehabilitation, it is necessary to weigh the court reports, psychiatric assessment, and available social supports against the degree of risk indicated. The pre-sentence report evaluates you as a suitable candidate for the Community Order with Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, as well as possible attendance on a Substance Misuse Programme, if engagement is sustained. The Probation Service highlights the critical importance of stable housing as a foundational element in achieving compliance and reducing recidivism risk. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. In the final analysis, Mr H, the offences you committed were not impulsive or isolated, but part of a deliberate and persistent pattern with measurable negative impact. The economic loss is modest, but the distress inflicted upon victims and the consequent erosion of public confidence is significant. Your late plea limits the credit available, and your refusal or failure to engage meaningfully with support services compounds concerns about future risk. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal order will be issued in due course. You have the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days of this pronouncement pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions in place under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. B2025/14327 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. K. Rawlings Filed: 12 November 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced in respect of a charge of theft, specifically shoplifting, contrary to the provisions of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending took place over a period spanning late 2023 into early 2025, occurring at varied premises within the Bristol metropolitan area and nearby districts. The prosecution case—that you have now admitted—was presented under a single count on the indictment, representing what is described as a course of conduct involving repeated thefts of goods, the details of which will be elaborated upon shortly. Procedural History and Court Context Your initial apprehension followed a protracted investigative process commencing in January 2025, involving the coordinated efforts of multiple law enforcement and community safety agencies. The Bristol Business Crime Partnership, established in 2009 to foster collaboration between commercial enterprises, local police, and the municipal council, played a key role in collecting intelligence and providing victim liaison services. This defunct yet occasionally mentioned body, notwithstanding its archival status, was noted in initial briefs, although its dissolution in 2022 rendered direct involvement nominal at best in the present proceedings. A pre-trial review hearing on 1 March 2025 led to an adjournment for case management purposes. At that hearing, the matter was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 27 April 2025. The progression of the case otherwise adhered, in broad terms, to the indicative timeframes prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Rules (CrimPR), albeit not without some procedural difficulties. Initial attempts to obtain Legal Aid funding for an independent psychiatric evaluation encountered delays due to shifting eligibility criteria and administrative backlogs within the Legal Aid Agency—a pattern increasingly characteristic of resource-constrained public administration. Such delays, lamentably common in criminal proceedings, not only retard the justice process but, on occasion, test the patience of all parties concerned. It is worth pausing to note that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and defence counsel both engaged cooperatively throughout, with Ms Emily Radcliffe representing the Crown and Ms Jeremy Thom, a solicitor advocate, representing you under a representation order granted on 15 February 2025. The court records their efforts with appreciation, though it falls to me to observe the cumulative procedural complexity besetting even comparatively minor offences in the current legal climate. Public confidence in the criminal justice system depends, in no small measure, upon its reputation for timely and proportionate resolution of cases. The Better Case Management (BCM) framework, introduced formally in the early 2020s to promote judicial scrutiny of case progression, was invoked here. While the framework was designed to expedite procedural milestones and reduce unnecessary adjournments, its implementation has been far from uniform across jurisdictions. In this instance, the court acknowledges that the case management hearings proceeded with a degree of efficiency and adherence to prescribed standards, a welcome counterpoint in a generally overburdened system. The theft provision under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines the primary offence: the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof. Shoplifting, though often perceived as a relatively minor offence due to the low monetary value of items commonly involved, must not be treated lightly where patterns of repeated offending emerge, impacting victims’ businesses and community welfare. In R v. Chambers [2020] EWCA Crim 1721, the Court of Appeal underscored the principle that repeated acquisitive offending directed at retail premises warrants a sentencing approach attentive both to the cumulative harm inflicted and the broader public confidence implications. While the individual thefts in that case were each of low value, the serial nature and deliberate tactics adopted by the appellant supported a custodial term to mark denunciation and deterrence. Similarly, it is instructive to consider R v. Preston [2019] EWCA Crim 1459, where the defendant engaged in a series of aggressive shoplifting incidents involving intimidation and concealment. The Court emphasised the importance of factoring in the psychological impact on staff and the disruption to business, even when physical violence was not present. Although Mr H’s conduct cannot be equated in gravity to Preston, the circumstances nonetheless warrant serious regard. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. The breadth of published sentencing guidelines for theft offences, including the 2023 edition, provides a calibrated framework for assessing culpability and harm. Paragraphs 2.12 through 2.26 outline relevant aggravating and mitigating features, among them the presence of previous convictions, sophistication of offender tactics, impact on vulnerable victims, and the cumulative effect of multiple offences constituting a \"course of conduct,\" as is alleged here. Notably, this court is reminded of the dictum in R v. Beckwith [2022] EWCA Crim 991, which emphasised the courts’ responsibility to consider the broader societal consequences of prolific minor offences. The judiciary must balance proportionality with the imperative to sustain deterrent messaging and uphold victim confidence. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. The detailed evidential record reveals a series of shoplifting episodes from various retail premises, including multiple grocery stores, pharmacies, and convenience shops. These incidents, emerging through painstaking collation of CCTV footage, staff accounts, and inventory checks, depict a pattern of deliberate, repeated theft. Your modus operandi encompassed the use of concealed garments and bags to appropriate items largely comprising toiletries, over-the-counter medicinal products, and confectionery. Such targeting reflects an awareness of the secondary market value of these goods, as well as an attempt to minimise detection—though, regrettably for you, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. In one notable incident, a shop manager observed you attempting to distract staff by engaging in seemingly innocuous conversation while covertly removing items from shelves. On another occasion, you were captured on multiple cameras, traversing a retail space with a conspicuously bulky coat, which appeared designed to facilitate concealment. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. Furthermore, at least one victim store reports that your continued presence and repeated offending have caused considerable disruption to staffing arrangements, with some employees requesting adjusted working hours or site transfers. These accounts attest to the intangible harm resulting from such offences—a factor considered significant by sentencing courts, notwithstanding the absence of physical harm or threat. The involvement of the Bristol Retailers' Liaison Group merits mention. This body, though not an official prosecuting authority, has played a commendable role in supporting affected business owners through arranging security audits, staff training in theft prevention, and advocating for enhanced collaboration with law enforcement. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. Whilst your case is discrete and singular, it is essential to view it in light of your prior criminal history. You have previous convictions for theft-related offences, including two disposals via conditional caution in 2022 and a community order in 2023. Despite these interventions, offending appears to have persisted or escalated in frequency. Probation service records reveal episodic engagement and occasional absences from scheduled appointments. The preparatory reports before me also cite a lack of full acceptance of responsibility until recently, alongside a degree of minimisation concerning the impact of your conduct. Such factors, while not determinative, necessarily invite a degree of caution in assessing your prospects for rehabilitation absent appropriate statutory intervention. The psychiatric report submitted on behalf of the defence, prepared by Dr Helen Wentworth in August 2025, provides a detailed assessment of your mental state. Dr Wentworth concludes that you do not meet diagnostic criteria for major mental illness but exhibits traits consistent with impulse control difficulties and mild anxiety disorder. There is no evidence of organic brain dysfunction or psychotic illness. The report emphasises your reported socioeconomic stresses, including unstable housing and intermittent unemployment, while also noting limited engagement with support services designed to address these vulnerabilities. Dr Wentworth cautiously suggests that psychosocial interventions targeting impulse regulation and coping mechanisms may be beneficial. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. Conversely, the probation officer’s pre-sentence report notes a medium risk of harm and relatively high risk of reoffending, primarily driven by socioeconomic factors and limited protective support networks. The report underscores the importance of structured supervision with cognitive behavioural components. It is instructive to signal current pressures within probation services nationally, where staff shortages and extensive caseloads frequently constrain the reach of intensive intervention programmes. This systemic limitation often results in delayed access to tailored support, particularly for individuals presenting multifaceted social complexity. The court also receives correspondence from the Bristol Homelessness Action Alliance, outlining the ongoing challenges faced by those at risk of insecure accommodation or rough sleeping. While not specific to you, the material serves as a salutary reminder of the broader social environment in which many defendants exist—a context that, while not excusing offending, situates it within the landscape of lived experience. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. Victim personal statements provide harrowing insights into the impact of repeated theft on local shopkeepers and their staff. While the financial sums involved in individual offences may appear modest, the cumulative losses impose significant strain on small and independent businesses, many of which already operate on narrow margins. One business owner writes poignantly of the erosion of community space and the chilling effect of persistent offending on employee morale. The psychological burden on staff—manifesting as anxiety and diminished job satisfaction—constitutes real harm, recognised expressly by the courts as an element requiring redress. This court notes with respect the efforts of the Bristol Retail Crime Prevention Strategy team, whose ongoing engagement with affected businesses includes advice on environmental design, surveillance enhancements, and staff safety protocols. Such initiatives represent an essential component of community resilience but are inevitably reactive and, to an extent, constrained by funding limitations. It is a cause for concern that these programmes are often stretched beyond capacity, necessitating careful choices about resource allocation. The victim impact is thus not solely monetary but also manifest in the weakening of local commercial fabric and increased community insecurity. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. In the broader social context, the court acknowledges evolving patterns of acquisitive offending, increasingly fuelled by economic pressures, social exclusion, and the pervasive challenges of mental health. Recent Home Office reports from 2024 indicate a modest upward trend in petty theft in urban centres, including Bristol, with marked spikes noted in areas of high deprivation. This trend has seen concomitant strain on emergency services, retail businesses, and local authorities seeking to stabilise neighbourhoods. The “place crime” theory articulated in criminological literature underlines that persistent petty offending, while individually minor, collectively engenders significant community harm. It is incumbent upon the courts, therefore, to respond proportionately but firmly. As has been well documented in media commentary, including recent discussions in The Times and The Guardian, society’s tolerance thresholds are approaching critical levels, with calls for enhanced sanctions alongside expanded rehabilitative infrastructures. The Role and Challenges of the Legal Aid System Throughout these proceedings, the court and parties have contended with notable funding and resource difficulties associated with Legal Aid applications—specifically in respect of expert assessments integral to the defence’s case. This frustrating reality is not unique to this jurisdiction and speaks to systemic issues in the administration of justice. Defence counsel’s application for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist experienced in acquisitive offending was delayed for several weeks due to procedural queries and insufficient clarity in the statutory criteria. Such delays hamper timely resolution and impose further stress upon defendants already grappling with complex needs. The court regrets that remedies have not yet been implemented to streamline these processes effectively. This state of affairs is unsatisfactory in the extreme and risks undermining defendants’ access to appropriate representation and expert advice. Mr H stated in interview that he frequently takes items, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. It is equally lamentable that the capacity of forensic and digital units to analyse and process evidence, including CCTV archives and electronic transaction data, remains stretched. Policemen, analysts, and technical staff dedicated to retail crime investigations must often balance these duties with pressures relating to more serious offences such as violent crime or fraud. The consequence can be operational delays and protracted case preparation. Your arrest in February 2025 represented the conclusion of an intelligence-led operation targeting a suspected prolific thief. Such resources are not expended lightly; intelligence analysts maintain a careful balance of priorities to deliver effective public protection outcomes. The authority to utilise telephone data and CCTV triangulation was granted only after due judicial scrutiny, reflecting the seriousness with which your offending was regarded. The court is tasked with navigating a complex seam in determining an appropriate sentence that adequately reflects the culpability of your conduct, the harm caused, your personal circumstances, and the wider public interest. The acknowledged persistence of offending despite prior community resolutions is a significant aggravating factor. Such history signals a heightened risk of recidivism and demonstrates, I regret to say, a pattern of behaviour not deterred by earlier interventions. Notwithstanding this, the mitigating factors of your mental health assessment—while not amounting to a mental disorder—must be taken into account in shaping the form of sentencing and supervision. Your apparent willingness to engage with support services subsequent to the current proceedings offers some hope for rehabilitation. It is also pertinent to reflect that the shoplifting offences, while serious and damaging, did not involve violence or threat thereof—an aspect that influences the gradation of sentence severity. In considering the composite sentencing framework, the court will have regard to both custodial and community options. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on Theft offences advocates custodial sentences where offending is repeated, planned, and persistent, yet also recognises the potential for rehabilitation through requirement orders where appropriate. I remind all parties that an immediate custodial sentence does not always serve the interests of justice, especially when community-based sanctions may be better tailored to address criminogenic needs and reduce reoffending risk. The court has also considered the underlying social factors contributing to your offending, including episodes of unstable accommodation and unemployment. While these circumstances do not excuse criminality, they are relevant to the question of sentence type and conditions. Finally, the court expresses its gratitude to the staff of the Bristol Retail Recovery Network, whose expert support for victims has been invaluable in collating victim impact statements and offering practical assistance post-offence. Such organisations perform a vital function in estate and community cohesion, often under significant resource constraints. Having reviewed all material—statutory and non-statutory guidance, case law precedents, the factual matrix, expert reports, victim statements, and submissions from counsel—it falls to this court to adjourn for the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report. Such report is to be prepared by the Bristol Probation Service and should explore fully options for community rehabilitation, appropriate supervision levels, cognitive behavioural therapy courses, and any ancillary support mechanisms, including housing assistance and employment counselling. The probation officer is also requested to assess risk factors for further reoffending and offer recommendations for a tailored package of interventions. This matter is adjourned to the scheduled sentencing hearing on 17 December 2025, at which time this court will determine the appropriate disposal informed by the report and any further relevant representations. These sentencing remarks are entered as of this 12th day of November 2025, in Court 8 of the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. The defendant, Mr H, is advised of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM R v. MR H Case No. B2025/14567 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. G. Farnsworth Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this Court for sentence on a matter concerning theft from retail premises contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offence arises from a succession of shoplifting events reportedly occurring over a period of approximately 18 months within the Birmingham metropolitan area, including but not limited to districts such as Digbeth, Moseley, and Ladywood. Procedural Background The case has followed a somewhat protracted course through the criminal justice system. Initially charged on 2 February 2025 following investigative activity by local police and the Business Crime Reduction Partnership for Birmingham City Centre, the case proceeded under the direction of the Crown Prosecution Service’s Local Casework Unit. Plea hearings were scheduled and re-scheduled owing to several adjournments precipitated by both defence applications and administrative constraints. It is appropriate to reflect on the wider context within which this case unfolds. Over recent years, acquisitive crime rates have exhibited fluctuations that correspond to socio-economic changes as well as policing priorities and community reporting behaviours. The role of multi-agency partnerships, such as those manifested in the Birmingham Retail Crime Initiative (BRCI), remains pivotal in gathering intelligence, coordinating preventive measures, and supporting victim businesses. These organisations operate under the strain of resource limitations, high case volumes, and the demand to balance immediate response with strategic foresight. Excursions into institutional observations further underline the fragility of current support frameworks. The Legal Aid Agency, for instance, has been subject to repeated criticism regarding the timeliness and consistency of its approvals for expert report instructions. In this matter, an early request for a forensic psychiatric assessment was delayed by over six weeks, despite clear indication of mitigating factors raised by the defence. Such delays have a cascading effect — impacting listing availability, prolonging custody durations, and inevitably placing strain on all parties concerned. A note must be made of the enduring challenge faced by mental health services, including the NHS Trust responsible for adult mental health provision in the West Midlands. Waiting lists for specialist assessments extend into months, and while intermediate support mechanisms exist, their efficacy is hampered by high demand and funding shortfalls. Against this institutional backdrop, the court must endeavour to deliver justice with both firmness and compassion, recognising the complexity but resisting the temptation to conflate structural issues with individual culpability. Engagement with the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol saw the initial case allocation on 16 February 2025, and subsequent listing for a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing (PTPH) on 10 March 2025. At that hearing, you entered a not guilty plea, though this was amended to guilty with effect from the first day of trial on 15 September 2025. The Crown elected not to proceed with a contested hearing, following extensive evidential disclosure and the arrival of forensic and digital evidence corroborating identification. The timing of your plea results inevitably in reduced mitigation for acceptance of responsibility. It is, however, acknowledged that plea was unequivocal and entered in open court having had the benefit of legal advice. The discount available should be tempered in line with appellate guidance, including that laid down in R v. Simmonds [2020] EWCA Crim 1507. The Crown, represented here by Ms Anne Dalrymple, has presented detailed submissions supported by CCTV footage, witness statements from retail employees, and multi-agency risk assessments. Defence representation is provided by Mr Oliver Brice, acting on a representation order. The court records its appreciation for their thorough advocacy under challenging circumstances. It bears mention that this court has recently undergone refurbishment, including improved accessibility measures and enhanced technology for remote video links, which has been of some assistance given the fluctuating public health constraints and pilot digital initiatives. The impact on victims has been set out in victim personal statements supplied through the Birmingham Retail Federation. These describe not only financial loss but the psychological burden borne by staff subject to repeated targeting and the feeling of insecurity engendered in the workplace. Prior to addressing the substance of offending, the court notes the devotion of volunteer organisations working in community support roles. Of particular relevance is the Birmingham Food Bank Network, whose representatives have written in to acknowledge the complex factors driving some individuals towards economic desperation, but who also underscore that support is available and that engagement with these services is essential. Another institutional commentary pertains to the pressing concerns of the probation service, which currently is operating under significant staffing shortages and operational pressures. The availability of tailored rehabilitative programmes for acquisitive offenders, including cognitive-behavioural and motivational interventions, remains limited. This reality constrains the court’s options but does not obviate the need to attempt community-based disposal where appropriate. It is also worth noting the evolving jurisprudence on sentencing discount and credit where mental health issues are present. The recent decision in R v. Elmhurst [2025] EWCA Crim 1234 reiterated that while underlying health difficulties may mitigate culpability, they do not exclude a proportionate custodial sentence where public protection and general deterrence demand it. Moreover, in R v. Clifford [2019] EWCA Crim 405, the Court underscored that repeated theft offences, particularly when involving vulnerable retail settings, require a measured but firm response. Although that case is factually unrelated to this matter, its legal principles remain pertinent in emphasizing the effect of acquisitive crime beyond mere financial calculation. A review of the Background Reports is germane at this juncture. Mr H’s recorded criminal history reveals three prior convictions for theft-related matters, all within the last five years. Notably, no offences of violence or drug distribution feature. Previous sentences have included community orders and a conditional discharge. Social services records indicate a history of childhood instability, marked by periods in foster care and intermittent school attendance. Such information has been assessed and reflected upon by the Probation Service in their pre-sentence overview. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. This court has had the benefit of a psychiatric report from Dr Kamal Patel, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, dated 10 September 2025. Dr Patel observes that although Mr H does not meet the criteria for severe mental illness, there is evidence of emotional dysregulation, a history of substance misuse, and a modicum of chaotic lifestyle factors which have yet to be addressed fully through intervention. Dr Patel commends Mr H’s articulate self-reflection displayed during clinical interviews but warns of the risk of rapid relapse into harmful patterns post-release absent structured support. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. Outside the direct orbit of this matter, it is germane to mention the operational challenges faced by police digital forensics units, which have experienced increasing workloads partly arising from broader cross-jurisdictional tasking. The West Midlands Police Forensics Department handles thousands of devices annually, filtering data of investigatory value from mass stores of irrelevant personal communications. The time taken to process devices often delays case progress. It is further observed with regret that the city has seen numerous instances of fly-tipping on designated Green Belt land, attracting enforcement priorities that sometimes conflict with retail crime investigation resourcing. Cases such as R v. Davies [2023] EWCA Crim 1890 serve as examples of the courts’ approach to environmental offences having a wider societal effect, although completely unrelated to Mr H’s conduct. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. The court has also reviewed letters from community organisations. The Moseley Social Outreach Group writes of the pressures of rising street homelessness in the Birmingham area and appeals for enhanced collaboration between statutory and voluntary sectors. While these concerns are of high social importance, they do not diminish Mr H's personal responsibility. Likewise, a statement from Mr H’s sister, Ms Fiona Clarke, has been submitted. She speaks to his struggles with addiction but also expresses hope for his rehabilitation. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. I refer next to the procedural peculiarities that have marked this case’s timeline. On 28 April 2025, the listing centre notified parties of a delay owing to court room reallocation and conflicting hearing dates caused by strike action within the judiciary support staff. Such occurrences have become regrettably frequent, straining the administration of justice. The case’s adjournment length, albeit not excessive, reflects these systemic pressures. The case management hearings have otherwise followed the expectations of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules (CrimPR) and the Judicial Studies Board guidance on Better Case Management. No pre-trial applications other than defence requests for psychiatric assessment were advanced. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. On receipt of the psychiatric report, defence counsel submitted supplementary mitigation asserting compounding social vulnerabilities, including housing insecurity and intermittent employment history. These points, while relevant to sentencing disposition, must be balanced against deterrent considerations. During the trial course, the Crown placed particular reliance on the testimony of Ms Jane Whitmore, a retail manager at a store in Digbeth, who described clear disruption to business practices and staff wellbeing arising from repeated incidents attributed to Mr H’s conduct. Of ancillary note, a co-defendant named in an unrelated matter involving street-level drug supply in Ladywood remains at large following decision to proceed with separate proceedings. No connection is evidenced with Mr H beyond proximity of geographical area. Similarly, a landlord of a property rented by Mr H was subject to a noise abatement notice due to unrelated tenancy disputes. Such matters have no bearing on the offence for which Mr H is to be sentenced but were disclosed in ancillary documentation. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. The Sentencing Guidelines Council, in their Theft and Handling guideline (2024 edition), emphasise several factors relevant here, including the offending pattern, harm to victims, and offender’s previous record. While the financial value of stolen goods may be modest, the repeated and deliberate nature indicates a criminal lifestyle requiring inhibition. International developments in rehabilitation models were briefly considered during sentencing workshops earlier this year. Some studies highlight cognitive reinforcing programmes as effective in reducing reoffending among acquisitive offenders. Whether such programmes can be widely implemented within present probation resources remains uncertain. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. In assessing culpability, the court takes account of the careful summary of legal principles articulated in R v. Duncan [2024] EWCA Crim 1552, noting that persistent offending following community disposal inevitably merits escalation and that mere economic pressure rarely suffices as mitigation. Finally, the Probation Service’s pre-sentence report, received 7 October 2025, evaluated Mr H’s risk to the public as medium, highlighting his prior history of non-compliance with community orders and mixed record on engagement with previous support programmes. The report recommends that any community order should include intensive supervision and a rehabilitative element targeting acquisitive behaviour, as well as substance misuse components. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. In light of the foregoing, the court imposes a short adjournment for the preparation of a final pre-sentence report, taking into account all expert and social agency input. Following receipt, sentencing will be determined with the appropriate level of proportionality, considering all aggravating and mitigating features. This hearing has been conducted in open court with all parties properly represented and in attendance. I thank Ms Dalrymple and Mr Brice for their clear submissions and professional conduct. The court also expresses appreciation for the probation officers, psychiatric experts, and victim liaison team whose work has informed these remarks. These sentencing remarks have been prepared and filed on this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be retained for the record. Mr H is reminded of his right to appeal against any sentence passed within 28 days pursuant to the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 have been engaged. Costs are reserved pending sentencing. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT LIVERPOOL R v. MR H Case No. T2025/14567 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. L. FORD Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for the purpose of sentence in relation to offences of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct extended over a protracted period spanning from late 2023 through the early months of 2025 and encompassed several commercial locations predominantly within the Liverpool metropolitan area and its surrounding districts. Procedural Overview You were arrested on 26 March 2025 following a sustained investigative operation coordinated by Merseyside Police in partnership with the Liverpool City Retail Crime Reduction Board. This investigation, resulting from a series of recurring theft reports originating from numerous small to medium-sized convenience stores and chemist outlets, was predicated on the suspicion of a methodical, organised pattern of retail dishonesty. The initial reports were not initially treated as interconnected. However, a methodical review of CCTV footage, staff witness statements, and stock shrinkage records eventually revealed a consistent modus operandi warranting further inquiry. It is relevant to underscore here the broader context within which such offences arise. Petty theft, and retail theft in particular, while often perceived as minor, exerts disproportionate strain on law enforcement agencies, judicial resources, and local businesses alike. The cumulative effect is far from trivial. The investigation, encompassing review of hours of surveillance tape and systematic collation of intelligence, required a dedicated task force working alongside retail security personnel. This involved a delicate balance of resource allocation, stretched as policing functions increasingly must contend with violent crime, gang activity, and cyber-enabled fraud. [1] The reality remains that the policing and prosecution of such offences relies heavily upon close cooperation across sectors: private sector security teams, local authority trading standards officers, and community safety partnerships. These frameworks, despite their good intentions, are frequently challenged by constraints of funding, manpower, and logistical complexity. It is perhaps worth remarking on the systemic role of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) prevalent in many urban localities — a network intended to enhance information sharing and rapid response. Despite its formal existence in Liverpool, the effectiveness of the BCRP varies considerably depending on local personnel, political will, and inter-organisational trust. There are regrettably instances where delays in intelligence dissemination or failures in follow-up visits diminish otherwise promising initiatives. [1] See R v. Thomsett [2019] EWCA Crim 344, articulating the increasing demands on police proficiency in balancing acquisitive crime against broader public safety imperatives. Following your arrest, you were interviewed under caution on 28 March 2025. You initially denied any involvement. However, subsequent forensic analysis — notably the identification of a distinctive pair of trainers captured on multiple CCTV cameras and items recovered during a search of your accommodation — supported the prosecuting authority's case. Formal charge ensued on 31 March 2025, with the matter transferred to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol. The BCM initiative represents a concerted judicial effort to streamline pre-trial procedures, reduce inefficiency, and prevent protracted adjournments that unduly burden all parties. While the scheme has had mixed success nationally, in the present case, the procedural timetable was met with relative compliance by prosecution, defence, and court administration alike. It is on record that listing of the plea and trial preparation hearing on 18 May 2025 proceeded without undue delay. Your initial plea was one of not guilty, entered on 18 May 2025. However, as additional evidence was served — including high-definition still images and corroborative witness statements from shop floor personnel — your counsel made an application on 2 July 2025 to amend the plea to guilty. This change was effected on 5 July 2025, following which the matter was listed for sentence today. The willingness to enter a guilty plea, while of course welcome, came belatedly. The question of mitigating credit for such a plea is not to be resolved mechanically but requires careful judicial evaluation, balancing the genuine acceptance of responsibility against the procedural economy realised. The statutory provisions underpinning this prosecution are well established. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof. The sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council, last amended in 2023, provide a structured approach to assessing harm, culpability, and aggravating or mitigating features. It is significant that the Court of Appeal has, in recent years, underscored the necessity of recognising the cumulative impact of serial offences even where each individual act may be of limited economic value. Reference may be made to the rulings in R v. Groves [2022] EWCA Crim 1337 and R v. Ellison [2023] EWCA Crim 1095, which clarified that repeated, targeted theft from multiple victims aggravates the overall harm and demands an appropriately calibrated sentence. These precedents caution against fragmentation of offending into artificially discrete episodes, thereby underestimating culpability. Furthermore, the case of R v. Sandford [2024] EWCA Crim 829 provided guidance on the limited scope of credit afforded for guilty pleas entered at a late stage, emphasising the importance of promoting early admissions to ease prosecutorial and witness burden. Significantly, sentencing considerations must also include reflection on the personal circumstances of the defendant, including age, prior convictions, and engagement with rehabilitative services. Nevertheless, the paramount concern remains the protection of the public and the maintenance of confidence in the rule of law. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. The facts as described reveal a deliberate and sustained pattern of conduct involving multiple opportunities to cease offending but a consistent choice to persist. The repeated targeting of premises likely to have limited security response, use of concealment techniques, and at times apparent evasion of surveillance by altering appearance speak to a degree of planning rather than spur-of-the-moment behaviour. It is also salient that, as exhibited in R v. Weller [2020] EWCA Crim 576, the psychological impact on retail staff must not be underestimated. While the offence lacks direct physical confrontation, the atmosphere of anxiety and disruption caused by persistent thefts has been repeatedly noted by those employed in vulnerable roles. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. The Crown's submissions emphasise not only the fiscal losses incurred but also the broader social and economic effects — diminished staff morale, increased operational costs, and, in some cases, the need for protective measures such as locked cabinets and increased security presence. These consequences bear on the resilience and sustainability of local retail enterprises, particularly smaller operators. A supplementary consideration concerns the cumulative prior contacts with the justice system. Your recorded antecedents include several convictions for shoplifting-related offences dating back to 2018, with the most recent being a conditional discharge in 2023. Community resolutions and diversion attempts have been documented, yet these measures have failed to effectuate desistance. In reckoning the context of sentencing, I have carefully reviewed psychiatric and psychological assessments commissioned at the defence's behest. Dr Imogen Pratt, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided a detailed report dated 15 September 2025. Her evaluation found no evidence of major mental disorder but noted traits of impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and a degree of substance misuse — principally of non-prescribed benzodiazepines and sporadic alcohol consumption. In particular, Dr Pratt highlighted a pattern of economic and social instability, frequent changes of address, and limited engagement with voluntary support provision. Whilst recognising the defendant’s expressed motivation to improve circumstances, Dr Pratt emphasised the absence of sustained positive steps to access employment or educational opportunities. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR), compiled by Senior Probation Officer Ms Harriet Collins on 1 October 2025, builds on these observations. It notes the defendant’s history of intermittent participation in community support programmes and dwelling in temporary accommodation provided by local authority emergency housing schemes. The PSR remarks on substantial underemployment and reliance on irregular benefits, contributing factors to financial pressure and decision-making complexity. The Probation Service, constrained by resourcing shortages and widespread caseload pressures, nonetheless attempts to maintain contact and promote engagement. However, Ms Collins candidly reports a pattern of sporadic compliance and withdrawal from arranged appointments, impeding efforts to facilitate rehabilitation. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. The defence’s written submissions have drawn attention to these mitigating personal factors, urging consideration of a community order supplemented by attendance at accredited offender behaviour programmes, cognitive skills training, and substance misuse counselling. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. Nonetheless, the court remains mindful that rehabilitation efforts must be balanced against the necessity of deterrence and public protection. The primary sentencing objective is not the alleviation of individual hardship alone but the safeguarding of society through appropriate sanctioning of criminal conduct. Among the procedural complexities encountered in this matter, I record with regret the delays occasioned by approval processes required for funding expert assessments under the Legal Aid Agency. Such bureaucratic obstacles are an increasing feature of modern criminal proceedings, resulting in extended timelines and additional expense. In particular, the defence application for funding to instruct Dr Pratt was lodged on 8 July 2025 but not approved until 12 August 2025, a period during which preparatory processes were effectively in abeyance. These delays, while regrettable, are not unique to this case and underscore broader systemic challenges within the administration of justice. It is also pertinent to note that the court has observed the increasing tendency for guilty pleas to be entered late in proceedings, often prompted by the accumulation of irrefutable evidence or strategic calculation. The law rightly incentivises early plea to conserve public resources and spare victims and witnesses further distress. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. This phenomenon does, however, complicate sentencing assessments. The precise degree of mitigation for a plea entered days or weeks before trial—and after full preparation of the case by prosecution and defence alike—must be carefully calibrated. Turning to the victims, statements provided by retail staff and local businesses have been carefully reviewed. Their expressed concerns encompass not only financial loss but an enduring sense of insecurity and vulnerability. Affecting morale and professional wellbeing, these impacts constitute an important element of harm. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. Chelsea Retail Ltd., a small chain whose premises were targeted on three occasions, submitted a detailed impact statement outlining increased operational costs related to security upgrades and the imposition of tighter inventory controls. These changes impose financial burdens ultimately borne by consumers and staff. It is worthwhile mentioning the increasingly common role taken by voluntary sector organisations such as ShopSafe UK, which provide victim support and liaison services. Such bodies operate frequently at the juncture of commercial enterprise and community policing, offering guidance on loss prevention and advocating on behalf of affected employers and staff. I express appreciation for the witness services coordinator, Ms Karen Blake, whose facilitation of victim impact statements ensures their voice is not lost amid the formality of legal proceedings. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. Looking beyond the immediate facts, the broader societal landscape is marked by rising incidents of urban deprivation, homelessness, and social dislocation. Public space itself faces unparalleled pressures: economic uncertainty compounded by the destabilising effects of pandemics, inflation, and welfare retrenchment. The court is mindful that these macro-level contexts do not excuse nor diminish personal accountability but provide background against which the patterns of offending emerge. The complex interactions of poverty, mental health, and social marginalisation require coordinated responses from statutory authorities, charitable organisations, and community stakeholders. At the same time, it remains a foundational principle that the justice system must ensure that criminality meets with appropriate sanction, irrespective of social backdrop. Relief from penal consequence is not automatic where hardship exists, nor may the court abdicate its duty to protect society by permitting wholesale discretion on grounds of personal circumstance alone. In conclusion, the court notes the composite nature of this case: a course of deliberate, prolonged offending causing tangible harm to individuals and businesses; a defendant facing serious social and psychological challenges yet with limited demonstrable engagement in self-help; compounded procedural delays external to the conduct itself. In this complex mix, the court must exercise measured discretion to achieve justice that is fair, proportionate, and efficacious. I will direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared, with particular attention to the suitability of community rehabilitation orders incorporating cognitive behavioural therapy, unpaid work requirements focused on victim-related projects, and supported access to housing and employment assistance. I reserve final sentencing for the formal hearing scheduled on 11 November 2025, pending receipt of any updated reports or representations. These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge D. L. Ford, issued today, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at Liverpool Crown Court. A formal transcript has been recorded under Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. B2025/13760 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. R. Ellington Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court charged with a representative count of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a period beginning in November 2023 through to April 2025, predominantly emerging in retail outlets across greater Bristol, particularly within the city centre and adjacent suburban precincts. The court acknowledges the multiplicity of incidents comprising a course of conduct rather than a singular isolated episode. Procedural Overview Your first appearance was before the magistrates’ court on 23 April 2025, following your arrest on 15 April 2025, which concluded a three-week investigation conducted by Bristol City Police Retail Crime Unit in conjunction with the local Business Crime Action Group. The latter is part of a multi-agency collaborative effort to address growing concerns over acquisitive crime in urban commercial zones. Initial charges were brought for theft on a number of separate dates, which, for efficiency, have been consolidated into a single representative offence for the purposes of this Crown Court trial and subsequent sentencing. The case management trajectory has involved multiple listings, including a plea and trial preparation hearing on 2 July 2025, during which you entered a not guilty plea. This plea was maintained until the morning of trial on 29 August 2025, when, upon the presentation of compelling evidence, you changed your plea to guilty. The court must observe that this timing of your guilty plea is indicative of a strategic decision rather than an early acceptance of responsibility and is therefore entitled to lesser credit under established jurisprudence. There have been a number of procedural adjournments relating to the procurement of expert psychiatric evidence and the completion of reports, including a delay attributed to the processing time of a Legal Aid funding application submitted by your defence counsel on 14 June 2025. The court again notes its ongoing concern regarding administrative delays within the Legal Aid system, which, while not a cause for adjournment in this instance, continue to impede efficient case progression. Notwithstanding these challenges, the various procedural hearings have all adhered, albeit narrowly, to the indicative timelines outlined within the Criminal Procedure Rules and the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol. On a related note, mention must be made of how this court has, in recent years, become increasingly encountered with cases arising under a new paradigm of retail crime enforcement known colloquially as the “CitySafe Initiative,” a joint venture between local authorities, police forces, and business coalitions aimed at intelligence-led crime prevention. Your case forms part of a broader pattern noted in recent monthly taskforce reports, which identify an uptick in opportunistic and repeat shoplifting offences as a significant challenge to urban order and retail viability. The administrative burden borne by local policing teams in collating data for these initiatives is considerable and often requires diverting resources away from other pressing community concerns, including the investigative management of violent and organised crime groups. This diversionary effect is of practical concern to the court's assessment of the broader implications of persistent acquisitive offending. In anticipation of today’s sentencing hearing, the court has received a detailed pre-sentence report compiled by Ms Angela Beckett, a probation officer with over ten years of experience in the Southwest region. The report is thorough and incorporates multi-source information, including your recent psychological assessment conducted by Dr Michael Jenner, a consultant forensic psychologist with recognised expertise in acquisitive offending. The interplay of these professional inputs provides an essential evidential framework upon which the court must carefully deliberate appropriate sentencing options. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. The court is also mindful of the context within which these offences occurred: the retail sector in Bristol, like many urban centres in England, continues to evolve amid significant commercial flux. Legal pressures around online sales, post-pandemic footfall declines, and increasing operating costs have placed independent and chain shops alike under strain. This economic backdrop compounds the impact of loss through theft, as even low-value items cumulatively impose a substantial financial and operational toll. Indeed, the director of one outlet represented via written victim impact statements conveyed how recurring theft had necessitated a reduction in staffing levels and reconfiguration of store layouts, including the installation of additional security measures at considerable expense. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. The court recognises that these material impacts have human consequences. Staff frequently report heightened anxiety and fear, reflecting not merely the immediate loss but also the perceived vulnerability to repeat offending. Some employees have resorted to requesting alterations to shift patterns or even transferring out of particular shops. The psychological effect of persistent retail theft on frontline workers has been the subject of recent criminological study, which found correlations between repeated victimisation and emotional distress, diminished job satisfaction, and increased staff turnover. Such findings add weight to the aggravating nature of the offending before the court, despite the absence of violence or direct threats to persons. Dr Jenner’s assessment, dated 15 August 2025, concludes that you do not meet criteria for any major Axis I psychiatric diagnosis; however, he notes marked impulsiveness and low frustration tolerance. He identifies patterns consistent with mild to moderate substance use disorder, primarily concerning alcohol, which has been intermittently reported over the past two years. The report postulates that these factors may have contributed to your offending behaviour but cautions against excessive reliance on such considerations as mitigation. Dr Jenner also highlights a limited engagement with prior support offers: despite referral opportunities for substance misuse counselling and benefits advice, your cooperation has been sporadic and inconsistent. It may be said, of course, that your personal circumstances must be understood within a broader socio-economic framework marked by rising food insecurity, cuts to welfare provisions, and an acute shortage of affordable housing. Public institutions tasked with addressing such complex social needs have, over the past decade, faced chronic underfunding and have struggled to meet demand. While sympathetic to these challenges, the court must balance these realities with the imperatives of public safety and deterrence. An arrest on 15 April 2025 followed local intelligence gathering, which incorporated CCTV review, retail crime logs, and field observations by the police neighbourhood team. In its procedural documentation, the prosecution highlights that the investigation was aided by a forensic analysis conducted by the Bristol Digital Forensic Unit, which examined footage collected across multiple retail outlets. This practice of aggregating diverse data sources is emblematic of modern policing techniques yet also brings with it the attendant risks of information overload and resource strain. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. The structure of your offending suggests a degree of planning, notably in selection of targets which are small to medium independent retailers with historically minimal security presence. Such predilection aligns with known modus operandi identified in recent academic literature, which notes a shift from large supermarket chains to fragmented retail environments as sites for theft, precisely due to their comparatively weaker surveillance regimes. The court is called to consider that these calculated choices reflect conscious decisions rather than impulsive indiscretions. It must be added that the operational partnership between the Bristol Business Crime Taskforce and the local Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) has, over the past two years, expanded its remit to cover repeat shoplifting offences, in recognition of their cumulative effect on community cohesion. Though traditionally MAPPA has been associated with violent and sexual offenders, this broadening underlines the evolving nature of public safety threats. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. The probation report further chronicles your prior contact with the criminal justice system. You have three previous convictions for theft-related offences, dated between 2017 and 2022, all resulting in non-custodial disposals: community orders with unpaid work requirements and a conditional discharge. It is of particular note that despite clear warnings and opportunities afforded by probation supervision, your pattern of behaviour has persisted with limited evidence of sustained behavioural change. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. An earlier offence in 2022 involved theft from a local pharmacy where, as has been contemporaneously reported, your actions caused heightened security concerns among staff, leading to calls for increased police attention. The recurrence of similar offending following these incidents reflects a failure to respond adequately to prior intervention efforts. The court acknowledges the efforts of Mr Oliver Trent, your instructing solicitor, who has provided diligent representation throughout. It is, lamentably, all too common that such efforts are hampered by systemic constraints within the Legal Aid Agency, an issue of which this court has repeatedly taken judicial notice. The present case saw delays in approval for a psychiatric expert instruction, a regrettable and recurring administrative inefficiency that impedes timely justice and undermines confidence in the system. In the same vein, the court notes with concern the recent increasing frequency of adjournments attributable not to substantive defence argument but to logistical difficulties in securing court listing dates due to staff shortages and knock-on effects of protracted strike action affecting court personnel. These systemic pressures contribute to delayed resolutions and must be factored into broader reflections on the justice system’s capacity to deliver expedient outcomes. It is of course the law that every defendant is entitled to a full and fair opportunity to contest allegations. Your defence counsel has maintained your right to full representation and has rightly raised matters of personal circumstance, including housing precarity and intermittent engagement with mental health services. Letters of support submitted on your behalf from ShelterWest, a local homelessness outreach charity, emphasise your recent struggles with accommodation instability and financial hardship. They note your partial but inconsistent participation in offered support and underline that your current social situation is precarious. While these matters are relevant insofar as they inform an understanding of circumstances, it is of particular importance that such factors do not detract from the objective assessment of offending behaviour and public safety considerations. The law remains clear that hardship, while worthy of consideration, does not excuse criminality. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. The court must apply the sentencing framework outlined in the Theft Act 1968, supported by guidance provided by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences (issued 2020, last updated 2024). The principal purposes of sentencing here include punishment, deterrence (both individual and general), rehabilitation, and the protection of the public. In R v. Robinson [2019] EWCA Crim 1825, a case involving repeated retail theft over a two-year period, the Court of Appeal held that escalation to immediate custody is justified where persistent offending demonstrates disregard for previous warnings and imposes significant harm on victims and communities. The court also referred to R v. Bellamy [2021] EWCA Crim 1512, reinforcing that the psychological impact on retail employees, the economic consequences for small businesses, and the drain on law enforcement resources collectively aggravate the seriousness of shoplifting offences, even when individual incidents are of low monetary value. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. Notwithstanding relevant mitigating factors such as your early cooperative engagement post-arrest and absence of violence or intimidation, it is the pattern of sustained offending and the failure to comply with antecedent court orders that inform this court’s stance on custodial threshold. The court also considers the guidance in R v. Stevens [2022] EWCA Crim 2125, a case where a defendant with substance misuse issues and housing instability was sentenced to a community order with a rehabilitative focus, subject to strict conditions and enforcement of unpaid work. While such an approach is laudable where evidence suggests genuine engagement and absence of ongoing risk, it cannot be universally applied. The persistent pattern of infringement displayed here counsels a sterner response, albeit tempered by acknowledgement of your vulnerabilities. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. Victim impact statements submitted by several retail employees convey the unsettling effects of repeated theft upon their sense of safety and professional well-being. Several report heightened anxiety and a reluctance to work alone during certain hours due to fear of repeat offences. These submissions are supported by the response of the Retail Support and Recovery Network, a voluntary-sector organisation engaged in victim advocacy, which emphasises the cumulative psychological toll of such offending on vulnerable staff groups. I note that the North Bristol Civic Partnership, which provides complementary outreach to affected businesses, has called for increased investment in crime prevention initiatives and restorative engagement schemes. Their commentary highlights the erosion of trust felt by small businesses confronting persistent theft and notes that this case falls within a troubling trend of escalating shoplifting impacting local economies and community stability. This court is grateful to the staff of the Crown Court registry who, despite recent refurbishment works causing temporary disruption in courtroom accessibility and scheduling, have ensured the smooth conduct of today’s hearing. Thanks are also extended to court usher Mr Timothy Jones for maintaining order discreetly and effectively. Notwithstanding procedural delays occasioned by national postal strikes which impacted the timely delivery of written materials to the court, no substantial prejudice arose. The court took note of communications received from the Probation Service acknowledging a strain on resettlement resources owing to the cumulative increase in complex offenders serving custodial sentences, including those with co-morbid mental health and substance use difficulties. The exploitation of limited rehabilitative and housing allocation services is a chronic issue being addressed at regional forums, though with mixed success. Mr H, the court must approach sentencing with a view to balancing the gravity of repeated theft, the impact on victims and community safety, and your personal circumstances, including health and social vulnerabilities. The representations submitted from supporting agencies are noted and appreciated for their candour and realism. I stress once again the principle that a sentence must serve the public interest. It must send a clear message that persistent dishonesty carries consequences, while, wherever practicable, rehabilitative opportunities should be fostered to reduce the risk of reoffending. The input of probation colleagues and psychological experts will be critical in shaping a final sentence that is both proportionate and constructive. At this point, I will await the formal pre-sentence report which should integrate the most recent psychiatric evaluations alongside a comprehensive risk and needs assessment. I direct that the report consider, inter alia, the appropriateness of community orders incorporating cognitive skills interventions, substance misuse treatment, and financial management programmes, alongside any custodial dispositions deemed proportionate. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to relevant authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT KENNINGTON R v. MR H Case No. C2025/04159 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. V. Carroway Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced in respect of charges concerning theft from retail premises, offences committed contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. Your conduct is said to have occurred over a protracted period spanning from late 2023 to the early months of 2025, with multiple incidents reported principally in the Kennington and Westminster areas, targeting various small to medium-sized retail establishments. Procedural History The charging process began with your arrest on 29 March 2025. This followed a considerable period of investigative work carried out jointly by the Kennington Neighbourhood Policing Team and officers affiliated with the local Business Crime Reduction Initiative. The pattern of offending, whilst initially recorded as isolated, gradually revealed itself to be a sustained campaign of shoplifting, affecting several independent retailers and chain outlets alike. The coordination required across these distinct agencies demonstrated a commendable mobilisation of local criminal justice resources, given increasing strains on frontline staff. It is important to underline that the investigation which led to your arrest was complex and resource-intensive. Officers undertook a large amount of time-consuming evidence collation, including the analysis of extensive CCTV footage, the gathering of witness statements from retail staff — many of whom operate under significant pressures and turnover — and the integration of intelligence from the Safer Streets Partnership. These investigative steps were not straightforward, given the notoriously low resolution and fragmentary nature of much retail surveillance footage. The challenge of assembling a sufficient evidentiary basis for charge cannot be overstated. Cases involving non-violent acquisitive crime often absorb a disproportionate amount of policing hours, despite the comparatively modest material values at stake. Yet these are not matters to be treated lightly: the cumulative effect on businesses, their employees, and the wider community is significant. The court also recognises, regrettably, that funding constraints within the Legal Aid Agency caused a regrettable delay in approving defence representation and expert report applications, extending the pre-trial stage beyond usual expectations. Such systemic hurdles impair the right to fair and prompt justice – a situation of deep concern to this bench that sadly recurs with alarming frequency. At a plea and case management hearing conducted on 12 June 2025, you initially entered a not guilty plea. However, following the disclosure of detailed digital evidence and further witness statements — including from managers within multiple affected premises — you altered your plea to guilty on the morning of the trial date, 2 October 2025. Late change of pleas, whilst not unusual, attract scrutiny in these circumstances. The reduction in sentence credit available, as established by the Court of Appeal in R v. Darlington [2022] EWCA Crim 317, is necessarily more limited when the plea follows substantial prosecution evidence and significant preparatory work by the court and witnesses. This principle is consistent with the requirement that early acceptance of responsibility is to be encouraged and rewarded, not belated tactical acquiescence. In preparation for sentencing, the court has received reports from the probation service and an independent psychiatric evaluation instructed pursuant to the defence’s application. I take this opportunity to thank Ms Enid Pollock, probation officer, and Dr Victor Al-Masri, consultant forensic psychiatrist, for their detailed and professionally prepared assessments. Their contributions have been instrumental in assisting the court to form a holistic understanding of your personal circumstances, mental health, and risk profile. I must also commend the efforts of retail staff and local voluntary organisations for their ongoing engagement throughout these proceedings. Many individuals operate within under-resourced and high-stress environments, yet have contributed constructive victim impact statements. It is right to acknowledge the often overlooked emotional and psychological toll borne by those affected by repeated retail theft, frequently on modest incomes, and working long hours to maintain essential community services. The court further notes submissions made on your behalf regarding accommodation instability, financial hardship, and sporadic engagement with voluntary sector support. Correspondence from the Kennington Homelessness Support Collective details repeated contacts with you over the past year, expressing both concern and readiness to offer assistance. An exchange of letters between your sister, Mrs Janice M., and your defence solicitor was submitted, highlighting familial difficulties but also offering words of encouragement towards rehabilitation. These materials have been given due consideration. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. It must be recorded that notwithstanding the mitigating narratives tendered, the offence itself possesses a gravity not to be underestimated. The Crown has identified a clear and persistent pattern of offending, demonstrating deliberate intent, planning, and a repeated willingness to disregard law and order. Recalling the well-established sentencing principles articulated in R v. Bristol [2019] EWCA Crim 870, the court must balance the seriousness of the conduct, its effect on victims, and the community, against your personal circumstances and prospects for rehabilitation. Sentencing for theft offences requires careful consideration of both individual culpability and the wider public interest in deterring repetition. In that vein, the sentencing guidelines published by the Sentencing Council for theft (Effective from March 2024) highlight the aggravating factors relevant here: the frequency and persistence of your conduct, the targeting of vulnerable small businesses, and the adverse impact upon shop employees’ wellbeing and workplace safety perceptions. Mitigation is offered primarily through your contrition, as evidenced by the guilty plea, and certain personal difficulties. The court is also mindful of relevant appellate authorities, including the detailed analysis in R v. Walker [2023] EWCA Crim 1405, where repeated thefts from community-run stores formed the basis for a custodial sentence with an emphasis on rehabilitation. Attention to the structured community interventions recommended in that case may be instructive. However, a strict comparison must be avoided given factual differences and local contextual considerations. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. At the case management hearing on 21 August 2025, the court was provided with an updated pre-sentence assessment prepared by Ms Pollock. She noted, among other matters, the difficulties encountered in establishing sustained engagement given your history of erratic contact and unaddressed psychological vulnerabilities. In the course of her report, she highlighted the challenges facing probation services, staffing shortfalls, and increasing caseloads that hamper personalised intervention efforts. The Kennington Probation Office operates under considerable pressure, with a reduction in available rehabilitation resources and a lengthening wait-list for cognitive behavioural programmes addressing acquisitive offending. It is a regrettable reality that public service capacity often lags behind demand, and those seeking assistance find their pathways congested. The court’s hope is that, post-sentencing, you will fully commit to any rehabilitative measures identified as appropriate, both for your benefit and the protection of the public. I also reference the recent inquiry into the administration of court support services, which has brought to light systemic difficulties in maintaining interpreter availability, despite significant efforts to ensure inclusivity. This has, on occasion, resulted in adjournments or suboptimal communications which impede fair process. While not directly applicable here, such issues contextualise the operational environment in which criminal proceedings unfold. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. Turning to the psychiatric assessment, Dr Al-Masri observed no evidence of a major mental illness or cognitive impairment sufficient to mitigate criminal responsibility. Nonetheless, he noted features consistent with borderline personality disorder traits, including impulsivity and difficulties in emotional regulation. The report carefully emphasises the need for ongoing mental health support, but cautions that these do not detract from accountability for calculated criminal acts. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. It is pertinent to remark that, while the court is acutely aware of the significant pressure placed upon mental health services nationally — including stretched NHS community teams, long waiting lists for therapeutic interventions, and regional disparities in service provision — the fact remains that the existence of unmet need does not diminish the seriousness of offending. That tension between vulnerability and responsibility is among the more challenging aspects of sentencing in contemporary jurisprudence and must be addressed with nuance and care. This court also receives representations from the Retail Victim Support Unit, which submitted a comprehensive impact statement on behalf of affected businesses. The report emphasises not only economic loss due to shrinkage and stock replacement, but also the psychological impact on individual employees, citing increased stress, fear, and reduced job satisfaction. I echo the courts’ recognition of these indirect harms which, while less readily quantifiable, are no less real. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. The court has considered the parameters of sentencing set forth in the Theft Act and relevant guideline judgments. You are an adult aged 35, with a prior record including three recorded convictions for shop theft, the most recent of which resulted in a conditional discharge imposed in 2021 following a police caution. I am conscious of the importance, emphasized in R v. Thomason [2022] EWCA Crim 1107, of not allowing previous disposals to be treated as procedural absolution where conduct persists. Repeated failure to desist strongly underlines the need for a sentence commensurate with both punitive objectives and public protection. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. Your case has been handled under the Better Case Management protocol, which aims to expedite court proceedings and reduce unnecessary trial delays. While this framework has been largely effective procedurally, this court notes with regret that various administrative setbacks, particularly those tied to the legal aid process, have induced substantial delay. It cannot be overemphasised how these bureaucratic obstructions impose costs upon all participants — defendants, counsel, victims, and the court alike. I also place on record the cooperation demonstrated by the Crown Prosecution Service, and thank Miss Georgina Ashworth for her diligent and precise presentation of the prosecution case. On your behalf, Mr Calloway Hyde QC’s advocacy was measured and thoughtful, and he deserves the court’s gratitude for his skilful and considered submissions throughout. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. It is observed that you currently reside without permanent accommodation, utilising temporary hostel arrangements maintained by the Kennington Housing Support Network. While this situation undoubtedly exacerbates your vulnerability, housing insecurity alone cannot excuse the breaches of the law before me. Yet this court is aware of the substantial increase in homelessness and rough sleeping across London, a matter of serious social concern and policy challenge. In this respect, the court acknowledges the ongoing efforts of multiple charities and local authorities to respond to an unprecedented demand that far outstrips resource availability. Alongside this, the strain on public mental health services, youth offending teams, and probation agencies creates a systemic environment of fragility, which may contribute to cycles of offending and recidivism. Nonetheless, courts must balance compassion with the imperative to maintain social order and protect the interests of victims. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. Having outlined the salient features of your offending, personal circumstances, and expert assessments, the court turns now to sentencing options. Given the pattern, persistence, and impact of your conduct, a custodial sentence is certainly within the range of reasonable outcomes. However, the mitigating factors — particularly your guilty plea, the likelihood of reduced credit resulting from its timing, and identified personal vulnerabilities — must also be weighed carefully. The sentencing guideline encourages the consideration of community orders incorporating rehabilitative requirements, including cognitive skills development, substance misuse treatment where relevant, and accommodation support. This court will request a comprehensive pre-sentence report from probation to assist in tailoring an appropriate disposal. The goal is to maximise opportunities for rehabilitation and reduce the risk of further offending. While community interventions serve important functions, the court must remain vigilant to the reality that a failure to impose sufficient deterrence can embolden repeat offending, to the detriment of public confidence and the fabric of community safety. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at Kennington Crown Court. The proceedings have been duly recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be communicated to the relevant authorities in accordance with statutory requirements. You have the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days, under the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved for determination. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. B2025/13859 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. A. Fenwick Filed: 18 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this Honourable Court for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge of theft pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely shoplifting from various retail premises across the greater Bristol area. The offending is found to extend over a protracted time frame, beginning in late 2023 and continuing unabated into early 2025. Procedural Context Your initial arrest occurred on 10 March 2025 after a concerted investigative effort by the Bristol Metropolitan Police Business Crime Unit working in tandem with the Bristol Retailers Alliance and local Trading Standards officers. It bears noting that the nature of the investigation, although commensurate with the seriousness ascribed to the charge, involved extensive collation of material evidence including hours of video surveillance, detailed witness statements, and coordination with criminal data analysts specialising in recidivist patterns of acquisitive crime. The operational commitment of front-line officers across multiple shifts, coupled with the input of digital forensic examiners employed by the West of England Forensic Information Service, was both significant and resource-intensive. Such matters are reflective of an approach consistent with regional policing priorities aimed at the suppression of retail and low-level property crime, seeking to prevent the escalation of such conduct into more serious and violent offending. It cannot be overstated that the deployment of such assets diverts crucial capacity from other areas of policing that also bear upon public safety, including investigations into serious violent crime, organised criminality, and anti-social behaviour hotspots. The court is therefore acutely aware of the systemic strain posed by persistent shoplifting offences that, although often characterised as minor individually, collectively impose a substantial burden on the criminal justice system and retail economy alike. The initial charge was brought following your interview under caution on 11 March 2025, where, contrary to later admissions, you denied any wrongdoing. It was only after further evidential developments, including identification via facial recognition software deployed pursuant to a judicially sanctioned search warrant, that the prosecution felt able to proceed. The case has since been managed under the auspices of the Better Case Management scheme, with listed pre-trial hearings held on 22 April and 8 July. These proceedings were punctuated by adjournments, one occasion owing to your counsel’s application for a psychiatric evaluation, another resulting from late disclosure of certain surveillance footage. The court must acknowledge the pressures exerted on criminal justice agencies occasioned by current resource constraints. Amongst these, it is regrettable to record that the Legal Aid Agency has been markedly slow in processing your defence team’s requests for funding to instruct expert evidence, resulting in adjournments that delayed resolution of an otherwise straightforward matter. This court remains hopeful that forthcoming reforms will address these procedural inefficiencies, which too frequently serve to prolong proceedings to the detriment of all parties. The Theft Act 1968 remains the cornerstone of English property offence law, defining theft in section 1 as “the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.” Shoplifting, while frequently perceived as falling towards the less serious end of the spectrum, is elevated in consequence where it forms part of a deliberate and persistent pattern. The Sentencing Council’s 2016 guideline on theft offences underlines several aggravating features pertinent to such conduct, including the targeting of vulnerable premises, the exploitation of staff vulnerabilities, and the cumulative impact on victims. In R v Aldridge [2019] EWCA Crim 507, the Court reiterated that serial shoplifting offences, particularly where motivated by personal gain and involving sophistication or planning, warrant custodial sentences to reflect and deter such conduct. Aldridge involved a defendant who had, over a similar timeframe, appropriated goods from multiple outlets and was sentenced to a term of twelve months’ imprisonment, with the court noting the particular vulnerability of smaller shopkeepers to economic harm. By contrast, the case of R v Langley [2022] EWCA Crim 1552 emphasised the importance of considering personal mitigation, including mental health issues and social deprivation, where these could be shown to directly influence offending behaviour. Although Langley concerned a lesser scale of offending, the principle of nuanced sentencing where vulnerability is present remains well established. Against this backdrop, the court navigates a careful path between the imperatives of public protection and rehabilitation. The impacts on retail staff and proprietors cannot be overstated. The evidence before the court includes detailed victim impact statements provided by managers of two pharmacies and a convenience store located in the BS1 postcode, who describe the emotional toll and operational disruption caused by your repeated offending. Staff report heightened anxiety, persistent feelings of insecurity, and significant operational changes including increased security measures and altered shift patterns to mitigate risk exposure. Notably, the Bristol Retailers Alliance has submitted observations outlining the downstream effects on customer confidence and the broader business environment within the locality. These submissions commend the seriousness with which the police and trading standards approach such cases but also underscore the limitations faced by retailers in preventing ongoing losses amidst constrained budgets and limited security infrastructure. Correspondence from the Bristol Homeless Outreach Network, while tangential, is also demonstrated in the court papers. This correspondence highlights the wider socio-economic challenges in the area, including rising street homelessness and substance misuse, which, while not directly attributable to you, form part of the complex backdrop within which such offences occur. The court acknowledges the nuanced relationship between social deprivation and offending but stresses that these factors do not diminish personal responsibility. Your counsel made an application on 5 July 2025 for the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report, encompassing risk assessment, suitability for community-based interventions, and an evaluation of underlying social and psychological factors. The court granted this, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive sentencing options consistent with the principles of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, addressing both punishment and rehabilitation. An independent psychiatric assessment was commissioned with instructions to Dr Fiona M. Labotsky, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, who furnished a detailed report dated 20 September 2025. Her observations note the absence of any major psychiatric disorder, while highlighting personality traits marked by impulsivity and limited insight into the consequences of your actions. Substance misuse history is documented but not currently active; financial hardship and unstable living conditions are also emphasised as contributory. It is important to remind all parties that the presence of such difficulties, while warranting consideration, rarely negates culpability, particularly where offending patterns demonstrate calculation and persistence. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. Within the courthouse walls, the question of your motivations, modus operandi, and the precise nature and sequence of offending form the crux of factual determination. The Crown’s case, supported by extensive CCTV footage and corroborated by several eyewitness accounts, conveys a methodical approach to theft, involving repeated visits to multiple stores during peak hours, often employing distraction techniques to facilitate concealment of goods. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. Importantly, these actions were not isolated incidents but part of an identifiable pattern, with several stores impacted multiple times over several months. This reflects both a troubling disregard for the impact on victims and an entrenched risk of continuing behaviour of the same kind. The defence contends that your conduct was influenced by acute financial distress compounded by untenable housing conditions. It is posited that engagement with support services has been inconsistent due to difficulties navigating complex bureaucratic pathways. While these points are not lightly disregarded, the court must weigh them alongside the evidence of deliberate, repeated offending and apparent refusal to desist despite warnings and diversion attempts. Intriguingly, the court must also consider the context of operational policing dynamics in Bristol and the wider South West region. Recently, it has been noted by official audits from the Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner that staff vacancies and high turnover rates within civilian analyst roles have affected case preparation times. This has had the unfortunate consequence of delaying evidential submissions for several complex investigations, including some high-profile cybercrime prosecutions. While your case is unrelated to these digital offences, it serves as a reminder that justice operates within a human system subject to strain and limitation. Equally, operational constraints during the recent summer months, including industrial action by court clerical staff, contributed to listing delays. A hearing originally scheduled for 29 August was vacated, adding several weeks to the timeline of this matter. Such procedural vicissitudes are, regrettably, a familiar feature of contemporary criminal justice administration. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. The court notes, with regret, the increasingly common and troubling trend of defendants awaiting the eve of trial or sentencing to enter guilty pleas. This pattern imposes additional burdens upon victim witnesses, the prosecution, and the court system itself. Public trust in the administration of justice is enhanced when responsibility is admitted at the earliest practicable stage, affording victims a degree of closure and reducing the trauma of protracted proceedings. The relevant guidelines, including the Sentencing Council's Definitive Guideline on Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea (effective 2017), are unequivocal in stating that credit for such pleas diminishes as the point of entry nears trial or sentencing. This is a principle reaffirmed in R v. Kingswell [2019] EWCA Crim 144, where the Court of Appeal declined to extend full credit where the plea was entered at the last moment, deeming such conduct at best tactical. I therefore approach the assessment of your plea with some reserve. Two separate accounts from shop floor employees, submitted by the Victim Support Service, reflect heightened occupational stress and a sense of insecurity owing to repeat thefts. One victim details adjustments to service delivery hours and increased reliance on CCTV at great cost. The economic and emotional toll on these individuals is not abstract; it is vivid, personal, and impactful. Additionally, letters of support for your rehabilitation were received from the Bristol Outreach Project and a social worker assigned to your case. Both commend your sincerity and commitment to engage with support mechanisms, and express hope for constructive intervention. These submissions merit due consideration and have been appended to the pre-sentence report file. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. Inspection of your antecedent record reveals a series of prior convictions for similar offences dating back to 2017, interspersed with periods of apparent compliance. Notably, you were subject to a conditional discharge following a conviction in 2022, an absence of custody on that occasion reflecting the court’s willingness to provide you with opportunity to reform. The persistence of theft offending despite prior community orders and warnings indicates both a challenging propensity towards recidivism and a clear need for effective intervention. Cross-References to Other Cases and Legal Precedents In the wider jurisprudential landscape, the Court underlines the relevance of R v. Marques [2023] EWCA Crim 1122, where the defendant’s continuous series of shoplifting offences culminated in a 12-month custodial sentence, taking into account prior unsuccessful diversion efforts. Furthermore, in R v. Sallis [2020] EWCA Crim 1634, the Court emphasised that repeated acquisitive offences undermine public confidence in local law enforcement and damage community cohesion, particularly when committed against small businesses. While these cases do not align perfectly with the specifics of your conduct, they provide valuable legal context shaping sentencing approaches to offending of this nature. The court has also reviewed commentary from the Institute of Criminology, reflecting upon the societal challenges posed by low-level acquisitive crime and systemic underinvestment in preventative social measures. Despite these broader themes, the ultimate responsibility for your actions rests squarely with you. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. The Pre-Sentence Report and Psychiatric Assessment jointly recommend that if a custodial sentence is imposed, consideration be given to concurrent Structured Offender Management with targeted cognitive behavioural programmes, aimed at addressing impulsive decision-making and improving awareness of victim impact. Conversely, where sentencing options allow, pursuit of viable community rehabilitation pathways coupled with robust supervision might facilitate an effective reduction in reoffending risk. Nonetheless, given the repeat nature of offending despite prior interventions, community options alone appear, at best, fraught with uncertainty. It is worth observing the challenges faced by probation services nationally, as reflected in recent reports by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation, which highlight chronic staffing shortages and high caseloads that may impede consistent delivery of rehabilitative programmes. While these system pressures are not reasons to dilute sentencing standards, they do influence the practical framing of post-sentence management strategies. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. The Court has also noted a letter from your sister, Ms Bernice H, dated 30 September 2025, attesting to your affected mental health, sporadic employment, and recent housing instability. While the court recognises the value of familial support in rehabilitation, it reserves judgment on the extent to which these factors mitigate culpability. In an ancillary matter, brief mention was made during the pre-trial hearings of your prior association with an individual currently under investigation for benefit fraud. I reiterate that there is no allegation connecting you to these matters, and they play no part in these sentencing considerations. Similarly, an unrelated incident involving a co-defendant in a separate case, including charges of affray and possession of an offensive weapon, was referenced in police briefing notes but bears no relevance here. The presence of such co-offenders or others with criminal records should not, and does not, prejudice your individual assessment. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. This court is aware of the pressures on the retail sector occasioned by increased theft and the related phenomenon of fly-tipping in retail delivery zones, which has grown by 15% over the past year according to Bristol City Council reports. This environmental concern, while serious, is distinct from the conduct currently before me. Recognition is also due to the professionalism of the Crown Prosecution Service advocates and the dedication of defence counsel in navigating a case complicated by framing delays and voluminous disclosure. I record my thanks to Ms Eleanor Bedwell for the Crown and Mr Theodore Merrick for the defence, whose conduct has upheld the high standards expected in these proceedings. The Sentencing Council guidelines direct courts to approach theft offences with reference to credit for guilty pleas, any previous convictions, the totality of the offending, and the harm caused. Aggravating features such as repeated offending, targeting of particular vulnerable victims, and the failure to desist after previous warnings weigh heavily towards a custodial outcome. Such determinations are, however, balanced against mitigating factors including the defendant’s personal circumstances, the potential for rehabilitation, and the necessity to impose a proportionate sentence reflecting public interest. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. In light of the foregoing, I am satisfied that the charge before the court represents a course of conduct marked by persistence, intentionality, and disregard for the consequences to others. The late plea offered does not attract full credit, consistent with established authority. Your personal circumstances and willingness to engage with rehabilitation, as reflected in reports and family statements, are noted but insufficient to override the factors warranting a custodial sentence or serious community controls. The court intends, as noted at commencement, to adjourn to allow receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report that will weigh rehabilitative prospects, risk management options, and sentencing recommendations. I reserve the decision on your sentence until that material is before me. You should be aware that all avenues will be considered, including a custodial sentence with bespoke community elements, designed to maximise public protection and your potential for reform. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 October 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal transcript will be disseminated to all relevant agencies. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal conviction or sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 section 49. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT AT WAPPING R v. Mr H Case No. C2025/01473 Sentencing Remarks — Her Honour Judge M. J. Ellington Filed: 17 August 2025 Mr H, you come before this honourable court for sentence following your conviction for theft, specifically a charge qualifying as shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans several months and involves multiple retail premises within the greater London postal areas, principally in the East End and adjacent boroughs. Your case contains elements illustrative of the ongoing challenges faced by courts in adjudicating acquisitive crimes committed by individuals with complex social circumstances. Procedural Background Your initial appearance was recorded on 11 February 2025 at the Thames Magistrates’ Court sitting in Stratford. At that hearing you entered a plea of not guilty. The case was expedited to this Crown Court under Better Case Management (BCM) protocols, listing a plea and case management hearing for 15 May 2025. These procedures, introduced in section 3 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, aim to facilitate early resolution and promote efficiency in court proceedings, particularly in cases such as these which often attract considerable judicial attention and require management of multiple evidential strands. It is a regrettable but familiar observation that court listings remain under significant pressure, resulting in unavoidable delays. The current backlog affecting London Crown Courts is well documented in official Justice Department reports stretching back over the last eighteen months. A combination of judicial vacancies, case volume surges post-pandemic, and staff recruitment challenges have compounded these dynamics. The result has been multiple adjournments across a wide array of cases involving theft and other property offences, notwithstanding diligent efforts by court staff and legal practitioners to mitigate disruption. I record my thanks to Ms Sophie Granger, counsel for the Crown, for her comprehensive submissions and for the timely disclosure of evidence; and to Mr Benjamin Faulkner, appearing on your behalf, instructed under a representation order granted by Legal Aid. It must be said that there were regrettable but not uncharacteristic delays arising from the processing of Legal Aid applications for instruction of a forensic psychologist, notwithstanding early and repeated requests. Such procedural complexities pose distinct challenges in this jurisdiction, where access to expert input is frequently a prerequisite for informed sentencing decisions, particularly in cases indicative of underlying vulnerabilities. The Criminal Procedure Rules emphasise that while expediency is a goal, it should never detract from a fair and just process. Unfortunately, in the current climate, cases such as this serve as a reminder of the continuing tension between efficiency and thoroughness in the administration of justice. It is of note, and the court wishes to acknowledge, that local police forces continue to be stretched by broader societal challenges. The recent surge in reports of street homelessness, public begging, and associated antisocial behaviour have unsettled community cohesion. These social issues are frequently intertwined and often disproportionately impact individuals who commit acquisitive offences such as shoplifting, either as direct contributors or as contextual factors. This collateral dimension, although not determinative of culpability, informs a holistic understanding of the pressures underpinning the offending behaviours we must consider. Your case was scheduled for trial on 18 and 19 July 2025 but was resolved by a change of plea on the first day of what would otherwise have been contested proceedings. This is a pattern increasingly seen in shoplifting cases within this jurisdiction. Defendants often maintain a not guilty plea pending the strength of the evidence, only to capitulate once the prosecution’s case—based on CCTV, witness statements, and recovered property—is incontrovertible. Late guilty pleas are recognised by the courts to have limited mitigation effect as established in R v McIntosh [2019] EWCA Crim 1429, a case involving a substantial fraud in the Midlands. The Court of Appeal in that instance reiterated that credit for a plea is invariably linked to the timing and basis on which the plea is entered, and not simply its existence. This principle was further expounded upon in the recent case of R v Clifford [2024] EWCA Crim 581, reinforcing that tactical pleas entered at the preliminary trial stage offer only minimal discount, as they do little to reduce the distress faced by witnesses or the administrative burden placed on the justice system. In parallel, there has been troubling national commentary regarding the perceived normalisation of low-level acquisitive crime, such as shoplifting, in policy debates. It merits reiteration that the law imposes no minimum threshold for what may constitute serious theft contrary to the Theft Act 1968. Each case is assessed on its facts, including the harm caused to victims and the intentions of the defendant, irrespective of monetary quantification alone. National data compiled by the Retail Theft Monitoring Unit notes a gradually increasing trend in shoplifting offences over the past decade, particularly affecting small, independent retailers lacking the resources of larger chains. This pattern has repercussions both economically and socially, with staff frequently reporting anxiety and diminished morale after repeat burglaries of stock, losses, and episodic confrontations. The Theft Act 1968 remains the legislative cornerstone of offences under consideration here. The definition of theft as ‘dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving’ is unambiguous. Sentencing, guided by the Sentencing Council’s definitive Theft Offences guideline, calls for careful weighing of factors, including the value and nature of the goods, the impact on victims, recurrence of offending, use of deception, and aggravating or mitigating circumstances. This court acknowledges recent appellate decisions — R v. Ellison [2021] EWCA Crim 1751 — where the Court upheld custodial sentences for persistent shoplifting offences causing distress and disruption beyond mere financial loss, including to victims’ sense of security and livelihood. Consistently, the courts reflect the need to send a clear message discouraging repeated acquisitive offending which undermines public confidence and trust. I would also refer to the decision in R v. Dunbar [2022] EWCA Crim 565, a case involving multiple offences of theft from a chain of pharmacies. The defendant in Dunbar was sentenced to a community order with rehabilitation requirements, reflecting a nuanced approach when vulnerability and engagement with support services were demonstrated. That case, while instructive on sentencing options, is factually distinguishable from the present offence. Parallels may also be drawn, albeit cautiously, to the regulatory framework within the Environmental Offences regime, where R v. Kendall [2019] EWCA Crim 1005 found that persistent fly-tipping on green belt land over several months warranted significant custodial sentencing given the environmental damage and ongoing defiance. By way of further context, the court recalls the difficulties brought to bear in the case of R v. Tyler [2018] EWCA Crim 288, where the defendant was convicted of affray following a public disturbance involving pool cues at a licensed venue. While obviously unrelated directly in offence type, that case reiterates the court’s persistent concern about the escalation risks inherent in public disorder. Though your offence involves no violence, offences of acquisitive crime sometimes present latent threat potential when victims or staff feel intimidated. Similarly, the case of R v. Hill [2017] EWCA Crim 711, involving possession of a bladed article found in a school car park, underscores that sentencing must engage with context, public protection considerations, and the harm caused, rather than merely the letter of the law. Before turning to the specifics, I find it instructive to note the important role played by partnership arrangements, such as the Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRP) and the Safer Neighbourhood Teams (SNT). Evidence submitted to this court shows active engagement by borough-based teams coordinating resources to reduce repeat offending and share intelligence. Such collaborations also monitor emerging offences, but as in this jurisdiction, the impact of fluctuating staffing levels and competing priorities means that sustained coverage can often be compromised. Nevertheless, here, partnership working has operated with commendable continuity. Letters provided by several retailers and employees affected repeatedly by thefts in their premises illustrate the wider social effects of your offending. Staff reported heightened stress levels, reduced confidence in the workplace, and the need to adopt protective measures such as additional locking of shelves or reduced presence during high-risk periods. The economic impact, while individually modest, aggregated to a nontrivial cumulative effect on the viability of some small retailers already struggling in the current retail climate. One victim impact statement came from Ms A. Patel, manager of an independent chemist on Dockside Road, who notes the necessity of installing additional closed-circuit equipment and hiring a security guard after a series of small but targeted thefts. The court acknowledges that while these measures may deter, they impose cost burdens ultimately borne by legitimate customers through increased retail prices. Similarly, correspondence received from the Retail Staff Welfare Network emphasised the psychological cost of persistent theft on store employees, particularly those working shifts with reduced colleague presence. This forms a key contextual consideration underpinning the court’s approach. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. The prosecution has relied substantially on photographic and video evidence obtained from fixed and portable CCTV units. You were recorded at multiple locations using similar disguising methods: for example, employing layered clothing to conceal small items, employing distraction techniques involving the use of a mobile phone, and utilising hand movements designed to obscure store staff’s view. Furthermore, you were observed on at least one occasion removing security tags prior to exiting the store—an action which elevates the degree of planning and sophistication in your conduct. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. Security personnel at one premises described your demeanour as ‘controlled and measured,’ though persistent. There were no physical confrontations; however, the cumulative effect understandably caused anxiety. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. Notably, an informant to the Business Crime Reduction Partnership flagged your presence on several occasions entering premises shortly before peak staffing changes, suggesting deliberate timing to maximise opportunity and reduce risk of detection. The repeated nature of the offending demonstrated a running pattern of behaviour over several months, with several breaches of earlier community resolutions and warning letters issued by police. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. It should be noted that the Metropolitan Police Service reports considerable effort expended on surveillance, evidence collation, and victim liaison in shoplifting cases such as this. This diverts specialist resources from violent crime investigation and organised crime task forces. The strain on forensic analysis units is particularly acute, with digital evidence requiring thorough and time-consuming examination. In addition to police resources, the Probation Service in this area is operating consecutive caseloads well beyond national targets — a factor which diminishes the availability of proactive support for offenders prior to sentencing. Reports from probation officers have lamented the increasing pressure they face in delivering rehabilitative programmes matched to the diverse needs of those caught in such offending cycles. There are broader implications for agencies providing social care and mental health support. The NHS has documented rising waiting times for psychological interventions, including those for impulse control disorders and substance misuse. Liaison between criminal justice agencies and health providers remains a work in progress, and defendants such as yourself often fall between gaps in service provision. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. The psychiatric report prepared by Dr Rhodri Evans, consultant forensic psychiatrist, concludes that you exhibit no diagnosable major mental illness. His observations note traits associated with impulsivity and mild depressive episodes but find no sufficient clinical grounds to mitigate or excuse the offending. Engagement with support services has been sporadic and largely unreciprocated. Dr Evans’ report also highlights the absence of genuine remorse or acknowledgement of the impact of your conduct on victims, a factor the court must weigh carefully. The Probation Service pre-sentence report documents a pattern of repeat acquisitive offending, intertwined with unstable housing and precarious financial circumstances. It also notes prior opportunities for diversionary measures were not taken up. The officer preparing the report recommends consideration of a community order incorporating Rehabilitation Activity and Unpaid Work requirements to balance punitive and remedial elements. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. It must be underlined that a key element in the sentencing framework seeks to balance the imperatives of public protection, punishment, and rehabilitation. The court is mindful that custodial sentences for low-level offences are not automatically appropriate, particularly when community measures may be tailored to address specific criminogenic needs. Moreover, the efficacy of community orders is closely linked to the genuine engagement of the defendant. To that end, I reiterate the necessity of securing an up-to-date and robust pre-sentence report to assist in tailoring an effective intervention strategy. It is relevant to record that this courtroom was recently refurbished to improve accessibility and video-link capability, reflecting ongoing efforts to modernise the criminal justice estate. However, the deployment of remote attendance during the pandemic caused certain delays in defence counsel engagement, which in turn has, on occasion, impacted timetabling. Interpreter services were engaged for a witness in a related case last month, but their late arrival caused brief adjournment, a reminder that logistical complexities persist. The court also acknowledges the continued dedicated service of its ushers and clerks, whose meticulous management of documentation, witness scheduling, and courtroom order often goes unseen but is vital to effective justice delivery. On a tangential but affecting note, the sudden closure of a local shelter supporting persons at risk of homelessness last year — due to funding constraints — has been linked in wider policy discussions to increased rates of acquisitive crime in specific London boroughs. A recent independent review by the Home Office of Legal Aid administrative structures has also confirmed systemic backlogs in processing applications for expert reports in criminal cases, particularly impacting defendants without means to self-fund such assessments. The court cannot underscore enough that such wider systemic challenges form an important backdrop but do not excuse individual culpability. Given the volume and complexity of these considerations, the sentencing decision will remain reserved until a comprehensive pre-sentence report, inclusive of all relevant assessments and representations, has been received and considered. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 17 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Central Criminal Court, Wapping. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded according to the requirements of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and any disposal imposed will be notified to the relevant authorities for dissemination. You are advised of your right to appeal against any custodial sentence or community order imposed, within 28 days of such sentence being passed, under the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs remain reserved pending final determination. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINDSOR R v. MR H Case No. 2025/18473 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L. Underwood Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in respect of an offence of theft, commonly described as shoplifting, committed contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The matter concerns a series of incidents occurring over a protracted period spanning from early 2023 through the late spring of 2025, engaged predominantly within retail establishments in the Windsor and Maidenhead local authority areas. Procedural History The genesis of the prosecution arose following complaints forwarded by multiple retail operators, notably small and medium-sized grocers, chemists, and convenience stores situated in proximity to Windsor town centre. The charges emerged after extensive inquiries conducted jointly by the Windsor Borough Police and the Thames Valley Business Crime Unit. The scale of investigative effort devoted to this case was considerable, with an emphasis placed on reviewing surveillance footage, collating witness statements, and profiling a suspected pattern of repeated offences consistent with the modus operandi observed. Alas, it remains an unfortunate truth that offences of this nature, while seemingly low in standalone value, cumulatively impact upon public confidence, business viability, and the welfare of retail staff. The court acknowledges the challenges faced by officers responsible for handling such matters. The relentless overlay of investigative and administrative burdens placed on already stretched police resources heightens the risk of inefficiency and fatigue among frontline personnel. This case, though relatively straightforward in evidential terms, marks a rare instance where inter-agency coordination has yielded a coherent punitive response within appropriate procedural timeframes. You were arrested pursuant to a warrant executed on 18 May 2025, following an extensive period of covert observation and intelligence collation that included, but was not limited to, covert mobile surveillance, license plate data cross-referencing, and analysis of retail CCTV networks. Your initial attendance under caution occurred on 19 May 2025, at which point you elected to remain silent. Subsequent forensic examination of recovered items, including clothing articles and an unregistered rucksack, contributed substantively to the evidential basis for charge. The case has proceeded to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, with pleas entered as of 15 July 2025. It is pertinent to note that the BCM system aims to streamline case progression whilst avoiding unnecessary adjournments. In this matter, despite some early engagement difficulties owing to delayed legal representation and the availability of expert reports, the case has nonetheless progressed in a timely fashion. Both prosecution and defence have co-operated towards the effective listing and preparation for trial. I express appreciation to both counsel for their engagement with the process. The case was also delayed by the need to secure Legal Aid funding for commissioning a clinical psychologist experienced in the assessment of recidivist acquisitive offenders. I take this opportunity to comment with no small degree of exasperation on the persistent inefficiencies of the Legal Aid Agency when authorising such requests. The application lodged on 10 June 2025 required multiple iterations, culminating in a protracted approval on 28 June 2025. These procedural glitches serve only to frustrate clients’ rights to expeditious justice and place an undue strain on all parties concerned. The Crown, represented admirably by Ms Lucille Thornton, has made clear the gravity of persistent retail theft in modern urban contexts. Likewise, Mr Jeremy Wallace, on behalf of the defence, has submitted mitigation rooted principally in social welfare factors and limited engagement with support services. It has come to my attention, tangentially, that the office of the assigned probation officer has encountered unprecedented staffing shortages coinciding with this case’s preparation. It is hardly novel that community corrections departments operate under resource constraints, often resulting in delayed report preparation or fractured continuity of supervision. No significant criticism is directed here, merely an observation on how systemic pressures inevitably shape individual case outcomes. In line with established authority, notably R v. Keaton [2019] EWCA Crim 1512, the court recognises that persistent shoplifting offences warrant a measured response reflecting both culpability and the often complex social antecedents underlying such offending behaviour. While Keaton concerned an extended series of offences involving organised theft rings, the principles concerning the deterrent effect and proportionality of sentencing are apropos. Of interest too is the decision in R v. Petrovic [2021] EWCA Crim 2548, involving an offender convicted of serial shop theft where the Court of Appeal emphasised the significance of prompt guilty pleas in securing sentence mitigation. The timing and sincerity of admissions remain material considerations, even where past convictions are present. Case reports confirm, regrettably, a trend towards an increase in offences of this nature in the Thames Valley region over recent years — a phenomenon traceable in part to socioeconomic instability, rises in unemployment, and a visible uptick in street-level opportunism. Data compiled by the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership indicate a 14% year-on-year increase in thefts involving small independent shops between 2021 and 2024. The associated financial losses, not to mention the detrimental impact on staff morale, highlight the broader harms occasioned by such behaviour. The court has considered the statements of several store managers and assistants, who describe ongoing anxiety about repeat theft, leading in some cases to reduced staffing, enhanced security protocols, and even temporary closures for risk assessment. Taken as a whole, the background to this offence places it in the context of pressing contemporary challenges faced by urban retail sectors. Yet the law remains clear — hardship does not excuse dishonesty, nor does it diminish the need for accountability. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. It is necessary to underscore at this juncture the forensic and digital evidence which, while robust, demanded meticulous assemblage. Tempered often by concerns regarding privacy and evidential integrity, the multi-layered gathering of data contoured a compelling narrative of repeated incursions upon shop premises. Here one reflects on the modern realities of policing, where technical expertise must be marshalled not only efficiently but judiciously. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. In the wider spectrum of criminal jurisprudence, this court is mindful of the case of R v. McAllister [2018] EWCA Crim 2047—an instance of aggravated burglary involving theft beyond the shoplifting remit. Although wholly distinct factually, the principles underpinning proportionality and the consideration of aggravating features retain pertinence when grappling with repetitive acquisitive offences. On a procedural note, it has been brought to this court's attention that the late appointment of an interpreter at a sentencing hearing in a neighbouring court resulted in significant delay. While unrelated, it highlights systemic pressures and the precarious balance courts must strike between expeditious administration and the individual rights of defendants. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. At this stage, the court pauses to recognise the efforts of the Windsor Retailers Association, whose collaborative initiatives — including staff training in theft prevention and liaison with police liaison officers — have provided both practical and moral support to individual shop staff impacted by offences of this kind. Their written representations, submitted in advance of sentencing, refrain from rhetorical flourish, focusing instead on facts and the human cost of such offending. In addition, the voluntary sector has played a quiet yet vital role. The Thames Valley Community Outreach Programme submitted a letter drawing attention to the limited availability of housing support for individuals in financial precarity. Their observations echo a broader national crisis in housing provision, marked by soaring rental prices and acute shortages of social housing. Again, while these issues do not excuse criminal behaviour, they provide vital context. Mr H, the psychiatric report commissioned by this court and authored by Dr Samantha Ingram, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, is a document of considerable length and detail. It characterises your presentation as typified by low mood, intermittent anxiety, and a degree of impulsivity, though no clear diagnosis of severe mental illness was established. Dr Ingram expressed concern at your inconsistent engagement with proposed supportive interventions and noted a pattern of self-isolation and social withdrawal. The report cautiously advises that without a structured therapeutic framework, risk of reoffending remains present. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. Turning to the jurisprudential framework, the court is guided by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences, promulgated in 2020. The guideline articulates a comprehensive sentencing matrix, factoring in the value of property taken, the sophistication of offending, and the impact on victims. Aggravating features such as repeat offending, vulnerability of victims, and breach of trust merit due weight. Though shoplifting is occasionally perceived as a relatively minor incursion upon law and order, particularly when involving low-value goods, this court aligns with the considered position advanced in R v. Bridges [2021] EWCA Crim 810, where the Court underscored that acquisitive crime, if left unchecked, undermines community cohesion and places intolerable strain upon retail sectors and public resources alike. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. It is important also to reflect on the broader operational environment within which the criminal justice system currently functions. The court is acutely aware of the immense pressures facing the Probation Service nationally, grappling with recruitment challenges, financial restrictions, and the demands of an expanding caseload. These factors inevitably affect the timeliness and depth of pre-sentence reporting. Moreover, one cannot overlook the ripple effects on the court system itself. Recent strikes by court clerical staff have at times caused adjournments and interruptions across multiple jurisdictions. Again, this matter was not directly delayed due to such industrial action, but the phenomenon forms part of the backdrop against which all participants must operate. The effective administration of justice remains the highest priority, notwithstanding such operational tribulations. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. In relation to sentencing mitigation, the defence submissions have drawn attention to your housing instability and purported lack of stable family support. While such factors are acknowledged, they do not sufficiently mitigate the persistent nature of your offending. The court must balance compassion with public protection and deterrence. It is also germane to mention that this court has received a letter from the local Housing Association, which emphasises the strain upon accommodation services caused by increasing rates of tenancy breaches and anti-social behaviour. While unrelated to your specific tenancy arrangement, the letter indicates an ongoing challenge within public housing management — a challenge that may impact individuals with limited support networks and heightened vulnerability to social exclusion. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. In addition, the court notes correspondence from the Windsor Volunteer Aid Society, which describes the pressures on charitable food banks in the area. It is worthwhile to acknowledge that such organisations operate under severe resource constraints, yet persist in offering vital assistance to those in poverty. The court does not overlook these realities in assessing the social context of offending. Finally, the court must address the issue of your previous criminal record, which comprises three prior convictions for theft-related offences, including an offence involving the theft of a mobile phone from a public venue and a community resolution for shoplifting in 2021. Those earlier matters resulted in non-custodial penalties but appear to have had limited deterrent effect. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. I have also been provided with a victim personal statement from the manager of one impacted retail outlet. Though restrained in tone, the statement highlights both the financial loss and the human cost in terms of the stress felt by staff. The statement underscores the impact of repeated offending rather than a single incident, painting a picture of chronic disruption. Mr H, the facts demonstrate a course of conduct marked by persistence and a degree of planning. You exploited the familiarity of frequenting local shops to target times of low staffing and relied upon distraction techniques and concealment to evade detection. While there is no suggestion that your offending involved violence or threats, it caused real and sustained distress to victims and staff. This is a material aggravating factor. You have pleaded guilty, albeit not at the earliest opportunity. This court, accordingly, will reflect on the stage at which your plea was entered in the exercise of sentencing discretion. In matters of this nature, the court is frequently reminded of the need to promote rehabilitation alongside punishment. However, rehabilitation must be grounded in active engagement and willingness to accept support, qualities which have, regrettably, been sporadic in your case. The pre-sentence report will be critical in advising on your personal circumstances and on risk of reoffending. It will consider your social circumstances, possible interventions, and proposals for community-based sanctions. Advanced programmes focusing on cognitive behavioural therapy and impulse control may be appropriate if you demonstrate genuine commitment. Your age and previous convictions establish you as a repeat offender, but not one whose offending has reached scale or sophistication warranting custodial sentence as a mandatory starting point. That said, the court must consider the cumulative impact of persistent acquisitive crime upon the business community and the public perception of safety within the town centres affected. I must also be candid and inform you that sentencing will take into account the broader imperative of general deterrence. The increasing incidence of retail crime is a matter of national concern. Courts must therefore send a clear signal that repeated offences, albeit low in individual value, attract commensurate consequences. The court recognises that you currently lack stable employment and reside in temporary accommodation provided by the local authority. Your personal circumstances are understood to be difficult, and your engagement with available support services limited. It must be reiterated, however, that such circumstances cannot be treated as a licence to offend or a shield from sentencing consequences. In conclusion, I will reserve my decision on sentence pending the preparation and receipt of a detailed pre-sentence report. The report is to address your suitability for community rehabilitation, your personal circumstances, and risk factors relevant to reoffending. I expect the probation service to make recommendations in line with sentencing guidelines, considering options which may include a community order with requirements addressing offending behaviour, unpaid work, and possible curfew or electronic monitoring if warranted. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Windsor. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. A formal transcript will be maintained in relation to the matters heard and the subsequent judgment. You are reminded of your right to appeal against any sentence imposed within 28 days in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT COVENTRY R v. Mr H Case No. T2025/13568 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. A. Godfrey Filed: 14 August 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely shoplifting from multiple retail premises within the metropolitan area spanning between late 2023 and the early part of 2025. This indictment represents the prosecution’s consolidation of a series of thefts alleged to have been committed across various commercial establishments within the Coventry and Warwickshire boroughs. It is appropriate at the outset to reflect upon the procedural and evidential history of this matter, which has unfolded over the course of more than eighteen months. Your initial arrest took place on 7 March 2025, following a lengthy intelligence-led investigation conducted by officers of the Warwickshire Constabulary alongside key stakeholders including the Coventry City Business Crime Partnership and local community policing teams. The genesis of the case lay in a series of reported incidents involving the disappearance of consumer goods from retail outlets, predominantly convenience and pharmacy stores, where losses, while individually modest in monetary value, cumulatively raised substantial concerns regarding public confidence and commercial sustainability. Such investigations, it should be noted, are by no means routine undertakings. The collation and cross-referencing of digital and physical evidence—including CCTV stills and video footage from disparate sources—entails considerable commitment of investigative resources. Officers are daily confronted with the limitations posed by quality of footage, covering angles that often obscure crucial features and timestamps that do not always align cleanly with corroborative witness statements. The phenomenon of repeated low-level acquisitive crime is not novel. However, the procedural conundrums it presents continue to test the capacities of policing and judicial systems alike in an era of constrained budgets and increasing demand. Your initial proceedings commenced at the Magistrates’ Court in Coventry on 10 March 2025, where you first entered a not guilty plea. The matter was committed to the Crown Court pursuant to standard pre-trial procedures, and a plea and case management hearing was subsequently listed for 29 April 2025 before me. Regrettably, this hearing was delayed twice on the defence’s application, first to allow for the drafting of further mitigation and then to secure the production of a psychiatric report. These adjournments, while frustrating to all concerned, were duly granted in consideration of procedural fairness and your rights to the preparation of a full and robust defence. The psychiatric evaluation, commissioned in late April and conducted by Dr Amina Shah, a consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Warwickshire Mental Health Trust, was thorough and accompanied by a comprehensive narrative passed to both prosecution and defence. In her report dated 15 May 2025, Dr Shah expressed that while you do not present with major mental illness, there are indications of emotional dysregulation and traits suggestive of an impulse control disorder of mild severity. Notably, her appraisal also references your reported history of intermittent engagement with drug and alcohol misuse services, and a pattern of low-level substance misuse that may have influenced your behaviour, albeit not to a degree causing pervasive impairment. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. It is fitting at this juncture to address for the record the continued difficulties besetting the provision of forensic mental health expertise within the jurisdiction. Despite the evident importance of such assessments in sentencing decisions, there remain significant delays in funding authorisations for expert reports due to systemic bottlenecks at the Legal Aid Agency. The court has been compelled on multiple occasions to remonstrate against procedural inertia which hampers expedient case progression. The present matter is no exception. Notwithstanding the eventual completion of the psychiatric report, the timeline was regrettably extended by administrative deferments beyond the control of the parties. Appreciation is hereby expressed for the attentiveness of Ms Eleanor Lees, your defence solicitor, whose persistent and diligent representation has ensured continued advocacy through these challenges, and for Crown Counsel Ms Saira Nyong’o, whose coordination aided timely disclosure and synthesis of evidential materials. Both counsel have conducted themselves with professionalism and decorum throughout. The court is also grateful to the staff of the Coventry Retailers’ Victim Support Network, particularly Mrs Lesley Carver, whose charitable organisation has devoted considerable voluntary time to liaising with affected shops and providing victim impact statements. In the course of enumerating the evidential matrix supporting the prosecution, it is instructive to consider the precedential context. While distinct in facts, R v. Tyrell [2022] EWCA Crim 1834 remains instructive for sentencing frameworks in relation to repetitive acquisitive crime. The defendant in Tyrell engaged in multiple counts of shoplifting across a six-month period, targeting high-turnover retail outlets and deploying distraction techniques. The Court of Appeal therein emphasised the aggravating effect of premeditation and repeated offending, affirming a custodial sentence where interventionist approaches had failed to deter recidivism. Similarly, in R v. Simmonds [2023] EWCA Crim 395, the appellate court underscored factors including the erosion of staff morale and the indirect economic consequences borne by small business proprietors as weighty considerations when calibrating the severity of punishment. Though these cases diverge in contextual specifics from the matter at bar, the underlying principles remain cogent and provide a judicial backdrop for sentencing deliberations. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. The court further notes the limitation of community diversion efforts in your history. You were subject to a conditional caution in 2023 for a related offence, coupled with engagement on a pilot theft prevention scheme organised by the Coventry Crime Reduction Partnership. Despite these initiatives, your offending persisted, evidencing a lack of responsiveness to non-custodial interventions. The circumstances of your offending reveal a sustained and deliberate pattern. Surveillance footage from multiple outlets depicts a consistent modus operandi: targeted selection of items—often high-value cosmetics and over-the-counter medicines—carried out during identified shift changes or periods of reduced staffing. On occasion, you were observed to use concealment tactics such as layered clothing or bags switched to avoid detection. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. In some instances, your conduct extended beyond mere appropriation and involved the removal or disabling of electronic security tags, an act which necessitated the duplication or improper usage of store devices. Store managers have provided statements describing not only the material loss but the resultant atmosphere of anxiety and insecurity felt by staff. A number of employees disclosed altered shift patterns and expressed anxiety sufficient to consider seeking transfers—indicative of the wider operational impact of your conduct. It is worth mentioning that the broader retail environment has become increasingly strained, with increasing reports of shop staff turnover and early retirement linked directly to workplace stress in theft-affected stores. These are matters to which the court must have regard, as the social fabric sustaining commercial stability is inextricably connected to the wellbeing of individual workers. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. This court has observed, with some concern, a recurring phenomenon in which the pressures on frontline services—be they police, probation, or health-related—are compounded by cumulative low-level offending. The Legal Aid Agency, notwithstanding its stated commitment to facilitating fair access to justice, has in this district manifested procedural shortcomings including protracted approval processes for expert instructions and delayed authorisation for guardian ad litem appointments in family law proceedings. While these do not pertain directly to your charges, the systemic nature of such delays impacts the wider administration of justice and by extension the lives of defendants awaiting resolution. The Local Authority Housing Department has submitted correspondence dated 21 June 2025, outlining ongoing challenges associated with increased homelessness and temporary accommodation allocations within the region. The linkages between housing instability, financial insecurity, and acquisitive offending have been the focus of contemporary criminological studies, though one must resist simplistic causal attributions. The court recognises that these wider social determinants create a complex background but insists that accountability remains paramount. Among unrelated, yet strikingly illustrative case material furnished to this court was a local prosecution relating to the use of counterfeit currency at a Coventry car boot sale, prosecuted in early 2024. While entirely separate, it highlights the diversity of acquisitive behaviours that occupy judicial attention. The Crown submits that, notwithstanding the lack of direct violence or threats, your offending has had a deleterious cumulative impact such that a deterrent and rehabilitative sentence is essential. The factual network supporting this position is built upon multiple items of direct and circumstantial evidence, including forensic collection of recovered goods and detailed witness testimonies. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. The compilation of victim impact statements, prepared by the Coventry Retailer Liaison Unit, reveal the profound psychological effect upon those who regularly serve the public. One staff member, Ms Hannah Pearson, described losing “all sense of safety” at work following repeated thefts, necessitating counselling and prolonged leave. Another, a store manager with over 20 years’ experience, lamented the financial and emotional toll taken upon small-scale retailers operating on thin margins. This evidence serves to amplify the seriousness with which the court must treat the persistent disregard for property rights demonstrated in your conduct. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 17 June 2025, you elected to enter a guilty plea in respect of the charge, having previously maintained a not guilty stance. You were afforded credit for this plea, although the timing—mere weeks prior to the anticipated trial—warrants moderation of any discount in accordance with established jurisprudence, as articulated in R v. McLaren [2019] EWCA Crim 1122, which reduced the maximum available credit for late pleas in shoplifting cases. Your history reveals antecedents including previous convictions for shoplifting, as well as minor public order offences, none of which involved the use or threat of violence. There is no evidence of gang association or organised criminal enterprise in your case. This court further notes that you have declined various probation service offers for intervention, which may have assisted in addressing underlying factors. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The most recent pre-sentence report, prepared by Senior Probation Officer Fiona Carrick dated 29 July 2025, provides a comprehensive assessment of your offending pattern, social circumstances, and risk profile. The report identifies medium risk of serious harm primarily attributable to acquisitive offending, consistent with impulsive traits outlined in the psychiatric assessment. It underscores your continued unstable accommodation status and lack of sustained employment as contributors to reoffending risk. Offender engagement with community services has been sporadic and inconsistent. Recommendations include enrolment on a Cognitive Behavioural Programme tailored to theft offenders, exploration of substance misuse treatment options, and enhanced financial management support. Ms Carrick’s report expresses concern that without structured intervention, the risk of reoffending remains significant. Furthermore, this court must consider the established framework set out in the Sentencing Council Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (reissued 2020), which emphasises factors such as harm, culpability, premeditation, and mitigating circumstances. While this was not a high-value single theft, the cumulative impact, deliberate planning, and failure to desist following prior warnings place this offending in a higher culpability bracket. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. It is incumbent here to recognise that the court, while exercising its duty to protect the public and uphold the rule of law, also endeavours to ensure sentencing outcomes that are not merely punitive but orientated towards rehabilitation where feasible. The prospect of community-based remedies including rehabilitation activity requirements or unpaid work may be considered where suitable. However, your repeated failure to engage with non-custodial measures necessitates careful reflection on the proportionality of any custodial element. The court is mindful that in recent years, pressures on probation resourcing have escalated dramatically, with caseloads increasing disproportionately to staffing capacity, leading in some areas to delays in assessment and intervention delivery. These strains are recorded in annual Ministry of Justice reports and impact the speed and efficacy of rehabilitative efforts. You were previously provided with opportunities for diversion from prosecution, including a conditional caution in 2023, which you breached. This pattern illustrates a troubling resistance to authority and an unwillingness to avail yourself consistently of support measures. It remains essential for the judge, in balancing the aims of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection, to weigh carefully all contextual information, including your personal circumstances, the factual matrix of the offending, and pre-existing vulnerabilities as identified in professional reports. Nothing in that process ought to infantilise or excuse criminal responsibility. The court is advised that sentencing will not take place today, pending receipt of an updated pre-sentence report to be furnished within the next four weeks. This will incorporate any further psychiatric or psychological assessments, as well as the views of the probation officer, to assist in a fully informed sentencing decision. These sentencing remarks are accordingly issued this day, 14 August 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Coventry. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of the right of appeal against sentence within 28 days under statutory provisions including the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARLOW R v. MR H Case No. H2025/20389 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. Calverley Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in respect of a theft offence, namely shoplifting, contrary to section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, over which this court must exercise its judgment, spans a number of months and involves multiple retail establishments situated within the Harlow and surrounding Essex areas. Procedural Background The charge arises following an investigation that commenced in late 2024 and culminated in your arrest on 12 February 2025. The investigatory process was multi-layered, engaging the resources of the Harlow Borough Police Service alongside the Business Crime Reduction Unit and local trading standards officers. Over the investigative period, a series of reports from various retail outlets—ranging from chain supermarkets to independent pharmacies—highlighted persistent losses attributable to unidentified thefts, eventually linked by surveillance and forensic analysis to your person. The Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) in Harlow, created as part of a national initiative to foster cross-agency cooperation, played a prominent role by collating incident reports, sharing premises’ risk profiles, and facilitating communications between victim retailers and law enforcement. While the BCRP system theoretically offers a coordinated response mechanism, this court is aware that operational effectiveness often depends on local funding stability and staff retention levels. Unfortunately, recent budget pressures have caused disruptions in coverage, an issue lamented by many front-line police officers tasked with crime deterrence and victim liaison. Nevertheless, in this matter, it appears that the partnership fulfilled its core responsibilities in a timely manner. The investigation that led to your apprehension involved the analysis of CCTV footage from multiple sites—some of which had incomplete or overlapping recordings—alongside witness statements gathered from retail staff and customers. Mobile phone location data, critical to linking your movements with particular incidents, was obtained pursuant to a judicially sanctioned warrant after appropriate application brought by the prosecution. The use of digital evidence in Theft Act cases has increased in recent years; however, such technological assistance also imposes significant evidential and procedural burdens, particularly in the safeguarding of lawful privacy rights and compliance with data protection obligations. An initial hearing was held on 17 February 2025 before the Harlow Magistrates’ Court, where you were bailed on strict conditions pending further proceedings. Your representatives—the firm of J. Willard & Co. solicitors—promptly applied for a Legal Aid funding certificate for the instruction of expert evidence, including a forensic behavioural analyst and a clinical psychologist to assist with mitigation. While the grant of such authorities is expected under the current Legal Aid framework, this court records considerable frustration with the delays experienced in this instance. Authorisation was only confirmed on 22 April 2025 after protracted correspondence and escalating chaser letters, a regrettable circumstance which has become, in this judge’s experience, increasingly common and detrimental to case progression. Your case was transferred to this Crown Court pursuant to the Better Case Management guidelines in place since 2019. These guidelines aim to streamline criminal proceedings by pre-emptively identifying evidential issues, limiting unnecessary adjournments, and fostering early guilty pleas wherever appropriate. Early hearings scheduled for 11 March and 14 May 2025 were, respectively, adjourned on your defence's application in order to secure views from expert witnesses and to take account of further disclosure. While such applications are entirely within your procedural rights, their repeated use underscores the delicate balancing act courts confront in managing finite resources and the individual right to a full and fair trial. It bears noting that the Crown and defence teams have conducted themselves with professional courtesy throughout, albeit within the constraints imposed by case complexity and system pressures. I take this opportunity to thank Ms Eleanor Braithwaite, appearing on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, and Mr Julian Hirst, representing you under a Legal Aid representation order. The legal question before this court is how to appropriately respond to your offending, recognising both statutory principles of sentencing and the overarching public interest. We find ourselves in an age where retail theft, particularly shoplifting, constitutes an increasing proportion of acquisitive crime reported nationally. However, one must resist simplistic narratives that attempt to justify this trend solely on socio-economic grounds. While the post-pandemic economic downturn and rising cost of living have undeniably exacerbated vulnerabilities, the persistence and frequency of offences such as those before the court also reflect a complex interplay of factors including systemic challenges in policing, evolving criminal opportunism, and the shifting dynamics of social control. The court is conscious that shoplifting offences impose both tangible and intangible costs: the shrinkage of business assets, increased insurance premiums, anxiety and stress among retail workers who often face threats or confrontations, and broader reputational damage to neighbourhoods and commercial districts struggling to maintain vitality. The work of local charity groups such as “SafeStreet Harlow” and “Essex Retail Victims Support” deserves recognition. These organisations—operating largely on constrained funding and volunteer input—offer counselling and practical assistance to affected individuals and businesses, frequently serving as the first point of support when statutory channels either fail or are overwhelmed. Their contributions form an essential part of the ecosystem of crime prevention and community resilience, which courts hope will be supported rather than undermined by judicial approaches to sentencing. It is unfortunate, but necessary, to observe that there is a tendency towards the normalisation of certain forms of anti-social behaviour, including low-level theft, in some communities. This shifts the demarcation between lawful and unlawful conduct in public consciousness, threatening to corrode respect for legal norms and public order. While social policy debates rage over causes and remedies, the courts remain steadfast in their role to uphold the rule of law and administer proportionate justice. Against this backdrop, attention must be given to the strain placed on frontline law enforcement by so-called “volume crime.” Resources allocated to street-level theft nonetheless detract from investigation of serious offences such as violent crime, organised drug markets, or threats of domestic extremism. Such opportunity costs are difficult to quantify but emphasise the wider impact of offending beyond the immediate victim or defendant. In this vein, the recidivism of repeat shoplifters remains a perennial challenge. Probation services, tasked with supervising community sanctions and rehabilitative programmes, report chronic under-staffing and resource limitations. Waiting lists for cognitive behavioural therapy aimed at reducing offending behaviour extend into many months, and mental health trusts themselves face substantial demand. The knock-on effect is that many defendants receive limited intervention beyond rudimentary curfew or electronic monitoring measures. It is in this systemic context that your personal circumstances must be considered. The Theft Act 1968, specifically section 1(1), defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive them of it. While offences of this nature may vary in scale, the courts recognise that repeated or organised shoplifting constitutes more serious conduct meriting enhanced sentencing. Sentencing must be directed by section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, under which the overarching considerations are denunciation, deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation. Custody is to be a last resort, reserved for cases crossing the custodial threshold as set forth in the Sentencing Council guideline for Theft and Burglary Offences (2021). Recent appellate decisions continue to provide clarifying guidance. In R v Ellison [2023] EWCA Crim 334, the Court underscored that the cumulative effect of multiple low-value thefts within a date range may support a representative charge but does not diminish the seriousness of repeated dishonesty, particularly when conducted systematically. Ellison involved a defendant who targeted high-value cosmetics across 12 separate stores, using distraction techniques and altering appearance between incidents. The Court found no error in the imposition of a 14-month custodial sentence, observing that deterrence of predictive reoffending was paramount. Similarly, in R v Daniels [2022] EWCA Crim 1127, the defendant was convicted of theft involving a coordinated group trafficking stolen goods. Although your case does not implicate organised crime, the judgment emphasises that sentencing is informed by offender culpability, degree of planning, and actual or potential harm, considerations all relevant here. I also refer with interest to R v Lester [2020] EWCA Crim 2021, where the court upheld a suspended sentence for a first-time shoplifter whose contrition and engagement with rehabilitation services mitigated risk. While differing in context and facts, Lester is relevant insofar as it illustrates the importance of offender cooperation and uptake of support. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. The prosecution’s case is predicated on a body of evidence including CCTV footage from multiple retail premises, witness statements from staff and security, and forensic examination of items recovered during your arrest. Your clothing bore fibres matching those found near the point of concealment in several incidents. Consistent sartorial choices were noted throughout a series of offences, aiding identification alongside transactional timestamps and your habitual presence in these locations. Your conduct appears to have involved the systematic concealment of items within bags and under clothing, with occasional tampering of security tags and in at least one instance, the use of an accomplice to distract staff while goods were removed. No violence or threat thereof was employed, but the repetitive nature and sophistication of the acts demonstrate a degree of planning and intent beyond a spur-of-the-moment lapse. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. It is pertinent that no physical harm occurred to retail employees or other customers, a fact which, while deserving of recognition, does not diminish the wider consequences. Chronic loss from stock shrinkage has contributed to store closures and reduced local economic diversity in the flagged high streets. Staff morale and feelings of personal safety have likewise been impacted, as reflected in witness testimony from management at affected stores. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. An independent clinical assessment was commissioned from Dr Sally Hemingway, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, instructed on your behalf. Dr Hemingways's report, dated 6 September 2025, concludes that you suffer from no major mental health disorder. However, she notes traits of impulsivity and an emerging pattern compatible with mild substance misuse disorder, primarily involving alcohol. There is no evidence of psychosis, cognitive impairment, or significant personality pathology. Recommendations include engagement with community-based addiction services and cognitive-behavioural therapy focusing on impulsivity control. The report observes that effective intervention could reduce reoffending risk, particularly if accompanied by stable accommodation and employment. In addition, Probation Service submitted a pre-sentence report dated 10 October 2025. The author, Senior Probation Officer Janet Monroe, highlights moderate levels of risk of acquisitive reoffending, compounded by your unstable housing status and lack of meaningful employment. There is a noted history of inconsistent engagement with support services and prior convictions for low-level theft. Ms Monroe expresses guarded optimism regarding your potential for rehabilitation but stresses the need for structured supervision combined with access to substance misuse treatment and financial management courses. She also recommends exploration of restorative justice opportunities, which some retailers have expressed openness to participating in. It is worth pausing to remark on the probative value of such reports in enabling the court to formulate a sentencing strategy that aligns with both public protection and the aspirational goal of offender rehabilitation. The derived assessments form critical inputs into the sentencing matrix, balancing punishment with practical opportunities for change. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. Victim statements from retail proprietors and staff underscore the psychological and economic toll wrought by your offending. Many report increased anxiety during shifts, leading some employees to request relocation or reduction in hours for wellbeing. One pharmacy manager relating to a small independent business detailed lost sales margins, the cost of additional security measures including installation of CCTV upgrades, and the stress engendered among the workforce. It is not uncommon for small businesses, already stretched by rising utility costs and post-pandemic recovery challenges, to be disproportionately affected by persistent theft. As some outlets close or downsize, displaced workers face unemployment or underemployment, exacerbating local socio-economic deprivation. Such community impact often escapes facile quantification but remains a compelling factor in judicial consideration of harm and culpability. In the course of this trial, I have noted various systemic pressures impacting all involved: from court clerks operating under staff shortages to delays in evidence collation caused by stretched police forensic departments, who are obliged to prioritise violent and serious crime investigations above lower-level offences. The Magistrates’ Court listing office experienced disruption due to industrial action on three separate occasions during 2025, contributing indirectly to adjournments in this case. The Legal Aid Agency’s convoluted administrative requirements and procurement delays—though increasingly contentious—nonetheless remain a vital, if strained, safeguard ensuring representation. It is incumbent on the justice system to advocate for reforms that minimise procedural delay while protecting defendants’ rights. Additionally, the involvement of third-sector organisations such as “Streetwise Support Network” has been instrumental in providing ancillary services to individuals in precarious circumstances, including hostel outreach and benefits advice. These functions supplement statutory provision and mitigate risk factors associated with acquisitive offending but face chronic funding shortfalls. It is within this broader social and institutional fabric—that presents formidable challenges—that courts must apply the law. Mr H stated in interview that he frequently takes items, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. The sentencing exercise requires careful balance: to reflect the gravity of your offences, to protect the public, to deter similar conduct by others, and to promote your rehabilitation prospects. The timing of your guilty plea is acknowledged, albeit at a relatively late stage after evidence became overwhelming. This attracts a modest reduction in sentence in accordance with the Credit for Early Guilty Plea guidelines under paragraph 1.3 of the Sentencing Council’s Manual. Your personal mitigation pertaining to financial hardship, periods of unstable housing, and reported family difficulties have been fully considered. However, it must be underscored that hardship does not excuse repeated dishonesty. Where community support services have been offered and declined, the court is entitled to treat this as an aggravating rather than mitigating factor. The principle that individuals have a duty to take reasonable steps to address underlying causes of offending behaviour is well established. Comparative case law instructs that persistent acquisition of property by deception or theft over a sustained timeframe tends to elevate culpability. The absence of violence is material but does not lessen the serious consequences for victims and the wider community. I order the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report with specific enquiry into: - Participation in accredited cognitive behavioural programme targeting acquisitive offending; - Suitability for a community order with unpaid work; - Availability of addiction treatment, including alcohol cessation support; - Assessment of housing stability and engagement with relevant local housing authorities; - Consideration of restorative justice options agreeable to victims. The court anticipates that the pre-sentence report will address the likely need for structured supervision balanced against realistic prospects of engagement. Conclusion Today's hearing has been conducted in open court, attended by prosecution and defence counsel, with all procedural safeguards observed. I thank all parties for their submissions, which have been detailed and professionally presented. Particular note is made of the cooperation received from the Probation Service and expert medical staff who have provided timely reports. I also acknowledge the dedication of court staff, ushers, and clerks who maintain the conduct of business with commendable efficiency despite increasing workloads. Having considered all material before me, including statutory guidelines, case law, reports, victim impact statements, and defence representations, I reserve the matter for sentence at a date to be fixed after receipt of the outstanding pre-sentence report. These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge R. J. Calverley, issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Harlow. The proceedings have been duly recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are reminded of the right to appeal this sentence pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. The question of costs is reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER R v. MR H Case No. T2026/04158 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. A. GRAYSON Filed: 14 September 2026 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced on a charge of theft, specifically multiple counts of shoplifting conducted over a period stretching from late 2024 to mid-2026. This offending has primarily involved retail premises situated throughout the Greater Manchester conurbation, encompassing independent stores and larger commercial outlets alike. The indictment consolidates these numerous acts into a single count, reflecting the court’s approach to cumulative conduct as forming a course of criminal behaviour. Procedural and Investigative Context Your arrest was effected on 25 July 2026 following an extensive investigation initiated by the Manchester Retail Crime Taskforce, a body convened to tackle the proliferation of shop thefts which has exerted palpable strain on local businesses and policing resources. The investigation was the product of concerted multi-agency efforts, including liaison with the Manchester Business Crime Reduction Group, input from local trading standards officers, and the proactive deployment of covert surveillance across premises identified as high-risk. Such investigative measures, while increasingly necessary, constitute a considerable diversion of scarce public resources. Attending to what many might dismiss as “low-level” offending can, paradoxically, demand a disproportionate commitment of specialist manpower, digital forensic expertise, and administrative capacity. The court is acutely aware, from discussions with senior officers and policy colleagues, that dedicated police teams often find themselves hindered by the volume and persistence of these crimes, which cumulatively sap momentum from more serious investigative priorities, including those addressing violent offences, drug trafficking, and organised crime syndicates operating at a macro scale. It is a regrettable truth that repeated retail theft — despite the relatively modest value of items stolen — can cumulatively produce serious economic and social dislocation. Damage to staff morale, increased security costs, store closures, and the withdrawal of services from fragile communities are but some consequences. The broader social fallout is manifestly felt, especially when shoplifting targets are small, locally owned businesses that often serve disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Your case has unfolded amid the ongoing evolution of criminal case management processes. The Better Case Management system, introduced to accelerate evidence assessment, streamline disclosure, and minimise adjournments, was engaged here, reflecting the Crown Court’s commitment to procedural efficiency. The case was marked by scheduling challenges, notably the temporary unavailability of key witness statements and delays occasioned by competing lists, but overall progression was consistent with official timelines. The court acknowledges the diligent efforts of the Crown Prosecution Service to coordinate effectively with law enforcement and business stakeholders to bring your case expeditiously before the court. Following your initial custody and charge on 27 July, you made your first court appearance on 2 August. The proceedings have since encompassed a plea and trial preparation hearing, during which you maintained a not guilty plea, denying involvement. This plea was reconsidered only at the outset of the scheduled trial in September, when you elected instead to enter a guilty plea to the representative count. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. Your change of plea at this late stage, while ultimately consistent with the evidence presented, cannot attract the full measure of credit contemplated by sentencing guidelines. It is a regrettably habitual pattern in many acquisitive crime cases whereby defendants delay admission of guilt until trial preparation has essentially concluded, thereby imposing avoidable strain on witnesses, police, and court processes. The precedent of R v. Davies [2019] EWCA Crim 412 establishes that such tardy pleas warrant limited discount, serving to balance the interests of justice and procedural economy. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. The Court’s reflection on your conduct is informed by detailed witness statements, CCTV footage submitted by various retailers, and forensic analysis indicating the repeated nature of your offending. The offences display a matrix of deliberate planning — including selection of low-staffed time periods, utilisation of concealment techniques, and occasional use of accomplices unknown to the court and as yet unprosecuted. While your own role has been singular, the context is not devoid of complexity. It is appropriate to recognise the collaborative efforts of the Manchester Retail Crime Reduction Group (MRCRG), whose reports have shed light on the cumulative effects of your offences beyond what raw figures might convey. The MRCRG's interventions have included improvements to store layout, staff training in theft prevention, and community education initiatives. The Group’s recent quarterly report emphasised the uptick in “displacement tactics” employed by repeat offenders, noting a concurrent rise in what they term “flash thefts” designed to exploit momentary vulnerabilities during peak hours. Moreover, victim impact statements submitted on behalf of several small businesses paint a picture of anxiety and economic hardship. One such witness described how the repeated thefts led to the reduction of opening hours for fear of theft accruing during unstaffed intervals, a measure that consequently adversely affected customer access and employee income. It is clear that the intangible harms wrought by your behaviour extend into social and economic domains, compounding the direct loss of stock. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. The court also notes the correspondence received from the North West Retail Workers’ Union expressing particular concern over the mental health toll that repeated thefts impose on frontline staff. The Union highlighted increased reports of workplace stress, absenteeism, and in some cases, the need for clinical interventions. While these impacts are difficult to measure with precision, their resonance with lived experience must not be overlooked. The foregoing underscores that, while shoplifting may seem a minor offence on paper, its reverberations within communities and the commercial ecosystem can be profound. It is a salutary reminder that sentencing must account for the aggregate effects when determining an appropriate sanction. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. The Probation Service has produced a comprehensive pre-sentence report, following interviews with yourself, feedback from family members, and evaluation of your engagement with prior community orders. Unfortunately, the report documents a limited history of compliance and support uptake, indicating a pattern of superficial engagement rather than substantive rehabilitation. Further to a court direction, a psychiatric evaluation was undertaken by Dr Amanda Reid, a consultant forensic psychiatrist specialising in impulsivity disorders and acquisitive crime. Dr Reid’s report, filed on 30 August, was detailed and professionally composed, offering insight into your mental state and possible contributory factors. While the assessment concluded that you do not meet diagnostic criteria for a major mental illness or personality disorder, it identified tendencies consistent with impulse control difficulties interlaced with chronic situational anxiety. The report cautiously recommended intensive cognitive-behavioural therapy addressing decision-making patterns and distress tolerance. This position aligns with emerging evidence regarding the efficacy of targeted psychological interventions for acquisitive offenders exhibiting impulsivity without broader psychopathology. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. Notwithstanding these recommendations, the report underscores your limited motivation to engage with voluntary services and notes a degree of ambivalence expressed during interview, often manifested as minimisation and rationalisation of offending behaviour. Such attitudes are well-recognised impediments to effective rehabilitation and elevate concern regarding likelihood of recidivism absent punitive measures. Your background is marked by periods of housing instability and fluctuating familial support, detailed extensively in the probation report. The court is mindful of the challenging socio-economic landscape and the frequent shortfall in specialist resources, particularly within mental health and social care systems. NHS waiting lists for psychological therapy in Greater Manchester are known to be long; capacity constraints pose systemic barriers to timely intervention. Nonetheless, while acknowledging these difficulties, the court must balance empathetic understanding against accountability and public safety imperatives. Many defendants face similar or greater barriers yet manage to maintain lawful conduct. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. The Legal Aid Agency’s involvement in this matter has been noted with some concern. The defence’s applications for funding to obtain expert advice, delayed by repeated administrative requests and protracted authorisation processes, resulted in the psychiatric report being filed a mere two weeks prior to sentencing. These bureaucratic delays, increasingly frequent in contemporary practice, hinder prompt justice and strain all parties involved. The Crown and defence counsel have fulfilled their roles with professionalism. I thank Miss Olivia Kent for the Crown and Mr Jacob Mills for the defence, both of whom have conducted proceedings with appropriate decorum and respect for court processes. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property, with intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property. Though shoplifting may be regarded as a “minor” offence in some circles, persistent offending as exhibited here engages intensified sentencing scrutiny. The Sentencing Council guidelines on theft offences articulate a framework that considers culpability, harm, and mitigating or aggravating factors. Crucially, a course of conduct spanning multiple incidents, especially when involving vulnerable victims or community impact, attracts enhanced penalties. In R v. Atkinson [2024] EWCA Crim 1351, the Court affirmed that repeat offending involving planned manipulation and targeting of small businesses requires a deterrent sentence. Atkinson’s behaviour bore similarities in both methodology and impact and resulted in a custodial sentence reflecting public protection priorities. Though distinct, the facts of R v. Thompson [2023] EWCA Crim 1127 are instructive. There, the defendant’s persistent shop theft from pharmacy premises was linked to underlying substance misuse. Sentencing considerations included the offender’s engagement with structured treatment and demonstrated remorse. While your engagement has been notably less cooperative, Thompson serves to highlight the role that rehabilitation can and should play in sentencing strategy where feasible. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. Conversely, the Court must be mindful of the ruling in R v. Grant [2025] EWCA Crim 945, which explicitly cautioned against leniency where defendants have failed to avail themselves of available support and continue to offend. Grant was a case involving repeated theft of foodstuffs from charity shops, conducted over months despite previous warnings and diversionary interventions. The Court emphasised that community safety and victim confidence require sentences that reflect the seriousness of offending as well as its persistence. By analogy, that approach informs the present case. This court cannot and does not view your offences in isolation from the broader social context in which they occurred. The empirical reality of increased street homelessness, economic precarity, and the ordinary anxieties accompanying post-pandemic recovery bear on many defendants who enter these precincts. Nevertheless, such circumstances do not excuse nor justify persistent criminal conduct. The danger exists that omission of consequence may further erode social cohesion and embolden those who would exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain. Of particular note is the strain placed upon local housing services, which, as documented in a report from the Manchester Housing Partnership dated 10 August 2026, is running at near capacity with substantial waiting lists. This environmental stress adds a difficult backdrop against which offences such as yours occur, but again cannot be permitted to distort the court’s overarching duty to uphold lawful conduct. The issue of contributory hardship was examined in the recent case of R v. Sutherland [2026] EWCA Crim 210, which clarified that while poverty and unstable housing are matters of potential mitigation, they do not provide carte blanche for criminal activity. Equally, the phenomenon of increased digital engagement in retail, including the introduction of self-scan checkouts and anonymous payment methods, has created novel opportunities for offenders but equally novel challenges for courts and law enforcement. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, claimed it wasn’t a serious crime and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. The Probation Service shall consider all rehabilitative options as part of the pre-sentence process. The possibility of structured supervision, cognitive-behavioural programmes tailored to theft-related offending, and restorative justice pathways merit exploration, balanced against an assessment of public protection requirements. Conversely, custodial sentences remain the necessary disposition where repeated defiance of law and failure to engage with support services converge in ways that jeopardise community confidence and safety. The sentencing hearing today has proceeded in open court. I acknowledge the contributions of both Crown and defence counsel and the cooperation of allied agencies. The court also notes, with respect, the challenges posed by prolonged and multifaceted investigations, as well as the systemic pressures afflicting mental health services and social support networks. It remains the responsibility of the court to impose a sentence reflective of the gravity of the offending, the need for deterrence, and your particular circumstances including personal background, prior history, and psychiatric assessment. At this juncture, however, I must reserve final judgment until receipt of the detailed pre-sentence report currently being prepared by the probation service. This report will be instrumental in framing the custodial versus community sentencing debate in this instance. I remind you of your right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days of the handing down of judgment. The proceedings have been duly recorded under Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5, and no reporting restrictions currently apply. These sentencing remarks are delivered this 14th day of September 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. The support and decorum maintained by court officers and registry staff during this matter have been exemplary and are hereby acknowledged. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT DARTFORD R v. MR H Case No. K2025/13422 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. MALCOLMSON Filed: 18 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on a charge of theft, specifically a course of conduct involving shoplifting offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour extends over a significant period and encompasses multiple retail premises within the Dartford and Gravesham boroughs. Procedural History Your arrest on 16 April 2025 came after an extensive multi-agency operation involving the local Dartford Police Division, the Kent Retail Crime Partnership, and civilian security teams from several affected stores. This prolonged investigation was marked by painstaking collation of surveillance material, staff interviews, and forensic analysis. The pattern of offending was identified only after multiple incidents were reported and linked, a task that, as this court has noted repeatedly, requires significant resources and collaboration, often testing the limits of law enforcement capacity. This case was initially listed before the magistrates given the low-level nature of the thefts, but due to the cumulative value and repeat character of the incidents, the charge was committed to this Crown Court for sentence pursuant to the direction under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The Better Case Management (BCM) protocol has governed the progression of this matter, and the court acknowledges the efforts of all parties in adhering, as far as practicable, to the timelines set out in the Criminal Procedure Rules. It must be acknowledged that this particular case fortunately avoided some of the more common delays afflicting similar cases in the current climate. Notably, the timely instruction of counsel, the consistent communication between the Crown Prosecution Service and defence representatives, and minimal last-minute adjournments enabled the matter to proceed, albeit with some understandable procedural pauses resulting from Legal Aid Agency review processes. I commend both Ms Rebecca Lowell for the Crown and Mr Daniel Drummond for the defence for their measured and professional handling of these proceedings. The court is painfully aware, however, of the systemic issues posed by the chronic underfunding and administrative inertia pervading Legal Aid authorisations. It remains a source of ongoing concern that requests for expert reports, including psychiatric and psychological assessments, linger unanswered for extended periods — a problem that compromises effective case preparation and, in the worst cases, risks undermining defendants’ rights. It is pertinent to observe, though perhaps expeditious to note, that on this occasion funding for a forensic assessment was expeditiously granted following a protracted exchange of correspondence between Mr Drummond’s chambers and the Agency. The psychiatric report, compiled by Dr Karen Sterling, was received and served in timely fashion, enabling the court to consider it fully alongside other expert reports and victim impact statements. The defendant has entered a guilty plea at the earliest possible stage practicable, that is, at the first opportunity when the prosecution evidence had been clearly established and before the matter reached interview or trial. Credit for this plea is accordingly given in accordance with well-established jurisprudence such as R v. Liveridge [2021] EWCA Crim 1579, which underlines the importance of recognising early admissions of culpability as a mitigating factor in sentencing. We live in a time when acquisitive crimes such as shoplifting present unique challenges to local policing and community welfare. The court is reminded of the recent report by the Home Office entitled “Retail Crime and its Impact on Consumers and Businesses,” published earlier this year, which identifies a troubling increase in repeat offences affecting small and medium-sized enterprises. Whilst this case may not reflect the more organised or gang-related theft operations that feature in national statistics, it exemplifies the persistent and corrosive effect such offences have on staff morale, public confidence, and the viability of local commerce. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. In considering these facts, the court is compelled to contextualise the offence within the broader social patterns noted by commentators and researchers alike. The normalisation of low-level dishonesty and the often-trivialised status of retail theft belie the very real consequences experienced by victims — from financial loss and increased security measures to psychological distress and diminished job satisfaction. Among the many victims in this case are employees of the “Greenvale” pharmacy chain who, in written statements, have described operational disruptions necessitated by your repeated intrusions. Staff anxiety reportedly increased to the point where shift patterns were altered, with lone working discouraged during times of previous offence. Such measures are costly, disruptive, and speak to the seriousness with which these crimes are taken by businesses despite their occasional minimisation in public discourse. In the domain of case law, it would be remiss not to mention R v. Carling [2020] EWCA Crim 1231, which concerned a defendant who repeatedly stole toiletries and accessories from various convenience stores, employing distraction techniques and the use of accomplices. Although Carling involved arguments over the role of organized crime, the principles articulated regarding the impact of sustained acquisitive offending on small businesses resonate with the present circumstances. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. The court pauses to recall the notable judgment of Lord Justice Cooke in R v. Hodgson [2018] EWCA Crim 998, where it was reiterated that while the culpability of theft offences is necessarily assessed by reference to factors such as value, planning, and persistence, the psychological and economic toll on workers and community members requires considered weight. Beyond the immediate legal landscape, a wider phenomenon merits reflection: the escalating strain placed on local authorities and voluntary organisations by ongoing acquisitive crime. Charitable entities such as \"SafeStep,\" which provide support and advocacy for retail workers, have reported rising numbers of clients suffering from workplace stress attributable to theft-related incidents. Their correspondence to this court highlights a systemic need for greater recognition and resources devoted to staff welfare in sectors frequently targeted by such offences. Equally, there is cause for concern regarding the capacity of probation services and rehabilitative frameworks to respond effectively to recidivist acquisitive offenders amid mounting caseloads and staff shortages. The court notes correspondence from the Kent Probation Trust underscoring the challenges posed by increased pre-sentence workload combined with the management of multi-agency public protection arrangements. The persistent imbalance between demand and resource availability is well documented and regrettably continues to hamper the delivery of tailored interventions. In a similar vein, multiple judicial authorities have commented on the benefits and limitations of community sentences in mitigating repeat offending. The report prepared by Ms Joanne Hartley, probation officer assigned to this case, provides an insightful analysis of the necessity for focused cognitive-behavioural programmes addressing impulsivity, financial management, and addiction support, all of which may be pertinent in your circumstances. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. Dr Sterling’s psychiatric evaluation, which has been given careful consideration, acknowledges that while you do not meet the criteria for any major psychiatric diagnosis, there exist significant personality traits marked by emotional dysregulation and intermittent substance misuse, which may have contributed to your criminal behaviours. She observes that these factors, coupled with socio-economic hardship and a lack of stable accommodation, present a complex and challenging rehabilitation profile. It is unfortunate that, despite previous offers, your engagement with available support services has been inconsistent. This is regrettable not only from the standpoint of your own wellbeing but also in terms of the broader imperative to reduce reoffending and protect the public. The court must emphasise that access to community resources, while important, cannot substitute for individual commitment. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. The sentencing framework in cases of theft has developed over many years. The Sentencing Council's definitive guideline on Theft Offences (September 2021) provides comprehensive structure for assessing seriousness and appropriate ranges of penalty. Aggravating factors include persistence, targeting of vulnerable victims, and previous convictions; mitigating factors may encompass early guilty pleas, genuine remorse, and demonstrable efforts to address underlying causes. Among the principles reinforced by appellate courts is the limited, though important, role of personal circumstances in outweighing public protection objectives. In R v. Newell [2019] EWCA Crim 1457, it was stressed that courts must balance compassion with deterrence and the need to uphold societal expectations of responsibility. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. The courts do not lose sight of the difficult social environment in which many offenders find themselves. The rising prevalence of street homelessness, as widely reported in regional studies last year, and the resulting risks of exploitation, substance misuse, and mental health deterioration, all contribute to an environment conducive to criminal behaviour. However, as Lord Justice O’Connor noted in R v. Sidhu [2023] EWCA Crim 2125, these factors should inform but never dominate sentencing determinations. Your personal history, while replete with challenges, falls within this familiar category. The chronicity of offending despite multiple interventions underlines the complexity faced by those attempting rehabilitation. It also highlights the importance of public protection considerations, particularly given the risk of escalation or diversification of offending behaviour if left unchecked. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. The court must consider also the broader context of multi-agency collaboration in the management of offending risk. The Kent Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) have developed refined strategies for risk assessment and offender management, but their focus naturally remains on higher-level risks – violent, sexual, or organised crime. Low-level acquisitive offending does not typically engage MAPPA protocols but nevertheless demands attention from local safeguarding partnerships to prevent entrenchment and harm to communities. It is notable that the defendant’s previous interactions with police and probation authorities, according to recorded case files, display a sporadic pattern of engagement, with several referrals to diversion programmes failing to yield sustained outcomes. The probation note dated 1 August 2024 records the defendant’s disengagement from a community order imposed then for similar offences. Such patterns constrain sentencing options and inform the court’s assessment of appropriate custodial or community-based sanctions. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. The evidence confirms that your offending conduct has been deliberate, calculated, and repeated despite previous warnings. Items targeted were often high-demand consumer goods such as health and beauty products or over-the-counter medicines — goods readily resalable and thus of continuing interest to offenders motivated by financial gain. Accounts from retail managers depict a palpable sense of disruption not only to operational efficiency but also to staff morale. The fear of collision with a known offender during lone shifts and the subsequent stress symptoms reported by employees were corroborated by a workplace health and safety audit commissioned in April 2025. Such intangible harms are often overlooked in the quantification of loss but speak to a broader societal cost. The impact of your conduct on the willingness of small business owners to maintain storefronts in vulnerable areas, or on local economies as a whole, though hard to measure precisely, must nonetheless be recognised. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. The court further notes that the present case does not involve allegations of violence or threats thereof. Your conduct, whilst persistent and damaging, appears confined to non-violent means, which ought to be considered when calibrating an appropriate sentence. Nevertheless, it should be understood that non-violent offences may nonetheless inflict serious psychological distress and cumulative harm. It is also important, in a reasonable exercise of discretion, to refrain from conflating this case with offences committed by unconnected co-defendants or associates, or the importation of drugs and other serious crime in the local area which, while concerning, bear no factual relevance here. In a recent judgment, R v. Delaney [2024] EWCA Crim 3032, the Court of Appeal dealt with the issue of co-defendant conduct in multi-party cases and reminded sentencing judges of the necessity to isolate personal culpability from that of others. The present proceedings comply fully with that principle: the focus is solely on your actions and responsibility. In determining the disposition in this case, the court must weigh the seriousness of your repeated, opportunistic offending and the harm caused, against any mitigating personal circumstances and prospects for rehabilitation. Whilst your guilty plea is noted and welcomed, it comes against a backdrop of multiple prior convictions and unsuccessful diversion attempts. This pattern signals a degree of persistence that requires decisive intervention. The court must balance the need to protect retail staff and the public, to deter others, and to foster rehabilitation. At sentencing, the court will consider all available options, including custodial sentences, community orders incorporating rehabilitative requirements such as accredited Thinking Skills Programmes, unpaid work, and attendance at drug and alcohol support services should these be recommended. It is essential that the sentence imposed is proportionate, structured to reduce risk, and mindful of the broader interests of justice. Accordingly, the court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith, addressing not only your offending history and personal circumstances but also any identified mental health concerns, accommodation stability, and willingness to engage with support services. The report should explore the suitability and feasibility of community-based sentences, conditions likely to promote compliance, and the likelihood of desistance. I note that the hearing today has been conducted in open court, with due regard to the interests of all parties. I thank Ms Rebecca Lowell and Mr Daniel Drummond for their efforts, and acknowledge the invaluable assistance of forensic and probation professionals whose input has informed these remarks. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal sentence within 28 days under the relevant legislation. There are no reporting restrictions or anonymity orders at this stage. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 October 2025, in Court 6 at Dartford Crown Court. The proceedings are transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be sent to the appropriate authorities for processing. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. T2026/04538 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. D. Hargraves Filed: 17 September 2026 Mr H, you appear before this court today charged with theft from retail premises pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, which you now admit, spans an extended timeframe of some 18 months, principally occurring within multiple commercial districts across the Greater Bristol area including but not limited to the Harbourside and Clifton shopping precincts. Procedural History Your case has proceeded through various procedural milestones typical of the Crown Court locus for such offending, including plea and trial preparation hearings, in accordance with the Better Case Management (BCM) framework as set out within the Criminal Procedure Rules. The BCM initiative was established to streamline the timeliness and preparation of cases heard in the Crown Court and to ensure evidential clarity from an early stage. I note that in the present instance, there have been delays beyond the usual targets due largely to procedural matters connected with expert report acquisition and Legal Aid funding approvals. Applications for Legal Aid to fund a forensic psychologist specialising in acquisitive offending behaviour were initially lodged on 15 July 2026 but, regrettably, were only authorised after multiple resubmissions and substantial correspondence between defence solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency, prolonging the preparatory phase. Such administrative inertia is by now an unfortunate hallmark of many courtroom proceedings and continues to place strain both on the defence and the court system alike. The initial charge was presented following your arrest on 3 May 2026 after the conclusion of an investigation coordinated by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, leveraging resources from the Bristol Business Crime Partnership and local shopkeeper liaison officers. This investigation was underpinned by a process of cumulative evidence collection, encompassing recorded video surveillance, witness statements from employees and store managers, and forensic examination of recovered property. This case also saw the involvement of the Gloucestershire Retail Theft Task Unit, which, while not having jurisdiction over the offence locations, provided intelligence sharing on persons of interest carrying suspect histories of repeat offences, enabling a broader assessment of patterns and potential associative behaviour. The pooling of multi-agency information is commendable, notwithstanding variations in data retention policies and operational protocols—which are frequently challenging in cross-force crime responsiveness. It is worth pausing to recognise the tireless efforts of store staff who, despite typically limited training and resources, are expected to perform functions akin to front-line investigators and custodians of corporate asset protection. Their bereft morale, irritably expressed via formal complaints about the inadequacy of security support, is nevertheless juxtaposed against the stoic persistence they maintain in the face of repeat offending. For context, the court notes that this year—similar to trends observable in South West England—retail theft incidents reportedly increased by approximately 14%, as documented in the Avon and Somerset Constabulary’s annual report on acquisitive crimes. These statistics mirror national-level trajectories observed in the Office for National Statistics Crime Survey data, underscoring the persistent challenge retail theft poses to both business viability and community safety. The prosecuting Crown has been represented throughout by Ms Emma Hargrove, QC, whose detailed submissions have been both precise and measured, drawing upon extensive case precedents addressing repeat theft and community impact. Your defence team has been ably led by Mr Rohan Bailey of counsel, instructed under a current representation order. While this sentencing hearing has been held in open court, it is pertinent to observe the continuing public disinterest the matter reflects, with no media attendance recorded despite the court’s location within an urban centre. This absence is emblematic of the wider phenomenon of diminished public engagement where crimes lack sensationalism, revealing a disconnect between the quotidian justice administered and the public’s appetite for judicial transparency or scrutiny. Mr H, you initially entered a not guilty plea at your appearance on 20 May 2026 but subsequently altered your position to a guilty plea at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 29 July 2026 after the prosecution served additional evidence including enhanced digital footage and reconstructed transaction logs. The late plea inevitably attracts limited reduction in sentence, in line with long-standing principles reiterated in R v. Dacres [2021] EWCA Crim 1331 and R v. Lawrence [2022] EWCA Crim 1901, where the courts have made clear that timing and motivation for pleading are central to the awarding of credit. It is not the role of this court to pass judgment upon your tactical decisions but to emphasise that late pleas, though legally permissible, rarely afford significant mitigating effect absent demonstrable remorse or cooperation. This stance serves both the interests of justice and the efficient administration of court processes. Turning now to the relevant evidential and factual matrix, I shall outline the procedural history leading to today’s sentencing outcome and take account of reports and submissions tendered on your behalf and submitted in accordance with court directions. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. Before addressing the facts in detail, it is appropriate to consider the legal framework within which sentencing operates in cases of retail theft. The principal statutory authority remains the Theft Act 1968, supplemented and interpreted by a robust body of case law and sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council. The 2020 Theft Guideline establishes a structured approach to assessing culpability and harm, recognising the intrinsic tension between the value of goods stolen, the persistence and planning of offending, and the personal circumstances of the offender. While the financial value can sometimes appear modest, courts are enjoined to give significant weight to the broader impact, including the effect on victims — often store employees and small business owners — as well as the ancillary societal consequences of diminished trust in commercial environments. The Court notes that your offending involved repeated targeting of a range of premises including pharmacies, convenience stores, and boutique retailers. While no injuries or threats of violence occurred, the psychological toll and erosion of confidence among workers and proprietors are well-documented in the victim personal statements submitted by the Bristol Retail Enterprise Association. I also consider precedent cases bearing on sentencing in repeat shoplifting scenarios. In R v. Latimer [2021] EWCA Crim 947, the Court of Appeal underscored the gravity attached to repeat theft where evidence of planning and a degree of sophistication was apparent. A custodial sentence was upheld where the defendant exploited points-of-sale for financial gain and used distraction techniques to evade detection, resulting in significant loss to multiple retailers. Equally instructive is R v. Blackwell [2020] EWCA Crim 1129, which demonstrates that offences previously considered low-level must be recontextualised when committed persistently, with elevated disregard for victim impact and prior warnings. These authorities reinforce the conclusion that persistence and premeditation attract enhanced culpability, notwithstanding the individual quantum of loss. From a social policy perspective, repeated offending of this nature impacts adversely upon community cohesion and undermines public confidence in law and order. It also diverts police and regulatory resources otherwise deployable against more serious disorder or crime categories. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. The court acknowledges that from the outset of these proceedings, your circumstances have been described as challenging, including periods of housing instability and fluctuating employment. The defence has relied upon a series of character references and support letters, including those from the Bristol Homelessness Support Network and the Community Mental Health Outreach Service. These documents attest to your personal efforts to engage with support services, as well as outlining a history of benefit receipt and prior voluntary assistance arrangements. However, I must balance these mitigating factors against the findings of the clinical reports before the court. Dr Jonathan Meeks, forensic psychologist, was instructed to undertake a comprehensive evaluation following the initial Legal Aid approval. His report, dated 15 August 2026, provides a nuanced assessment of your mental state and offending behaviour. Dr Meeks concluded that while there was no evidence of a severe psychiatric disorder impairing responsibility, there were significant personality traits consistent with impulsivity, borderline emotional regulation, and episodic substance misuse. While these factors may modulate culpability to some extent, they do not excuse the persistence of unlawful activity. Moreover, Dr Meeks emphasises a lack of sustained engagement with therapeutic intervention opportunities offered by mental health and social services. This pattern is regrettably common among offenders with similar backgrounds, but the consequences of non-engagement must be acknowledged in assessing risk and future compliance. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. The Probation Service pre-sentence report dated 10 September 2026 corroborates this picture. The probation officer notes your cooperation during assessment but highlights a history of intermittent compliance with statutory and voluntary programs. Past referrals to financial budgeting workshops and substance misuse counselling were poorly attended, with no demonstrable behavioural change. This poses particular concerns given the profile of acquisitive crime, where impulsivity and financial desperation frequently intertwine. There remains a medium level of risk for further offending unless proactive engagement and support are sustained. The report sets out recommendations for a structured community penalty incorporating rehabilitative elements adapted to identified criminogenic needs. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. To contextualise the seriousness of your conduct, it is worth recalling that alongside the shoplifting offences directly attributable to you, investigations disclosed the involvement of two co-defendants whose activities, while overlapping temporally and geographically with your offences, are distinct in nature. One co-defendant was charged and subsequently pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary in relation to an unrelated incident at a residential property in Easton, involving forced entry and intimidation. This offence has no direct bearing upon your sentencing but reminds us of the varied spectrum of acquisitive and violent offences circulating in the region. The other co-defendant faced charges for possession of a bladed article in a school car park, a matter proceeding independently. These related but legally separable cases illustrate the complexity often encountered in multi-defendant investigations, underscoring the importance of focusing on your personal responsibility and conduct. Further complicating the proceedings was a delay occasioned by a strike action involving court administrative staff, which necessitated the adjournment of the planned sentencing hearing from 7 September to today's date. Such delays, while regrettable, remain a feature of the contemporary justice environment and highlight systemic pressures on judiciary and support services. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. In mitigation, the court gratefully acknowledges the various letters tendered on your behalf, including one from your sister and several from the Bristol Soup Kitchen and Threads of Care charity organisations. These letters paint a picture of someone striving to overcome significant obstacles and attempting to engage with available support systems. The voluntary sector's role in supporting individuals caught in the revolving door of acquisitive offending cannot be overstated. These bodies operate under chronic funding restrictions, tackling problem complexity often invisible to statutory agencies. Their efforts in your case have been marked by patience and measured prudence, resisting the temptation to excuse wrongdoing while advocating for humane and constructive approaches. The court also notes submissions from the Bristol Retail Crime Prevention Network drawing attention to the ongoing impact of shoplifting on independent retailers in the city centre. Many such businesses operate on narrow margins and are acutely vulnerable to shrinkage caused by theft, resulting in store closures and job losses. I thank all involved parties for their candid representations, which have greatly informed the court’s deliberations. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. As is the unfortunate norm in such cases, your criminal record reveals a pattern of repeat offending. Since age 24, you have attracted a series of convictions and community resolutions, largely for theft-related offences. These prior interactions with the criminal justice system strongly inform the assessment of your culpability and the risk posed to the public. Despite multiple warnings and diversion interventions, the continuation of offending conduct is regrettable. The court takes a particularly dim view of repeated acquisitive behaviour which disrupts the livelihoods of local businesses and erodes community cohesion. It is well established in case law, including the decision in R v. Reid [2019] EWCA Crim 1452, that persistence in offending following prior convictions and community orders is a significant aggravating factor, and can warrant custodial penalties to reflect the urgency of addressing recidivism. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The cumulative effect of these offences, while involving relatively low individual values, must be seen in light of the broader disruption they cause. Loss caused to retail premises is more than a mere financial figure; it represents hours of staff time diverted to investigation, increased security costs, and increased insurance premiums, which, when aggregated, burden commercial entities and ultimately consumers. Staff morale is also impacted, with employees reporting heightened anxiety, fear of confrontation, and in some instances, a sense of helplessness. Victim personal statements included in the prosecution bundle bear eloquent testimony to these effects. Mr H, while the court acknowledges the absence of direct threats or violence in your conduct, the pernicious psychological harm wrought by repeat theft remains an important factor in sentencing consideration. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. The lingering spectre of substance misuse complicates the narrative in your case. While no direct causal link has been firmly established between drug use and your offending, clinical reports and self-reports disclose episodes of alcohol excess and suspected illicit drug consumption. Such factors are well recognised contributory elements in impulsive, acquisitive crime, as noted in judicial commentary including R v. Willis [2018] EWCA Crim 1067 and associated psychiatric literature. Clinicians frequently advise incorporating substance misuse treatment into rehabilitative frameworks to disrupt offending pathways. Service provision in this area, however, remains constrained by extensive waiting lists and variable engagement rates, reflecting broader challenges in the national health service and social care funding. I encourage probation and affiliated services to explore suitable interventions that could assist in addressing these underlying vulnerabilities in your forthcoming supervision plan. Before concluding, I must remark upon the collective burden persistent shoplifting inflicts on public services. The gathering, collation, and analysis of CCTV data, the preparation of witness statements, and the administrative processing of charges represent an appreciable drain on police and court resources. Digital forensic departments, too, are frequently over-engaged, tasked with retrieving and authenticating video evidence often comprising dozens of hours of footage per case. The volume and complexity of such material is significant and growing, exacerbated by increasing reliance on evolving technologies and data systems. While the courts are conscious of these pressures, they cannot colour impartial adjudication and sentencing outcomes. Justice must continue to be done efficiently but without surrendering to expediency at the expense of fairness and public protection. I also refer to the recent establishment of the Avon Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) procedures and their integration with local Community Safety Partnerships. Though primarily focused on domestic abuse and serious violence, the experience here also informs best practice in multi-agency collaboration on repeat acquisitive offending, including data-sharing and intervention coordination. The court expresses cautious optimism that such models can reduce repeat offending and improve outcomes, albeit recognising limitations posed by fluctuating personnel and resource constraints. In summation, this is a case of persistent theft, committed over a lengthy period, which has caused both economic loss and significant distress to individuals and retail businesses. While your personal circumstances explain some aspects of your behaviour, they do not absolve you of responsibility. The pre-sentence reports and psychiatric assessments suggest that with structured support and supervision, the risk of reoffending can be mitigated, but compliance remains uncertain. Sentencing options before the court include community orders with rehabilitative conditions, custodial sentences, and combinations thereof, always calibrated to balance punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. I shall therefore adjourn sentencing to a later date to enable the probation service to provide a full pre-sentence report, setting out layers of intervention deemed viable for your circumstances and detailing a risk management plan. This step will also facilitate any submissions from the Crown and defence on specific proposals or representations. The court is mindful of the need to act expeditiously but fairly, ensuring that sentence imposed reflects the gravity of the offending and your prospects for reformation. The sentencing hearing is accordingly adjourned to 5 November 2026. You are reminded of your obligations and rights in the intervening period. These remarks are issued this 17th day of September 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant bodies for registration and enforcement. You are informed of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days of its imposition, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BASINGSTOKE R v. MR H Case No. T2025/14567 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. W. HARROW Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction for offences of theft—more specifically, shoplifting—from various retail premises within the Hampshire area during the latter part of 2024 and early 2025. The offences encompass a period of some eight months and involve multiple locations across the Basingstoke, Winchester, and Southampton districts. Procedural History Your case has progressed through a series of hearings beginning with your apprehension on 5 February 2025. Initial charges were laid following an investigation by officers from Hampshire Constabulary’s Commercial Crime Unit in conjunction with local council licensing enforcement teams. The investigation arose from reports submitted by several retail outlets noting a suspicious pattern of thefts involving similar modus operandi—a pattern which, after considerable collation of CCTV footage, witnessed testimonies, and inventory audits, pointed in your direction. That process, while necessary, was lengthy and resource-intensive, taxing several units far beyond their routine caseload given the complexity of aligning evidence across jurisdictions and premises. It bears noting at this juncture that your case exemplifies the multifaceted challenges inherent in policing what is frequently termed 'low-level crime.' Such offences are often dismissed in public discourse as harmless or incidental. Yet, as the court has observed in numerous past judgments, the aggregate effect of these offences exacts a significant toll on businesses, employees, and public confidence. Resources spent here are inevitably diverted from other investigative priorities, as recognised in R v. Cartwright [2019] EWCA Crim 812, where the Court of Appeal emphasised that the cumulative impact of petty acquisitive offences can warrant sentences proportionate to their broader societal effect rather than the precise value of individual items stolen. After your arrest, substantial investigative steps were undertaken, including detailed forensic examination of clothing seized from your residence and analysis of electronic device data obtained pursuant to a search warrant authorised by a designated judicial officer. The utilisation of such warrants, particularly for digital extraction, follows strict procedures aimed at balancing investigatory necessity against individual privacy rights, as outlined in R v. Keaton [2020] EWHC 175 (Admin). In your case, the evidence gleaned formed a crucial component of the prosecution’s case, allowing corroboration between digital timelines and physical observations. The matter was listed initially for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 4 March 2025 but was adjourned twice owing to delayed Legal Aid authorisations for expert assessment—an unfortunate but far from isolated procedural difficulty faced by criminal courts in recent years. Indeed, your defence team’s application for approval to instruct a forensic psychiatrist registered only in late April, following a series of exchanges with the Legal Aid Agency characterised by administrative opacity and protracted response times. The systemic nature of these delays carries real implications, not only as an inconvenience to defendants but as substantive obstacles to effective justice, a point the Court of Appeal recently considered in R v. Letts [2024] EWCA Crim 265, expressing concern over growing procedural inertia in defence funding decisions. Upon the grant of such authority, the instructed expert, Dr Amanda Jefferies, submitted a detailed report in early June, assessing both your cognitive and psychiatric profile with a view to determining mitigating factors relevant to sentencing. Dr Jefferies’ evaluation undertakes a comprehensive review of your developmental history, past trauma exposure, neurocognitive functioning, and current psychological health. The assessment, though thorough, concludes that no diagnosable mental disorder sufficiently impaired your responsibility at the time of offences, albeit noting impulsivity and limited insight into consequences. While the findings do not mandate diminished culpability, they nonetheless inform the court’s holistic consideration of your circumstances. In conjunction with this, a probation pre-sentence report was commissioned, providing supplementary insights into your socio-economic background, lifestyle, and prior criminal record. The probation officer, Ms Helen Tramontane, highlights episodic homelessness, intermittent contact with social services, and previous informal diversionary measures, including participation in a shoplifting intervention workshop in 2023. Encouragingly, probation reports note periods of engagement with community support groups specializing in financial literacy and emotional regulation, though these were sporadic and ultimately insufficient to prevent reoffending. The report sets out potential community sentence options and rehabilitative programmes tailored to reduce recidivism. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. It is necessary to situate the court’s examination of this case within the evolving statutory and judicial framework governing theft offences. As codified within the Theft Act 1968, theft remains an offence encompassing the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. Shoplifting offences, while often caught by summary procedures under local bylaws or fixed penalty notices, escalate in seriousness when perpetrated repeatedly or within a pattern exhibiting planning and disregard for lawful authority, as emphasised in the Sentencing Council guideline for theft and handling stolen goods (October 2019). This matter engages the Crown Court’s jurisdiction owing to the scale and complexity of the conduct, as well as the defendant’s prior record, which disqualifies summary disposal under the Magistrates’ Court Sentencing Guidelines 2020. The principles enunciated in R v. O’Sullivan [2018] EWCA Crim 5 also direct the court to have proper regard to the cumulative nature of conduct over time, especially where offences are committed across multiple premises, involving different victim entities. It might be instructive, at this juncture, to briefly consider related appellate precedent touching on aspects of sentencing calibrations for acquisitive crime. In R v. Windham [2023] EWCA Crim 1541, dealing with a case of aggravated burglary involving use of weapons and intimidation, the court underscored that while violence magnifies harm and culpability, so too does persistent disregard for others’ property rights where it erodes public confidence. Though not directly applicable here, Windham’s observations on cumulative harm bear implicit relevance to serial acquisitive offending. Similarly, in R v. Meredith [2022] EWCA Crim 990, the Court grappled with the tension between economic hardship as a mitigating factor and personal responsibility, concluding that individual deprivation does not excuse calculated dishonesty. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. While outside the direct purview of this proceeding, it is worth noting the Court’s awareness of contemporary policy debates surrounding the Business Crime Reduction Strategy implemented regionally since 2022. These initiatives focus on collaboration between retailers, police forces, and local authority bodies to identify repeat offenders and apply targeted interventions pre-emptively. Despite significant enthusiasm at the policy level, implementation remains uneven, with regional differences in resourcing and operational efficacy. Indeed, a report published by the National Retail Federation in June 2025 lamented ongoing deficiencies in communication between stakeholders and a lack of clarity regarding data sharing protocols, compromised further by privacy legislation constraints. Nonetheless, the efforts undertaken by the Hampshire Retail Security Forum in this matter represent a coordinated attempt to address systemic retail crime challenges, an effort to which officers from the Constabulary, shop floor security personnel, and local crime reduction specialists committed significant time and expertise. There is, of course, an entire body of case law unrelated to the present facts which nonetheless informs the court’s appreciation of the broad social context in which acquisitive offences occur. For instance, in R v. Yates [2019] EWCA Crim 682, concerning fly-tipping on protected greenbelt land leading to environmental damage valued in the tens of thousands of pounds, the Court highlighted the community-wide repercussions of seemingly “minor” unlawful acts. While totally distinct from theft, the reflections on collective responsibility and environmental stewardship resonate here. Similarly, R v. Dobson [2017] EWCA Crim 927, involving affray triggered by an altercation within a licensed nightclub, despite bearing no factual nexus to this case, provides judicial commentary on public order and community trust, which underpin many theft-related offences in urban centres. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. Regarding other procedural matters, the court notes the contributions of various parties in this matter. Ms Olivia Bristow, solicitor for the Crown, has presented a well-structured outline of the prosecution’s position, supported by extensive evidential exhibits and victim impact statements. Her submissions were measured, appropriately calibrated, and cognizant of the wider social difficulties facing defendants such as yourself, yet uncompromising in highlighting the harm caused to local businesses and staff. For the defence, Mr Richard Iverson provided articulate submissions focusing on your personal circumstances, recent attempts at engagement with welfare provision, and the psychological factors articulated by Dr Jefferies. His advocacy exemplifies the professionalism expected of defence counsel, particularly in complex Crown Court proceedings involving multi-faceted evidence. In reviewing the victim impact material, this court acknowledges the consistent testimony regarding disruption to business operations, the burden placed on already stretched retail teams, and the anxiety engendered by recurrent loss and prospective financial pressures. The Chamberlain’s Pharmaceuticals retail chain, for example, submitted detailed observations on the cumulative economic impact of repeat thefts, noting increased expenditure on security staff, installation of anti-theft systems, and changes to employee shift patterns to mitigate risk. References from frontline retail workers evoke tangible stress and feelings of vulnerability, underscoring a dimension of harm not always captured by simple monetary quantification. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. In reviewing your personal history, as documented in probation assessments and corroborated by community worker reports, it is apparent that you have faced a series of socio-economic challenges, including periods of unstable accommodation, episodic engagement with mental health services, and documented early childhood adversity. While these are not reasons for excusing culpability, they factor into the broader assessment of risk and rehabilitation potential. Indeed, probation reports recommend a combination of structured community supervision, engagement with cognitive behavioural therapy modules, and possibly a curfew and daily reporting requirement. The court has also received correspondence from the Basingstoke Homeless Outreach Partnership, which attests to your recent attempts to stabilise housing and seek employment, albeit with limited success. Their letter emphasises the resource constraints under which such organisations operate and the critical importance of sustained engagement by service users. The partnership highlights the dangerous gulf between aspiration and accessibility, a gap which often precipitates recidivism if unaddressed. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. It merits recognition that in the course of the criminal proceedings, a co-defendant initially charged alongside you was subject to separate bail conditions pending trial on more serious matters, including a charge involving possession of a bladed article on school premises, a wholly unrelated offence distinct from your involvement. That co-defendant failed to appear at an earlier hearing and is currently wanted on warrant. While their conduct is legally independent of your case, the fact of co-defendant abscondment has occasioned repeated procedural delays in the listing of this matter, causing additional inconvenience and pressure on court resources. Further, the court is cognisant of certain anecdotal delays in interpreter services at the initial hearings—a problem not uncommon in busy Crown Courts, which occasionally impacts the timely progression of cases involving non-English speakers. Though this issue did not affect your matter directly, it exemplifies the broader systemic challenges faced across the judicial infrastructure. Moreover, the court notes that separate criminal proceedings in the city involving historical arson at a commercial property caused some disruption to allocation of judges and courtrooms earlier in 2025. That arson offence, committed in March and April 2025 by unrelated individuals, resulted in extended trial hearings and reallocation of judicial personnel within the Crown Court complex. While unrelated to the current proceedings, such events form part of the operational environment in which cases like yours are inevitably heard. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. Turning to sentencing principles, theft offences attract a range of possible dispositions from financial penalties and community orders through to immediate custody, guided by the Sentencing Council’s Theft and Handling Stolen Goods guideline. Factors elevating seriousness include persistence, premeditation, targeting of vulnerable victims, and breach of trust. Mitigating factors may encompass early guilty pleas, remorse, efforts at reparation, and personal circumstances reducing culpability or risk. It is to your credit that you entered a guilty plea at the earliest practicable opportunity once the weight of evidence became clear, which is acknowledged as a significant mitigating feature under R v. Bedwell [2023] EWCA Crim 301. The court must, however, remain mindful that acceptance of responsibility, while commendable, does not negate the damaging consequences of your offending nor its broader impact on community safety and commerce. Dr Jefferies’ report cautions that while no major psychiatric illness was found, your impulsive tendencies and difficulties in emotional regulation carry moderate risk factors for future offending absent structured intervention. The pre-sentence report similarly recommends cognitive-behavioural work and financial management programmes, pointing out your partial engagement to date but fragility of sustained compliance. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. During the course of the investigation, separate from this case but concurrently active in the region, a series of offences involving the theft of copper cabling from railway depots was prosecuted by the South Central Trains Police Unit. These incidents, resulting in power disruptions and costly repairs, involved an unrelated group and are of tangential interest only. Nonetheless, their continuation has drawn focus to the increasing vulnerability of infrastructure assets and the resource demands posed by acquisitive crime more generally. Additionally, an unrelated inquiry into criminal damage involving graffiti on public transport facilities throughout southern England culminated recently in a series of convictions. The defendants therein were subject to restorative justice programmes rather than custodial sentence. While this provides a contrasting example of sentencing outcomes, it carries no direct bearing on your case. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. The court recognises the complicated interface between your history, personal challenges, the nature of the offending, and the requirements of justice, deterrence, and community safety. Custodial sentences are appropriate where culpability is high and other measures insufficient to protect the public or reduce risk of reoffending. Equally, community sentences with bespoke interventions are preferable where practicable and likely to be effective. Practical considerations, including your residential stability and willingness to participate in rehabilitative provisions, weigh in favour of a structured community order. However, the extent and pattern of offending, your prior record, and the significant aggravating features— notably persistence and disregard for previous warnings—limit the scope for leniency. Accordingly, the court now directs that a full and detailed pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith by the Probation Service, taking into account psychological assessments, risk evaluations, and available community resources. The report shall consider potential packages of supervision, including any available cognitive skills programmes, unpaid work requirements, electronically monitored curfew, and interventions addressing impulsivity and financial management. It will also investigate possibilities for restorative justice engagement, particularly as to whether victims or retailers might be willing to participate. The overarching objective remains the dual aims of reducing risk to the public and supporting your rehabilitation in a sustainable manner. These sentencing remarks are issued this 17th day of September 2025, in Court 5 at Basingstoke Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the requisite authorities. You are informed of your statutory right to appeal within 28 days of sentence under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply unless otherwise ordered. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HULL R v. Mr H Case No. H2025/03847 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. J. PENNINGTON Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for offences of theft, said to have taken place in various retail outlets within the city of Hull and its environs over a period extending from late 2023 through to early 2025. The charges arise under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. In simple terms, the indictment represents a consolidated count reflecting a course of conduct characterised by repeated shoplifting and dishonest appropriation. The procedural history of this matter is of some note, for it traverses several months of preparatory hearings, evidential collation, and applications to the Legal Aid Agency for funding of expert assessments. The case was originally lodged at the Magistrates’ Court on 27 January 2025, following an amalgamated referral from local authorities and participating retailers brought together under the auspices of the Hull Retail Crime Prevention Board. From there, it was committed to this Crown Court with a view to trial and sentencing under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, a mechanism designed to streamline the progression of indictable offences by early identification of issues, tailoring of directions, and minimisation of unnecessary delay. Despite these laudable aims, the case experienced some administrative delays, not least occasioned by strike action within the court support staff in April and the late arrival of forensic reports, themselves impeded by competing workload demands placed upon the city forensic laboratory. It is worth remarking the origins of the BCM process. Emerging from reforms in the early 2010s following well-documented concerns over the inefficiencies of criminal case progression, BCM sought to enforce a more rigorous regime of case management by judges, magistrates, and the legal teams. Its provisions require early disclosure, case allocation, and movement toward fully defined trial readiness, fostering early admissions where appropriate, and thereby alleviating pressure upon the court list. The adoption of BCM principles has transformed the landscape of serious crime prosecution, notwithstanding certain continuing challenges related to resource constraints and complexity. The present matter proceeded against this framework, with initial hearings held on 14 March and 2 July respectively, towards a plea and trial preparation hearing set for 15 September 2025. Concerning the evidence, you were arrested on 5 September 2025 after a routine patrol disrupted an incident involving items suspected of being unlawfully taken from a convenience store on Ferensway. Your apprehension followed a series of reports and complaints consolidated from multiple retailers, coordinated through the Hull Business Crime Partnership. The investigation involved cross-referencing CCTV footage, electronic point of sale discrepancies, and witness statements from shop assistants and managers. The prosecution case rests significantly on the coherence of these multiple, time-stamped visual records and recovered property allegedly traced back to your possession or immediate control. The Crown’s evidence bundle extends to over 700 pages and includes contemporaneous records and electronic transactions, carefully catalogued and disclosed in full to the defence. In R v. Davenport [2019] EWCA Crim 1324, the Court of Appeal reiterated that the offence of theft, particularly where committed as a sustained pattern involving multiple acts over a period, attracts proportionate sentencing reflecting not merely the individual acts but the cumulative effect upon victims and the community. While Davenport concerned supermarket theft exceeding £2,500 in value, the principles established concerning aggravating features such as planning, persistence, and impact are germane here. Furthermore, the well-known case of R v. Thompson [2021] EWCA Crim 2121—although touching upon a separate category of offences, namely criminal damage—provides useful guidance concerning the role of a late guilty plea in sentencing mitigation. There, the Court opined that credit is primarily designed to reflect early admission and genuine remorse, with delayed pleas, often entered following exhaustive case preparation and overwhelming evidence, attracting markedly reduced reductions. That principle is equally applicable in the context of acquisitive crime. This court is also mindful of the provisions of the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on Theft Offences, published most recently in 2020, which emphasises an assessment of culpability, harm, and any aggravating or mitigating features. The guideline directs focus upon the preparatory activities undertaken by the offender, use of deception, targeting of vulnerable victims or premises, and the degree of planning or sophistication. Although the individual monetary values involved in shoplifting often appear modest, the societal harm caused by persistent offending is not to be underestimated. Over recent years, Hull has seen a notable rise in retail crime reports, partly reflective of larger socio-economic trends within the region. There is ample evidence to suggest that the cumulative burden on small retail operators has intensified, as noted in a 2024 report by the Humber Retail Security Forum. Staffing shortages, heightened threats of antisocial behaviour, and the persistent underfunding of community policing initiatives combine to create increasingly fraught trading conditions. The fallout frequently extends beyond mere financial loss, encompassing diminished employee morale and concerns over personal safety among shop staff. The case law also dictates that sentencing in theft cases must balance deterrence with rehabilitation, recognising the pressures that financial hardship and social marginalisation might bring. Nevertheless, personal circumstance cannot excuse repeated breach of the criminal law, especially when previous interventions have been unsuccessful. Prior to sentencing, expert assessments were commissioned. Notably, Dr Nana Onyeka, consultant forensic psychologist, undertook a comprehensive evaluation in August 2025. Her report, spanning 26 pages and detailed by interview and psychometric testing, indicates a borderline intellectual functioning profile, with underlying difficulties in impulse control and occasional periods of mood lability, but notably no diagnosis of a severe mental illness or major cognitive impairment. Dr Onyeka emphasises the importance of structured engagement with community support in addressing the identified impulsivity and the attendant risk factors. Meanwhile, the Probation Service’s pre-sentence report, authored by Ms Fiona Crossley, reflects on your history of limited sustained employment, housing instability, and prior informal warnings by retail security, yet notes your reluctance to participate in voluntary community programmes. The report flags a moderate risk of reoffending and urges consideration of a rehabilitative regime incorporating cognitive-behavioural components. It is a matter of concern that, despite repeated offers of support from outreach and voluntary agencies—such as Hull Homeless Outreach and the Retail Support Alliance—you have opted predominantly not to engage. Such engagement is integral to effecting behavioural change and reducing recidivism. It is also telling that your own statements often attribute responsibility to external factors rather than recognising agency and choice. The administrative challenges faced by Legal Aid practitioners in securing timely funding for expert assessments, particularly in resource-squeezed areas, have been a recurring feature in this and other similar cases. Applications for funding to instruct independent psychiatrists or psychologists often undergo protracted delay, as was the case here, potentially impeding expeditious resolution and undermining the defendant’s access to justice. While no direct culpability attaches to any party, the systemic inefficiencies serve only to prolong proceedings and place additional strain on judicial resources. It is necessary now to turn to the facts underlying the conviction. The evidence adduced at trial establishes that you engaged on multiple occasions in deliberate acts of theft from a range of retail outlets. Such conduct was not impulsive or opportunistic, but marked by deliberate planning and repeated execution over several months. Multiple staff statements describe your behaviour as rehearsed and covert, using various concealment techniques and often returning repeatedly to the same premises. The recurrent nature of your actions, targeting items frequently resold on informal markets, reveals an ongoing and intentional pattern of acquisitive offending. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. These considerations are germane to the evaluation of culpability and the appropriate quantum of sentence. In addition to the direct consequences to each individual establishment affected by your offending, there has been a broader economic impact. Independent shops have spoken through victim impact statements to the increased costs and disruption caused by such sustained loss, resulting in reduced opening hours and the scaling back of staff numbers to mitigate vulnerability. Such knock-on effects extend beyond immediate financial loss to degrade community confidence and disrupt social cohesion. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. The court acknowledges that you are currently aged 34 and present with a limited custodial record, though including prior warnings and conditional discharges for related acquisitive conduct. Your reported history of homelessness and economic hardship is noted, as is your engagement in sporadic employment, often precarious and of short duration. There is no evidence of gang affiliation or organised criminality, which might otherwise attract enhanced sanction. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. The victim impact statements from affected store employees reflect a palpable stress and diminution of workplace confidence as a result of your offending. Several refer to an atmosphere of apprehension, as repeat low-level theft not only diminishes stock but interrupts day-to-day operation and places staff under additional monitoring requirements. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. It must also be underscored that your behaviour has persisted despite a series of community resolutions and warnings from law enforcement and local retail security teams aimed at diverting you from further offending. Such interventions did not succeed in altering your course. Instead, reports indicate a return to similar conduct within a matter of weeks or months. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. These circumstances elevate the seriousness of the offence and weigh heavily upon the sentencing decision. Whilst the courtroom today reflects on established sentencing principles—punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection—it must also grapple with larger systemic pressures. Public services, including probation and social care, face sustained underfunding, rising caseloads, and dilapidated infrastructure. The NHS mental health services in particular struggle under mounting referral lists and extended waiting times, challenging the delivery of timely and effective intervention for vulnerable individuals. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. The court is mindful that in R v. Wilcox [2022] EWCA Crim 1543 the Court of Appeal highlighted the importance of balancing custodial necessity with non-custodial options where appropriate, especially when underlying vulnerabilities appear in the offender’s psychosocial profile. The present case demands similarly careful weighing of factors. It is unfortunate this court has become accustomed, with dismay, to repeated references to the poor state of Legal Aid funding and the corresponding impact upon quality of representation and expert outreach. Such systemic shortcomings risk undermining the administration of justice, yet remain beyond judicial authority to remedy. A case pending since early 2025 might well have concluded months earlier absent such complications. I also record the participation and contributions of those working in Hull’s voluntary and community sector—including the Hull Retailers’ Support Hub and the East Yorkshire Community Trust—whose dedication continues unabated despite severe financial constraints. Their carefully considered reports and the eloquence of their written submissions testify to a commitment seldom fully acknowledged in public discourse. The court notes with regret that the custody suite at Hull Police Station continues to see overcrowding and staffing pressures, which have implications for detainee welfare and timely processing. Public interest in retail crime remains mixed. As this court has observed, such offences rarely attract media attention unless linked to violence or spectacular scenes. Yet, they constitute a substantial proportion of the criminal docket and a significant drain on policing and judicial resources. The evidence before the court also demonstrates, contrary to any suggestion of inadvertence, that your acts involved deception, repeated subterfuge, and deliberate attempts to defeat store security measures, including removal or concealment of packaging and labels. On a number of occasions, accomplices were allegedly used to create distraction, though no conclusive evidence associates you with any co-offenders. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. These observations help delineate your role and culpability within the overarching course of conduct. Appreciation is extended to Ms Samantha Fairchild, who appears for the Crown, for her able and thorough presentation of the case. Likewise, I thank Mr Benjamin Havers, appointed under a representation order, for his professional advocacy on behalf of you, the defendant. It is important, also, to acknowledge the work and professionalism of the court clerks, ushers, and security personnel in ensuring the proceedings have been conducted orderly and without disruption, despite ongoing refurbishment works in this courtroom. The hearing has been conducted in open court. It is a matter of proper public record that low-level offending such as that before this court is no less serious in its cumulative impact simply because it involves sum values which might be individually trivial. There are victims whose voices must be heard and whose experiences must be respected. The wholesale dismissal of shoplifting as victimless crime ignores the realities of victim suffering, financial strain, and community degradation. The court has also given consideration to the wider societal context in which such offences occur. The spectre of entrenched poverty, housing insecurity, and social marginalisation cannot be ignored, though neither can they be permitted to serve as blanket exculpations. This court remains conscious of the delicate balancing act within sentencing: recognising human frailty and systemic failure, while maintaining the imperative of law and order. I emphasise that the statutory framework directs that the sentence imposed must be just in all circumstances, reflecting the nature and seriousness of the offence, the character and antecedents of the offender, and the purposes of sentencing enshrined in statute and developed in jurisprudence. The preferable approach, with a case of this nature, remains the preparation of an up-to-date, comprehensive pre-sentence report, which may incorporate further psychiatric and social assessments as necessary and explore avenues for intervention within both custodial and community contexts. Sentence will be deferred pending receipt of such a report, allowing the probation service the opportunity fully to assess risk, need, and proposal for rehabilitation, consistent with public protection. This court accordingly reserves final sentencing for a date to be fixed following delivery of the pre-sentence report. The defendant will be entitled to make further representations at that time. This document constitutes the sentencing remarks of Her Honour Judge L. J. Pennington, delivered on 14 October 2025 within Court 4 of the Crown Court at Hull. The proceedings have been digitally recorded in compliance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant and counsel are advised of the right to appeal this decision pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, with the prescribed 28-day time limit. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are in effect. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT PETERBOROUGH R v. MR H Case No. T2025/14637 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. R. COCHRANE Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of theft, specifically shoplifting from commercial premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour under consideration, as set out in the indictment, relates to repeated acts spanning a period from mid-2023 through to early 2025 within the Greater Peterborough area and nearby retail districts. Procedural Background Your arrest was effected on 28 February 2025 by officers of the Peterborough Local Policing Unit after an investigation initiated by the city’s Retail Theft Taskforce. This unit was formed in response to an observable increase in shoplifting incidents in the wake of post-pandemic retail recovery efforts. The case was classified as appropriate for Crown Court jurisdiction due to the sustained pattern and the cumulative value of goods involved exceeding the threshold for magistrates’ court competence, compounded by the history of repeat offending on your part. It must be acknowledged that the establishment of the Retail Theft Taskforce stemmed from a strategic initiative to improve inter-agency responses to commercial theft, which has long been recognised as a drain on local economies and a source of distress for business owners and staff. The Taskforce utilises an amalgamation of intelligence sharing, covert surveillance, and multi-agency coordination, including the cooperation of private security operatives contracted by retail chains. In this context, intelligence-led policing measures were employed extensively, with the eventual arrest coming only after several weeks of concerted monitoring. The case experienced initial listing challenges due to the unusually high court workload during the summer of 2025, magnified further by the ongoing staff shortages within criminal justice administration nationally. A previous hearing scheduled for 10 August 2025 was adjourned on account of defence counsel awaiting funding authorisation for the instruction of a forensic psychologist — a delay lamented by all parties but illustrative of the systemic pressures within the Legal Aid framework. The funding request itself was subject to protracted correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency, involving multiple resubmissions and clarifications over a period of six weeks. I must place on record the court’s continuing dissatisfaction with such procedural inefficiencies, which serve only to retard the timely administration of justice. The present sentencing hearing has proceeded with both prosecution and defence representatives present and fully prepared. I record my thanks to Ms Catherine Burns, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, and to Mr Michael Travers, instructed under a Legal Aid order, representing you. I also acknowledge the presence of the court clerk, ushers, and court security staff, who continue to maintain courtroom order amidst these demanding caseloads. It is appropriate here to revisit the historical trajectory of the Theft Act 1968, under which you are charged. The statute has been foundational in English criminal law regarding dishonesty offences for over five decades. Amended on occasion to reflect societal developments, including the Theft Act 1978 and subsequent legislation addressing related property crimes, it nevertheless remains the primary reference. The relevant sentencing guidelines were last substantively revised by the Sentencing Council in 2021, emphasizing the importance of offence context, culpability, and harm. The court is also mindful of the Better Case Management (BCM) framework introduced in 2013, which aims to streamline trial preparation and disposal phases. This matter was managed under BCM protocols, with initial hearings prompting the early disclosure of evidence, including CCTV footage, witness statements, and forensic reports, thereby ensuring procedural transparency and efficiency commensurate with expectations under the Criminal Procedure Rules. It is worth noting that the case progressed without any significant procedural defaults or failures—a rare procedural achievement worthy of acknowledgment in an era of chronic judicial delay. The Crown has presented a thorough evidential matrix, including commercial CCTV records, witness eyewitness accounts from store staff, and corroborative forensics relating to items recovered in your possession at the moment of arrest. There was an initial not guilty plea at your first appearance on 5 March 2025, but this was amended to a guilty plea at a hearing held on 14 September 2025, following the receipt of further detailed evidence. While that admission alleviates some of the burden on witnesses and court resources, the timing of your plea falls within the category often described in case law as a “late” guilty plea. This carries implications for any mitigation in sentencing credit, as emphasised in R v. Khan [2022] EWCA Crim 1156 wherein the Court of Appeal restated that the timing of a plea reflects the offender’s acceptance of responsibility and influences the degree of reduction. Turning momentarily to ancillary case law, in R v. Milton [2019] EWCA Crim 1873, dealing with offences involving theft from charitable institutions, the court noted that while the monetary value was modest, the reputational damage and disruption to charitable operations warranted enhanced custodial considerations. Of course, that judgment is factually distinct, but the principle of aggravated harm through victim vulnerability is broadly instructive. Similarly, R v. Owusu [2020] EWCA Crim 902 involved a repeat offender found guilty of aggravated commercial burglary, a more serious offence bearing little direct relation to the present facts but noteworthy for its statement on public protection concerns arising from repetitive acquisitive offending. Further, R v. Carlyle [2018] EWCA Crim 562 concerned possession of a bladed article in a school car park—a matter unrelated to your case save for highlighting the courts’ firm stance on offences potentially endangering vulnerable groups, underscoring the contextual weight courts afford such factors in sentencing assessments. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. Post-arrest, the police established through intelligence-led surveillance and forensic examination a pattern to your activities. The consistency of your methodology emerged clearly: timed visits to midweek shopping days, selective targeting of unstaffed aisles, and the use of concealment tactics. Multiple staff statements attest to a growing atmosphere of trepidation among employees at the targeted outlets. The cumulative financial impact, while individually minor per incident, amassed to a figure significantly exceeding the £1,500 mark, invoking greater prosecutorial attention. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. Of note, the evidentiary package submitted included a victim personal statement from the manager of a local pharmacy, expressing the demoralising effect your conduct had on staff wellbeing and morale, challenges to managerial scheduling, and the economic burden borne by the business after repeated shrinkage. Such statements serve as important reminders that victim impact in shoplifting cases extends beyond the monetary. Regarding your background, you are aged 34. You carry previous convictions for theft-related matters, notably a caution in 2021 for shoplifting and a conviction for handling stolen goods in 2018. Your personal history reveals periods of unstable housing, unemployment, and intermittent engagement with substance use services, though there is no diagnosis of serious mental illness. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. Within the psychiatric and psychological assessments obtained pursuant to the court’s direction, Dr Olivia Miller — a consultant forensic psychologist instructed at the defence’s request — reports your presentation as consistent with borderline personality traits, impulsivity, and maladaptive coping mechanisms. While not suggesting psychosis or major mental disorder, Dr Miller highlights longstanding difficulties with emotional regulation and low tolerance for distress, factors which may bear upon motivations but do not mitigate culpability. The report recommends structured interventions focusing on cognitive-behavioural approaches, impulse control, and engagement with local addiction services. The Department of Probation has prepared a comprehensive pre-sentence report, authored by Probation Officer Sophie Lin, which was made available to all parties ahead of this hearing. The report points to medium risk of reoffending with a focus on acquisitive offending patterns. It also laments your inconsistent participation with voluntary support offers and noted difficulty maintaining stable accommodation, a recognised criminogenic factor. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. The report references your family circumstances briefly; you have a sister residing in Birmingham with whom contact is intermittent. Letters submitted on your behalf from your sister and a social support worker at the Peterborough Homeless Outreach Service convey sympathy and hope for your rehabilitation but are cautious about unrealistic expectations. Notably, the letter from the outreach service worker speaks to the strain on local housing support schemes, which are operating at near maximum capacity. The chronic shortage of affordable and supported housing in the region is well-documented, with waiting lists extending for years for suitable placements, further exacerbated by a rise in street homelessness. Such context is relevant to overall assessment but not a fresh excuse for persistent criminality. The court recognises environmental pressures but equally holds steadfast to the principle that personal responsibility remains paramount. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. Switching briefly to procedural observations, I comment on recent innovations trialled within the Crown Courts of the East of England, particularly the measured adoption of technological solutions to expedite case management. Electronic disclosure systems, enhanced digital evidence presentation, and remote witness facilitation have yielded some efficiencies, albeit tempered by perennial challenges of uneven internet connectivity in rural circuits. I also note the recent refurbishment of Court 1 at Peterborough Crown Court, which included improved audio-visual aids and an ergonomically designed judge’s bench. While marginal to sentencing considerations, such improvements contribute positively to the judicial process and participant experience. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. Turning to the wider social implications, one cannot ignore the broader societal backdrop to this offending pattern. Nationally, the past decade has witnessed considerable shifts in retail security technology, consumer behaviour, and community policing priorities. The rise of self-service checkouts, contactless payments, and increased video surveillance have altered the landscape, but criminal methods adapt swiftly—thus the importance of continued vigilance. Moreover, the court shares awareness of the pressures faced by shop workers, many reliant on minimum wage jobs, vulnerable to physical and emotional strain, and increasingly disillusioned by repeated encounters with theft. The cumulative cost of such offences imposes upward pressure on pricing, insurance premiums, and ultimately consumer access. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. The Crown has presented evidence that you previously participated in a local diversionary programme targeting first-time or low-risk offenders, focused on restorative justice and community service. Unfortunately, the programme concluded with your cessation of compliant engagement and immediate resumption of offending upon conclusion. This fact adversely colours any mitigation based on reduction of culpability or prospects for rehabilitation and is a pertinent aggravating factor. The court must balance community safety with the necessity for a sentence sufficiently robust to denote the serious nature of persistent acquisitive offending. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. In considering sentence, I am mindful of the sentencing guideline stipulations. Factors aggravating your culpability include persistence, prior offending, disregard for warnings, and the impact — both economic and psychological — on retail staff. Mitigating factors are limited, primarily your eventual guilty plea and some evidence of personal difficulties, though none sufficient to diminish criminal responsibility. Recent jurisprudence informs that custodial sentences are appropriate where offending demonstrates significant planning, repeated breach of trust, or where community-based interventions have been exhausted or declined. However, this court remains conscious of the overrepresentation of similar offenders in custodial institutions and the need, where possible, to deploy proportional alternatives balancing rehabilitation and public protection. It is essential to reiterate that sentencing powers are exercised not merely to punish but to prevent reoffending and promote reintegration within society. The court welcomes the probation service’s willingness to recommend structured programmes targeting offending behaviour, and will consider such in full at the formal sentencing hearing. Finally, I must address the issue of credit for the late plea. As earlier noted, the timing of the guilty plea bears on any discount applied to sentence length, reflecting judicial recognition of early acceptance of wrongdoing and substantial savings in court time and emotional cost to victims. In assessing your plea timing, I note it was entered some months into the process, only after the prosecution presented an unassailable case. The sentencing discount will thus be appropriately limited. I shall adjourn the matter to permit receipt of the updated pre-sentence report, incorporating any new information from probation and clinical professionals, and will impose sentence accordingly on the date set. The sentencing remarks issued today, 17 October 2025, are delivered in open court, Court 1 at Peterborough Crown Court. A full transcript has been prepared in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules and will be entered on the court record. The defendant is advised of the statutory right to appeal within 28 calendar days following sentencing, pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under section 4(2) of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. Legal costs remain to be addressed at the conclusion of proceedings. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BLACKWELL R v. MR H Case No. T2026/04329 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. J. FAIRBRIDGE Filed: 14 September 2026 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction for a series of offences involving theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct in question was committed over a protracted period spanning from late 2023 into early 2026, affecting a variety of stores situated primarily within the Blackwell and Greater Ashford retail districts. Procedural and Investigative History Your arrest on 11 March 2026 was the culmination of an extensive and resource-intense investigative process orchestrated by the Blackwell Metropolitan Police Retail Crime Unit in tandem with the South Ashford Urban Taskforce. This cooperation incorporated intelligence-sharing with the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), designed precisely to curb repeat acquisitive offending. The investigative operation, which included covert surveillance, the analysis of store security networks, and a painstaking review of commercial loss reports, followed several months of reports detailing persistent theft at multiple premises—primarily convenience stores and pharmacies in the vicinity of transport interchanges and suburban shopping centres. There is often, regrettably, a disconnect between the actual resource expenditure devoted to such cases and the perceived gravity of the offences. What may appear to an outsider as a series of trivial infractions can mask a coordinated pattern that exerts a profound cumulative impact on local businesses and their employees, as well as draining public resources through protracted investigatory efforts. Resource allocation for investigations of this nature must be acknowledged to include not only police officers but also civilian crime analysts, digital forensic specialists, and case officers, engaged over months in securing evidentiary clarification and corroboration. These endeavours naturally carry a significant fiscal cost, diverting attention from other policing priorities which often include violent crime, organised substance supply, and community safeguarding duties. The case advanced through the stages of the criminal justice system meeting the stipulated timeframes outlined in the Criminal Procedure Rules, although not without some delay. A plea and trial preparation hearing was initially listed for 18 May 2026 but was deferred due to the necessity of obtaining a psychiatric report and the securing of Legal Aid funding for an independent assessment. The procedural complexity of cases involving multi-agency collaboration, as well as the involvement of voluntary-sector organisations providing support to both victims and perpetrators, cannot be overstated. While this court is aware of and sympathetic toward those logistical pressures, it is nonetheless imperative that all parties comply with the statutory frameworks governing the administration of justice. It has become an unfortunate, yet increasingly routine, feature in cases of acquisitive offending that guilty pleas are not entered at the earliest opportunity. This court acknowledges the principle that credit should be afforded where pleas are tendered promptly, thereby sparing victims and witnesses from the stress attendant upon contested proceedings. However, where pleas are entered at a late juncture—often mere days before trial—the extent of credit granted is judiciously reduced to reflect the additional burden borne by the court and prosecution, consistent with guidance established in R v. Booth [2024] EWCA Crim 159 and R v. Bernal [2025] EWCA Crim 18. The Crown's case was fortified by a comprehensive evidential package, including digital footage, witness testimony, and forensic analysis, which it is conceded made prolonged denial untenable. It should be noted with respect the thorough and conscientious submissions made on your behalf by counsel, Mr Oliver Stretton, and also the diligent representation by Miss Amelia Fairlake on behalf of the Crown. Their efforts ensured the orderly progression of this matter, and their professionalism is commendable. Equally, I acknowledge the efforts of the Blackwell Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose collective action yielded detailed victim impact statements that articulate the psychological and economic consequences of your offending on local shopkeepers and employees. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. The nature of your offending, whilst not involving physical violence, is nonetheless of considerable seriousness given its repetitive character and the distress caused to staff. Shops affected reported significant financial losses as well as a decline in employee morale, leading to staffing adjustments such as altered shift patterns and the installation of security reinforcements. This dynamic is far from inconsequential; indeed, it undermines the very fabric of community retail operations and poses a broader threat to public confidence in commercial safety. This court is attuned to the widespread perception that shoplifting constitutes a “low-level” crime often overlooked in the hierarchy of enforcement priorities. But such an appraisal is fallacious. The cumulative effect of repeated incursions upon retailers—particularly small businesses operating on narrow profit margins—can precipitate closures, job losses, and, in turn, contribute to the economic blight of neighbourhoods. In the absence of robust and proportionate judicial responses, the message sent is one of permissiveness, which in turn may precipitate a further descent into disorder and lawlessness. In R v. Bevan [2019] EWCA Crim 2743, the Court of Appeal made plain that offences of acquisitive dishonesty, while often non-violent, are not devoid of impact; the emotional toll on victims, coupled with financial harm, justifies stern judicial reaction. In that case, a defendant who perpetrated a sustained campaign of retail theft over eighteen months, causing significant distress among elderly shop staff, was sentenced to twelve months’ imprisonment. The sentiment expressed therein remains apposite. The relevance of sustained acquisitive criminality to the preservation of public order is also underscored in R v. Coulson [2022] EWCA Crim 333, where the court clarified the distinct sentencing considerations involved when conduct is repetitive, deliberate, and indicative of a disregard for community norms. The persistent flouting of laws designed to safeguard property rights is reflective of a disquieting erosion of civic standards, an observation echoed frequently in sentencing literature. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. Your case management hearings unfolded against a background of significant administrative pressures, including intermittent strike action within local court administration and well-documented shortages in Legal Aid funding allocation. The delays occasioned thereby extend beyond the inconvenience of the affected parties and impede the expeditious dispensation of justice—a matter to which this court returns with some reluctance. The Legal Aid Agency, while under fiscal constraints, must not be allowed to create impediments to specialist expert engagement, particularly in cases where psychological assessment informs both sentence and rehabilitation potential. The request here for a forensic psychologist with expertise in acquisitive offending was met with protracted bureaucratic negotiation, which compounded procedural delay. On four separate visits within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same small shop and stole alcohol and tobacco products. The broader systemic context cannot be ignored. Local law enforcement agencies grapple with near-constant demands on capacity by an increasing caseload of “low-harm” offences which nonetheless generate significant community dissatisfaction and resource commitments. The strain on specialist units tasked with retail crime prevention and investigation is considerable. Concurrently, voluntary-sector organisations that aid in victim support and offender rehabilitation operate under chronic funding deficits and staffing shortages. The South Ashford Charity Alliance recently issued a report highlighting the alarming rise in retail-related antisocial behaviour and the attendant psychological impact on shop workers, many of whom report anxiety and burnout. Of course, the interplay between public services and judicial proceedings is complex. NHS mental health provision, for example, remains challenged by long waiting lists and overstretched community psychiatric teams. This court notes the submission of Dr Anne-Marie Cole, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose detailed report—although not ultimately pivotal—highlighted your tendencies toward impulsivity and low mood, while also drawing attention to the absence of any diagnosable psychotic or personality disorder. The report rightly stresses the importance of multi-agency cooperation in supporting rehabilitation and reducing recidivism. Turning to the difficulties encountered in securing appropriate accommodation, it is no secret that the widening gap in housing availability, exacerbated by economic pressures and the erosion of affordable units, has intensified the challenges faced by vulnerable populations. Organisations such as the ShelterTrust and the Blackwell Emergency Housing Support have endeavoured to mitigate these pressures, yet the scale of the problem remains vast. Your stated unstable living arrangements are, while unfortunate, not unique in this context. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. In considering the social fabric in which this offending occurred, one cannot overlook the well-documented ascent of street homelessness and rough sleeping in urban centres, with attendant concerns regarding drug dependency and exploitation. These challenges feed into a broader pattern of social exclusion that forms part of the mosaic in which many acquisitive crimes arise. Nonetheless, the judiciary must balance understanding with accountability; hardship is no less real for its ubiquity, yet neither does it constitute licence to disregard the law. The trial itself proceeded with the normal rigour of this court. Witnesses gave evidence with professionalism and considerable composure, reflecting the importance they attached to the case. The victim impact statements submitted by the managers of Croft’s Convenience Store and Wellside Pharmacy particularly conveyed the intangible but pervasive harm inflicted not only on business viability but on the everyday psychological welfare of staff who faced repeated intrusion, suspicion, and the threat of confrontation. You were represented by Mr Oliver Stretton throughout. His submissions, carefully considered and respectful of the court, emphasised your personal circumstances including your expressed remorse and attempts at engagement with outreach services. It is noted that you have participated intermittently in financial literacy workshops run by local charities and have attended support groups aimed at reducing impulsive behaviour, albeit inconsistently. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. While there is merit in recognising personal circumstance, the court must weigh these against the nature and pattern of offending, the impact on victims, and the broader imperatives of deterrence and public protection. In R v. Phillips [2023] EWCA Crim 1585, the Court upheld a significant custodial sentence for repeated shoplifting where the defendant had declined structured rehabilitation despite offers, emphasising that repeated acquisitive offending presents a significant risk of further harm if left inadequately addressed. Attention must be paid, too, to the ongoing concerns surrounding the administration and capacity of the probation services. Staffing shortages have increased caseloads and often limit the delivery of bespoke interventions, such as programme work aimed at reducing reoffending linked to acquisitive crime. The local probation office informed this court via correspondence dated 29 August 2026 that while efforts are made to engage offenders in Thinking Skills Programmes and similar rehabilitative initiatives, these are frequently hampered by resource limitations and the transience of the offender population. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. Further complicating the picture is the expanding scope of multi-agency risk assessment and management. While procedures such as MARAC (Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference) and MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements) primarily focus on high-risk offenders, there is increasing recognition of the necessity for coordinated approaches in cases of persistent acquisitive offending, particularly when co-occurring vulnerabilities such as mental health issues or substance use are identified. However, implementation of such frameworks varies significantly by locality, affected in equal measure by funding constraints and inter-agency communication challenges. Council housing allocations in your area have been affected by recent legislative reforms impacting tenant eligibility criteria, often delaying access to stable accommodation for those with custodial sentences or on probation. That said, the court is duty-bound to observe that residence instability itself is a well-known risk factor for repeat offending. Courts must be alert to this interplay and ensure that sentencing in individual cases does not inadvertently exacerbate instability or marginalisation without concurrent support. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. In assessing your criminal history, it is apparent that you have prior convictions for shoplifting, dating back some six years, with the most recent occurring in 2023. These convictions include community orders with requirements to attend rehabilitation activities and abstain from certain locations. Despite these measures, you returned to similar offending within months, undermining their rehabilitative effect. This pattern raises serious questions about the adequacy of previous interventions and your prospects of compliance absent more structured engagement or, indeed, custodial oversight. The principle of totality must be borne in mind: sentences should be just and proportionate overall, taking account of all offending behaviour involved. Although the instant offences concern low individual values, the persistent course of conduct aggravates culpability. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, claimed it wasn’t a serious crime and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. I take note of several letters submitted in support by third parties, including one from your sister, Ms Janelle Harding, who describes a background of familial instability and some periods of homelessness in early adulthood. While such correspondence is relevant to understanding personal context and capacity for reform, it does not mitigate the seriousness of the offending. It is appropriate also to observe that there are ongoing proceedings concerning your estranged partner, unrelated to this matter but indicative of family turmoil which, while not legally connected, may bear upon your broader social circumstances. Likewise, the fact that a co-defendant in a separate theft case has absconded and remains at large, known to police, does not influence your individual culpability. The court is conscious that the psychological and social difficulties that many defendants face are real and profound. Yet it cannot abdicate its fundamental responsibility to uphold the rule of law and safeguard the public from repeated criminal conduct. The sentencing framework applicable to theft offences, as outlined in the guideline issued by the Sentencing Council in 2020, directs that particular attention be paid to frequency, planning, and impact on victims. These factors are all plainly engaged. In light of these considerations, the court anticipates the preparation of a pre-sentence report, which should comprehensively assess your circumstances, explore the scope for community-based interventions, and evaluate rehabilitation potential consistent with public protection. The report should consider the feasibility of imposing a structured community order incorporating accredited programmes such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy focusing on acquisitive crime, financial management support, and victim awareness. Should such an approach prove unsuitable or unavailable, the court may have to contemplate custodial options. These sentencing remarks are given this day, 14 September 2026, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Blackwell. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are reminded of your right to appeal against the sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are applied. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. B2025/04932 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F. Kensington Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing following your conviction for shoplifting offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, in a case that has occupied a significant procedural footprint stretching over the course of the past 18 months. The offending conduct attributed to you spans various retail premises across Bristol and its immediate environs between March 2023 and June 2025. Procedural History and Case Management Your initial appearance was before the Magistrates’ Court on 15 June 2025, where bail conditions were imposed, including a curfew and daily reporting requirements. The matter was committed here for trial due to the seriousness attached to the pattern of offending and the volume of evidence requiring trial-level management. The case was listed under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, a procedural initiative designed to expedite the handling of indictable offences by ensuring early identification and resolution of issues relating to disclosure, witness availability, and expert evidence. The case proceeded through a series of hearings and arraignments, with due regard paid to the obligations imposed by the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR), consistent with the overriding objective of enabling the court to deal with cases justly and efficiently. I note that the prosecution, led by Ms Susan Warren QC, and your defence team, fronted by Mr Oliver Freeman, Solicitor Advocate, engaged professionally throughout a process punctuated by adjournments which, while unfortunate, reflected the complexities pertinent to this case. Early attempts were made to instruct a forensic psychologist to assist with mitigation and risk assessment; however, as is regrettably frequent, the authorisation from the Legal Aid Agency was delayed, resulting in some procedural difficulty which inevitably lengthened the preparatory period. This court has, on numerous occasions, raised concerns about systemic impediments within the administration of Legal Aid funding, which act as impediments to efficient case progression and add to burdens already borne by court staff and practitioners alike. The investigation was instigated following a report from the Bristol Retail Crime Reduction Partnership (BRCRP), a multi-agency body comprising local police, council trading standards, and independent retail security personnel. This team acts to collate intelligence, facilitate communication across stakeholder groups, and support a coherent enforcement approach to repeat thefts within the city centre and suburban retail districts. Whilst the Partnership operates with considerable dedication, the court is conscious of the pressures facing its membership, with shrinking budgets and increasing caseloads exacerbating the challenge of swift information sharing. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. This court is reminded that the acts of shoplifting, as defined by the Theft Act 1968, involve the dishonest appropriation of goods belonging to another, with the intention to permanently deprive. While single overt acts may attract minimal public notice, a sustained series of such offences, especially where they disturb community confidence and business viability, are considered in aggregate. You were apprehended on 12 June 2025 after a confidential tip-off to the Avon and Somerset Police Retail Unit, following weeks of surveillance and intelligence collation involving Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage, electronic point-of-sale data anomalies, and on-the-ground witness statements. This investigation, as confirmed by Detective Inspector Helen Marsh, required considerable deployment of resources, including teams specialising in digital forensics who analysed mobile device data pursuant to warrants authorised by the District Judge. The operation extended over multiple weeks, involving coordination across borough boundaries and necessitating intermittent redeployment of uniformed and plainclothes officers. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. The scale of investigatory work undertaken — while arguably disproportionate to the monetary values directly involved — is justified by the need to uphold lawful commercial activity and community order. It is also influenced by the cumulative toll on retail employees who face disruption, anxiety, and the demoralising effect of recurrent thefts. The BRCRP's recent report outlined a trend of increasing acquisitive crime post-pandemic, with particular concern expressed over the impact on small, family-run establishments. Turning to the sentencing framework, this court acknowledges the guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council for theft offences, which emphasise the gravity of repeated offending and the vulnerability of victims, including employees subjected to harassment or intimidation. The leading guideline insists that sentences must be proportionate, taking into account aggravating and mitigating factors, the offender’s culpability, and the broader public interest. The Court takes careful note of the precedent established in R v. Ellison [2019] EWCA Crim 2402, where the Court of Appeal held that sustained shoplifting—planned and systematic—merits a custodial response despite low individual item values. Ellison concerned the theft of over £3,000 in goods from multiple branches of a department store over several months, involving sophisticated concealment tactics. The appeal court there highlighted the importance of deterrence, noting the cumulative economic and psychological damage inflicted. Furthermore, the decision in R v. Fenwick [2020] EWCA Crim 1175 is germane, insofar as it considered the partial mitigation offered by underlying mental health issues, but nonetheless upheld a sentence reflecting the inherent seriousness of persistent acquisitive offending. In that case, the defendant’s diagnosis of bipolar disorder was found to be a relevant, but not determinative, factor in sentencing. This court will carefully balance similar considerations here. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. While the rulings referenced address distinct factual matrices, their legal principles regarding credit for guilty pleas, offender culpability, and the appropriate threshold for custodial sentencing provide a helpful framework. The impact of your offences, though lacking violent component, has been acutely felt by those caught up in the offending. Victim personal statements were submitted by a range of retail staff, many of whom reported feelings of anxiety and apprehension during work hours. The management of several stores confirmed that staff rotas were altered to mitigate lone working, and some reported reductions in opening hours due to concerns about shoplifting and associated antisocial behaviour. The court is also conscious of the role of local charities such as ShopSafe Bristol, which offers support to retail workers experiencing the emotional toll of repeat thefts and shop-based aggression. Their written representations commend staff for their resilience but warn that without effective intervention the cumulative stress risks burnout and attrition within the sector. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. Notably, the witness statements also reveal the adaptation of loss prevention strategies, including increased use of electronic tags, heightened surveillance, and staff retraining—all costly measures borne ultimately by businesses and consumers alike. Your defence has advanced several mitigating factors, notably personal struggles with intermittent homelessness and unstable accommodation. Moreover, a psychiatric assessment conducted by Dr Eleanor Matthews, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, provides a detailed overview of your mental state, indicating features of borderline personality disorder, exacerbated by longstanding substance misuse. Dr Matthews concludes that while no psychotic or major affective disorder is present, the complexity of your cases suggests a need for carefully structured community support. It must be stressed here that psychiatric opinion was formally instructed to explore both mitigation and risk. Dr Matthews’ report, dated 30 September 2025, is thorough and professionally composed, presenting a nuanced view of your vulnerabilities alongside the recognition of persistent antisocial behaviour patterns. However, the conclusion within that report is guarded, noting that rehabilitation potential is contingent on your engagement with services which, thus far, has been erratic. The court takes this opportunity to commend the efforts of your defence team in the face of pronounced difficulties encountered with the Legal Aid Agency. Initial applications for funding to instruct the psychiatric expert were lodged in early August but only granted after protracted correspondence extending over six weeks. Such bureaucratic inertia, while lamentably routine, imposes unfair burdens on defendants and counsel alike and risks prejudice to the preparation of effective mitigation. These frustrations have been recorded in other courts and will, it is hoped, be addressed by forthcoming reforms. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. It is impossible to divorce an understanding of this case from wider societal trends. Recent years have seen a marked increase in street homelessness within urban centres in the South West. Local authorities and voluntary organisations face significant challenges responding to needs that have outpaced resourcing. The normalisation of begging and street presence carries implications not only for those living in precarious conditions but also for community perceptions of public safety. This court is aware of reports by the Bristol Homelessness Action Forum underscoring the expanding nexus between destitution and acquisitive crime as survival mechanisms. While such contexts do not excuse criminal conduct, they offer an essential lens recalling that enforcement is but one strand in a multi-agency response. Alongside these grim realities is the enduring challenge of delivering mental health services to vulnerable adults. NHS waitlists for community psychiatric care and addiction treatment remain long, with significant variation in access depending on locality. Cases like Mr H’s underscore the necessity of integrated statutory and voluntary support systems, though as noted, the choice to engage remains with the individual. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. The court also acknowledges with respect the work of the Avon and Somerset Police Retail Crime Unit, whose members have contended with rising workloads and a broadening remit encompassing not only theft but complex data analysis, digital evidence retrieval, and victim liaison—all while navigating budgetary constraints. Interestingly, the emergence of so-called “hotspot policing” has yielded mixed results, with some shifts in offending locations rather than reductions in overall theft rates. This has prompted academic critiques regarding the sustainability of current enforcement models. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. In parallel, the Probation Service remains afflicted by staff shortages and increasing caseloads complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic’s ongoing effects. A limited number of available appointments for accredited cognitive skills programmes constrains the options for structured rehabilitation. Council Authorities, alongside voluntary housing agencies, continue grappling with mounting demands, and the increasing frequency of temporary accommodation placements creates a fragile base from which individuals like yourself must attempt reintegration. Sentencing for offences such as yours must navigate the tension between deterrence, reparation, rehabilitation, and public protection. The Sentencing Council’s theft guideline outlines culpability categories and harm ranges, noting that persistence and premeditation increase the severity. The court must also consider whether ancillary orders—such as a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement or a curfew—might complement formal sentencing, though suitability depends on risk assessment. Addressing the timing of your guilty plea, which came on the second day of trial proceedings, the court is bound to note that while such pleas reduce exposure to trial-related distress, they cannot command the maximum credit available for early admissions. The principle is established that guilty pleas entered at an advanced stage principally function to conserve judicial resources but do not necessarily evince genuine remorse. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. Mr H, this case is emblematic of the complex challenges at the intersection of criminal conduct, social vulnerability, and systemic resource limitations. Your conduct, though lacking in violence or threat, has nonetheless had persistent and tangible consequences for individuals and communities. While the court recognises mitigating circumstances and the psychiatric evidence indicating your difficulties, it must also send a clear message about the unacceptability of repeated dishonesty. The preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report is essential to ensure that the holistic circumstances are analysed in detail and that the sentencing response appropriately addresses rehabilitation needs and public safety. It is hoped that such a report will explore feasible intervention pathways linking probation, mental health services, and social support networks. Members of the public and victims alike deserve to have confidence that the court’s response is proportionate, effective, and principled. This sentencing hearing has been conducted in open court, with all parties duly present. I record my thanks to Ms Warren QC for her considered submissions, to Mr Freeman for his diligent and nuanced advocacy, and to the probation officers and psychiatrists who have contributed expert insights. I further commend the court staff and ushers, who have ensured the smooth running of proceedings despite a recent refurbishment rendering court 5 uncomfortably cramped. These sentencing remarks are issued this 17th day of October 2025, in Court 5 at the Bristol Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal order of conviction and sentence will be processed through appropriate channels. You are advised of your right to appeal within twenty-eight days in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM R v. MR H Case No. B2025/24579 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge S. W. FENWICK Filed: 15 August 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for theft by shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct attributed to you spans a protracted period, covering multiple separate events occurring within Birmingham and the surrounding metropolitan boroughs from the latter months of 2023 through the early part of 2025. Procedural Background Your case initiated with the receipt of intelligence from the Birmingham Retailers Association, coupled with a number of incident reports compiled by the West Midlands Police Business Crime Team. These reports detailed a pattern of repeated thefts from several local retail outlets, many small independent stores and pharmacies serving particularly vulnerable communities. The reports were made over a nine-month interval, conveying a growing sense of escalating loss and distress amongst those affected. The involvement of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership in Birmingham, while formally robust on paper, revealed some familiar practical difficulties. Local officers, despite commendable diligence, confronted issues including inconsistent data-sharing protocols and varying levels of retailer cooperation, many of whom faced commercial pressures dissuading prolonged engagement with law enforcement. I note here, parenthetically, that the effectiveness of the BCM model is dependent on the goodwill and capacity of both statutory and non-statutory actors. In numerous hearings, this court has received evidence that suggests procedural weaknesses in information collation and enforcement responsiveness continue to blight efforts to stem retail theft in large urban areas. These systemic challenges, while tangential to this case’s particulars, form an important backdrop. You were arrested on 18 March 2025 after an intensified investigative period. That investigation included covert surveillance from uniformed officers, the collation of digital CCTV footage, primary witness statements, and mobile device analysis. The deployment of such investigative resources illustrates the rising seriousness with which local authorities approach repeat acquisitive crime, recognising not only the immediate economic losses but also the adverse effect on community wellbeing. The trial dates proceeded after several procedural hearings, including a plea and trial preparation hearing on 1 June 2025, where you maintained a not guilty plea. However, on the morning of trial on 11 August, you entered an unequivocal guilty plea. This pattern of late admission is, regrettably, a recurrent feature in cases of this type, inviting reflection on its impact upon the efficient administration of justice and on those who bear the consequences, not least the numerous retail staff called to prepare for trials which ultimately do not proceed. Legal Aid funding for commissioning an independent psychiatric assessment took several months to authorise, in no small part due to administrative backlogs at the Legal Aid Agency. This reflects a growing concern regarding access to timely expert evaluations in criminal proceedings involving complex social and psychological dimensions. The delays, while understandable in context, pose a significant impediment to the proper resolution of cases within expected timeframes. It is both necessary and appropriate to record the court’s gratitude to Mr David Mapperley, counsel for the Crown, whose forensic presentation throughout these proceedings has been methodical and measured. Likewise, I thank Ms Elaine Thompson, who appears for the defence. Despite the inevitable pressures attendant upon Legal Aid work, her submissions have been conscientious, conforming fully to her professional responsibilities. I observe, again with some disappointment, that staffing levels at the West Midlands National Probation Service have dwindled significantly over the past several years. This reduction has led to increased caseloads per officer and consequently diminished capacity for thorough risk assessment and offender management. That reality hampers the delivery of preventative measures, a fact that must bear upon our collective considerations of sentencing and rehabilitation. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. The relevance of a cogent psychiatric evaluation was duly noted during pre-trial discussions. The report authored by Dr Simon Riley, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, submitted on 8 July 2025, offers an insightful, though ultimately inconclusive, appraisal of your mental state. Dr Riley emphasises the absence of severe psychiatric pathology but identifies certain mild personality traits indicative of impulsivity and diminished frustration tolerance. The report also notes your sporadic engagement with community-based support, highlighting a lack of sustained compliance with therapeutic interventions. I must further mention the recent correspondences received from the East Midlands Charitable Trust for Shoplifting Victims, who have provided victim impact statements representing several affected stores. Their narratives speak of ongoing financial strain and psychological stress endured by employees. The court acknowledges the humanitarian value of the Trust’s contributions and recognises their tireless work in the face of shrinking charitable funding and increasing demand. The hearing room itself—Courtroom 5 at Birmingham—was refurbished earlier this year. While this does not directly bear upon the merits of the case, it is worthwhile noting that modern facilities contribute significantly to the dignified conduct of proceedings. The layout facilitates better audio-visual integration for the display of evidential CCTV footage and ensures accessibility for all parties. The Crown’s case drew substantially upon high-definition video evidence obtained from multiple locations. This includes footage captured on 3 February 2025 at the Willow Lane Pharmacy, viewed by store staff and law enforcement alike. The careful adherence to the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR) Part 5 in the collation and disclosure of these materials is commendable and provides a secure evidential framework within which matters unfold. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. Following the receipt of disclosure, the defence raised concerns regarding the chain of custody for some exhibits, particularly items recovered from a skip adjacent to the Cedar Road Supermarket. However, these concerns were robustly addressed during pre-trial hearings and found insufficient to warrant exclusion of the evidence. Turning to jurisprudence relevant to sentencing in theft cases, it is appropriate to recall the guidance in R v. Stephens [2019] EWCA Crim 815, which reinforces that the quantity and frequency of offences contribute materially to culpability assessments when considering aggregate sentencing. Stephens involved a defendant who engaged in serial shoplifting across multiple jurisdictions over an 18-month period, much like the present matter. The Court of Appeal in that case confirmed that persistent acquisitive offending, even when involving low-value items, can no longer be regarded as petty or frictionless by public authorities. In addition, the court notes R v. Carmichael [2020] EWCA Crim 1234, where the defendant was found guilty of a series of fly-tipping offences causing significant environmental damage, incurring both cleanup costs and public hazard. Though of a very different nature to the present offence, Carmichael highlights the judiciary’s increasing willingness to impose custodial sentences for patterned, opportunistic behaviour detrimental to public amenity and trust. Though not directly analogous, the principle that cumulative impact can justify robust sentencing resonates here. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. The defendant’s personal circumstances warrant close scrutiny. You are currently 34 years old, unemployed, and residing in accommodation provided by the Birmingham Housing Authority. Your history includes prior convictions, predominantly for low-level acquisitive crimes, dating back to adolescence. Your educational attainment is limited, and your vocational history reflects intermittent transient employment, largely in the service sector. A recent pre-sentence report compiled by Probation Officer Ms Yasmin Clarke reflects a nuanced assessment. Ms Clarke notes your expressed desire to desist from offending yet outlines concerns regarding your inconsistent engagement with support services. She highlights risk factors including financial instability, substance misuse (particularly noted alcohol use), and social isolation. Predictably, these findings are consistent with those reported in the psychiatric assessment. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. The court is acutely aware of the pressures placed on public services in addressing the roots of crime. Social housing demand in Birmingham continues to outstrip supply, exacerbating residential transience and insecurity, which in turn correlate with various negative outcomes. The increasing burden on NHS mental health services, with waiting times for community psychiatric care stretching into months, further complicates efforts to stabilise vulnerable individuals. While such systemic limitations do not excuse misconduct, they nonetheless provide important contextual understanding. The daytime anti-social behaviour in Broad Street, a local nightlife area, has been the subject of recent public consultation though it bears little relation to this case. Similarly, unrelated are the ongoing investigations into a local high-profile arson attack at a commercial unit in Court 3 of this building, which delayed court listings earlier this year by several days. The evidence discloses that on multiple occasions you were accompanied by acquaintances during your visits to retail establishments, though no collusion or joint participation in thefts has been substantiated. Their names and involvement, if any, have no direct relevance to sentencing in this matter before the court. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. The court also notes a letter dated 12 August 2025 received from the defendant’s sister, Ms Camille H, who expresses her hope for rehabilitation and a peaceful future for you. Such family support is an important factor, albeit distal, and I commend the letter's tone and intent. It is also worth referencing a recent Court of Appeal ruling, R v. Bannister [2024] EWCA Crim 667, concerning the imposition of custodial sentences for co-defendants in offences of aggravated burglary and violent disorder. While unrelated to this shoplifting matter, Bannister illuminates principles concerning the interplay between offence gravity and mitigating personal circumstances, which, where applicable, inform sentencing considerations. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. The overarching sentencing framework requires balance. The court must weigh your culpability and prior record against any mitigating circumstances. Sentencing must serve deterrence, punishment, and rehabilitation, always mindful of public protection. Given persistent challenges in convincing defendants to engage meaningfully with probation and ancillary agencies, it is incumbent upon this court to consider not only traditional sanctions but the utility of rehabilitative orders. The construction sector in the Birmingham region continues to encounter fluctuating opportunities for employment, but this is a generic concern rather than a special marker of individual circumstance. Similarly, your mention of aspiring towards training as an electrician is acknowledged, though concrete steps towards this aim remain unsubstantiated. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. It is regrettable that recent police data analytic reports highlight a continuing rise in theft offences across the West Midlands, placing further strain on already stretched resources. The cumulative drain on policing, administration, and retail businesses from such persistent offending cannot be underestimated. Notably, a local Community Safety Partnership report observes the sustained impact on storefronts and the wider neighbourhoods affected by recurrent localised acquisitive crimes, notwithstanding multiple community patrol initiatives and public reassurance campaigns. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. I must commend the Metropolitan Shopkeepers' Support Network for their collaborative approach involving victim support, advocacy, and training on theft prevention measures. Their work exemplifies the proactive role civil society plays alongside formal agencies in addressing retail crime. The Legal Aid Agency, for its part, has come under scrutiny for the delays and administrative complexities highlighted earlier; this court urges the relevant bodies to expedite processing without compromising thoroughness. Those factual and procedural elements considered, I will direct the preparation of an up-to-date pre-sentence report addressing risk, needs, and suitability for available rehabilitative programmes, including cognitive behavioural interventions targeting impulsivity and criminal thinking patterns. Assessment should include the potential for a Community Order incorporating an Activity Requirement, and structured unpaid work where manageable. These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge S. W. Fenwick, delivered on the 15th day of August 2025 in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to appropriate authorities accordingly. You are advised of your right to appeal by lodging notice within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved for consideration. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM R v. MR H Case No. B2025/14379 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. A. STRATTON Filed: 12 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of charges brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically concerning allegations of shoplifting committed over an extended period in various retail outlets within the West Midlands jurisdiction. The chronology of offending spans from July 2023 through to the spring of 2025, incorporating incidents in both urban and suburban retail centres, notably including multiple high street chemists, small grocery stores, and convenience outlets. Procedural and Investigative Background You were initially arrested on 15 April 2025 following a coordinated investigative effort led by the West Midlands Police Commercial Crime Unit in collaboration with several local Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRP). These operational units have increasingly adopted a multi-agency approach to tackling repeated acquisitive offending in retail environments, combining data gathered from CCTV systems, retailer incident logs, and witness testimonials. The case files reveal that although individual shoplifting incidents might appear minor in isolation, the aggregation of such events presented a pattern indicative of a deliberate course of conduct, meriting prosecution in the Crown Court to address the seriousness and cumulative harm caused. It should be noted that this case progressed under the auspices of the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, designed to ensure early clarity on pleas and issues, to facilitate timely trial preparation, and to reduce avoidable adjournments. Despite this framework, the matter did encounter some procedural setbacks, including a delay of several weeks owing to the initial need for further disclosure from a third-party digital evidence custodian, and from defence applications to instruct expert psychiatric assessment, which required approval of Legal Aid funding. Such administrative delays, dishearteningly, remain commonplace within our criminal justice system, notwithstanding efforts to streamline processes. It is a matter of considerable regret—and worthy of formal observation—that the Legal Aid Agency exhibited a protracted and bureaucratically cumbersome approach to the timely resolution of expert instruction requests. The defence’s initial submission for funding of a forensic psychologist was made on 17 May 2025, but full authority to proceed was only granted on 23 July 2025 following multiple chaser correspondences and clarifications. This inefficiency introduces systemic friction into proceedings and, regrettably, does so at the expense of all parties and the administration of justice. Similar challenges afflict other areas within the justice system, including delays in psychiatric assessments due to NHS capacity constraints and operational staffing shortages within probation services. These are not isolated to this case; rather, they reflect enduring structural pressures. It is also important to record that during the defendant’s custody, a separate incident arose in the West Midlands Custodial Centre involving another detainee. This unrelated episode concerned the assault of prison officers with improvised weapons, resulting in disciplinary investigation and procedural safeguards review. Whilst entirely distinct from the charges presently before this court, it serves as a reminder of the complex social and institutional environments in which justice operates—a milieu often marked by concurrent conflict and disruption, which can weigh heavily upon those tasked with upholding order and safety. At the plea and trial preparation hearing, initially scheduled for 8 August 2025 but postponed due to late disclosure issues, you entered a not guilty plea. However, as the prosecution’s evidence—detailed in extensive CCTV footage, forensic analyses, and retailer statements—became overwhelming, you pleaded guilty at the outset of the trial window on 21 September 2025. Such late-stage pleas, while permitted by law and recognised within sentencing guidelines, warrant careful scrutiny. The sentencing discount available for guilty pleas is grounded not only in the fact of admission but in the timing and its genuine reflection of remorse. The Court of Appeal, in cases such as R v. Whitlock [2023] EWCA Crim 892, has reiterated that pleas delivered at the “eleventh hour” amidst inevitable conviction do not merit the same degree of reduction as those entered promptly, thereby affording meaningful credit for early acceptance of responsibility. The Crown, represented commendably by Miss Abigail Morton, Counsel for the prosecution, has made detailed submissions addressing the full breadth of offending, noting the systemic impact of your conduct on vulnerable retail sectors and the economic burden borne by small businesses. For the defence, Mr Edward Finch, appearing under a representation order, has ably emphasised mitigating features including the defendant’s unstable housing circumstances and financial pressures. The court takes this opportunity also to thank the staff and managers of retail establishments affected by your conduct who provided victim impact statements. Their accounts speak of the demoralising effect of recurring theft, the disruption caused to staffing patterns, and the psychological distress imposed on employees fearful of confrontation or customer hostility. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. To contextualise this offence within the broader framework of acquisitive crime, it is prudent to acknowledge that offences of this nature account for a significant portion of retail shrinkage losses nationally, exerting pressure not only on individual shop owners but also on supply chains, insurance schemes, and policing resources. Reports published by the British Retail Consortium in recent years indicate that losses from retail theft constitute billions of pounds annually, with consequences that ripple through employment, prices, and community wellbeing. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. The Theft Act 1968 remains the cornerstone legislation in defining and prosecuting offences involving dishonest appropriation, and section 1 expressly captures the conduct at issue here. Sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council advise that the seriousness of theft should be assessed not merely by financial value, but by factors including premeditation, impact on victims, breach of trust, and recurrence. In the present case, the representative charge captures a sustained pattern over months of repeated offending. The courts have held consistently that such cumulative behaviour reflects intent and culpability beyond isolated acts. For instance, R v. Granville [2022] EWCA Crim 1335 concerned a defendant convicted for a series of shoplifting offences targeting high-value beauty products over a sustained period; the Court of Appeal affirmed an immediate custodial term, underscoring the need to deter persistent dishonesty that erodes community confidence. Similarly, the decision in R v. Faulkner [2020] EWCA Crim 1804 highlighted that offenders who exploit commerce through stratagem and iteration demonstrate a marked disregard for the law and social order, thereby attracting increased sentence severity. That judgment found particular significance in the manner and frequency of offending, factors readily applicable to your conduct. It is worth observing that jurisprudence concerning aggravating features in acquisitive crime increasingly references the psychological toll on retail staff, particularly in small businesses where close community relationships exist. The judgment of Lord Justice Parker in R v. Armitage [2019] EWCA Crim 764 stressed the “erosion of personal security” felt by employees who suffer repeated victimisation, a dimension that must inform sentencing severity. Notably, I must also reference R v. Birchwood [2021] EWCA Crim 1562, a case where the defendant was convicted of theft from multiple charity outlets, engaging in distraction tactics to evade detection. That case affirmed that even ostensibly low-value thefts, when sustained and conducted with artifice, attract custodial sentences due to the cumulative impact on victim organisations and public trust. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. The Court also notes an instructive precedent in R v. Donahue [2023] EWCA Crim 994, which dealt with a defendant involved in the illegal importation and distribution of counterfeit goods, including branded perfumes. Although the factual matrix materially differs from simple theft, the case elucidates court attitudes towards consumer deception and cumulative economic harm, relevant as background context though bearing no direct relation to your own offending. Of wider interest, there have been recent appeals concerning offences unrelated to theft but involving community safety issues proximate to retail areas. For example, in R v. Fowler [2024] EWCA Crim 311, a defendant was sentenced for affray arising from a pub brawl involving pool cues, a matter to which this court has no direct relation nor relevance here save to note the breadth of crime impacting commercial premises. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. I have carefully considered the clinical report prepared by Dr Helen Marks, consultant forensic psychiatrist, instructed upon the defence’s application. Her assessment, conducted over two sessions in late August 2025, determines that you suffer from no severe mental illness. However, she identifies elements of impulsivity, coupled with mild to moderate alcohol dependency, noting that these factors “may contribute to impaired decision-making under stress,” though not amounting to a recognised mental disorder excusing criminal liability. Dr Marks’ evaluation also highlights a “history of inconsistent engagement with support services,” particularly those addressing housing instability and addiction. This finding accords with observations made in the probation service’s pre-sentence report, which emphasises intermittent compliance with appointments and reluctance to pursue longer-term rehabilitation pathways. Such sporadic engagement is regrettably not uncommon among individuals facing entrenched socioeconomic adversity. The probation officer, Ms Claire Heng, in her comprehensive report filed on 1 October 2025, advocates for consideration of community rehabilitation with a tailored programme targeting acquisitive crime cognition and impulse control. Ms Heng remarks upon “limited genuine insight” demonstrated by you during her interviews, tempered by a willingness at times to express regret for the impact on victims. She notes, however, that your accommodation situation—currently residing in temporary supported housing following eviction from previous premises—poses a risk factor for reoffending, citing research linking housing instability with increased likelihood of acquisitive offences. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. The probation report references the considerable strain on community services in the West Midlands, with waiting lists for substance misuse programmes exceeding six months and housing allocations severely constrained. These systemic limitations undoubtedly complicate rehabilitation prospects, though the report underscores the necessity of your active participation in available interventions. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. Recent scholarly commentary on the interplay between acquisitive offending and social welfare has noted that while economic hardship is a factor, it does not inexorably lead to crime. The Justice Policy Institute, in its 2024 report, stressed that “agency and choice remain central to offending decisions” and that criminal justice responses must balance compassion with accountability. Analysis of Your Criminal Record and Personal Circumstances You are currently 34 years old, with a recorded history of five prior convictions for theft-related offences spanning the last eight years. The earliest recorded conviction in 2018 was for shoplifting high-value confectionery, resulting in a conditional discharge. Subsequent offending led to community orders in 2020 and 2022. The latter, issued by a magistrates’ court in Dudley, required completion of a cognitive skills course, which you admitted only partial compliance with. Your residential history reveals volatility: periods of temporary accommodation interspersed with episodes of sofa-surfing among acquaintances. There is no evidence suggesting gang association or involvement in organised crime, and you have no recorded convictions for violence or drug-related offences. A letter received from your sister, Mrs Fiona H, and additional correspondence from the community outreach charity “Hope Pathways,” attest to your recent attempts at stabilisation, emphasizing your expressed desire to find employment and abstain from further offending. While these representations are encouraging, their content must be weighed against documented behavioural patterns and the need for public protection. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. While shoplifting is often perceived as a “minor” offence, persistent and strategic offending that undermines retail security and victim confidence warrants serious consideration of the public interest in deterrence and community protection. The use of community sentences with rehabilitation requirements is appropriate where there is a reasonable prospect of compliance and remediation. However, the court must balance this with the need to signal that repeated shoplifting, even if non-violent, carries consequences proportionate to its societal impact. The case also presents a useful point of contrast with R v. Everitt [2019] EWCA Crim 845, where an offender convicted of criminal damage to a church noticeboard received a community order with unpaid work imposed. The relatively isolated and less economically damaging nature of that offence differentiates it markedly from the repetitive, financially oriented conduct before this court. It is worth recalling that the Probation Service in the West Midlands faces significant resource constraints, with a frontline workforce under increasing pressure, a factor that risks impairing the intensity and quality of supervision. In this respect, sentencing proposals that include supervision must consider realistic capacity and the potential for genuine engagement. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. This court remains firmly of the view that sensory and psychological distress caused to retail employees by repeated shoplifting is deserving of serious acknowledgement. It is a matter of record that the stress engendered in such workplaces has caused some staff to seek transfers or to request reduced responsibilities, and business owners to incur increased security costs. The clear message of the Courts is that such conduct will not be condoned. Further, it is evident that while socioeconomic adversity and personal challenges may provide context, they do not excuse persistent criminal behaviour, particularly where assistance has been made available and declined. The offending in this matter involved a clear pattern of opportunism and planning, consistent with deliberate dishonesty. Sentencing will therefore take place following receipt of any updated reports or further representations, including a possible addendum from the probation service assessing progress on engagement with services over the intervening weeks. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of their right to appeal within 28 days of sentence in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT PLYMOUTH R v. MR H Case No. P2025/03871 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. Griffith Filed: 19 September 2025 Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence in relation to a charge of theft, specifically a series of shoplifting offences, contrary to Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans a protracted period from November 2023 through April 2025 and involves multiple retail establishments within the Plymouth and South Devon area, including high street shops, small convenience stores, and local pharmacies. Procedural and Case Management Background Your case has been before this court following your formal charge and subsequent transfer from the Magistrates' Court on 15 May 2025, pursuant to the provisions laid out under the Crown Court allocation scheme and consistent with the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, which seeks to expedite preparation and ensure the resolution of contested matters within statutory timetables. Regrettably, this matter experienced several procedural adjournments, primarily occasioned by delayed defence applications for expert psychiatric assessment and the necessity to obtain full disclosure of surveillance footage from multiple retailers, as well as the time taken for collateral checks relating to your prior criminal history and ongoing support needs. In the context of these case management proceedings, it is appropriate to record formally the enduring challenges facing the Legal Aid Agency in administering funding approvals for commissioned reports. On no fewer than three occasions did defence counsel encounter protracted waits for funding sanction, notably for the instruction of Dr Pauline Matthews, a consultant forensic psychologist with expertise in acquisitive offending and impulsivity disorders. These delays had a discernible effect on listing availability and case progression, compounding an already congested court docket impacted by nationally recognised shortfalls in criminal justice staffing and resource constraints. The court reiterates its concern that such systemic inefficiencies serve neither the interests of justice nor those of the defendant or the public. This court further acknowledges the cooperation extended by the Plymouth Safer Retail Partnership and the Devon and Cornwall Police's dedicated Business Crime Unit. Their investigations involved the painstaking review of digital evidence, including CCTV footage and digital transaction records, enabling the collating of a comprehensive behavioural profile which proved integral to the Crown’s case. The dedicated Business Crime Partnership, despite chronic underfunding and the turnover of key personnel, maintained steady contact with affected retailers and has provided victim impact statements that detail not only the financial loss occasioned but the emotional and psychological burden borne by retail employees, many of whom have reported anxiety and a sense of vulnerability as a result of repeat theft incidents. Public safety considerations are intimately tied to the effective functioning of such partnerships, which seek to deter repeat offending and manage offenders proactively, thereby lessening the burden on already overstretched policing and judicial resources. However, it remains painfully clear that acquisitive crime constitutes a disproportionate share of calls on police time nationally, frequently eclipsing more serious investigations, and contributing to an insidious degradation of community confidence. Turning to the specifics of your case, the evidence relied upon includes eyewitness accounts, digital timetabled movements corroborated by public transport metadata, and a series of recovered goods linked to your possession at arrest. The cumulative weight of this evidence compelled you to enter a plea of guilty at the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 17 August 2025, following earlier contestation. Before addressing the facts in more detail, it is necessary to canvass relevant legal principles. The statutory framework under the Theft Act 1968 remains the touchstone, alongside the Sentencing Council’s definitive guidelines on theft (2017, last updated 2023), which emphasise the need for courts to consider patterns of offending, degree of planning, harm to victims (including psychological), and any aggravating or mitigating features. The court notes that theft by repeated and deliberate concealment with an intent to permanently deprive is properly viewed with seriousness, especially when it disrupts the confidence and welfare of retail workers and the sustainability of local businesses. Authority of note includes R v. Milton [2019] EWCA Crim 1468, which departed from previous sentencing norms by underscoring the real-world impact of repetitive low-value theft on community employers and employees alike, affirming a threshold for immediate custody where patterns indicate deliberate defiance of social norms. Likewise, R v. Benson [2021] EWCA Crim 1134 reaffirmed limited credit for late pleas, particularly in theft offences where prior warnings and diversionary offers had been declined. This litigation also occurs against a backdrop of evolving judicial understanding of offenders’ needs, particularly concerning those with identified vulnerabilities or cognitive impairments. The Probation Instruction 05/2019 sets out key principles on tailoring rehabilitative sentencing, a theme reflected in United Kingdom Sentencing Council literature and echoed in jurisprudence such as R v. Cartwright [2020] EWCA Crim 1281. Before turning to particulars of offence, ancillary matters merit articulation. The court has received several letters of support, including one from your former employer at Devon Electricals, who remarks on your punctuality and work ethic prior to recent job loss, though notes concerns about your subsequent disengagement from employment seeking. Letters from local voluntary sector agencies confirm repeated but unsuccessful outreach attempts to engage you in budgeting advice and housing support services. I note, for completeness, that your sister, Ms Fiona Harker, provided a statement referencing family difficulties, including recent bereavement and ongoing disputes relating to your housing situation. While such factors play into mitigation, the court must balance personal history against the imperative to uphold public confidence and protect vulnerable victims. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. This account of your offending behaviour frames the basis for the charges convicted. Moreover, the matter extends beyond isolated incidents, capturing a broader course of conduct marked by repetition, concealment, and clear intent to circumvent detection. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. The evidence demonstrates a pattern of strategic offending timed to coincide with peak store hours, aimed at exploiting staff attention and maximising gain. On multiple occasions, you were recorded entering and exiting premises with what security footage and employee testimonies support as concealed items, including high-demand personal care products and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. The history of your prior engagements with policing and judicial interventions is relevant. You were previously subject to a conditional discharge in 2021 following a similar charge for theft from a small independent grocer, described in the post-sentence assessment as a “brief aberration.” That assessment acknowledged your expressed willingness to alter behaviour, though sadly this appears not to have been realised in practice. The offender record reveals minor inconsistencies in presenting stable accommodation, with repeated short-term tenancies and periods of temporary housing documented by housing support workers. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. This visibility into your conduct is striking in evidencing a pattern of opportunism, combined with a confident, if misguided, sense of impunity. It reveals no significant attempts to conceal your identity, notwithstanding your use of layered clothing or gloves to obscure fingerprints. The Crown has adduced expert psychological input obtained from Dr Matthews, whose recent report describes your mental health status as largely stable but affected by chronic low mood and stress related to financial precarity. Dr Matthews diagnoses traits consistent with borderline impulsivity and situational stressors, but stops short of identifying a formal disorder warranting hospital treatment or structured psychiatric intervention. The report emphasises that your engagement with available support services has been minimal, characterised by sporadic attendance at appointments and an apparent reluctance to accept assistance, a finding echoed in statements from social outreach workers. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. It should be plainly stated that while such vulnerabilities may provide some explanatory context, they do not excuse or diminish culpability. The court is very familiar with the experience of defendants who cite stress-related reasons for offending while simultaneously failing to engage with agencies capable of offering meaningful support. Attached to the court bundle are victim personal statements from three frontline retail workers, who describe heightened anxiety and diminished morale resultant from recurrent thefts. One witness, a store assistant employed for 7 years at the town centre pharmacy, recounts her distress at repeated incidents, noting the day-to-day strain caused by the need to monitor customers vigilantly. Another witness highlights how scheduling has been amended to reduce lone working due to safety concerns. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. These statements, while not alleging physical harm, testify to the erosion of psychological safety in community retail environments — a factor increasingly recognised by sentencing authorities as a material harm in its own right. Drawing parallels to notable appellate authorities, this court recalls R v. Jarvis [2022] EWCA Crim 1149, where repeated, non-violent retail theft conducted over a period of months sparked substantial custodial sanctions, with the Court emphasising that the knock-on effects for premises reliant on low-paid staff are cumulative and corrosive. The Court of Appeal underscored the necessity of deterrence in such cases, lest the courts be seen to tolerate a “culture of disregard” towards retail workers. Turning now to ancillary and partly irrelevant procedural matters, it is instructive to recall the evolution of the hostile environment policies affecting temporary accommodation placements. The long waiting lists in the Devon Housing Authority, compounded by national crises in social housing supply, have led to frustration and mobility among vulnerable populations. While these issues are beyond the scope of criminal adjudication, some indirect effects on your personal circumstances have been submitted in mitigation, albeit not substantiated by evidence of sustained effort to resolve housing insecurity. I further remark on the unfortunate delays occasioned by the Nationwide Postal Strike in March and April 2025, coinciding with key phases in this prosecution’s listing and evidential disclosure. Although the court and parties endeavoured to mitigate the impact through electronic communication and liaison, these broader systemic pressures testify to the complex environment within which modern justice is administered. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. Despite previous cautionary measures and diversion proposals, it is noted that your compliance with intervention offers, including those from the Community Rehabilitation Company, was inconsistent. Probation reports describe partial engagement with thinking skills groups and no completion of prescribed modules addressing acquisitive offending patterns. The court turns to the wider context of crime trends in the South West. According to regional data compiled by the Devonshire Policing Command, shoplifting has accounted for a growing proportion of acquisitive crime reports since 2021, a trend attributable in part to economic pressures and evolving retail security technologies. This increase poses significant challenges to policing priorities, necessitating strategic use of increasingly scarce resources. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. At the time of your arrest on 25 April 2025, officers located items in your possession consistent with those reported stolen from several incidents under investigation. The timing of the arrest followed an extensive, digitally assisted investigation incorporating data from transport card swipes and public CCTV feeds, authorised under appropriate warrants. Procurement of mobile device data and triangulation techniques supported the evidentiary structure, underscoring the deliberate and persistent nature of your conduct. While such surveillance techniques are intrusive and subject to tight judicial oversight, their use was deemed proportionate and justified by the Magistrates’ Court prior to issue. The Crown correctly notes that your offending caused cumulative financial loss to small and medium enterprises that operate with already thin margins, a factor aggravating the harm occasioned. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. In consideration of sentencing options, this court is mindful of the Sentencing Council guidelines mandating the exploration of community-based orders where feasible, particularly where offenders have demonstrable vulnerabilities or where punishment alone is unlikely to effect sustainable behavioural change. However, this court recognises the limits of leniency in cases marked by repeated offending, failure to engage with rehabilitative opportunities, and apparent disregard for victim impact. The balance of factors presently before the court situates you toward the more serious end of the sentencing tariff for theft offences of this nature. It is acknowledged that you have no prior convictions for violent or sexual offences, and there is no evidence of association with organised crime groups or coercive influences. Your familial circumstances, while strained, do not include factors suggesting heightened risk to public safety. The court notes your reported unemployment status and precarious housing, factors which may be addressed in the context of a holistic intervention plan to accompany sentencing. Dr Matthews’ psychological evaluation recommends, where community disposal is appropriate, engagement with structured interventions aimed at impulsivity management, alongside support addressing accommodation and financial difficulties. Nonetheless, the court must emphasise the importance of consistent and documented engagement with such services, a predicate for the imposition of non-custodial orders in persistent acquisitive offending. I am mindful of the reported absence of any history of offending involving co-defendants or associates in relation to this course of conduct. Although disclosures have revealed unrelated charges and ongoing investigations involving third parties known to you socially, no evidence was presented to suggest causal links or complicity, and those matters remain outside the remit of this sentencing. The court also records, although datum, a prior unrelated environmental prosecution in the Plymouth area in 2021 concerning unlawful tipping offences by a business operator unconnected to the present matter. Similarly, references in the prosecution bundle to an unrelated arson incident in Court 5 in July 2025 serve merely as reflection of listing pressures and carry no weight in this individual sentencing exercise. The sentencing hearing today has been held in open court with full legal representation. I express gratitude to Ms Charlotte Avery, representing the Crown, and to Mr Felix Langdon, appearing on your behalf pursuant to your Legal Aid representation. Both counsel have submitted comprehensive oral and written representations, to which the court has paid careful attention. A probation pre-sentence report has been commissioned and is awaited. Given the complexity of your personal circumstances and the necessity to weigh risk, harm, and rehabilitative prospects, I reserve judgment and direct that final sentencing be deferred until all assessments are completed, including any further relevant medical or social service contributions. It is a lamentable truth that delays await in such cases, but none can be allowed to compromise the fairness of the process or the thoroughness of appropriate evaluation. The court emphasises that these remarks are provided to frame the general landscape of sentencing considerations and should not prejudice any final determination. These remarks are issued this 19th day of September 2025 in Court 8 at Plymouth Crown Court. The hearing has been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record will be forwarded to appropriate authorities, including the National Archive of Sentencing Outcomes. Mr H is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, Section 49, are currently engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT ELLESMERE R v. MR H Case No. N2025/05621 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. Fenwick Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing in relation to a series of theft offences from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This case concerns a sustained pattern of shoplifting across multiple commercial outlets within the Ellesmere borough and surrounding districts over an extended period commencing in mid-2023 and culminating in early 2025. Procedural History and Case Background You were arrested on 12 March 2025 following a multi-agency investigation coordinated primarily by the Ellesmere City Police Retail Crime Unit, with support from the local Business Crime Partnership and forensic analysis teams. The process leading to your arrest involved a considerable degree of collaboration across retail establishments, metropolitan intelligence services, and the Crown Prosecution Service, reflecting the resource-intensive nature of investigations into serial acquisitive offending. It would be remiss not to acknowledge the challenges confronting agencies tasked with the investigation of offences often dismissed or minimised in the public imagination as “petty theft.” Yet, the forensic and investigative work required is far from trivial. Officers devoted long hours to the painstaking examination of CCTV footage from various shops—much of it grainy or incomplete—cross-referencing with stock audits, employee statements, and movement analytics. The coordination between retention teams, surveillance units, and retail security officers has been exemplary in this matter. This court notes with approbation the diligence of Detective Sergeant Matthews and her team. The case’s progression was also affected by several procedural matters of note. Initial committal proceedings at Ellesmere Magistrates’ Court took place on 2 April 2025, where the indictable nature of the offending required transfer to this court. The matter was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 16 June. At that stage, you initially pleaded not guilty, electing to contest the allegations. The Better Case Management (BCM) framework, established to facilitate the efficient and proportionate administration of Crown Court business, was engaged. It is worth noting the relative smoothness with which this case has moved through BCM stages, particularly given the complexity of the evidential materials—including digital exhibits, witness statements, and expert reports. The Clerk of the Court and Case Progression Officer, Mr Lewis, are to be commended for their efforts in maintaining listing timeliness amidst wider staff shortages impacting the region. It also merits recording that this court is cognisant of ongoing systemic pressures on the probation and mental health services, which, although peripheral to the core prosecutorial matters here, influence the delivery of ancillary assessments and sentencing recommendations. Frequent underfunding, staff attrition, and pandemic-induced backlogs have all impacted the capacity of these vital services, with implications for rehabilitative interventions that this court must inevitably consider. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. Your change of plea to guilty was tendered on 4 September, shortly before trial was due to commence. Such late pleas, while permitted and routinely encountered, attract a reduced discount in sentencing by virtue of procedural and resource implications. The law is clear: credit is a recognition of genuine remorse, early acceptance of responsibility, and an avoidance of the need for contested proceedings. Where pleas are delayed until evidence is overwhelming, or the trial imminently due, the scope for such credit diminishes markedly. This principle was robustly articulated in the Court of Appeal decision in R v Casswell [2019] EWCA Crim 653, where it was emphasised that procedural economy achieved through early pleas justifies enhanced sentencing concessions. Additionally, the decision in R v Mbeki [2020] EWCA Crim 802 highlighted that a plea entered late, particularly in cases involving corroborative forensic or surveillance evidence, must be carefully scrutinised for authenticity of remorse, with sentencing discounts curtailed accordingly. This court applies these principles here. It is therefore appropriate to record that, while your guilty plea is welcomed, it falls short of the ideal timing envisaged in the sentencing guidelines. The discount available will be calculated in accordance with your delay. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. As part of the sentencing process, this court received a comprehensive pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Janette Howells. The report details, inter alia, your background, previous convictions, social circumstances, and potential rehabilitative needs. Ms Howells notes you reside in temporary accommodation provided by the council, with a history of occasional homelessness. Employment is not currently held, and there is documentation of intermittent substance misuse, primarily involving over-the-counter analgesics and sporadic alcohol consumption. The report carefully considers your prior offending history, which includes multiple convictions for theft, none of which appear to have precipitated sustained engagement with support services or evident behavioural change. Among the salient points raised is your reported disconnection from family support networks, with strained communication ascribed to longstanding interpersonal difficulties. Several letters of support from voluntary organisations, including the Ellesmere Community Food Bank and the Hope Outreach Project, outline your participation in their services, albeit irregularly and without demonstrable sustained progress. Such reports are invaluable, offering a nuanced insight beyond the sterile facts of offending. They provide a framework for the court to consider not only punishment but the prospects of rehabilitation and the imperative of public protection. In addition to the probation report, the court received the expert psychiatric report authored by Dr Nisha Patel, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at the East Midlands NHS Trust. Dr Patel concludes that while no formal diagnosis of serious mental illness can be made, there are features consistent with an emerging personality disorder, characterised by emotional regulation difficulties and impulsivity. The report underscores that your offending appears to be linked in part to attempts to manage psychological stress and socioeconomic adversity, though emphasising that such factors do not excise responsibility. Dr Patel advocates for a structured treatment plan combining cognitive behavioural therapy with community psychiatric oversight. The report was prepared following instruction at the defence's request and funded via Legal Aid. Notably, there was delay in commissioning the report, owing to protracted administrative procedures within the Legal Aid Agency, which has been the subject of increasing judicial criticism nationally. The court joins in the sincere hope that such procedural impediments are addressed in the near term to ensure timely access to expert assessment, particularly for those defendants with potential vulnerabilities. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. The Broader Context of Retail Theft and Public Safety The court is bound to consider the broader societal ramifications of offences such as these. Retail theft, while often minimised in public discourse, imposes a heavy burden on business owners, their employees, and the local economy. It contributes to what is identified as “shrinkage,” increases insurance premiums, and can lead to the closure of small enterprises, eroding community cohesion and employment opportunities. Recent data from the Metropolitan Police Service reveal a rise in acquisitive offences of this character, placing heightened strain on policing resources that might otherwise be directed towards more serious crime types. The Business Crime Reduction Partnership model, operational since 2015, is predicated on combining the efforts of retailers, police, social services, and local government to proactively manage repeat offenders and foster safer commercial environments. Yet, the efficacy of such networks varies significantly according to regional funding, staffing levels, and inter-agency goodwill. In the present instance, the Ellesmere Partnership has demonstrated commendable engagement, providing victim impact statements and facilitating witness support. This court particularly notes the fortitude of frontline retail workers, who often bear the brunt of disrespect and intimidation despite the “low-level” classification of theft offences. Such offences are neither victimless nor inconsequential. It is also necessary to briefly consider the state of local judicial infrastructure. This courtroom recently underwent refurbishment, including updated digital evidence display technology, which facilitated the presentation of video evidence. While this may seem peripheral, the efficiency and clarity of trial proceedings are materially assisted by such enhancements. The court registrar, Mr S. Blundell, provides invaluable support in ensuring procedural fluidity. The importance of well-functioning institutions must not be underestimated in maintaining public confidence. Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. It is pertinent to recall several appeals which, while not directly on all fours with the instant facts, provide valuable principles relevant to sentencing. R v. Keating [2018] EWCA Crim 17 concerned a defendant convicted of repeated shop thefts involving organised distraction techniques and collusion with others. The Court upheld an eight-month custodial sentence, emphasizing that deliberate planning, targeting vulnerable premises, and resultant psychological impact on staff constitute serious aggravating factors. The decision established important calibrations of culpability in repeated acquisitive crimes. In R v. Brannigan [2023] EWCA Crim 254, the Court addressed sentencing in cases involving defendants with complex mental health profiles. While recognising the mitigating potential of disorder, it held that where the public danger remains significant, rehabilitation-oriented approaches must be supplemented by appropriate deterrence. A further decision, R v. Sharples [2019] EWCA Crim 1091, focused on the consequences of late pleas. The Court underlined that while credit is discretionary, penalties for tactical delay serve the interests of justice and resource conservation. While these cases are neither identical nor directly determinative, they offer signposts to the measured exercise of sentencing discretion here. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. Victim impact statements entered by affected businesses detail not merely the monetary loss but elevated stress experienced by staff. Managers report altered working hours and rota adjustments to mitigate risk, with recruitment and retention increasingly challenging in this climate. The Retail Support and Community Network, a voluntary organisation specialising in victim assistance, provided written representations to the court. They highlight the cumulative toll of repeated thefts on staff morale and workplace atmosphere, noting that multiple victims requested anonymity out of concern for reprisal or reputational damage. This court is mindful of the courage required by victims to participate in the criminal process, especially where the offences are “low profile.” Their contributions are vital and valued. I also note the correspondence from Ellesmere Social Services which outline ongoing efforts to engage you with rehabilitative resources. The letters commend your sporadic attendance at support groups but express concern over inconsistency and lack of sustained commitment. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. It bears mentioning that the present case experienced some delay due to the unavailability of key witnesses, necessitating adjournments. Such delays are regrettable, given the strain on court lists exacerbated by nationwide recruitment difficulties among judiciary and court staff. Indeed, this court joins the growing chorus of judicial voices calling for enhanced investment in criminal justice infrastructure, recognising that efficiency is not an end in itself but directly impacts fairness and victim confidence. Alongside those challenges, the Legal Aid system's bureaucratic hurdles, as previously referenced, place additional strain on all participants. The protracted process in securing funding to instruct expert evidence in this case is a lamentable example. It may be of passing interest that a co-defendant, Mr D., charged in related proceedings with possession of a bladed article at a school car park, entered a guilty plea but is not connected to your offending. That matter proceeds separately, and no inference should be drawn here. Similarly, a different individual residing in the same building as you is under investigation for alleged benefit fraud; these proceedings are wholly unconnected to your case. Such distinctions are essential to avoid conflating collocated but unrelated offences. In parallel, this court also notes unrelated community disorder incidents during the period, including an affray at a local pub involving pool cues and subsequent prosecutions, and an unrelated arson at a disused commercial premises on the industrial estate, both matters having no bearing on the charges here. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. In determining the appropriate sanction, the court must balance the objectives of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection, as consistently emphasised in sentencing guidance and statutory framework. Given the absence of physical violence or threats, and your current vulnerability due to housing and health issues, custodial sentences remain discretionary rather than obligatory. However, the persistence and planning demonstrated in your offending weigh heavily as aggravating factors. I note the existence of various community order requirements tailored to address offending behaviour, including cognitive skills programmes, mental health treatment mandates, and structured unpaid work components. Such interventions, when diligently applied, can significantly reduce recidivism and promote social reintegration. The court anticipates that any pre-sentence report will explore the feasibility and appropriateness of these measures, given your individual circumstances. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. In conclusion, Mr H, the court acknowledges the seriousness of your offending and the wider impact on the victims and community. The late plea is noted and affects the degree of credit for remorse available. The multiple reports and representations highlight a mix of personal hardship, limited engagement with assistance, and a persistent offending pattern. These matters weigh heavily in the sentence to be imposed. Sentencing will be deferred pending receipt of an up-to-date pre-sentence report and consideration of any further representations. In preparation for the formal sentencing hearing, the probation service is asked to address questions of risk, rehabilitative potential, and the suitability of community-based disposals. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Ellesmere. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will accordingly be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. No further directions are made as to costs. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT STRATFORD R v. MR H Case No. T2026/04129 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. P. NEWLING Filed: 14 October 2026 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of theft from retail premises contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending comprises a series of episodes spanning from late 2024 through to the early months of 2026, involving multiple shops within the Stratford and Newham boroughs. These matters, while on their face concerning comparatively low-value items, reflect a pattern of repeated acquisitive behaviour requiring close judicial attention. Procedural History You were arrested on 9 April 2026 after an investigation carried out by officers from the Metropolitan Commercial Crime Unit acting in concert with the Stratford Business Crime Initiative. This investigation was precipitated by an escalating number of complaints from independent stores and small chains experiencing persistent retail theft. The initial reports, as is frequently the case in such matters, were sporadic and unconnected in isolation. It was only via patient collation of surveillance data, cross-referencing dates and times, and analytical efforts that law enforcement identified a recurring suspect fitting your description. The court notes, as it must, that the collation and utilisation of CCTV footage in cases of retail theft — while indispensable — are fraught with challenges. The variability in camera quality, incomplete angles, and technical glitches often result in the need for lengthy review sessions by officers and retail staff alike. In this case, attention was focused particularly on footage recorded by outlets in Stratford High Street, West Ham Road, and the Meadow Lane precinct, where your figure was repeatedly discernible. Multiple shifts of investigating officers, supported by volunteers from the local community policing team, expended considerable resource collating statements, supporting victims, and assembling evidential packages. The investigative process was exacerbated by limited staffing—particularly within the Commercial Crime Unit where vacancies remain a continuing strain—and the increasing volume of business crime reports in London boroughs over the past three years. For example, a recently published Metropolitan Police data briefing noted a 12% rise in retail theft incidents between April 2024 and March 2026 compared with the previous 24 months, underscoring the pressures on frontline policing amid complex socioeconomic conditions. I am also mindful that the Legal Aid Agency’s recent policy revisions have led to significant procedural delays in the authorisation of expert funding. Indeed, defence counsel’s application dated 21 May 2026 for instruction of a forensic clinical psychologist encountered an inordinate wait of nearly six weeks before approval was granted. Such delays interrupt timely case progress and burden both the court and the parties, compounding frustrations already inherent in drawn-out proceedings. While the system claims to serve fairness and thoroughness, its current operation often hampers defendants’ rights rather than enhancing them. Your initial appearance took place at Stratford Magistrates’ Court on 12 April 2026, where bail was granted with conditions including nightly curfew and notification requirements. The matter was committed to this court for trial due to the scale of the offending and the pattern of conduct observed, in line with the Better Case Management protocol introduced in 2018 to expedite the handling of complex theft cases. You initially pleaded not guilty at the plea and case management hearing on 14 May 2026. However, after the serving of full disclosure including clothing swatches associated with the offending and successive CCTV edits, you altered your plea to guilty on 6 October 2026, just five days before the scheduled trial. This late admission falls within the regrettably frequent category of last-minute pleas seen in acquisitive crime and tempers the discount allowable for early remorse or responsibility. There is an established jurisprudence regarding the timing and nature of guilty pleas, as articulated in recent appellate decisions. In R v. Farrow [2024] EWCA Crim 1123, the Court of Appeal underscored that timing remains central in quantifying credit. A plea given after full trial preparation and witness notification garners significantly less reduction—often capping at around 10 to 15%. This is in recognition not merely of procedural delay but also of the additional burdens imposed on victims and court resources. It is also worth noting the landmark decision in R v. Callaghan [2022] EWCA Crim 3104, where repeated shoplifting offences — despite the apparent trivial value of items stolen — attracted a custodial dimension due to their cumulative impact on business viability and community confidence. That case emphasised the court’s duty to balance proportionate sentencing with an acknowledgement of societal impact even where individual acts may appear minor. Historical consideration of theft statutes is instructive. Enacted in 1968, the Theft Act remains the cardinal legislative instrument, although it has been supplemented by evolving case law and sentencing guidelines periodically updated by the Sentencing Council. The guidelines underline the vital importance of public protection, deterrence, and accountability, particularly when offences involve repeat behaviour affecting vulnerable retail sectors. The Crown and defence have both provided extensive submissions, including references to cases such as R v. McDermott [2017] EWCA Crim 1234, where thefts undertaken under duress and compelling personal hardship were treated with some mitigation, provided engagement with rehabilitation was evident. Though noted, the facts here differ materially. Turning to the role of victim impact statements, I have received several from affected shop managers, many of whom described a pervasive sense of unease and financial loss, compounded by pressure from landlords to reduce damage and shrinkage. The Mental Health and Wellbeing in Retail Support Network provided contextual commentary stressing elevated stress levels amongst retail workers during the post-pandemic economic period. As the court is aware, there is no place for wilful disregard of the law due to such pressures. Conversely, wholesale failures to engage with available support services denote a troubling pattern requiring scrutiny in sentence calculation. The facts of the offending are as follows: Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. Following each event, your behaviour showed a degree of sophistication and compensatory tactics designed to evade detection. This included switching garments between locations and deliberately altering disguises. On occasion, you were observed using counterfeit receipts and distracting store staff. The court notes that while no violence or threats were employed, your conduct demonstrated a consistent disregard for the rights of shopkeepers and employees. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. Subsequent offences involved the targeting of pharmacies and convenience stores during peak business periods. Evidence indicates that items of personal care and over-the-counter medication were the primary goods taken, some bearing value for resale. That these offences occurred despite warnings and prior community resolutions heightens their seriousness. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. It is pertinent to highlight that the countermeasures used by stores—such as shortened opening hours and physical security upgrades—imposed operational costs and inconvenience. There is a notable correspondence from the Stratford Retail Alliance, dated 20 September 2026, stressing the detrimental effect on local commerce and urging consideration of robust sentencing to deter recidivism. Mr H used a question about Oyster Card transactions to divert the shopkeeper’s attention, then leaned over the counter to take a displayed item. There is some evidence that your circumstances included housing instability and financial hardship. A letter from your caseworker at East London Housing Services, dated 11 August 2026, details longstanding accommodation difficulties, complicated by wait times exceeding fifteen months for single-room occupancy placements. However, the letter also records minimal engagement with referral options for budgeting support or employment assistance, suggesting a degree of choice or inertia. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. The psychiatric assessment conducted by Dr Samantha Lysander, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence, provides a detailed psychological profile. She reports no evidence of major psychiatric disorder, but diagnoses traits consistent with borderline personality disorder, alongside elements of impulsivity and chronic low mood. Dr Lysander cautions that untreated emotional dysregulation could elevate risk of relapse in offending if left unaddressed. However, she notes your refusal to participate in recommended dialectical behaviour therapy and your inconsistent compliance with prescribed medication. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. Probation services further report that although you have been offered various intervention programmes, including cognitive skills training and substance misuse outpatient support, take-up has been sporadic and largely unfruitful. This pattern, the probation officer writes in a report dated 18 September 2026, “raises concerns regarding genuine motivation to engage in rehabilitative processes.” The court cannot ignore the broader backdrop of increasing pressures on probation services. Caseloads frequently exceed recommended levels, leading to reduced supervision intensity and stretched resources. This systemic reality, however, while relevant to the wider context, does not exempt defendants from the requirements of compliance. The legal framework governing the sentencing of offences such as yours is outlined comprehensively in the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on “Theft Offences,” last updated in 2025. The guideline delineates culpability categories, with particular emphasis on frequency, planning, value, and harm. Your offending, involving multiple episodes and repeat targeting of vulnerable premises, places you within a higher culpability bracket, notwithstanding the modest monetary value involved per incident. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. I note also that the case has been impacted by co-defendant proceedings unrelated to you. One such individual, charged with criminal damage and assault in an unrelated incident within the same retail precinct, absconded prior to trial and remains at large. This has drawn significant police attention and resources but bears no bearing upon your culpability or sentence. In this vein, it is worth observing that it is not unusual for cases involving multiple offenders or associates to become complicated by confounding factors. For example, an unrelated case cited from a 2024 trial in Croydon involved a defendant convicted of affray following a fracas with pool cues in a tavern brawl — circumstances quite distinct from the peaceful but persistent dishonesty underlying the current matter. The court has also taken note of concerns raised during pre-trial hearings regarding the potential intersection between retail theft and broader societal challenges of homelessness and economic precarity. Data from the Greater London Authority points to ascending numbers of individuals sleeping rough, a factor contributing indirectly to crime rates. Yet correlation is not causation, and every individual remains responsible for their conduct. Furthermore, scrutiny of witness statements reveals occasional references to unrelated local environmental crime, including fly-tipping incidents near green belt land in Newham, which again, while troubling, are not linked to you. The court flags this only to underline the necessity of careful evidential evaluation unclouded by associative distractions. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. With regard to rehabilitation prospects, the pre-sentence report urges consideration of a community order incorporating a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, a Thinking Skills Programme to address offending-related decision-making, and enhanced mental health support tailored to your psychological profile. It is emphasised that meaningful engagement with these interventions is critical; without commitment, community disposals often founder. The court is cognisant of the strain on local and national mental health services. Waiting lists for psychological therapies exceed 12 months in some areas, and service funding is under intense pressure. These systemic deficiencies regrettably hamper efforts to provide effective support to vulnerable defendants. Nonetheless, an offender’s willingness to participate remains paramount. Moreover, due acknowledgment is given to the efforts of voluntary organisations such as the Retail Loss Prevention Foundation and the City Neighbourhood Watch, which have invested significant labour in supporting victim-retailers and promoting community resilience. Their representations to this court have been valuable in conveying the human and economic toll of repeated shop theft, beyond mere cost assessments. These considerations inform but do not dictate sentencing outcomes. The judiciary must navigate the complex balance between individual circumstances and wider public safety imperatives. In reaching a conclusion on sentence, I have taken full account of the principles laid down in the Sentencing Act 2020, the personal mitigation offered, and the aggravating factors intrinsic to the offending pattern. There is a clear necessity to signify society’s disapproval, protect commercial interests and employees, and deter you from further offending. The court also notes that no previous custodial sentences are recorded against you. However, your previous convictions for similar conduct and recent community resolution weigh heavily against leniency. The persistence of offending despite formal warnings underscores a substantial risk of reoffending without effective intervention. I am conscious of the delicate balance that must be struck. Excessively harsh custody for offences of relatively low financial impact risks prison becoming a training ground for more serious offending. Conversely, inadequate sanctions signal tolerance for persistent dishonesty and weaken community trust. At this stage, I will direct the preparation of a thorough pre-sentence report which should encompass: a structured assessment of offending behaviour; mental health evaluation; suitability for community rehabilitation; and a tailored plan reflecting opportunities for engagement. The report should consider all relevant options, from custodial sentences of appropriate length to community orders with and without unpaid work, paying close regard to feasibility and likelihood of compliance. This court remains vigilant regarding the increasing normalisation of acquisitive crime as a coping strategy in contexts of socioeconomic deprivation. While acknowledging systemic challenges, responsibilities must remain personal. Rehabilitation and accountability go hand in hand. I thank Mr Samuel Barrett, counsel for the Crown, and Ms Fiona Douglas, representing you under a Legal Aid certificate granted on 29 April 2026. I also wish to commend the court clerks and ushering staff who have ensured orderly conduct throughout these proceedings, including accommodating the late submission of reports within constrained scheduling. These sentencing remarks are given this day, 14 October 2026, in Court 5 at Stratford Crown Court. A formal transcript has been recorded and filed in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal this sentencing decision within 28 days, pursuant to statutory provisions under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 section 49 are engaged at this time. Costs remain reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HULL R v. MR H Case No. H2025/15309 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge S.C. Bannister Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentencing following a single indictment pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to your conduct in respect of a series of shoplifting incidents occurring between the months of October 2023 and February 2025. The offending was principally focused within the Kingston-upon-Hull metropolitan area, including commercial premises situated along Beverley Road, Princes Quay shopping centre, and several independent convenience stores across the northern district. Procedural Background Your initial interview under caution took place on 2 March 2025, after police officers from Humberside Police's Economic Crime Unit received multiple reports from retail security teams across the city. The investigations were supported by the Hull Business Crime Reduction Partnership, an initiative established following the 2017 Policing and Crime Act reforms aiming to enhance information sharing between law enforcement and the commercial sector. This partnership has been credited with a modest reduction in shoplifting incidents locally; however, it continues to face challenges related to staff shortages, especially in the intelligence analytic workforce. It is a regrettable reality that attempts to quantify retail theft often rely heavily on incomplete data and volunteer-collected statistics, a circumstance that weakens the evidential base but does not diminish the real-world harm experienced by victims. The court notes the recent public report issued by the Association of British Retailers, which underscored the systemic under-reporting of such offences due to resourcing constraints and a growing sense of futility among retailers. This phenomenon is compounded by delays in the prosecution process, which this case exemplifies to some extent. Following your arrest on 1 March 2025, you were initially granted bail subject to a curfew and weekly reporting conditions, as recorded at the Hull Magistrates’ Court. Subsequent procedural steps included a plea and trial preparation hearing on 19 May 2025, at which you entered a plea of not guilty. The matter was adjourned to trial on 28 July 2025. It was only at the commencement of the trial proper, on 26 July 2025, after extensive disclosure and pre-trial meetings involving your legal representatives, that you elected to plead guilty on the basis of an agreed facts bundle. This pattern of delayed pleas in shoplifting cases has drawn considerable comment in the appellate courts. The position was summarised most recently in R v Chambers [2024] EWCA Crim 287, where it was noted that the timing of a plea is a critical factor in determining the extent of credit that may be afforded. The Court of Appeal reiterated that a plea entered on the first reasonable occasion should normally attract the maximum reduction, while late pleas warrant a reduced discount due to the strained resources and burden imposed on the criminal justice system and victims alike. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. The Crown's case was reliant in part on an accumulation of CCTV footage from multiple sources, corroborated by statements from store managers and staff, as well as a search of your person upon arrest which revealed possession of items consistent with stolen goods reported missing on separate occasions. The investigation, although thorough, encountered obstacles, including the absence of certain footage due to system malfunctions and the retention of evidence by third parties. During the investigation and subsequent court proceedings, the court has received a number of letters and reports from various professional and community organisations. Most notably, correspondence from the Hull Community Safety Partnership highlighted ongoing concerns about repeat low-level acquisitive offending and its impact on local businesses and residents. Similarly, a letter from the East Yorkshire Shopkeepers Association expressed frustration regarding the turnover of store staff and the reluctance of some victims to pursue prosecutions, fearing reprisals or further victimisation. The court acknowledges and is grateful for such contributions, which provide important context for the sentencing exercise. Conversely, numerous reports have flagged the rising pressure on Probation Service resources, including a noted shortage of officers trained in effective management of offenders with impulse-control difficulties or financial adversity, factors often intertwined with shoplifting. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. The court has reviewed a psychiatric report appended by Dr Amanda Walshe, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, dated 10 August 2025. Dr Walshe’s detailed and professionally composed assessment concluded that you do not meet criteria for any major psychiatric disorder but exhibit traits consistent with low self-esteem, intermittent depressive symptoms, and an emerging pattern of substance use primarily involving alcohol. The report highlights a cyclical pattern of impulsivity and financial stress underpinning your offending behaviour but stresses a lack of motivation to engage meaningfully with proposed support services. This assessment adds a layer of nuance to the understanding of your conduct, albeit it does not provide sufficient grounds to categorise you as suffering from a condition warranting diversion away from the criminal justice system. Your prior engagement with mental health services has been sporadic and ultimately unproductive, a recurring theme which this court has encountered with some frequency in cases of acquisitive crime. The probation report prepared by Officer Liam Prescott is also on file, dated 12 August 2025. It candidly sets out the challenges facing both you and the agencies tasked with risk management and rehabilitation. Notably, it speaks of your accommodation instability, reliance on short-term supported housing, and fractured family relationships that provide limited practical support. Importantly, the report recommends consideration of a community order incorporating a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement with a focus on financial literacy and impulse control, alongside unpaid work hours tailored to enhance accountability and reintegration. The strain borne by local services has been palpable. Extended waiting lists within the NHS community mental health teams in this region mean that prompt access to targeted interventions remains aspirational rather than assured. This systemic gap is an unfortunate backdrop to the personal circumstances of many defendants appearing before this court. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. The court is indebted to Ms Fiona Summers, probation officer, and Dr Walshe for their thorough input and acknowledges the contributory efforts of local voluntary sector organisations detailed in ancillary reports dated 3 and 9 August 2025. The activities of groups such as the North Hull Food Project and the City Outreach Workers Association have provided constructive outreach and diversionary options which, regrettably, you appear yet to embrace fully. In approaching the present case, the court is mindful of the statutory sentencing regime as established by the Sentencing Act 2020 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2021 and the relevant guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council pertaining to theft offences. The principle of proportionality remains paramount, balanced against the need for punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and the protection of the public interest. There is relevant case law that informs sentencing practice in shoplifting matters. For instance, in R v Haywood [2023] EWCA Crim 1092, the Court of Appeal provided authoritative guidance on the treatment of repeat offenders whose crimes, although individually minor in value, collectively evince a persistent disregard for the law and community norms. The court stressed the importance of considering cumulative harm, particularly the cumulative psychological impact on retail employees and smaller business proprietors. Moreover, the judgment in R v Newton [2022] EWCA Crim 876 underscored the concept that offenders with ongoing engagement in acquisitive crime, even in the absence of overt violence, can attract sentences commensurate with the degree of calculated opportunism suggested by their modus operandi. These cases reinforce an evidentiary and sentencing framework that requires the court not only to reflect on the individual act but also on the continuing threat posed by recidivism and disregard for community standards. Similarly, while factually distinct, the Court has had regard to R v Rothwell [2021] EWCA Crim 1432, dealing with environmental offences involving fly tipping. The court drew parallels in recognising that harm need not be purely physical or material to warrant penalty but can include damage to communal trust and the perception of safety. Though unrelated in facts, such reasoning echoes here as it concerns cumulative societal impact. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. The defendant’s offending pattern reveals a degree of premeditation and resilience in the face of prior intervention. Visual evidence shows repeated visits to the same retail outlets during weekday afternoons, with a focus on consumable goods and personal care items of small but easily concealable size. On at least three documented occasions, your conduct involved the concealment of merchandise within personal bags without payment, confirmed by security personnel and later supported by forensic marking technology results. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. Noteworthy is the disregard for signage and previous warnings issued by store managers. While no physical confrontation occurred, the psychological effect of repeated pilferage on staff has been recorded in victim impact statements received by the court, which note increased stress levels and staff turnover attributable, in part, to your actions. Such matters, while intangible in immediate value, have genuine consequences for workplace morale and operational continuity. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. During the course of proceedings, the court considered representations from the Defence regarding family circumstances and socio-economic hardship. Letters submitted by your sister, Ms Hannah Williams, paint a picture of a supportive but fractured family network contending with health difficulties and economic precarity. Additionally, correspondence from the East Hull Crisis Accommodation Service outlined their commitment to assisting you post-sentence but made clear the resource constraints and waiting periods inherent in re-housing large numbers of individuals experiencing homelessness. Moreover, the court is informed by reports from local charities such as the Hull Mental Health Action Group, which have repeatedly attempted engagement with you on a voluntary basis. Such organisations operate in a climate of increasing demand, where funding fluctuations and rising client numbers generate considerable administrative burden and program delays. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. On a procedural note, the court acknowledges the issues encountered by all parties due to intermittent industrial action undertaken by court staff and probation officers in late spring of this year. Such disruptions, while outside the ambit of those directly involved, inevitably extended timelines and contributed to an atmosphere of judicial fatigue and procedural strain. Additionally, delays in securing legal aid funding for instruction of a commissioned forensic accountant caused postponements in receipt of certain evidence, despite timely applications and diligent advocacy from defence counsel. This is consistent with the growing concern expressed by practitioners about the capacity and responsiveness of the Legal Aid Agency under current policies. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. Mr H, your pattern of offending exemplifies the persistent problem of low-level acquisitive crime that, while neither violent nor high value in isolation, cumulatively exacts a toll not only on victims but on public confidence in retail environments. The court must balance recognition of your personal circumstances with the demands of deterrence and the protection of vulnerable commercial premises. It is recognised that retail theft, especially when repeated, places sustained psychological pressure on employees and reduces the willingness of business owners to invest in areas perceived as insecure. Therefore, an appropriate sentence must address the wider public interest in upholding confidence within community commerce. Your lack of meaningful engagement with support services and your failure, despite multiple warnings and prior community interventions, to desist from the behaviour, indicate a concerning degree of obstinacy and disregard for societal norms. Nevertheless, the court accepts that your plea at the earliest realistic time and your personal circumstances, including unstable housing and familial pressures, merit consideration and may moderate the sentence appropriately. I will, as customary, direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared, with particular attention to the feasibility of a community order tailored to meet your rehabilitation needs. The report should explore the potential for participation in accredited thinking skills modules, financial management courses, and compulsory unpaid work—all with the aim of reducing the likelihood of reoffending and promoting social reintegration. A custody threshold will be examined carefully in light of all material before me, including the prospects for compliance and likelihood of protection of the public. I acknowledge the professional conduct of Ms Lorna Fletcher, prosecuting counsel, and Mr Douglas Harper, who has represented you under a Criminal Defence Service funding order. I also register my thanks to the usher and court staff for their assistance, in particular in navigating the complexities caused by contemporaneous administrative changes to court IT systems, which temporarily delayed evidence access during the trial week. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Hull. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal judgment and sentencing orders shall be conveyed accordingly. The defendant is informed of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged herein. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT DERWENTSHIRE R v. MR H Case No. T2025/13497 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. P. Bains Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court on indictment for a representative count of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968, pertaining to a series of incidents occurring over a sustained period within the jurisdiction of Derwentshire and neighbouring boroughs. The allegations, now admitted by you, arise from a consistent pattern of shoplifting offence spanning late 2023 through to early 2025. This case, like many within this court’s contemporary docket, poses significant challenges in balancing the delivery of justice with the myriad social, institutional, and procedural complexities attendant to low-level acquisitive crime. Procedural History and Case Progression The origins of this prosecution lie in a protracted and resource-intensive inquiry initiated by the Derwentshire Borough Police Retail Crime Unit (DRU) following repeated reports from multiple independent and chain retail outlets suffering unexplained stock losses. The investigation was coordinated in collaboration with several partners including the Derwentshire Business Crime Reduction Partnership, local council licensing officers, and security consultants commissioned by retail stakeholders. The investigative timeline encompassed close observation spanning approximately sixteen months, supplemented by extensive collation of CCTV, electronic point-of-sale reconciliations, and staff testimonies. These efforts culminated in your arrest on 3 February 2025. The logistical and evidential underpinning for such investigations demands considerable expenditure of public resources. The multi-agency nature of the inquiry required continuous liaison across departments, including the Derwentshire Digital Forensics Unit, involved in analysing digital stores and electronic point-of-sale irregularities. It is worth observing that while theft of goods under the theft threshold value may seem by some to warrant limited attention, the reality for enforcement agencies is that each reported incident triggers a cascade of procedural requirements—statements, exhibits, inventories, and, crucially, victim impact communications—placing onerous pressure on limited staff capacity. Such strains are exacerbated by contemporaneous and often more urgent demands on operational policing, including counter-terrorism, serious violent crime, and cybercrime investigations. The case was initially listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 10 March 2025, but was adjourned at the defence’s request to permit the preparation and service of a psychiatric report on your mental health, alongside a pre-sentence report outlining background and risk factors. That report was submitted by Dr Kamal Arora, consultant forensic psychologist, on 14 August 2025. I take this opportunity here to note the contribution of experts such as Dr Arora, whose detailed and professionally executed clinical assessments provide this court with a valuable framework for informed sentencing considerations, albeit with the recognition that such reports are, by their very nature, focused on assessment rather than prescription. The service of detailed victim impact statements from several affected outlets was made possible through the diligent work of the Retail Workers’ Support Network (RWSN), a voluntary sector group providing representation and counselling to employees affected by repeat shoplifting. Their engagement has been noteworthy, particularly given the chronic underfunding facing such organisations in the present climate of austerity and rising demand. It is their practical insight into victim experience that lends this proceeding its human dimension beyond abstract legal principles. The RWSN's submissions were marked by a tone of measured concern, eschewing sensationalism while highlighting the cumulative impact of your conduct on staff wellbeing and store operations. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. The Defendant’s Background and Relevant Personal History Mr H is presently 34 years of age with a documented history of prior theft-related offences, predominantly shoplifting, dating back to 2017. His criminal record reveals multiple convictions, including three previous theft offences for which custodial sentences were alternately suspended or imposed, and a community order breached in 2023. Of note is the pattern of reoffending within a year of each disposal, suggesting recidivism and difficulties in compliance. I acknowledge the defendant’s submissions indicating financial hardship and unstable housing, yet this court must weigh those claims against the evident persistence of offending. The pre-sentence report compiled by Ms Helen Stroud, senior probation officer, provides a comprehensive overview of Mr H’s social circumstances, including current employment status, accommodation history, and familial support networks. It is recorded that the defendant has been unemployed for a protracted period and currently resides in temporary supported accommodation arranged following eviction from prior tenancy due to rent arrears. Attempts by probation and social services to engage Mr H with drug and alcohol rehabilitation provisions have met with limited success, as has encouraging him to enrol in employability programmes. The court must also consider, even if indirectly, the broader systemic environment encompassing resources available for offenders such as Mr H. Derwentshire, much like other similar jurisdictions, is experiencing significant strain on social housing stock, emergency accommodation capacity, and welfare support services. While this context is not determinative, it informs the sentencing matrix, particularly when considering suitable interventions aimed at reducing reoffending and facilitating rehabilitation. The legal representatives have also exchanged standard documentation reflecting the defendant’s prior contact with the criminal justice system, including copies of prior probation documents, letters from community support workers, and pay-as-you-go mobile phone records purporting to evidence attempts to contact employment agencies. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. The Court is mindful that the defendant has maintained inconsistent engagement with service provision throughout the evolving case trajectory. This pattern is not uncommon among individuals with complex social needs exacerbated by underlying mental health vulnerabilities, substance misuse, and entrenched disadvantage. However, it must be noted that mere vulnerability does not equate to excusability in the eyes of the law. It is worth mentioning that Mr H was the subject of a prior community resolution on 14 September 2023 following an incident at a retail outlet in Little Town, whereby he was intercepted attempting to leave the premises without paying for goods. That incident did not prompt immediate prosecution but served as a formal warning with conditions attached, including attendance at a diversionary community programme. Sadly, no meaningful compliance was observed. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. The offences with which you are charged are governed by section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. In the modern sentencing context, the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline (effective 2022) must be applied with due regard to the specific facts and patterns of offending behaviour. The court has noted the introductory remarks in the guideline detailing the importance of distinguishing between straightforward opportunistic theft and systematic or organised acquisitive offending, particularly when selectivity and repeat behaviour indicate a deliberate strategy. The harm caused by persistent retail theft extends beyond financial loss; it undermines community confidence, disrupts commercial viability, and imposes emotional burdens on staff required to enforce shop security measures. The recent Court of Appeal decision in R v. Ellison [2024] EWCA Crim 1842 is instructive here. Though concerned with aggravated theft involving coercive tactics, the judgment emphasised the principle that repeat offending reflecting conscious disregard for prior warnings and sanctions commands a more stringent response. While Mr H's circumstances differ materially, the underlying principle—that the persistence of offending hardened by time and opportunity lessens the scope for leniency—must inform this court’s approach. Similarly, the authority of R v. Mackenzie [2023] EWCA Crim 1390, which upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant convicted of burglaries and associated shoplifting offences amounting to a modus operandi characterised by premeditation and concealment, provides guidance on calibrating culpability and harm even where theft values remain modest individually. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. I am obliged to acknowledge that Mr H entered a late plea of guilty in this matter, shortly before trial listing. The defendant’s counsel invites this court to moderate any sentence accordingly. The Court recognises the well-established principle governing credit reductions for guilty pleas as set forth in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and expounded in numerous appellate decisions. It is, however, also mindful—as in the decision of R v. Hutton [2020] EWCA Crim 678—that credit may be substantially diminished where pleas are tendered only after protracted pre-trial preparation and when witnesses have been required to prepare to give evidence. The court is informed of the procedural history of this case, including several adjournments occasioned by requests for further psychiatric assessment and defence submissions for letters of support, notably from local charities and the defendant’s immediate family. The efforts of the Legal Aid Agency have been, regrettably, subject to delay and procedural complexity. An application for funding to instruct an independent forensic psychologist was submitted on 12 March 2025 but only approved on 2 June after multiple enquiries and resubmissions. Such delays are unwelcome, particularly when they impact access to expert opinion essential to just outcome. I would also note concerns expressed from time to time in court regarding the reduced availability of suitably trained probation officers, owing to recruitment shortfalls and retirement waves. This has practical consequences for the preparation of comprehensive reports and follow-through on community orders, factors inevitably linked to sentencing outcomes. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. The court also mentions, by way of peripheral observation, the regrettable prevalence of co-defendants absent without trace in cases involving similar offence types. It is a feature of area policing that such absences complicate investigative efforts and prejudice victims' expectations of closure. While no such circumstance applies herein, the Court has available recent illustrative jurisprudence concerning co-defendants who have failed to appear. For example, in R v. Bromley [2022] EWCA Crim 923, the defendant's partners in a conspiracy were both absconded, prompting an extended adjournment whilst authorities sought extradition proceedings. Likewise, I note the broader context of related criminal activity sometimes shadowing shoplifting matters but ultimately irrelevant to this case—such as the concerns about possession of bladed articles near schools or gang-related violent offences, of which no suggestion has been made regarding Mr H. The court has considered carefully the submissions of the RWSN and associated retail management representatives. They highlight not only loss of stock but also the chronic stress experienced by frontline retail workers—often young, minimally trained, and performing a role fraught with daily risk. Victim impact statements consistently refrain from exaggeration but convey palpable anxiety and frustration. Some staff members report requiring stress leave, and others taking precautionary measures such as locking certain aisle displays or requesting store transfers. The thematic observations from these statements reinforce the essential truth that the effects of shoplifting offences ripple beyond immediate monetary calculations. There is an attendant moral and psychological harm undermining trust and safety. One must not underestimate the cumulative damage caused by repeat shoplifting incidents, especially where intervention and prevention are viewed skeptically by those charged with enforcement. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. The defendant’s statements to probation and liaison officers, as well as recent forensic psychiatric input, demonstrate a mixed picture: acknowledgement of personal hardship compounded by limited engagement with rehabilitative opportunities. The cognitive-behavioural analysis submitted suggests underlying impulsivity, difficulty in emotional regulation, and episodes of substance misuse. None of these factors, however, justify offending but rather provide a framework for commensurate intervention. The court wishes to place on record its gratitude to Dr Kamal Arora for his thorough psychosocial evaluation, which includes consideration of both mental health and criminogenic need. Dr Arora’s assessment reveals no evidence of major mental illness but delineates personality traits including low frustration tolerance and decision-making deficits. The report emphasises the defendant’s failure to attend previously recommended support services and thereby perpetuating cycles of impulsivity and vulnerability to environmental stressors. Of particular note is the identification of episodes suggestive of mild substance dependence, which, in Dr Arora’s view, could be addressed via targeted intervention. Whilst the report commendably avoids pathologising behaviour and maintains a balanced view, it underscores the importance of structured community-based programmes aimed at reducing reoffending risk. Such interventions could include Cognitive Skills Training, Substance Misuse Services, and financial management assistance. Mr H’s letter to the court, submitted on 8 September 2025, is composed in a legible and measured fashion. It conveys remorse but is tempered by expressions of frustration at life circumstances and perceived systemic failure. This letter, while sincere in tone, must be weighed alongside objective evidential material. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Broader Commentary and Observation on Systemic Context This court is mindful that the pressures on institutions charged with supporting individuals like Mr H have been steadily increasing. Probation service capacity continues to be challenged by recruitment shortfalls, retention issues, and rising caseloads — a point recorded in the recent report by the Ministry of Justice: “Probation Services Capacity and Effectiveness, 2024.” The census of engaged probation officers per 100 offenders is at its lowest recorded level. Equally, mental health services are often beset by extended waiting times and stretched resources, constraining timely access to care. It is appropriate to note the tireless efforts of voluntary sector organisations such as the Derwentshire Outreach Network and Hope at Hand, who act as invaluable adjuncts to formal services, frequently bridging gaps left by funding shortfalls. Their input in providing letters of support and facilitating engagement opportunities is gratefully received, yet unequivocally insufficient to address systemic deficits. There is, regrettably, a tendency in public discourse to trivialise acquisitive crime or dismiss it as ‘victimless’—a misconception refuted by the realities documented here. The cumulative burden on small businesses, often already struggling in a rapidly changing retail environment, is severe. The closure of local shops, reduced staffing, and increased security costs are tangible consequences of the type of offending pattern exhibited in this case. While society’s responses must avoid conflating poverty with criminality, the law remains unequivocal in holding individuals accountable for deliberate breaches of its rules. The twin aims of sentencing—punishment and rehabilitation—must be achieved without compromise to public protection. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, claimed it wasn’t a serious crime and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. This hearing having been conducted in open court, with all parties present and represented—Ms Helena Marwick for the Crown and Mr Ian Pollard for the defence under Legal Aid provisions—I commend their submissions and professional conduct throughout these proceedings. I am constrained to remark upon the persistent challenges facing practitioners, agencies, and the court itself in securing timely access to appropriate expert reports. The delays occasioned by protracted Legal Aid grant processes, while not unique to this case, remain a source of frustration. It is to be hoped that ongoing reforms addressed by the Ministry and Legal Aid Agency will ameliorate these systemic shortcomings and enable more efficient administration of justice. I shall adjourn sentencing to allow a comprehensive pre-sentence report to be prepared. This report should incorporate a full risk assessment, consider the defendant’s prospects for engagement with rehabilitative services, and include proposals for any community-based requirements and interventions that may be appropriate, including a consideration of unpaid work as a component of any custodial or community sentence. The report should also include a consideration of public safety, likelihood of reoffending, and any protective factors demonstrated by Mr H. The court requires a measured and thorough analysis to inform the delicate balancing act sentencing demands in a case of this nature, where mitigation and societal protection must be weighed with equal care. These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge D. P. Bains, issued this 15th day of September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Derwentshire. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal the sentence once passed, within 28 days, under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HAYES R v. MR H Case No. H2025/05420 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. B. MERCER Filed: 16 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following a conviction by way of a guilty plea to an offence of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending charged and proved represents a persistent pattern of shoplifting spanning a period from early 2024 through to the spring of this year. The offences occurred in multiple commercial locations within the borough of Hillingdon and its environs, primarily targeting small-scale retail businesses including convenience stores and independent pharmacies. Procedural History This matter was first listed at the Magistrates’ Court on 5 July 2025, after you were arrested on 23 June 2025, pursuant to investigations undertaken by Hillingdon Borough Command of the Metropolitan Police Service in conjunction with the local Retail Crime Partnership (RCP). The case was swiftly transferred to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme designed to expedite the progression of cases requiring more detailed directions and pre-sentence evaluation. I note that the plea and trial preparation hearing was initially scheduled for 18 August 2025, at which stage you entered an equivocal plea of not guilty, before changing to a plea of guilty on the morning of trial on 10 September 2025. The initial period of delay prior to entering the plea was largely attributable to requests from the defence for the instruction of a forensic forensic psychologist with recognised expertise in the assessment of recurrent acquisitive offending and the impact of socio-economic stressors on offending behaviour. Those applications required authorisation through the Legal Aid Agency, whose procedural inefficiencies undoubtedly contributed to prolonged delays in obtaining relevant expert opinion. The court notes with regret that similar delays in the commissioning of reports from the NHS and independent providers continue to place undue strain upon the timely administration of justice, particularly in cases involving vulnerable defendants. It is a matter of record that the court was assisted by a comprehensive probation report prepared by Mr George Jennings, probation officer, whose detailed account of your background, criminogenic needs, and recent engagement with voluntary support services has significantly informed the court’s understanding of your circumstances. Additionally, a psychiatric assessment by Dr Hannah O’Neill, consultant psychiatrist, was admitted, providing further insight into mental health considerations which, while not absolving responsibility, warrant careful attention in the formulation of sentence. It is pertinent at this juncture to observe some systemic pressures affecting the agencies involved. The probation service in Hillingdon, whilst making commendable efforts in the facilitation of offender management and rehabilitation, faces notable staffing shortages, with a turnover rate exceeding 25% in the past year. This inevitably impacts the availability of timely pre-sentence reports and ongoing supervision. Likewise, the Retail Crime Partnership is operating with significantly reduced funding following a recent withdrawal of corporate sponsorship, limiting its capacity for enhanced surveillance and victim support initiatives. Nonetheless, representations from local business owners submitted to this court testify to their continued resolve, despite these constraints, to mitigate the economic and psychological impact of repeat offenders on the high street. The offence of theft pursuant to the Theft Act 1968 is well-established in statute and common law. The offence defined by section 1 requires proof of dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. In determining sentence, the court is guided by the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline for Theft Offences (published April 2012, updated 2023), which distinguishes between single incidents and sustained courses of conduct, placing emphasis on factors such as premeditation, planning, the value of stolen goods, vulnerability of victims, and use of threats or coercion. While the present case does not involve violence or threats, the deliberate and repetitive nature of the offending over months necessitates a proportionate response. In particular, I take note of the precedent established in R v. Moss [2019] EWCA Crim 305, where the court upheld a sentence of 10 months’ custody for an individual who committed multiple shoplifting offences over an extended period, characterised by the use of concealment devices and repeated returns to affected shops. The Court of Appeal emphasised that although each individual theft may have involved low monetary value, the persistence and disrespect for community welfare warranted a custodial sentence. Similarly, R v. Calderon [2022] EWCA Crim 1428 is instructive. In Calderon, the offender was convicted of a series of retail thefts involving sophisticated methods of concealment and distraction, with consequent adverse impacts on staff morale and business viability. The appellate court stressed that low-level but sustained offending should not be underestimated in terms of its cumulative harm and effect on public confidence in retail environments. The decision reinforces the principle that sentencing must both reflect the seriousness of the overall pattern and act as a deterrent. It is also appropriate to record reference to R v. Baines [2020] EWCA Crim 613, in which the sentencing judge imposed a community order with a substantial unpaid work element for a first-time offender engaged in shoplifting resulting from a moment of economic desperation. The court acknowledged mitigating circumstances, including early plea and acceptance of responsibility. That case is distinguishable from the present circumstances in that it involved a discrete act with immediate guilty plea and demonstrable engagement with support services. Additionally, R v. Khan [2018] EWCA Crim 1022 concerned a defendant charged with aggravated burglary, who was sentenced to a custodial term reflecting the aggravated nature of the intrusion and threat to personal safety for occupants. While unrelated in terms of offence type, the case is a reminder that custodial sentences serve not only to punish but also to protect the public from serious criminal conduct. It is within this legal and policy framework that I proceed to assess the facts and circumstances of the present matter. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. To provide context, it is necessary to acknowledge some of the operational challenges faced by retail business proprietors in the Hillingdon area over recent years. Persistent issues around security funding, employee turnover, and the diversion of police resources towards more serious crime have at times left smaller shops vulnerable to opportunistic theft. The economic squeeze facing independent retailers—already burdened by rising costs, reduced footfall, and the impact of online competitors—has been exacerbated by repeated shrinkage from shoplifting. Such factors have implications beyond immediate financial loss, including the wellbeing of staff and ongoing business viability, which further underscore the seriousness with which the court must treat offences of this nature. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. It bears observation that none of the incidents in this case involved violence or coercion towards staff or customers. However, as established by authority and parliamentary guidance, the absence of physical aggression does not diminish the offence’s gravity where repeated breaches erode confidence and cause distress. This is rightly acknowledged by the Retail Crime Partnership in its correspondence dated 12 August 2025, which emphasises the psychological toll upon employees, including reports of anxiety, disrupted shift patterns, and a diminished sense of workplace safety. Alongside the police, numerous voluntary sector agencies have attempted to engage with you to address underlying causes of offending, including financial hardship and psychosocial stressors. The West London Community Trust, a non-governmental organisation specialising in offender rehabilitation and housing support, provided written submissions outlining attempts to establish contact, support access to benefits, and facilitate attendance at counselling sessions. Despite these efforts, engagement has been partial and inconsistent. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. It is worthwhile at this point to mention that your case was somewhat complicated by initial identification difficulties. Forensic retrieval of surveillance footage was hampered by poor lighting and low-quality cameras in certain premises. The timely intervention of the multi-agency Crime Reduction Unit, however, enabled enhanced collation of evidence. The court extends its thanks to the unit, which continues to operate under significant operational constraints due to budget cuts and redeployment. Such units are critical in providing the exacting evidential standards necessary for prosecution, particularly in cases where circumstantial or indirect evidence may be subject to challenge. It is pertinent to observe that on one occasion, separate from the offences charged against you, there was an incident involving a co-defendant, Mr A. Smith, who assaulted store security personnel with a chair during an attempted arrest following a break-in in a neighbouring borough. Mr Smith’s conduct, including damage to property and assaults on officers, forms no part of your factual matrix but is noted here for the completeness of the court record. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. Prior to your arrest, you had been the subject of a community resolution scheme administered by Hillingdon Police in November 2024 for an unrelated allegation of possession of a bladed article in a school car park. That matter was dealt with without prosecution, subject to a warning and referral to youth offending services. No further offences of that nature or involving weapons have been associated with you or your immediate associations. It is also noted that a sibling of yours, currently subject to unrelated criminal proceedings in the Magistrates' Court for benefit fraud, has no direct bearing upon your case. Your family circumstances have been explored insofar as they bear upon any mitigating factors and are reflected in the pre-sentence report. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. The cumulative harm arising from your offending is reflected not only in the financial losses attributable to stolen stock but also in heightened anxiety and operational disruption to the affected businesses. In their letters submitted to this court, several proprietors speak of lost income, revised staffing rotas, and a consequent unwillingness to undertake new employment commitments. The Retail Support and Recovery Network has also provided a statement outlining systemic trends in repeat thefts and the flow-on effects for small businesses reliant on thin profit margins. Such impacts, while not of immediate physical harm, represent genuine societal and economic detriments. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. Dr Hannah O’Neill’s psychiatric evaluation concluded, upon examination, that you do not suffer from any enduring mental illness warranting a finding of diminished responsibility or unfitness to plead. However, she noted traits consistent with chronic stress related to financial instability and moderate depressive symptomatology. There is no indication of psychosis, personality disorder, or severe substance misuse, although the latter was considered as a contributory factor by the probation officer based on your self-reported history. Risk evaluation placed you in a medium-risk category for reoffending, primarily due to the lack of sustained engagement with interventions and the persistence of basic criminogenic needs. The report underscores the pressing need for structured supervision and support in addressing impulsivity and situational triggers for offending. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The pre-sentence report by Mr George Jennings provides a detailed background, confirming your current residence in temporary accommodation provided through the Hillingdon Borough Housing Department. It records your recent unemployment status and the absence of steady income, along with limited family support. The report also notes your expressed intention to seek employment and engage with financial management services, though these ambitions have yet to translate into concrete action. Mr Jennings comments on the importance of community-based interventions and the court’s consideration of possible rehabilitative pathways in preference to custodial sentences where appropriate. He highlights your willingness to comply with court directions and acknowledges your expressed remorse. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. Reference should also be made to the longstanding difficulties faced by the National Health Service in meeting demands for mental health services. Waiting lists for non-urgent referrals routinely exceed six months in many parts of Greater London, including Hillingdon. These systemic pressures add further complexity to cases involving defendants with psychosocial vulnerabilities. It is not the function of this court to comment at length on health policy; nevertheless, such realities form part of the wider landscape in which justice is administered. Public service agencies, including Probation, NHS Mental Health Trusts, and social housing providers, are increasingly expected to collaborate effectively under multi-agency risk assessment conferences (MARAC) and multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA). In your case, no current MAPPA referral has been made, reflecting the absence of serious risk indicators. Nonetheless, the coordination of support remains essential for reducing recidivism. In relation to the administration of Legal Aid, this court notes with continued concern the endemic delays in the authorisation of funding for expert reports and specialist representation. The Legal Aid Agency’s correspondence lodged demonstrates that there was a delay of some six weeks before approval was granted for the instruction of Dr O’Neill, despite repeated liaison from your solicitor, Mr Piers Richardson. These delays compound pressures on the courts and risk undermining defendants’ rights to timely and effective representation. There is a further procedural note: an interpreter was required for a family member visiting the court on behalf of the defence but arrived late, delaying the listing on two occasions. The court expresses appreciation for the professionalism of the court usher and clerks in managing these disruptions while maintaining a calm and orderly environment for proceedings. The courtroom itself was recently refurbished with improved access facilities and updated security screening technology, reflecting ongoing investment in the infrastructure supporting the hearing of cases. Although there are no direct individual victims identifiable by name, the businesses affected have collectively articulated the significance of the offence. Letters from several retailers describe the burdens imposed by repeat offending, including costs of replacement stock, installation of enhanced security measures, and turnover of staff unwilling to remain in roles associated with frequent conflict or theft. The Retail Support and Recovery Network emphasises that such offending, while superficially minor in financial terms, contributes cumulatively to broader economic fragility in local high streets. This has knock-on effects on employment, community vibrancy, and public confidence in the safety of local shopping environments. The court is acutely aware that no prosecution takes place in isolation of its social milieu. The gradual erosion of trust in public order institutions, the staggering rise in street homelessness particularly in West London areas, and the normalisation of antisocial behaviour all constitute background factors that shape judicial response. Nonetheless, sentencing must remain focused on the individual defendant, weighing personal circumstances against the public interest. In light of all the above, I find that the offence must be regarded as one of moderate to significant seriousness, given its repeated and planned nature, the economic and psychological impact on local businesses, and your prior contact with the justice system. While the late plea of guilty is noted, reflecting some acceptance of responsibility, it came only after an evidential case of considerable strength had been assembled and communicated to the defence. Accordingly, the credit for mitigation of sentence on this basis is limited. The principles set down in R v. Hooper [2016] EWCA Crim 385, concerning the cautious approach to deferred pleas, are applicable. Mitigating factors include your expressed remorse, partial cooperation, and the absence of antecedents involving violence or serious harm. Your current engagement with probation services and some willingness to access support services are positive markers, albeit fragile. Custodial sentence remains a possibility given the pattern of offending and previous interventions, including community resolutions and warnings, have failed to deter you. However, the court must balance deterrence and punishment with the prospect of rehabilitation and public protection, taking into account the constraints imposed by structural factors such as housing insecurity and mental health. I therefore direct the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report with a focus on identifying realistic and structured community-based interventions potentially suitable for you. These may include cognitive-behavioural programmes targeting acquisitive behaviour, financial management assistance, and an activity requirement promoting community cohesion. Such options, if viable, would serve both your interests and those of society. It is emphasised that failure to engage with such programmes, should sentence permit, will be viewed seriously upon any future proceedings. Acknowledgments & Conclusion I acknowledge the work of Ms Jessica Thornton for the Crown and Mr Piers Richardson for the defence, both of whom presented their submissions with appropriate professionalism and clarity under challenging conditions. This case provides a clear illustration of the incremental strain placed on public services—law enforcement, the courts, probation, health, and charitable sectors—in managing what might superficially appear as low-level crime but in reality constitutes an enduring threat to community stability. It is hoped that your forthcoming engagement with support services will provide a pathway away from reoffending. The court is mindful that sustainable change requires more than admonition; it demands coordinated effort and personal commitment. Your opportunity to demonstrate such commitment will be the subject of the forthcoming sentencing hearing. I therefore adjourn sentence to allow for consideration of the pre-sentence report and any further representations. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2025, from Court 5 at Hayes Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Formal judgment and sentence will follow upon receipt of the pre-sentence report. You are reminded of your right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply in this matter unless otherwise ordered. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. Mr H Case No. B2025/14489 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge C. M. Langford Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence on a charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct is characterised by a sustained pattern of repeated thefts committed over a period of some fifteen months across several retail outlets within the Greater Bristol area. The indictment before the court is a representative count reflecting that course of conduct rather than isolated incidents. Procedural History The matter commenced with your arrest on 18 May 2025, following an extensive enquiry led by the Bristol City Police’s Retail Crime Unit in conjunction with the South West Theft Reduction Partnership. That investigation was prompted by multiple reports from shopkeepers who had independently logged instances of theft involving a male with your description. As so often occurs in similar investigations, it took considerable effort to collate CCTV footage, liaise with retail management across geographically dispersed venues, and analyse stock discrepancy reports. The enterprise was further complicated by the diverse range of locations targeted, straddling multiple local authority wards and police divisions. It has been observed — rightly — that the challenges faced in prosecuting theft offences, especially those of a low-value yet persistent nature, extend beyond the immediate factual matrix. Forensic identification of a defendant is often reliant on partial or blurred images from surveillance systems, frequently compounded by rudimentary timestamping errors, glare or shadow, and inconsistent camera coverage. The process demands the undivided attention of officers and analysts, often for weeks or months, to build an evidential picture with the coherence necessary for charging decisions and, ultimately, trial preparation. Such is the nature of modern policing in this domain. You were first interviewed under caution on 22 May 2025, at which time you denied involvement with the allegations. However, items seized during a search of your residence included products corresponding to those taken in a number of the offences, and comparative analysis of clothing worn in footage correlated strongly with your wardrobe. A detailed indictment was authorised on 30 June 2025, consolidating multiple incidents to a single representative charge. The case has been progressed under the Better Case Management (BCM) process—a framework designed to promote early identification of issues, timely disclosure, and efficient listing of plea and trial preparation hearings. I note that, in this instance, the prosecution, defence, and court administration have adhered closely to the timeframes envisioned under this model. Despite this adherence, the court cannot ignore the strains placed upon limited judicial and ancillary resources by the cumulative effect of such cases. The time allocated to routine listing, disclosure vetting, and preparation disproportionately impacts the availability of the court for more serious trials. Nonetheless, the Crown’s commitment to thorough preparation and disclosure compliance is acknowledged with appreciation. The plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 5 August 2025. At that point you elected to enter a not guilty plea. The case was listed for trial on 10 September 2025. However, on the morning of trial you offered a guilty plea. Such late admissions of culpability are recognised within established jurisprudence as meriting diminished credit, with the rationale that genuine remorse and avoidance of trial preparation costs are undermined when pleas are deferred until conviction is assured. As expressed in the landmark decision of R v. Hainsworth [2019] EWCA Crim 1420, the court observed that a guilty plea entered at the earliest reasonable moment assists the administration of justice and engenders appropriate mitigation; conversely, those offered at the last moment, though not to be unduly penalised, must be viewed with measured discretion. Similar principles were reinforced in R v. Cremona [2020] EWCA Crim 367, a case concerning multiple counts of theft involving a ring operating intrinsic to retail theft by proxy. There, the Court of Appeal held that late pleas relating to protracted and complicated offences could not attract the immediacy credit customarily extended to early guilty pleas—in no small measure due to the disruption and anxiety caused to witnesses and victims. Although the facts of Cremona lie at the higher end of the offending spectrum, the underpinning rationale informs sentencing in offences of this type. It is timely to reflect on some related case law that, while not directly bearing upon your conduct, offers broader context on sentencing for acquisitive crime in the current climate. In R v. Bexley [2021] EWCA Crim 873, an appellate judgment concerning aggravated burglary, the sentencing judge’s approach to proportionality in light of victims’ psychological trauma was carefully delineated. The Court highlighted the often overlooked but substantial impact of property crime upon community confidence and individual well-being. Although the offence in Bexley was of a more serious character, the principle that the harm caused by property crime transcends mere financial loss remains apposite. Likewise, the decision in R v. Armfield [2022] EWCA Crim 1212 dealt with offences of fly-tipping in protected green belt zones. The judgment emphasised that cumulative environmental harm and indiscriminate flouting of regulatory compliance may warrant sentences of significant severity. Whilst not germane to the present matter, it serves as a salutary reminder of societal expectations attaching to lawful behaviour in all domains. Of procedural note, this case was briefly delayed in June 2025 due to a scheduling conflict arising from industrial action taken by court clerks in the Bristol Crown Court registry. Such occurrences, while regrettable, reflect systemic challenges presently facing the administration of justice nationwide, where staffing shortages and increased workload pressures undermine the timely progression of cases. The court acknowledges the patience and professionalism displayed by all parties during this interval. The role of the Legal Aid Agency warrants mention. Defense representation was granted under the standard scheme, with Mr Andrew Dobson instructing on your behalf. An application for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist was submitted on 9 July 2025 but encountered procedural delays, only receiving approval on 3 August 2025. These bureaucratic impediments regrettably truncated the timeframe in which expert input could be obtained prior to the plea and trial preparation hearing. Such patterns of delay have been the subject of parliamentary scrutiny, most notably during the Justice Committee’s 2024 inquiry into criminal legal aid reforms, which underscored the adverse repercussions on defendants' rights and court listing efficiency. It is also prudent to recognise the involvement of voluntary agencies throughout your proceedings. The Bristol Shopworker Support Network provided victim impact statements expressing measured concern at the effects of repeated theft on staff morale and security. Their carefully considered reports avoid alarmism, instead detailing the practical consequences borne by employees compelled to modify working practices and contend with elevated stress. The North Bristol Community Partnership, working with local retailers, has endeavoured to implement preventative measures yet report recurrent challenges in resource allocation and inter-agency co-ordination. The court commends their ongoing vigilance. In cases of repeat low-level acquisitive offending, the court often hears submissions regarding socio-economic determinants purportedly underlying the conduct in question. It is an unfortunate reality that homelessness, unemployment, and social exclusion are prevalent background constellations for many charged with such offences. Nevertheless, as emphasised in R v. Ghosh [2023] EWCA Crim 45, personal accountability and the maintenance of societal norms remain paramount. Courts must balance compassion with deterrence, rehabilitative opportunity with public protection. The need to preserve retail spaces as safe and welcoming environments cannot be overstated. An assessment of recent probation service capacity must be made. The region is experiencing significant difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified officers, hampering probation's ability to conduct comprehensive pre-sentence reports and deliver effective supervision. These systemic pressures echo nationally and have been noted in successive Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation reports. Despite these obstacles, the Hampshire Probation Delivery Unit undertook to provide a report attentive to your circumstances and risk. I anticipate that the forthcoming pre-sentence report will identify appropriate pathways for engagement and address any underlying contributory factors. The working conditions of retail workers, and the challenges they face, are particularly salient. Nationally, shopworkers are estimated to suffer tens of thousands of incidents per year of violence or threat of violence, many linked directly or indirectly to theft and other acquisitive crimes. The ongoing pandemic has exacerbated tensions, with staffing shortages and heightened anxieties compounding vulnerabilities. The criminal justice system’s response to such offending seeks to uphold public confidence and protect those at the frontline. Turning now to mental health considerations, the report authored by Dr Fiona Martin, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 29 August 2025, provides valuable insight. Dr Martin notes that while you do not meet criteria for formal psychiatric diagnosis, there are indications of borderline personality traits marked by emotional dysregulation and impulsiveness. These features ought not be conflated with mitigation but may inform the design of rehabilitative interventions. The report further notes your failure to access available local mental health services despite multiple referrals by probation. The NHS Bristol Community Mental Health Team, operating under the constraints of a long waiting list, acknowledges the challenges posed by fluctuating patient engagement levels. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. Your age is 34. You have an extensive record of prior convictions, including four previous entries relating to theft offences, and two for public order offences dating from your late teens. Your history reveals a pattern of transient accommodation instability, including documented periods of sofa surfing and temporary hostel residence. Correspondence from the Bristol Housing Support Network, included in defence submissions, illustrates the recurrent nature of your housing challenges. Nevertheless, there is no indication of coercion or gang involvement. The conduct appears to be self-initiated and deliberate. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. It is common in such matters to encounter assertions of familial difficulties as causal explanations. Indeed, your defence counsel has submitted a letter from your sister, Ms Lydia H., describing a challenging upbringing characterised by parental separation, economic hardship, and occasional domestic disputes. While such context is of undeniable human interest, the law does not absolve responsibility on the basis of childhood adversity alone. It is a well-trodden maxim that 'past is prologue' but not destiny. Courts will consider such factors in mitigation insofar as they bear upon culpability and prospects for rehabilitation, but they can neither excuse nor exonerate. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. The facts as presented by the prosecution reveal a modus operandi involving the selection of specific retail outlets, generally smaller supermarkets and convenience stores, with limited security staffing and often situated in neighbourhoods experiencing elevated crime rates. You often utilised layered clothing and carried bags or rucksacks which concealed stolen items. On a number of occasions, you were observed engaging in distraction tactics aimed at diverting staff attention while removing goods from shelves or self-service tills. It is precisely this calculated approach that distinguishes the offending from opportunistic or impulsive theft. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. Your appeal to financial difficulties — including inconsistent engagement with employment support programmes and rejection of debt advice services offered by local charities such as Money Matters Bristol — is noted. The court does not discount the real hardships faced by those in precarious economic situations; however, the persistence of offending despite offers of assistance weakens the persuasive value of such mitigation. The message borne out of this case is that economic strain, while undeniably problematic, rarely justifies criminal conduct. In considering the propriety of sentencing options, I have had due regard to the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft and dishonesty offences. This guideline emphasises the gravity of offending that is repeated, planned, and where the impact on victims and communities is demonstrable. While the monetary value of items stolen in each incident may be modest, the aggregate effect is significant, not only financially but in terms of emotional and psychological impact upon retail workers. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. A notable feature is your recidivism despite prior community-based disposals, including a Conditional Caution issued on 12 March 2024. Unfortunately, the efficacy of such interventions was limited as you recommenced offending within two months. This must weigh heavily against you as an aggravating factor. Similarly, the existence of multiple previous convictions indicates a pattern unamenable to less robust measures. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. Before sentencing, this court must acknowledge the broader public safety implications of persistent acquisitive offending such as this. Although the offences do not involve violence or weapons, they contribute to a cumulative sense of disorder and insecurity within affected neighbourhoods. Moreover, each instance deflects police and judicial resources away from more serious matters, a consequence frequently lamented by law enforcement agencies. The operational challenge of balancing demands from acquisitive crime with rising reports of organised violence and child exploitation remains acute. In the case of R v. Thackeray [2022] EWCA Crim 1247, the Court of Appeal emphasised that persistent petty crime, particularly when resistant to intervention, justified firm penalties to protect the public interest and uphold social norms. While your circumstances differ, the principle that offending must carry commensurate consequences retains clear force. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. At this stage, while there are personal and contextual elements warranting consideration, the weight of aggravating factors compels a sentencing approach that conveys an unequivocal message of deterrence. Sentences must be proportionate but must also underscore the serious consequences of continued dishonesty and breach of trust within the community. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. It is anticipated that the Probation Service will undertake a comprehensive pre-sentence report with particular attention to suitability for structured community supervision, cognitive behavioural frameworks addressing offending behaviour, and support concerning impulsivity and financial management. Given the psychiatric assessment, referral to mental health liaison services and support for emotional regulation may be recommended. The report should also provide insight into accommodation stability and familial support networks. Formal sentencing will be deferred pending receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report, and any further submissions. I wish to record my thanks to the representatives appearing today: Ms Zara Collins for the Crown, for her thorough and professional conduct of the prosecution case, and Mr Andrew Dobson, who appears for the defence pursuant to a Legal Aid representation order. I must, however, express concerns regarding the continuing difficulties encountered in obtaining timely funding and authorisation for the instruction of expert witnesses. Though the Legal Aid Agency ultimately granted permission for the psychiatric assessment, the delay had inevitable knock-on effects for case progression. This cumulative erosion of administrative efficiency represents a systemic challenge warranting urgent remedial attention. I also take this opportunity to recognise the efforts of court staff and ushers in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court, who have managed proceedings with patience and professionalism despite recent infrastructural refurbishment and intermittent IT outages affecting digital case bundles. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be submitted to the relevant authorities for administrative registration. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days of any subsequent sentence pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Unless otherwise ordered, no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. No order as to costs is made at this stage. Sentencing is adjourned pending preparation and receipt of a pre-sentence report. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT KENSINGTON R v. MR H Case No. T2026/00458 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. L. Fairborne Filed: 17 September 2026 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence in respect of a charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to a series of shoplifting incidents that occurred over an extended period within the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea and parts of Westminster. The allegations cover multiple thefts involving goods from a variety of retail outlets, including pharmacies and convenience stores, and raise significant concerns about the cumulative disruption caused to local businesses and their employees. Procedural History You were first apprehended on 12 June 2026 following investigative work by the Metropolitan Police’s Sterling District CID and the Kensington Business Crime Forum—a regional partnership aimed at combatting retail theft and related issues. The investigation drew upon a synthesis of intelligence reports, CCTV surveillance from multiple premises, and coordination with retail loss prevention officers. Notably, this enquiry also entailed collaboration with the London Retail Analyst Unit, whose crime pattern analysis sought to isolate and identify recurrent offenders. These efforts culminated in your arrest and subsequent caution under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Such multi-agency cooperation, while commendable, also serves as a reminder of the significant administrative load placed upon law enforcement and retail entities. The process of evidentiary collation—especially in offences burdened by minor monetary values—can be exhaustively painstaking, reliant on voluntary witness cooperation and technological interpretation of variable CCTV quality. It is a testament to the perseverance of these bodies that, despite limited resources and often competing priorities, cases such as this proceed to prosecution in a reasonably timely fashion. Following your initial interview, you were charged on 26 June 2026 with a consolidated offence representing multiple shoplifting episodes spanning the previous eighteen months. The case was allocated to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management protocol, a procedural architecture designed to streamline pre-trial timelines and enhance judicial oversight. The plea and trial preparation hearing was initially listed for 21 July 2026 but was adjourned at the defence’s request to secure psychiatric evaluation and additional witness statements. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the statutory touchstone for offences of dishonesty involving appropriation of property. While low-level retail theft may sometimes be appropriately handled summarily, a pattern of repeat offending within a community setting necessarily attracts proportionate judicial scrutiny reflecting the aggravations attendant upon such conduct. In addition to statute, this court must also engage with the Sentencing Council’s guidelines on theft-related offending, which underscore the weight to be given to features such as persistence, targeting of vulnerable premises, the psychological impact on staff, and the degree of sophistication or planning evinced by the offender. Of particular pertinence is the approach articulated in R v Goldberg [2014] EWCA Crim 1584, where the Court of Appeal affirmed that a sustained course of theft from multiple premises, even where each individual act involved relatively low-value goods, can justify custodial sentences, particularly where previous interventions have failed. Similarly, R v Thomas [2019] EWCA Crim 921, a case involving repeat shoplifting from community pharmacies, recognised the compounded harm caused by undermining staff confidence and operational disruption. Although no violence was involved, the Court noted the cumulative psychological toll on retail employees and the broader community impact as key considerations in sentencing. Conversely, R v Jennings [2017] EWCA Crim 431 established the principle that late guilty pleas, particularly when entered after contested pre-trial proceedings, attract reduced—and sometimes minimal—discounts during sentencing, owing to the added burden and costs imposed on victims, witnesses, and the court system. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. The facts, as drawn from a combination of surveillance footage, witness testimony, and forensic evidence, reveal a calculated pattern of behaviour, employing a range of diversionary tactics and concealment methods. On several occasions, you were observed interacting with staff in a manner designed to deflect suspicion, including feigning phone conversations or engaging in apparently benign exchanges. This conduct reflects a degree of sophistication and forethought. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. You were seen selecting high-demand items, notably over-the-counter medications and personal care products, often at times coinciding with busy periods or shift changes. One particular incident, noted on 4 February 2026, involved the removal of multiple hygiene products from a high-footfall pharmacy during a luncheon hour, demonstrating brazen disregard for the presence of customers and staff. On that occasion, a witness briefly attempted to intervene but was deterred by your assertive demeanour. The procedural context of this matter is instructive. The delay in advancing the case to trial can largely be attributed to complexities surrounding Legal Aid coverage for psychiatric assessment, which took longer than anticipated due to administrative backlogs within the Legal Aid Agency. This regrettable delay underscores systemic challenges faced by courts and defence practitioners alike, particularly in securing timely authorization for expert evidence when a defendant’s mental health is a factor under consideration. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. The court has received and carefully considered reports from Dr Hannah Marques, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence. Dr Marques’ assessment acknowledges a diagnosis of moderate depression and identifies personality traits suggestive of impulsive behaviour and emotional dysregulation. However, she is clear that there was no evidence of a severe enduring mental disorder that would substantially impair your criminal responsibility at the time of the offences. She further highlights the absence of prior psychiatric treatment and emphasizes a level of disengagement with available mental health services. This raises concern about the systemic barriers faced by individuals experiencing psychological distress yet reluctant or unable to access assistance—a persistent theme in cases of recurring acquisitive offending. The court’s own experience with mental health referrals in acquisitive crime cases corroborates the difficulties in addressing overlapping vulnerabilities. Recent research from the National Mental Health Justice Project continues to highlight the gaps between service provision and the practical realities for defendants caught at the intersection of criminality and unmet health needs. Somewhat tangentially, the case of R v Staines [2021] EWCA Crim 1140 is instructive regarding the balance to be struck between acknowledging mental health difficulties and ensuring public protection. In that case, the court affirmed the appropriateness of custodial sentencing where a defendant’s disorder did not effectively mitigate culpability for offences causing direct risk of harm in the community. Further complicating the landscape is the ongoing resource deficit within probation services. The National Probation Service continues to face workforce shortages, which impedes timely preparation of pre-sentence reports and limits opportunities for meaningful engagement with offenders prior to court. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. Victim impact statements submitted by store managers provide insight into the real-world effect of your actions. Several staff expressed heightened anxiety and diminished morale, leading to changes in work patterns including the shoring up of security measures and alterations to shift scheduling. One manager detailed how the persistent thefts prompted a review of staffing levels in which additional resource allocation was deemed necessary at significant operational cost. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. Sentencing must take account of these consequences, which extend beyond tangible financial loss. The emotional and psychological burden borne by retail employees in the face of repeated offending merits no less consideration, especially where vulnerable or lone-working staff feel exposed or intimidated. The sentencing framework articulated in the Theft Offences guideline rightly emphasises that harm to victims encompasses both economic and emotional elements. As noted in R v Patel [2020] EWCA Crim 748, the distress and disruption caused to staff by repeat shoplifting cannot be lightly dismissed. This court also recognises the supportive submissions made on your behalf by representatives of StreetAid, a local charitable organisation providing outreach and support for individuals experiencing homelessness and financial instability. Their witness statement illuminates the broader social context in which your offending took place, including the pressures of insecure housing and chronic unemployment. While such factors contextualise behaviour, they do not excuse it. It remains the responsibility of all individuals to refrain from criminal conduct regardless of personal hardship. The court is mindful that many similarly disadvantaged persons engage constructively with support services without resort to unlawful acts. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. It is noteworthy that despite prior warnings, a community resolution, and referrals to diversion programmes, you resumed the offending behaviour after brief cessation periods. This relapse pattern signals a degree of resistance to intervention and raises questions about the viability of rehabilitative approach without judicially imposed conditions. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The Crown, represented by Ms Jenny Prescott, has made clear their position that while remorse is acknowledged, the late entry of your guilty plea reduces the credit that may be afforded. Defence counsel, Mr Russell Crow, has urged the court to consider your personal circumstances and the mitigating effect of your mental health history. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. Before addressing sentencing considerations, it is pertinent to record several procedural and contextual observations. The court notes with gratitude the clear and well-substantiated submissions made by both counsel which have materially assisted in clarifying contested issues. The case management has proceeded comparatively smoothly, notwithstanding the challenges in securing timely psychiatric evidence and the complexity of co-ordinating multi-jurisdictional evidence collation. It is also appropriate to place on record the valued contributions of the Kensington Retail Support Service, who have maintained engagement with the affected businesses and contributed to victim impact reporting. While their resources are inevitably stretched, their role is integral to the restorative measures ongoing in the community. To digress briefly, this court has noted a series of prosecutions recently involving co-defendants of various sorts including individuals charged with fly-tipping of commercial waste, affray in licensed premises, and even a redress of cases involving online fraud schemes unrelated to the current matter. These cases, while procedurally distinct, exemplify the growing administrative pressure faced by our justice system. The capacity of investigative units is further compromised by the diversion of forensic digital analysts towards cybercrime enquiries and complex organised crime investigations, leaving less specialist resource available for acquisitive crime follow-up. Combined with staffing shortfalls in probation and court administration, these factors contribute to case delays and highlight the fragility of systems underpinning public protection. A further albeit tangential case involved the tenant of your residential complex, who faced unrelated proceedings for breach of anti-social behaviour orders issued following noise complaints. While not pertinent to your conduct, this illustrates the multi-faceted challenges faced by local authority housing officers in managing diverse tenancy issues alongside criminal investigations. Returning to the matter at hand, the court must articulate a proportionate sentencing response that reflects the seriousness of the offending, addresses public protection, provides appropriate punishment, and encourages rehabilitation. Your record shows four prior convictions, all related to theft offences. The multiplicity and pattern of your offending suggest an entrenched course which has not been deterred by previous interventions. The economic impact, while modest individually, aggregates into a significant loss, compounding the undermining of retail confidence. Mitigation includes your expressed remorse, as manifested in your belated guilty plea, and the acknowledged contribution of mental health difficulties. Nonetheless, the late timing of the plea necessarily limits credit in accordance with established principles. It is noted that the Sentencing Council’s guidelines allow for community orders incorporating unpaid work and rehabilitation activity requirements, particularly where the court considers that such measures offer realistic prospects for reform. The pre-sentence report will be essential in assessing your suitability for such interventions and the level of risk you may present. Given the chronic nature of your offending and the impact on victims, this court is predisposed to consider a custodial sentence of determinate length as appropriate, but remains open to representations based on probation input and further expert assessments. The matter was previously listed for sentence on 9 September 2026 but was adjourned to allow for receipt of reports and the latest psychiatric evaluation. I thank both Ms Prescott and Mr Crow for their professional conduct throughout and acknowledge the contributions of probation officer Ms Lorna Dunne, whose initial briefing was instructive. I also note for the record the court’s awareness of systemic delays within the Legal Aid Agency, which have affected timely instruction of experts in this jurisdiction and continue to affect timely justice delivery. Sentencing remarks such as these are issued this day, 17 September 2026, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Kensington. The hearing has been conducted in open court, with full attendance by all parties. The proceedings have been recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal sentence within 28 days under the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are applicable in this case. Costs are reserved pending further submissions. I reserve final judgment on sentence for a subsequent hearing scheduled following receipt of an updated pre-sentence report and any further representations. This is necessary in order to effect an informed and balanced disposition consistent with the interests of justice and public protection. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTFIELD R v. MR H Case No. H2025/15479 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. J. KENWORTH Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence upon a charge of theft, specifically multiple counts of shoplifting from various retail establishments over a protracted period. The offending conduct, as charged, is contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, and reflects a sustained pattern rather than isolated lapses. The offences occurred over an eighteen-month timeframe in the Hartfield metropolitan area and its immediate environs. Procedural History You were initially taken into custody on 5 May 2025 following an investigation that spanned several months and involved coordinated efforts by the Hartfield Metropolitan Police, alongside the Hartfield Retail Crime Task Force. This multi-agency approach involved the collation of store incident reports, digital evidence including CCTV footage, and employee statements, some of whom were compelled to provide detailed witness accounts under cross-examination during preliminary hearings. The collaborative apparatus assembled to address such behaviour invokes not only law enforcement but also retail security consultants and community liaison officers. The Hartfield Business Crime Reduction Partnership played a pivotal role, maintaining communications with affected merchants, analysing trends, and advising on best practices to reduce losses. Such partnerships, while theoretically demonstrating promising frameworks for crime reduction, frequently encounter practical challenges such as staff turnover, variations in data recording standards, and uneven financial backing from participating outlets. You elected to enter pleas of not guilty at the first listing on 18 June 2025, triggering the setting of a plea and trial preparation hearing in accordance with the Better Case Management regime. The Court noted with some measure of approval that all parties proceeded with reasonable expedition, notwithstanding the regrettable delays occasioned by Legal Aid representation orders and the late appointment of defence counsel. As is often the case in matters relying on forensic identification techniques, your legal representatives prudently sought an independent expert assessment, which was delayed by several weeks due to administrative backlogs in the Legal Aid Agency’s processing, a regrettable but familiar pattern. The second hearing, held on 15 August 2025, confirmed your intention to change your plea to guilty, a decision communicated shortly before the hearing commenced. While the court acknowledges that such guilty pleas serve to streamline proceedings and relieve witnesses of the distress associated with testifying, the timing unfortunately restricts the scope of discount applicable. As the Court of Appeal elucidated in R v. Holden [2023] EWCA Crim 1582, such last-minute admissions, absent compelling mitigating circumstances, attract significantly reduced credit. I take this opportunity to reiterate commentary on the persistent systemic issues affecting the justice system’s capacity to deliver fair and timely resolution. The delays caused by funding authorisation for expert psychiatric evaluations, as well as constraints within the probation service due to chronic under-resourcing, continue to impair the administration of justice in cases much like this one. These institutional challenges underscore the complex social ecology within which offending arises, but do not excuse it. Not least because repeated offending imposes direct burdens upon victims and indirect costs upon overstretched public services. The court also notes the recent refurbishment of Courtroom 4, completed earlier this year. While the physical environment of justice is tangential to substantive matters, it is a symbol, perhaps, of ongoing efforts to uphold dignity, decorum, and accessibility within the judicial process. Equally noteworthy is the continued commendable professionalism of the court ushers and clerical staff, who, despite rising caseloads and administrative complexity, maintain order and furnish procedural explanation to parties in language accessible to lay participants. The statutory framework governing theft is well-established, resting on the foundational principles set out in the Theft Act 1968. The offence requires proof of dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. Theft encompassing repeated incidents with calculated intent and planning attracts greater seriousness under sentencing guidelines, reflecting not only the tangible loss but also the wider psychological impact upon victims and communities. Considerable guidance is sourced from the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft, which underscores factors such as the frequency of offences, premeditation, and the vulnerability of The victims or locations targeted. The aggravating features of repeated offending, especially when directed at small independent retailers or specialist outlets, have been shown in authorities such as R v. Fenwick [2020] EWCA Crim 1825 to justify custodial sentences reflective of the cumulative harm. Though Fenwick concerned an offence of shop theft conducted under duress, its dicta regarding proportionality in sentencing remain instructive here. There is also instructive precedent in R v. Telford [2022] EWCA Crim 2134, where the Court upheld a sentence of immediate custody for thefts from community pharmacies, noting the heightened effect on staff morale and security concerns arising from targeted repeat offending. While the present charges do not include violence or threat, they are not entirely without impact beyond economic loss. Furthermore, although not germane to your own conduct, the court recalls the judgment in R v. McDermott [2019] EWCA Crim 908, involving wilful fire-raising at a local church hall, which emphasized the court’s duty to consider societal implications when imposing sentences even where direct physical harm is absent. Such cases serve as cautionary markers, reminding the court and public alike that low-level offences, if untreated, erode the social fabric. Turning to scholarly opinion, the evolution of sentencing principles over the last decade has been informed by a shifting landscape of criminal justice policy. The Better Case Management initiative, referenced earlier, was introduced following Lord Justice Briggs’ seminal Review (2016), which advocated for earlier case resolution and more effective resource allocation. While that reform has yielded improvements in some jurisdictions, the present case also demonstrates ongoing areas for procedural refinement, particularly in addressing Legal Aid bottlenecks. There is, moreover, a rich tradition of appellate decisions underscoring the interaction between mental health considerations and sentencing. Notably, in R v. Bellamy [2018] EWCA Crim 1207, the Court examined the limits of mitigation where psychiatric diagnosis intersected with persistent offending, concluding that clinical need does not diminish the court’s obligation to protect the public. Although your own clinical reports, which I shall discuss shortly, do not disclose major mental illness, that case frames the broader judicial approach well. The court is called, implicitly, to situate your offending within a wider societal tableau marked by rising economic precarity, fluctuating employment patterns, and increasing strains on housing services. Hartfield’s municipal homelessness figures have risen steadily in recent years, with temporary accommodation placements often lasting beyond statutory maximums due to acute shortages. Local food banks face demand far exceeding capacity, something reported in recent correspondence from Hartfield Community Aid, which also notes pressures on volunteer staffing. It bears mention that the Hartfield retail sector has, over the last five years, witnessed a slow attrition of independent shops, displaced in part by online commerce and rising business rates. This market transformation affects not only economic dynamics but community cohesion, as small retailer participation is integral to neighbourhood vibrancy. The converse – an environment in which persistent petty theft cycles endure – risks destabilizing this fragile equilibrium. There have been recent policy forums on the role of multi-agency panels, including Hartfield’s Local Crime Reduction Strategy Group, which continues to grapple with data-sharing limitations under GDPR constraints. Such restrictions hinder the prompt identification of repeat offenders and the deployment of tailored interventions; a problem noted elsewhere in the country, as highlighted in the Home Office’s “Review of Data Integration in Crime Reduction” (2024). Your case was also briefly delayed due to a court-wide adjournment resulting from a fire alarm activation in the adjacent Court 5 complex on 22 September, necessitating an evacuation and subsequent re-listing. This incident, while unrelated to your case specifically, showcases the operational vulnerabilities inherent in historic court buildings juxtaposed against modern digital courts elsewhere. At the initial hearing, you were remanded on conditional bail with a curfew order, reflecting the court’s assessment of the risk of reoffending and potential interference with witnesses. Throughout this period, probation and police liaison officers reported compliance with bail conditions, albeit with intermittent reports of non-attendance at appointments. Such compliance, while to be noted, should not be conflated with genuine behavioural change but rather regarded as procedural adherence. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. On the subject of your antecedents, the probation records indicate three prior convictions for similar offences within the last seven years, all relating to theft under £200. There is one recorded instance of a community resolution imposed in 2023 involving theft from a supermarket, though the record suggests subsequent breach thereof. No indication exists of gang affiliation or organised crime nexus, nor is there any record of violence or intimidation associated with your offending. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. The court received a comprehensive pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Joanne Sinclair, probation officer, who carefully considered risk, personal circumstances, and potential for rehabilitation. Notably, Ms Sinclair emphasises that your engagement with probation services has been, at best, sporadic. Attempts to initiate cognitive behavioural interventions met with limited attendance and frequent cancellation. The pre-sentence report further remarks on your reported history of unstable accommodation and significant periods of unemployment. You acknowledge reliance on state benefits and some occasional informal cash-in-hand work. The caseworker’s summary flags ‘low motivation for change’ as a significant concern. In addition to the probation input, a contemporary psychiatric evaluation was commissioned, with the report provided by Dr Elsie Byers, consultant psychiatrist at Hartfield Mental Health Trust. Dr Byers’ assessment concluded that no major mental illness is evident. She describes your presentation as ‘personality traits consistent with impulsivity and low frustration tolerance’ but explicitly excludes diagnosable personality disorder or psychosis. The report recommends that any engagement with structured community programmes focus on addressing impulsive behaviour and underlying social determinants. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. Letters of support submitted on your behalf include one from Ms Hannah Lewis of the Hartfield Outreach and Support Network, who speaks of your ‘occasional attendance at group sessions’ but acknowledges inconsistent engagement. A statement from your sister, Ms Tamara H, was also tendered, highlighting familial tensions but expressing hope for positive progression should appropriate support be secured. It is worth noting the continuing operational challenges experienced by community support agencies locally. In a recent parliamentary briefing, the National Probation Service highlighted chronic staffing deficits and reported caseloads frequently exceeding recommended limits. Coupled with reductions in third-sector funding, these constraints curtail the availability of intensive supervision or specialised interventions. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. Victim personal statements from managers and staff across the affected retail outlets have been submitted. They reflect a microcosm of the wider harm occasioned by your offending: increased anxiety, redistribution of workload to cover shift absences caused by stress, and heightened security measures including shelf locking and door alarms. While your actions did not entail physical confrontation, the psychological impact is nonetheless material. One victim impact report from the proprietors of a family-run chemist in Hartfield town centre details how staff changes were accelerated to mitigate exposure to your presence, resulting in financial and operational disruption. The court is cognisant of the wider implications of such repeated offending, notably in the cumulative drain on public resources - from investigative time to administrative processing and the indirect consequences for retail insurance premiums. It bears noting that in R v. Maddox [2019] EWCA Crim 1961, the Court emphasised the significance of the knock-on effects of repeated retail crime, even where individual theft values were modest. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. The Crown’s Submissions Ms Lydia Farr, counsel for the prosecution, has submitted that this court should impose a sentence reflecting the cumulative nature of the offending, its persistence despite previous warnings and interventions, and the demonstrated impact on victims. She emphasises that community orders with unpaid work and programme requirements may be appropriate but stresses that the threshold for custody should not be discounted lightly. The prosecution notes your late guilty plea, acknowledging some discount but reminds the court of the limited early opportunities afforded to the defence. Ms Farr further highlights the necessity of deterrence in a case typified by systematic evasion of lawful constraints. Mr Oliver Dwyer, appearing for you via a legal representation order, has submitted mitigating factors, including your unstable housing, unemployment status, lack of previous custodial sentences, and acknowledgement of responsibility. He contends that these factors militate strongly against immediate custody and advocate for a community penalty incorporating rehabilitative interventions, subject to the court’s approval. Mr Dwyer draws attention to personal challenges, including episodes of homelessness and reported past substance misuse, which, though not directly linked to the offences, provide context indicative of broader vulnerability. Citing the judgements in R v. Parker [2021] EWCA Crim 1034 and R v. Clarke [2023] EWCA Crim 1087, Mr Dwyer advocates for proportionality and rehabilitation in sentencing, reminding the court of the Human Rights Act considerations implicit in custodial decisions. He also notes your cooperation post-arrest and willingness to engage with support services as a positive step, emphasising the role of community sentences in reducing recidivism. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. Observations on Public Policy and Service Constraints It is incumbent upon the court to observe that the demand for community sentences exceeds supply, and the capacity for tailored programmes is frequently outstripped by case volumes. Waiting lists for cognitive skills courses and substance misuse programmes in Hartfield have, at times, extended to twelve months or more. This delay undermines rehabilitative prospects and compounds public safety risks. Notification of statutory duties to protect public welfare and prevent reoffending requires critical balancing against the finite resources of probation, courts, and ancillary services. Despite numerous reform proposals, including the 2024 Ministry of Justice Efficiency Plan, substantial challenges persist. An unrelated matter of record is the ongoing investigation into corruption within the local probation office, currently under internal inquiry and external oversight by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation. While unrelated to this case, such institutional instability casts a shadow on service delivery. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. The facts of the offending are as follows. Over the course of the eighteen-month period leading to your arrest, you committed multiple acts of shoplifting from retail premises primarily within Hartfield’s central business district. The offences included a sequence of thefts from convenience stores, pharmacies, and independent merchants, marked by frequent return visits and use of distraction techniques, including commanding staff attention while concealing items. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. On several occasions, your conduct involved removal of security tags and calculated evasion of staff surveillance. The value of stolen goods in individual instances was low, but cumulative losses resulted in tangible economic harm and psychological distress to victims. While your demeanour during police interviews was cooperative in the later stages of investigation, earlier denials delayed resolution and imposed additional investigatory burdens. In consideration of all material before the court, including the probation assessment, psychiatric evaluation, victim impact statements, legal submissions, and your antecedents, I have yet to determine the appropriate disposal. Given the complexity of factors and the necessity of ensuring a sentence tailored not only to punishment but also promoting rehabilitation and preventing reoffending, I shall order a further pre-sentence report. This report will also consider any updated information you may provide following engagement with support services. The final sentence will be imposed at a hearing to be listed shortly following receipt of that report. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Hartfield. The proceedings are transcribed and recorded under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing pursuant to relevant statutory provisions. No reporting restrictions under sections 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 or associated legislation are engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM R v. MR H Case No. T2026/05849 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge J. M. PENDLETON Filed: 17 October 2026 Mr H, you are before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending relates to a series of thefts committed over the course of nearly two years, principally within the Birmingham city centre retail district, but extending to several neighbouring town centres. The matter has been listed before me for sentencing following your admission of guilt at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 22 September 2026. Procedural History and Overview Your initial arrest took place on 11 February 2026 after a protracted investigation led by the Birmingham Business Crime Taskforce, a multi-agency unit combining local policing resources with the Retail Theft Intelligence Section. This collaborative effort involved coordination with other bodies including the West Midlands Trading Standards Department and the regional CCTV Operations Unit. The investigation, which encompassed a review of diverse evidence streams such as closed-circuit television footage, point of sale records, and witness statements collected over a 14-month period, culminated in charges being brought against you in mid-March 2026. In these environments, one might naively assume that the availability of visual surveillance technology would simplify evidentiary collection and case preparation. However, as has been well documented in academic and judicial circles alike, the raw presence of video footage is rarely sufficient on its own. The quality of such images varies dramatically. It is not uncommon, as this court has observed in previous matters, for footage to suffer from distortion, obstructions, or misaligned timestamps, rendering it frequently unreliable in isolation. Indeed, the judicial experience has shown that securing a coherent narrative from such disparate recordings often requires the painstaking cross-referencing of multiple camera angles, store incident logs, and employee recollections, a process both time-consuming and costly. It is a truism that the police and prosecution frequently must devote substantial resources to what might superficially appear to be 'minor' offences — a term which belies the real human, economic, and communal cost of such thefts. The misapprehension that petty theft occupies a lower rung on the ladder of criminal harm dismisses the lived experience of retail workers, many of whom endure persistent anxiety and stress as a consequence of repeated thefts on their premises. These impacts ripple outward — affecting store profitability, potential job security, and local consumer confidence alike. The Better Case Management (BCM) framework was engaged from the outset to ensure efficient case progression in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules. This court notes with measured satisfaction that despite the chronic under-resourcing that characterises many contemporary public services, the case documentation was filed in advance of hearings as required and that liaison between the various agencies involved proceeded without undue obstruction. It is worth noting, however, that this procedural efficiency is regrettably not the norm. So much judicial time is otherwise consumed by adjournments related to missing paperwork, delayed expert reports, or contested applications for legal aid funding. This brings me to the matter of funding. The Legal Aid Agency’s handling of requests related to your defence has been, with no small degree of regret, problematic. The initial application to instruct an independent forensic psychologist was submitted on 3 April 2026, yet was not authorised until 15 June 2026. This two-month delay, accompanied by intermittent requests for additional clarifications and documentation, is emblematic of a wider malaise within the system that undermines timely justice, imposes unnecessary burdens on counsel, and causes distress to defendants and victims alike. As the court has previously noted in similar contexts, such administrative inertia is inimical to the proper functioning of the justice system and warrants urgent remedial attention. Before turning to the specifics of your offending, I must acknowledge the ongoing contributions of certain voluntary sector bodies with whom you have had some contact during these proceedings. In particular, the Birmingham Retail Staff Support Network submitted a letter to this court on 4 October 2026 outlining the challenges faced by shop employees in the wake of repeated theft incidents. Their efforts to engage with affected individuals, provide counselling, and advocate for improved working conditions are commendable and deserve formal recognition in these remarks. Additionally, the Midlands Community Reinvestment Project has provided reports concerning local economic impacts of high retail shrinkage rates — including increased prices that inevitably affect vulnerable shoppers. It is notable that these agencies operate under significant financial constraints, reliant on grants and volunteer effort, yet nonetheless maintain a constructive dialogue with the criminal justice system. You entered a plea of not guilty at your first appearance, which was subject to the listing of a contested plea and trial preparation hearing. At the plea hearing on 22 September 2026, shortly before trial was due to commence, you elected to plead guilty. It is therefore necessary to address the credit to be awarded for that guilty plea, which, given its timing, is to be considered in light of established appellate authority. The Court of Appeal has on numerous occasions considered the principle that early guilty pleas deserve greater recognition, serving both to conserve public resources and to relieve victims and witnesses from the burden of giving evidence. The decision in R v. Elliott [2022] EWCA Crim 993 is apposite. There, the court stated that while credit for a guilty plea is a well-established mitigating factor, “the timing of that plea and the factual context in which it is made are matters of judicial discretion to be exercised with a careful balancing of interests.” Similarly, in R v. Kaur [2023] EWCA Crim 45, the court underscored the diminished credit available where a plea is entered at a late stage, particularly when evidentiary disclosure has long been complete and the plea is seen as tactical rather than demonstrative of genuine remorse. Having said that, while your plea was not at the earliest point in the process, it nevertheless brought the matter to a conclusion sooner than a contested trial would have permitted, thus achieving some degree of procedural economy. The credit you receive will be adjusted accordingly. The law and sentencing guidelines applicable to theft offences of this kind are well established. The Theft Act 1968, at section 1, defines the offence succinctly: the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, last updated in 2022, provides the framework within which offences of this character are assessed, taking into account factors such as the value of the goods taken, the frequency of offending, the impact on victims, and any aggravating or mitigating features. As a matter of context, the guideline expressly recognises that repeated or organised shop theft causing persistent distress or economic loss can justify custodial sentences, even where the sums involved are individually modest. It is both instructive and necessary to consider certain case law developments, although the factual matrices in those cases may be materially distinct from the present circumstances. For example, the widely-cited decision in R v. Maidstone [2019] EWCA Crim 370 considered an offender who engaged in a course of shoplifting over a period of several years, targeting supermarket chains with sums totalling in excess of £18,000. That case emphasised the need to take a proportional approach, balancing the offender’s personal circumstances against the public harm caused, and upheld a sentence of twelve months’ custody suspended for two years, subject to supervision and unpaid work requirements. Another illustrative judgment is that in R v. Campton [2021] EWCA Crim 887, where the defendant was convicted of trafficking stolen goods after an operation involving stolen electronics sourced from multiple retail outlets. The court in Campton stressed that organised or commercialised shoplifting merits a more severe response, reflective both of the degree of premeditation and the broader impact on the community, including distortion of legitimate market activities. While there is no suggestion here of such commercial operation, the case serves as a useful backdrop for evidencing the escalating seriousness with which the courts treat such offending. Turning from legal authority to the facts before this court, I must now set out the particulars as reflected in the evidence provided to the trial and the pre-sentence reports commissioned. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. The facts establish a clear pattern of repeated and opportunistic theft over a sustained period, involving multiple retail outlets including high street chains and local independent shops. The thefts involved goods frequently targeted for their easy resale value: personal care products, over-the-counter medicines, and electronics accessories. This is characteristic of a particular modus operandi commonly seen in such cases, as noted by the Birmingham Retail Crime Partnership in their analytic brief issued on 31 August 2026, which highlights the growing sophistication of what might once have been regarded as impulse theft. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. An important feature noted in the Crown’s evidence was the apparent use of concealment techniques, including layering clothing to obscure items, and in some instances, coordinated timing to coincide with busy periods or staff changes. It is also recorded that on occasion, you adopted apparent pretext conversations on mobile phones, thereby attempting to reduce staff vigilance — a tactic unfortunately all too familiar in such circles. Community impact statements provided by multiple shop managers detail the disruption caused, including increased anxiety among staff, the need to alter rotas, and an understandable reluctance to work unsupervised during vulnerable hours. The psychological toll, while intangible, is no less real for those affected. One witness, an employee at a modest independent pharmacy in Digbeth, spoke movingly of how your repeated visits instilled a palpable sense of dread amongst the team, a distress compounded by the fear that management might not fully appreciate the severity of the issue. Such victim impact is rightly regarded by this court as a material aggravating feature in determining the appropriate sentence. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. If one were to pivot briefly to the operational context of the agencies involved in your case, it bears mentioning the considerable strain placed upon the West Midlands Probation Service and local policing teams. The increased volume of acquisitive crime has contributed to elevated workloads, staff shortages, and a deficit in resources available for diversion or rehabilitative programmes. This systemic pressure has been extensively documented in the Annual Review of the West Midlands Criminal Justice Board (2025), which outlines the challenges faced in accommodating specialist interventions in a climate of austerity and high demand. These observations do not excuse individual conduct but serve to situate it within the broader environment of ever-decreasing institutional capacity. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. An independent psychiatric report ordered pursuant to the defence’s application was prepared by Dr Sylvia Lane, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose assessment was received on 13 September 2026. Dr Lane observed that you exhibit no major psychiatric disorder but identified enduring difficulties with impulse control and emotional regulation. She commented that your engagement with social support networks has been inconsistent and that there is a risk of continued offending absent targeted intervention. Dr Lane expressed the view that community-based rehabilitative efforts focusing on impulse management and cognitive behavioural approaches could offer some benefit, provided that sufficient motivation and support structures are available to secure meaningful engagement. However, she cautioned that premature optimism about voluntary compliance in such cases is often misplaced. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The court also acknowledges the social and personal difficulties you have experienced, including periods of insecure housing and episodic employment. While such hardships undoubtedly present challenges, they do not provide an automatic or sufficient justification for criminal conduct. The principle that hardship does not equate to licence remains firmly embedded within criminal justice jurisprudence and policy. A recent local authority report commissioned to assess the availability of support services for individuals at risk of recidivism found that while a modest array of options exists — including housing advice, debt counselling, and substance misuse programmes — demand far outstrips supply. This mismatch inevitably results in wait times and crisis points, reducing the likelihood that all defendants in your position will access interventions promptly or effectively. Nonetheless, the existence of such services is not to be dismissed and the recalcitrance or failure to engage with them when offered weighs heavily against considerations of mitigation. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. In the course of these proceedings, an unusual procedural matter arose. It was noted that your co-defendant in an unrelated case involving possession of offensive weapons was present in custody at the same time. This person’s case, involving an affray outside a licensed premises in Erdington with the use of pool cues as weapons, is entirely distinct from yours and bears no causal connection. While such overlap in the court roll sometimes causes confusion, this court is satisfied that no evidential or procedural overlap affects your determination. Equally, seen in the context of community-based schemes, the recent operation “Shield” conducted by the West Midlands Police involved patrols targeting fly-tipping activities on green belt land around the Solihull district. Its broader aim to reduce environmental crime is valuable but unrelated to your charge, serving only to illustrate the expansive scope of policing demands in the region. In sentencing, this court must weigh a range of factors derived from statute, precedent, sentencing guidelines, and the specific circumstances of the case. A custodial sentence, although severe, is not invariably the default for shoplifting offences. However, where the offending represents a deliberate, repeated pattern causing tangible harm to victims and the community, custody becomes an increasingly proportionate response. Having considered all material, including the reports from probation services, psychiatric assessments, victim impact statements, and counsel submissions, I find the following features to be particularly cogent. The clear pattern of prolonged offending despite previous warnings or interventions; the adverse impact on retail workers and the local economy; the late plea of guilty providing only partial mitigation; and the limited engagement with support mechanisms offered — these collectively weigh heavily toward a custodial outcome. That said, I note your youth at the time of the earliest offences, your expression of regret in court, and some open acknowledgement of the pressures contributing to your behaviour. These factors serve to tilt the scales marginally towards suspending or limiting the term of custody, subject to considerations of future compliance and rehabilitation. In accordance with standard protocol, I hereby order that a pre-sentence report be commissioned without delay. This report should encompass a thorough assessment of your personal circumstances, risk of reoffending, and suitability for any community-based interventions, including but not limited to cognitive skills training, restorative justice, and employment support schemes. The probation service is requested to pay particular attention to devising a tailored package of interventions aimed at addressing impulse control difficulties and opportunities for social reintegration. It is hoped that this report will furnish the court with the necessary detail to arrive at a sentence that both protects the public and provides a realistic prospect of reducing future offending. I express my thanks to Ms Zoe Fenton, who appeared on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Samuel Norris, who has represented you under a representation order. I record once again my concern at the delays caused by the Legal Aid Agency’s tardiness in authorising expert assessments. I also thank the court staff who have maintained order and facilitated smooth progress throughout these proceedings, notwithstanding occasional staffing shortages and scheduling constraints. The courtroom itself was recently refurbished, with new security features installed, which although tangential, have contributed to an improved environment for all participants, which merits passing mention. Finally, I remind you that these sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2026, in Court 8 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The transcript has been produced in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. You have the right of appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged in these proceedings. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT EASTBOURNE R v. MR H Case No. T2025/15739 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. J. Eldridge Filed: 19 October 2025 Mr H, you appear today before this court to be sentenced for a representative count of theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The indictment relates to a course of conduct involving repeated shoplifting offences over a period extending from mid-2023 to early 2025, committed at multiple retail premises within the boroughs of Eastbourne and Hastings. Procedural History The matter came before the Crown Court following your arrest on 17 March 2025. Your detention followed a lengthy multi-agency investigation coordinated by the Eastbourne Borough Police Retail Crime Unit alongside local business security teams and the Sussex Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP). The partnership had collated detailed incident reports, customer complaints, and undercover operations data over more than 18 months. They sought to identify patterns of repeat offending that had a disproportionately detrimental effect on independent and small-chain retailers within the seaside commercial zones. Such investigations into low-level but persistent retail theft demand significant allocation of limited policing resources. Officers tasked with these cases, who might otherwise address violence or organised crime, are frequently engaged over extended periods with detailed evidence gathering; this includes obtaining and reviewing hours of CCTV footage, interviewing store staff and witnesses, and cross-jurisdictional information sharing. The burden on police and retail partners reflects not only the material loss but also the intangible costs borne by employees and communities. As is well documented, an area which suffers repeated instances of retail theft commonly reports increased staff anxiety, high absenteeism, and a diminished sense of safety that may precipitate reduced service hours or closure. It is to the credit of the BCRP that they managed to sustain engagement with both law enforcement and retailers throughout the protracted investigative phase, despite significant challenges including staff turnovers and stretched operational capacity. Your arrest was the culmination of covert surveillance and an intelligence-led operation that included authorised mobile phone data extraction approved by the Senior Investigating Officer and an independent judicial authorising magistrate under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The resultant evidence, including multiple CCTV captures and witness statements, presented a compelling case which led to your formal charge. Following your initial custody and interviews under Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 protocols, you were charged with eight counts of theft and subsequently arraigned in the Magistrates’ Court on 21 March 2025. Because of the perceived complexity and volume of evidence, the matter was committed to the Crown Court for trial or plea. The case was listed under the Better Case Management (BCM) pilot initiative aimed at expediting the preparation and hearing of cases with comprehensive evidence sets. No less than four pre-trial hearings were convened between April and September 2025, each scheduled in consultation with the parties to ensure compliance with disclosure obligations and to permit the exchange of defence materials, including expert reports. The Legal Aid Agency’s administration in this case was, regrettably, marked by repeated delays, particularly concerning applications for funding to commission forensic psychiatric analysis and cognitive assessment. This situation is unfortunately emblematic of the systemic challenges faced by practitioners in securing timely authorisation for expert involvement, as has been noted in recent Parliamentary Select Committee enquires on legal aid funding efficiency. Your defence attorney, Mr Jonathan Blythe, instructed under a Legal Aid scheme, made laudable efforts to mitigate these bureaucratic impediments, resulting in a late but comprehensive psychiatric report being submitted on 30 September 2025. I acknowledge Mr Blythe’s continuing professionalism under these conditions. Ms Sylvia Arden appeared for the Crown Prosecution Service and advanced an unambiguous case against you. The matter was first listed for plea and trial preparation on 12 June 2025. At that hearing, you entered a not guilty plea, with the case being adjourned to allow for further evidential disclosure and expert reporting. However, on 15 September 2025, shortly before the trial window was due to open, you altered your plea to guilty on the single representative count. It is a regrettable yet familiar pattern that defendants in persistent acquisitive crime cases often maintain denial until the weight of evidence, including forensic corroboration and multiple witness statements, makes contest untenable. The courts recognise the conventional discount for early guilty pleas as an incentive for early admission of responsibility, which may spare victims and witnesses from the rigours of trial. However, where pleas are delayed until near trial, the discount must appropriately reflect the timing and motivation rather than be viewed as an unavoidable right. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly emphasised this principle: see R v. Benfield [2024] EWCA Crim 1543 and R v. Silverton [2023] EWCA Crim 2101. A comprehensive review of sentencing authorities underscores the judiciary’s imperative to hold the balance between rehabilitation on the one hand, and deterrence and public protection on the other. In R v. Fletcher [2022] EWCA Crim 889, the Court of Appeal upheld the imposition of an immediate custodial sentence where persistent dishonesty was accompanied by a manifest lack of remorse or engagement with rehabilitative services. Conversely, R v. Kirkland [2023] EWCA Crim 801 reiterated the necessity of proportionate sentencing reflective of the offender’s social and psychological circumstances. There is, of course, an expanding corpus of jurisprudence addressing the intersection between mental health, addiction, and risk assessment in offences of this nature. In R v. Matthews [2019] EWCA Crim 1156, the court elucidated that while underlying vulnerabilities may inform sentencing disposition, they do not detract from accountability where the risk of reoffending remains high and community safety cannot be assured. More recently, in R v. Harper [2024] EWCA Crim 330, the engagement failure with community psychiatric resources weighed heavily against the appellant’s plea for leniency. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. It is important to reflect on the operational context in which offences such as those under consideration occur. Retail theft, though often minimised or dismissed as trivial, imposes a ripple effect that reaches well beyond the immediate loss of goods. Local shops frequently operate on tight margins, and persistent theft undermines their viability, sometimes precipitating closures that erode the social fabric of high streets and community cohesion. Clerks and assistants bear the brunt of confronting offenders, absorbing not only financial but also emotional strain. The Safer Eastbourne Partnership, a multi-agency initiative tasked with reducing acquisitive crime, submitted a detailed community impact statement. This report draws attention to the deleterious effects of recurrent shoplifting on staff morale, with some employees requesting transfers or resigning due to stress and fear. It notes, pertinently, that while offences are low-value individually, their cumulative effect is significantly disruptive. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline (2024) remains the authoritative framework guiding judicial approach. The guideline categorises theft in bands reflecting harm and culpability, acknowledging factors including victim vulnerability, use of deception, breach of trust, planning, and sophistication of offending. The repeated nature of conduct and its economic and psychological impact weighs heavily towards the upper range of seriousness. Additionally, it is appropriate to consider the Sentencing Council’s Overarching Principles Guideline, updated last in 2023, which directs courts to impose sentences commensurate with public protection while encouraging intervention where suitable. Rehabilitation and reduction of reoffending underpin many community orders, but only when the offending pattern and defendant’s circumstances allow. It would be remiss to overlook the noteworthy developments in court administration pertinent to this matter. Eastbourne Crown Court has recently concluded a major refurbishment of its courtroom audio-visual facilities, facilitating improved access to video evidence and digital exhibits. While peripheral to substantive justice, such enhancements serve the delivery of fair and expedient trials. In the current pandemic-impacted climate, courts have contended with fluctuating operational constraints, staffing shortages, and sporadic adjournments, including a brief suspension following a staff Covid outbreak in Court 1 during early 2025. These external factors notwithstanding, the parties are commended for adherence, as far as possible, to scheduled listings. Your case was delayed in part due to the unavailability of an appropriate forensic psychiatric expert, a predicament linked to the limited number of qualified consultants willing to accept publicly funded instructions. This scarcity impairs timely justice and burdens the system, a problem regularly raised by the Criminal Bar Association and echoed in recent Ministry of Justice consultations. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. Consideration was also given to an application for ancillary matters involving the examination of co-defendant behaviour in an unrelated matter. I note that a former flatmate of yours was subject to separate proceedings involving possession of a bladed item on school premises, the subject of R v. Langford [2022] EWCA Crim 1349. That offence bears no connection to your conduct and must be disregarded in assessing your culpability. Similarly, references in the case file to a prior landlord noise abatement notice served upon your accommodation’s owner in 2023 are extrinsic and irrelevant to the Court’s deliberations. No evidence suggests this impacted upon your offending. Notwithstanding the apparent complexity of the criminal justice process, this case stands as a demonstration that cooperative work between agencies—police, courts, legal representatives, and community groups—can yield cohesive procedural outcomes with integrity. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. As part of the pre-sentence assessment, a report was prepared by the probation service, addressing your background, previous offending, social circumstances, and risk of reoffending. The report speaks to a history of unstable accommodation, marked periods of unemployment, substance misuse including intermittent dependency on alcohol, and intermittent engagement with voluntary support services. However, the report identifies significant gaps in your receptivity to sustained intervention, noting missed appointments and periods of lost contact. The report further references the “Thinking Skills Programme” and “Enhanced Thinking Skills” initiatives, which have been introduced nationally as cognitive behavioural interventions targeting reasoning deficits implicated in patterns of acquisitive offending. While potentially beneficial, your current levels of engagement suggest cautious optimism at best. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. The psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr Marian Telford, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, while noting no major psychiatric illness, identifies features consistent with an impulsive personality disorder and low mood exacerbated by social isolation. While no formal diagnosis of major depressive disorder was made, Dr Telford observed that instability of housing and lack of family support contribute to ongoing vulnerability. Despite recommendations for social work support and engagement with local alcohol support charities, your record suggests ambivalence, limiting the practical effect of such clinical advice. The probation service also highlights that no evidence was found of involvement in organised crime, coercion, or human trafficking, and that no child safeguarding concerns have been raised in relation to your household. I acknowledge the letter submitted on your behalf from a local charity, The Brighton and East Sussex Homeless Outreach Trust, which underlines the precariousness of your current living arrangement. The letter, while supportive, cautions that the ongoing risk of eviction and extreme weather exposure pose an urgent housing challenge. The impact of this instability on mental health and behaviour is recognised, notwithstanding the Court’s expectation of personal responsibility. In line with longstanding precedents, it remains essential that sentencing targets both the needs of the individual offender and the broader imperative of public protection. Rehabilitation-focused sentences retain their place; however, community measures must be effectively tailored and credible in terms of prospect of compliance. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. It is essential to record a brief reflection on the broader climate within which courts like this operate. The significant pressures levied upon public services—including probation, mental health, and social care—have escalated markedly in recent years. Increasing caseloads and reductions in resource allocation challenge the capacity of front-line workers to maintain consistent engagement and deliver bespoke interventions. In this vein, I must commend the efforts of the local probation team who, despite these constraints, have committed substantial time to preparing thorough reports and supervision plans for this court. Similarly, thanks are due to the staff of the Sussex Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose victim liaison work exemplifies professionalism and care in circumstances where collective resolve is often tested. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Turning to ancillary jurisprudence relevant to sentencing duration, although your offences bear no connection to matters involving arson, the Court of Appeal decisions in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624 and R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412 provide instructive contrasts in addressing sentences for calculated and escalating criminal behaviour marked by public risk. In both cases, custodial sentences were affirmed where the scale and degree of harm warranted restriction of liberty for a significant term. While these cases do not map directly onto your conduct, they emphasise the principle that judicial discretion must always account for the protective function of sentencing alongside rehabilitation. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. In concluding, I remind you of the well-established parameters within which the judiciary operates. Sentencing is not conducted in isolation from the societal context but is fundamentally an exercise in balancing the competing objectives of retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. Summary The facts as admitted disclose a persistent and deliberate pattern of shoplifting over an extended timeframe, marked by planning and disregard for lawful boundaries. The impact upon victims—small retailers and employees alike—has been palpably adverse. Your personal circumstances afford some mitigation, but your lack of meaningful engagement with available support services weighs against a wholly lenient approach. A plea of guilty, while welcome, was tendered at an unusually late stage; thus, the credit for that plea will be calibrated accordingly in sentencing. I shall therefore direct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared by the National Probation Service. The report is to examine in detail the suitability of community orders incorporating rehabilitative programmes such as cognitive skills training and supervision aligned with mitigating your offending triggers. It shall also consider accommodation stability, substance use treatment engagement, and potential restorative justice interventions. While the possibility of custodial sentence cannot be excluded in light of the pattern and persistence of offending, the Court remains open to options that advance both your rehabilitation and the protection of the community. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 19 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Eastbourne. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be conveyed to the appropriate authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. No order as to costs is made at this stage. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. T2025/15892 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. F. Ashford Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this Court for sentencing in relation to persistent shoplifting offences, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct spans a period from mid-2023 through to April 2025, involving multiple retail premises within the greater Bristol area. The indictment presents a representative count, which stands for a series of like offences committed against various businesses. Procedural Context and Case Progression Your arrest occurred on 30 April 2025 after an extensive investigation led by the Bristol Metropolitan Police and coordinated alongside the Bristol Business Crime Initiative. The latter is a partnership formed in 2017, aimed at sharing intelligence, risk profiles, and strategic responses to retail crime, which includes shoplifting, shop disruption, and counterfeiting. While this structure was formally established just eight years ago, it reflects longstanding efforts in the region to address acquisitive offending through collaboration among law enforcement, local authorities, and trade bodies. It merits noting that the Business Crime Initiative, although ostensibly a model of cross-sector cooperation, has repeatedly encountered challenges posed by competing priorities and the varying extent of engagement among its members. Staffing shortages in the local police force—particularly within teams assigned to property crime and retail-related offending—remain a systemic constraint. Operational demands stemming from rising incidents of domestic violence and street-level drug offences often siphon resources away from shoplifting investigations, resulting in recurrent backlogs in evidence collation and disclosure. Such bureaucratic complexities bear, albeit indirectly, on case flow and can contribute to the protracted timeline seen in matters like this. Your first appearance was at Bristol Magistrates’ Court on 7 May 2025, where you entered a plea of not guilty. However, subsequent disclosure of CCTV footage and the testimonies of several shop staff precipitated a change of plea at the Crown Court arraignment on 12 September 2025. Notably, the plea was entered only shortly before the scheduled trial window, a practice of late admitting in such cases that, regrettably, is becoming increasingly prevalent. This trend of delayed pleas places additional strain not only on contested procedure but also on the prosecution, defence, and judiciary alike. The aggravating impact on victims—who must sustain uncertainty and may be subject to repeated questioning or appearance in court—is considerable. The principles articulated in R v. Greenaway [2023] EWCA Crim 3245 remain instructive here; while credit for a plea is properly available, such credit must reflect the earliest reasonable admission of responsibility. Where pleas are delayed, discounting must be correspondingly limited. The present proceedings have similarly been affected by successive adjournments. Among the reasons was the need for an expert psychiatric assessment to inform mitigation, coupled with administrative delays in Legal Aid authorisation. Early applications for funding to engage a forensic psychologist were met with bureaucratic inertia, resulting in a delay of six weeks before approval was granted. Such systemic inefficiencies impede the timeliness of justice and exacerbate case management burdens. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. Owing to the above, the pre-sentence report remains outstanding, with the Probation Service notified to undertake a thorough assessment of your personal circumstances, offence causation, and prospects for rehabilitation. In the interim, it is appropriate to acknowledge the invaluable contribution of the local charities working in the addiction and homelessness sectors. Agencies such as Bristol Outreach Network and Safe Place have provided caseworkers to maintain contact with you, despite your inconsistent engagement. Their efforts, set against the backdrop of severely constrained funding and increasing demand, are commendable and illustrate the pressures faced by voluntary services attempting to fill gaps left by statutory provision. The Court notes the increasing burden posed by low-level acquisitive crime on public sector services, including social housing management, benefits administration, and mental health clinics. This cumulative impact magnifies the societal cost well beyond the immediate financial loss sustained by retail victims. It is worth recalling, albeit tangentially, several appellate authorities which shape the legal framework applicable here. In R v. Casewell [2020] EWCA Crim 2422, principles governing sentence reduction for guilty pleas were reasserted, particularly the emphasis on promptness of admission and meaningful contrition as prerequisites for the fullest credit. That case also involved comparatively minor property offences but underscored the necessity of proportionality and public confidence in sentencing outcomes. Meanwhile, in R v. Ellison [2019] EWCA Crim 353, the Court was confronted with issues surrounding the imposition of custodial sentences for repeated low-level acquisitive offending where underlying mental health vulnerabilities featured prominently. There, while recognising the rehabilitative needs of the offender, the Court emphasised that public protection and deterrence must not be sacrificed unduly. Less directly related, but nevertheless instructive, is R v. Fletcher [2021] EWCA Crim 1708, concerning aggravated criminal damage to a community centre. Though unrelated factually, the judgment is notable for its broader reflections on the deteriorating state of community cohesion, a theme pertinent to contemporary analyses of low-level offending and its social ramifications. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. Public service infrastructure, unfortunately, is overstretched. The National Health Service continues to grapple with extended waiting times for psychiatric outpatient appointments, while probation services report caseloads reaching unsustainable levels. It has been widely documented that frontline probation officers often endure excessive administrative burdens, limiting time available for direct intervention and supervision. This operational reality acts as a brake on swift, effective management of risk in cases like yours. There is additionally an ongoing debate around the application and efficacy of electronic monitoring and curfew requirements within community sentences. Recent pilots within the South West region have yielded mixed results, with compliance rates and recidivism impacts remaining under scrutiny. The Court also reflects on the trend in urban environments toward the normalization of antisocial behaviour and petty theft, as outlined in various sociological studies and local authority reports. This raises complex questions about balancing enforcement with social support, yet does not alter the fundamental responsibilities of individuals to conform to the law. Turning to your own circumstances, Dr Felicity Barr, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided a report dated 24 September 2025. Dr Barr noted absence of psychotic disorder or major depressive syndrome but identified features consistent with mild impulse control difficulties and episodic social anxiety. The report suggested potential benefit from cognitive behavioural therapy targeting impulsiveness but found no indication of severe mental illness detracting from personal responsibility. It is unhelpful to overstate vulnerability; the Court acknowledges the importance of compassion without resorting to paternalism. Treatment must complement, not excuse, accountability. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. The Pathway project of Bristol, a community initiative focused on supporting individuals exiting homelessness, submitted a letter praising your intermittent attendance at their drop-in sessions. It was noted that there remains a significant risk of relapse into chaotic behaviour absent sustained engagement with structured programmes. The business victims in this matter were largely small to medium enterprises: independent grocers, pharmacy outlets, and convenience stores. Each citation included victim personal statements evidencing distress and operational disruption. Losses, while individually modest, cumulatively burden these enterprises, which operate with narrow margins and declining footfall in the face of rising online commerce. The Safer Retailers Network provided a status report dated 18 August 2025, detailing a 12% increase in reported theft incidents across the district compared to the previous year. This finding corroborates national trends reported by the Business Crime Reduction Partnership and the Home Office. Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. I observe that your probation file notes mixed compliance with prior community resolutions. There have been unilateral terminations from voluntary programmes and inconsistent reporting, undermining confidence in rehabilitation prospects to date. Policy guidance issued by the Sentencing Council relating to theft offences emphasises the need for sentencing that reflects the culpability of deliberate and sustained offending. While remorse and early pleas may mitigate sentences, repeat offending necessitates incrementally stronger deterrent measures. It is instructive also to recall the decision in R v. Aleem [2022] EWCA Crim 1104, where the Court upheld an immediate custodial sentence for aggravated burglary with a significant mental health overlay. Though differing in gravity, the principles relating to sentencing discounts remain salient. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. Historical offences committed by co-defendants in unrelated cases were enumerated in prosecution disclosures despite lacking connection to the defendant. For example, an associate in an unrelated matter faced charges of affray linked to a pub altercation in 2023, a fact of no relevance here save to highlight the complexity of multi-defendant procedural contexts. Similarly, administrative examinations of prior convictions revealed that one roommate, unconnected to Mr H’s present charges, had been implicated in possession of controlled substances in a wholly separate incident nine months prior. Further court records show that delayed listings in this Crown Court are sometimes attributable to industrial action by court staff, including a week-long strike in June 2025. Such external factors contribute inexorably to case delays. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. The late submission of incomplete witness statements by the Crown delayed preparation for trial, an issue recurrent in property crime prosecutions where under-resourced teams manage voluminous and fragmented evidence. The local police digital forensics unit reported an unusually high workload between March and July 2025, attributed in part to concurrent investigation into a significant cyber fraud conspiracy unconnected to this case. That operation drew heavily on analyst capacity that might otherwise have supported retail theft enquiries. From a legal procedural perspective, this court notes the continuous evolution of the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol since its 2017 inception. BCM mandates more stringent timelines and evidence disclosure. Yet compliance varies, and the challenge of assimilating documentary and audiovisual materials within prescribed windows remains unresolved. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The court also notes with regret the increasing frequency of court appearances by defendants accompanied by minor children, necessitating welfare interventions by social services. In a separate matter from October 2024, a defendant presenting with a mental health crisis led to a multi-agency safeguarding meeting (MASH), a costly and resource-intensive process whose reverberations affect court listing and social care availability. Mr H’s defence counsel, Mr Dominic Lewis, engaged robustly during the hearing and advanced mitigation based on housing insecurity and economic hardship. While sincere, the submissions must be balanced against the need for deterrence, particularly as previous diversionary measures have failed to prevent recidivism. Correspondence from Mr H’s sister, submitted for today’s hearing, offers testimony regarding family support attempts yet reflects limited direct influence on your conduct. While familial interventions are to be encouraged, the court anticipates more substantive engagement with statutory services. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. Finally, it is prudent to observe the broader societal context within which this offending takes place. The landscape of urban deprivation, social fragmentation, and uneven access to support mechanisms all weigh on the backdrop of retail crime. Despite this, individual choice remains paramount and courts must guard against conflating social disarray with excuse. The principle that adults bear responsibility for their actions, particularly where offences involve planning and repeated conduct, underpins the administration of justice. The sentencing guidelines assign primary weight to culpability and harm, with mitigating factors including early plea and genuine remorse. The Court will order the preparation of a full pre-sentence report by the Probation Service. This report shall canvass the extent of identified rehabilitation needs, potential interventions—including cognitive-behavioural programmes, financial advice, substance misuse treatment—and risk of harm to the public. In due course, following receipt of all relevant reports, a sentencing hearing will be scheduled to determine appropriate disposal. The Court reserves full consideration until that time. These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge G. F. Ashford, dated 14 October 2025, recorded in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been formally transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is hereby reminded of the right to appeal against conviction or sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT ROYAL BARKING R v. MR H Case No. RB/2025/14429 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. A. LANGLEY Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you come before this court for sentence following your conviction for offences of theft by shoplifting, in breach of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct spans a significant period between November 2023 and June 2025 and was committed across a range of retail outlets within the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham as well as neighbouring wards. The offences represent a sustained course of dishonesty and calculated theft that has caused genuine distress among victims and wider repercussions within local business communities. Procedural Overview The case was originally charged at Barking Magistrates’ Court following your arrest on 28 June 2025. You were detained under investigation subsequent to a multi-agency inquiry coordinated by the Barking and Dagenham Retail Crime Partnership and the Metropolitan Police Service’s Specialist Crime Unit. Intelligence was gathered over a period exceeding fourteen months, incorporating evidence from numerous local businesses, CCTV footage, police patrol logs, and witness statements. Upon committal, the case was passed to this court for sentence pursuant to the Crown Court allocation scheme due to the scale and complexity of the offending. Your initial appearance in this court occurred on 7 July 2025, when you entered a not guilty plea. A plea and trial preparation hearing followed on 22 August 2025, at which point defence counsel indicated that a guilty plea would be forthcoming. However, the final admission of guilt was not tendered until the first day of trial on 15 September 2025, following detailed review of prosecution evidence and a pre-sentence psychiatric assessment. The court, recognising the pattern of late pleas in similarly situated cases, notes the effect on the efficient administration of justice and will, in due course, give appropriate credit for your eventual admission of responsibility. It is important to observe that this court was informed that the Legal Aid Agency’s processing of applications for expert psychiatric assistance in your case was protracted and marked by considerable procedural delays. The initial request for funding to instruct Dr Sarah Eastman, a forensic psychologist with expertise in acquisitive offending, was submitted on 16 July 2025 but only approved following numerous correspondence exchanges on 3 September 2025. These delays, while regrettable, underscore systemic challenges in resource allocation and administrative procedures within the legal aid framework, which continue to impact the timely resolution of cases involving vulnerable defendants. At all hearing stages, the court has benefited from the professional diligence of Ms Laura Benson, appearing on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Daniel Roberts, your instructed counsel on a legal aid funded basis. Both counsel have made detailed submissions directed at ensuring that sentencing reflects the balance between public protection, personal mitigation, and the overarching principle of proportionality. The cooperation demonstrated by prosecution and defence teams is noted with appreciation. The court also acknowledges the engagement of community support organisations, notably the Barking East Neighbourhood Support Network, whose written submissions provide insights into the broader socio-economic context in which offending occurs, without seeking to excuse it. Their efforts to support both victims and offenders reveal the complex web of interdependencies involved in addressing acquisitive crime. The Theft Act 1968 remains the principal legislative source governing offences such as those before the court. Shoplifting, while often perceived as a low-level offence, has evolved substantially in its patterns and methods, prompting the Sentencing Council to issue updated guidelines on theft offences in 2023. Those guidelines reinforce that repeated offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, and the aggravating impact on victims and local commerce properly attract increased custodial considerations. Cases such as R v. Fairbairn [2019] EWCA Crim 465 illuminate the court’s approach to repeated shoplifting where the defendant exhibits persistence despite prior sanctions and community interventions. There, a sentence of 21 months’ immediate custody was upheld, reflecting the destabilising effect on small businesses and workforce morale. Similarly, the decision in R v. Cheung [2022] EWCA Crim 1307 highlighted the court’s recognition of the cumulative harm inflicted by serial theft from independent retailers, emphasizing the psychological distress on staff and the erosion of community trust. In comparative terms, cases involving offenders with prior convictions who breach bail or community orders—as in R v. Connors [2021] EWCA Crim 990—are illustrative of reluctance to desist and warrant sentences that convey clear denunciation and deterrence. While your circumstances diverge in specifics, these authorities form the backdrop against which the present sentencing exercise must be viewed. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. It is well-recognised that serial acquisitive offences, though often involving items of modest monetary value, propagate disproportionate social harm. The aggregate effect of sustained dishonesty corrodes the operational viability of small and medium enterprises, fosters an atmosphere of suspicion and vigilance, and contributes to a deterioration of public order. Staff often face increased pressures, leading to disrupted work patterns and operational constraints that erode service quality and employee welfare. Indeed, retail crime reduction forums have repeatedly documented the strain placed on in-store and security personnel forced to contend with frequent losses, the deployment of enhanced security measures, and the psychological toll exacted by exposure to persistent offending. From a prosecutorial standpoint, there is a growing imperative to approach such offending not as isolated lapses, but as patterns indicative of underlying risk and recidivism. Your case falls precisely into this categorisation. This court is mindful of the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in managing the competing demands posed by acquisitive crime alongside serious organised and violent crime. The allocation of investigative resources to secure your prosecution demonstrates the priority accorded to such offences. Notably, electronic evidence was gathered through a carefully coordinated partnership between police digital forensic units and local retail security teams, highlighting the evolving nature of intelligence-led policing. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. Your personal circumstances, as detailed in the Probation Service’s pre-sentence report dated 10 September 2025, reflect a complex interplay of adverse experiences, economic hardship, and intermittent engagement with support agencies. You are recorded as currently unemployed, residing in temporary accommodation provided by the Barking Housing Association, and having a limited support network. The report sensibly observes that while you suffer no recognised severe mental health disorders, there persists a degree of emotional dysregulation and impulsivity that may have contributed to your offending behaviour. Critically, the report emphasises variable compliance with offered support, particularly in relation to debt counselling and alcohol misuse services. The court notes with concern that despite multiple outreach attempts, your engagement has been sporadic, limiting the effectiveness of therapeutic and rehabilitative interventions. It is essential to reaffirm that the existence of such services does not in itself absolve an offender of responsibility; rather, successful rehabilitation depends on meaningful uptake and sustained participation. Correspondence from the Barking Homelessness Prevention Team, received on 5 September 2025, underscores the acute pressures exerted on local housing provision, with substantial waiting lists and a predominance of temporary accommodation placements. This context, while undoubtedly challenging, cannot excuse or justify persistent offending. The capacity constraints across statutory and voluntary sectors are a sobering reality, reflecting broader social fractures rather than individual excuses. In this vein, the court reflects on the position taken in R v. Murphy [2020] EWCA Crim 789, where challenging life circumstances were acknowledged as mitigating factors but did not preclude the imposition of immediate custodial sentences given the public interest in deterrence and denunciation. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. Incident-specific Considerations and Victim Impact The Crown has adduced testimony and victim impact statements from staff at the affected retail outlets, which form a central part of the sentencing picture. Victims describe heightened anxiety during work, shifting schedules to avoid lone working, and in some cases, the withdrawal of staff from previously routine duties. Such disruption has economic and emotional implications that extend beyond the immediate value of stolen goods, diminishing workplace morale and fostering an environment of fear and uncertainty. One victim statement, from the manager of Eastwood Pharmacy, was particularly measured, reflecting professionalism yet acknowledging the lingering sense of vulnerability occasioned by repeat thefts. Staff turnover is noted to have increased, attributable in part to these sustained pressures. Moreover, the theft of certain over-the-counter pharmaceutical products carries potential health risks for the wider community by depleting available supplies. Mr H used a question about Oyster Card transactions to divert the shopkeeper’s attention, then leaned over the counter to take a displayed item. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. Parallels with Co-defendant and Associated Case Elements It is relevant to record that related investigations uncovered offences committed by third parties associated with the same retail locations, including one individual charged with dangerous driving in the course of fleeing police, and another facing charges of aggravated criminal damage to shop frontages. None of these acts are attributed to you personally, and there is no evidential basis for holding you accountable for these collateral matters. Nonetheless, the court is mindful of the cumulative impact of multi-faceted offending on public perceptions of safety and order. Additionally, a co-defendant in related proceedings recently received a custodial term for supply of controlled substances, an offence distinct in nature and separated from the theft charges that are the subject of your sentencing. It is important that your sentence reflect your conduct singularly and not become conflated with those associated proceedings, save for insofar as they illuminate the wider context of the offending environment. Your family dynamics, as explored in various reports, reveal little direct involvement, though correspondence from your sister, Ms Janine H., submitted in mitigation, reflects concern for your wellbeing and encouragement towards rehabilitation. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. The psychiatric report prepared by Dr Sarah Eastman is thorough and professionally composed. It indicates no diagnosis of major mental disorder but identifies moderate difficulties with impulse control, intermittent periods of low mood, and traits consistent with borderline personality features. While not sufficiently severe to warrant direct hospital-based treatment, Dr Eastman recommends structured psychological interventions focusing on cognitive-behavioural techniques aimed at improving emotional regulation and decision-making. The report also highlights your ambivalence towards engagement, suggesting that motivational interviewing and peer support groups may assist in fostering longer-term change. The availability of such specialist programmes within the probation service varies and is contingent on current caseloads and funding. It is regrettable that these resources are limited, as demand often exceeds supply. Recent publications on prison mental health indicate growing recognition of the difficulties offenders face in accessing consistent and meaningful support. A report by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2024 has called for enhanced coordination between health providers and criminal justice agencies to better manage cases with complex needs. While such initiatives offer promise for the future, the present case requires sentencing in the context of existing structures and available services. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. This court is acutely conscious of the need to protect the public, deter further offending, and promote rehabilitation. The balance between denunciation and therapeutic opportunity is a delicate one, particularly where offences are non-violent yet persistent, and where the offender’s social circumstances both invite sympathy and caution. The Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences articulates a starting point that reflects culpability and harm, adjusted for aggravating and mitigating factors. In your instance, aggravation arises from repetition, breach of prior conditions, and impact on vulnerable premises. Mitigation includes personal difficulties, absence of violence, and a belated guilty plea. Guidance from R v. Neville [2018] EWCA Crim 1294 advises that early engagement with rehabilitation and genuine acceptance of responsibility should attract appropriate credit, but that such factors do not diminish the need for community protection where offending is entrenched. Additionally, the role of unpaid work requirements, financial penalties, and structured activity within community sentences must be calibrated carefully against risk and likelihood of compliance. Community rehabilitation orders have proven effective in reducing reoffending in many acquisitive crime contexts, provided requisite supervision and support are maintained. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. In light of the foregoing, I shall defer sentence to allow the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by your appointed probation officer. That report should include assessment of your suitability for community programmes targeting acquisitive offending, mental health and substance misuse support, and any viable restorative justice avenues. It should also consider risk of reoffending and public protection needs. Sentencing will be fixed upon receipt and consideration of that report. In the interim, the court hopes you will reflect on the gravity of your conduct and embrace the opportunity for positive change. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Royal Barking Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to relevant agencies pursuant to statutory obligations. You are reminded of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT WATLING R v. MR H Case No. W2025/13456 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. RADCLIFFE Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced following your conviction for theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans a period of approximately eighteen months, during which you targeted multiple retail establishments within the Watling and surrounding boroughs. The Crown proceeded on a representative indictment consolidating a series of incidents under one charge, reflecting a course of conduct rather than isolated acts. Procedural Context This matter has traversed the criminal justice system with procedural precision, albeit not without delay. You were arrested on 2 April 2025 following an investigation coordinated between the Watling Metropolitan Police Service, local business security personnel, and the Watling Retail Crime Partnership. The investigative work was characterised by a concerted effort to collate digital evidence, with the police deploying advanced CCTV analytics alongside witness interviews to build a corroborative evidential picture. The arrest itself did not occur in isolation; it came after several weeks of targeted surveillance. Officers employed a combination of covert observation and data intelligence, which included metadata assessment of public transport usage coupled with fixed camera footage from retail premises. The operational commitment required for such investigations is notable, given the highly reactive demands placed on frontline officers at a time of significant resource constraints. The ever-increasing burden presented by non-serious crime constitutes a pressing challenge for policing agencies nationwide, and cases such as this one illustrate the tensions between finite personnel and the need for comprehensive evidential gathering. It is necessary here to remark upon the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of the defence solicitor’s funding applications. Regrettably, there were repeated administrative delays in approving requests for independent psychological assessments, which elongated the timetable for the preparation of pre-sentence reports and defence mitigation submissions. Such delays are far from uncommon and continue to frustrate the timely progression of cases. The court holds serious reservations about the impact of these systemic inefficiencies on the equitable administration of justice. The initial listing was for 16 June 2025 but was adjourned at the defence’s application to secure fresh medical evidence from Dr Eleanor Gilmore, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose report was ultimately received only in early August. This demonstrates the often unavoidable interaction between medical and legal timetables, especially in cases where assessment of mental health or cognitive function is relevant to sentencing options. Notably, the Better Case Management (BCM) framework was engaged early in the proceedings, facilitating the exchange of evidence and reducing unnecessary adjournments. Such practice is by now standard but nonetheless worthy of acknowledgment amid concerns about the general pace of criminal proceedings. For this, I commend the prosecution and defence teams for their continued professional diligence. The courtroom itself has recently undergone refurbishment. The layout now provides greater accessibility and improves acoustics, an important consideration given the length and complexity of some trials and sentencing hearings. Court officers have reported improved efficiency in case management, further contributing to the smooth conduct of proceedings. The analytical framework for sentencing in theft offences is well established. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines the offence with a clear focus on dishonesty and intent to permanently deprive the owner of property. Shoplifting sits within a spectrum of acquisitive crimes closely scrutinised by sentencing guidelines and appellate jurisprudence due to their common occurrence and cumulative impact. Although your offences are non-violent in nature, the effect on victims — particularly small businesses and shop staff — is well documented. Repeated offending exacerbates the financial strain on proprietors already contending with increasing overheads and economic uncertainty. The recent Sentencing Council guideline for theft, updated in late 2023, emphasises several factors pertinent to your case: the persistence of offending behaviour, the degree of premeditation, the vulnerability of victims and premises, the use of concealment or distraction tactics, and prior criminal history. Reference is made to R v. Samson [2023] EWCA Crim 2785, where the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant found to have stolen electronic goods across multiple visits to various stores. The Court stressed that repetition and planning elevate culpability and that the psychological toll on staff — including anxiety and fears of confrontation — must be accounted for in sentencing. Similarly, R v. Eastwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1740 highlighted the aggravating role of offending targeted at independent retailers whose margins and resilience are particularly susceptible to theft. It is also instructive to consider R v. McTavish [2021] EWCA Crim 1468, which addressed the limited availability of credit for late guilty pleas when pleas are entered only days before trial. The Court reaffirmed the principle outlined in R v. Lawrence [2022] EWCA Crim 1901 that the timing of the plea is critical to the assessment of remorse and mitigation. Given your plea was entered at this advanced stage, the sanction of reduced credit applies. The court is acutely aware of the principle that sentences should be proportionate and individualised. The statutory aim remains the protection of the public, the punishment of offenders, and the reduction of reoffending through rehabilitative measures wherever possible. The facts of the case are as follows: Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. The initial trigger for investigation was a series of reports received between September 2023 and January 2024 by the Watling Business Crime Reduction Partnership, which maintains a live register of suspected shoplifters operating in the area. Retailers involved ranged from national chain outlets to smaller stores in district shopping centres. Incident data included descriptions, time stamps, and recordings from CCTV, many of which documented your presence and actions during periods of theft. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. The prosecution relied heavily on video evidence and witness accounts from store employees. Some witnesses described you as adopting a methodical approach, deliberately selecting high-demand items such as cosmetics, over-the-counter medications, and confectionery, then concealing them beneath clothing or in bags. There was evidence you used distraction techniques, including feigning phone calls or engaging staff in conversation to divert attention while placing goods out of sight. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. One store manager provided a detailed victim impact statement. They recounted the disruption to staffing arrangements caused by your repeated visits — including alterations in shift patterns, extra security measures, and increased stress among employees, some of whom requested transfers due to anxiety over potential confrontations. Though no physical violence occurred, the psychological impact was significant. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. Victim liaison officers and the local Retail Support and Recovery Network have been engaged throughout. These voluntary-sector organisations operate under severe budgetary pressures but continue to provide valuable assistance to both victims and perpetrators in seeking redress and rehabilitation. Their contributions to the sentencing process — including written submissions and support statements — are deserving of recognition. Intriguingly, though unrelated to your charge, it is noteworthy that one of the co-defendants associated with a separate multi-count burglary case in the Watling region was found to have assaulted arresting officers with a makeshift weapon. That co-defendant’s trial was heard concurrently in another courtroom, without any intersection to your proceedings. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. Dr Gilmore’s psychiatric report is comprehensive. She found no evidence of major mental illness or psychosis but noted traits of emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and a degree of evasiveness regarding personal circumstances. She commented on a pattern of low engagement with statutory support systems and expressed concern over your present levels of social isolation. While recommending no custodial psychiatric intervention at this stage, Dr Gilmore noted that community forensic liaison could be beneficial as part of a post-sentence support framework. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. The pre-sentence report, prepared by Probation Officer Sarah Markham, provides context to your offending and personal circumstances. Ms Markham highlights your current lack of stable housing although there is no present evidence of substance misuse or involvement in gang activity. The report records your limited employment history and inconsistent engagement with previous diversionary interventions. Ms Markham expresses concern at your refusal to engage with local housing support services, despite repeated opportunities and assistance from outreach teams. The probation outlook is cautiously optimistic, given the absence of violence or severe mental health issues, but emphasises the need for structured rehabilitative programmes aimed at decision-making, impulse control, and financial management. It is germane to mention the increasing strain on the Probation Service nationally, which has suffered staff shortages and budget reductions over the past years. These pressures have been compounded by rising caseloads involving low-level acquisitive crime, putting further constraints on community supervision capacity. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. The court takes note of correspondence from ShelterWatling, a local homelessness charity, acknowledging their ongoing attempts to make contact with you. Their letter emphasises the challenges faced by all agencies involved in supporting individuals caught in cycles of offending and unstable accommodation. It speaks to the broader societal context in which offences such as yours arise, reminding the court of the necessity — and difficulty — of integrating criminal justice with social care. Beyond the immediate scope of your offending, it is pertinent to observe the continuing rise in street homelessness and beggary in the Watling area, contributing to a sense of unease in public spaces. While no direct link is established here, the court is mindful of the multifaceted challenges faced by vulnerable individuals, including intersectional deprivation, mental health difficulties, and marginalisation. The Royal Institution of Retail Crime Prevention recently published a report indicating that shoplifting accounts for approximately 35% of all retail losses nationally, with the majority being low-value but repetitive offences. Their research underlines the disproportionate burden on small retailers, many of whom operate at minimal margins and lack the resources for enhanced security. A further and unrelated note: the trial of D Simmons, charged with environmental offences at the nearby Greenbelt Conservation Area, currently occupies considerable court room resources. That case involves illegal fly-tipping and subsequent ecological damage, and has caused some administrative knock-on effects, including scheduling shortages that have impacted listing options across this court. At this juncture, the court must weigh a number of mitigating and aggravating factors before determining an appropriate sentence. The aggravating features include the sustained nature of the offending, the deliberate method employed, the psychological impact on victims and retail staff, and your previous convictions for like offences, including a community order breach in 2023. Mitigating factors include your plea of guilty, albeit late in the process, the absence of any threats, violence or weapon use, and some history of attempts to engage with support services, even if inconsistently. The court acknowledges the impact of social determinants in your circumstances — unstable housing, financial precarity, and limited employment opportunities. Nevertheless, these factors neither excuse nor justify a heading into a pattern of criminality; rather, they contextualise it. As noted in R v. Brennan [2024] EWCA Crim 2123, a case concerning repeat low-level retail theft, a balanced sentencing approach must seek to promote rehabilitation while delivering deterrence and maintaining public confidence. That case endorsed the use of structured community orders with a focus on cognitive behavioural therapy and financial management training in appropriate cases. Custodial sentences remain justified where there is evidence of persistent disregard for the law and repeated failure to engage with diversionary measures. Your previous record, including a caution and two convictions for similar theft offences dating back to 2021 and 2022, demonstrate a regrettable pattern of recidivism. Attempts at community-based disposals have evidently not produced sustained compliance or desistance. It is the duty of the court to protect local businesses and the public at large from the harm caused by such courses of conduct. Though your behaviour did not involve physical harm, the dimensions of economic loss, staff anxiety, and diminished retail confidence are material and must be reflected in the sentence. The court is mindful also of the need to ensure any disposal balances public protection with the prospect of rehabilitation; this requires access to appropriate programmes and support mechanisms, which the probation service will be tasked to identify and recommend. Mr H stated in interview that he frequently takes items, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. In light of the above, I intend to defer sentence to allow receipt of a full and updated pre-sentence report incorporating the latest psychiatric findings and any further relevant information concerning your circumstances. This will enable the court to impose a measured and informed sentence calibrated to your risk of reoffending and prospects for rehabilitation. I must reiterate my thanks to counsel for their submissions today. Ms Tara Jenkins has appeared for the Crown with professionalism and clarity, while Mr Declan Reeves has represented you diligently under a Legal Aid representation order, notwithstanding the inevitable challenges posed by delayed expert funding and support. The hearing is conducted in open court. I trust that the judicial and administrative bodies involved in this matter will continue to work towards efficient, proportionate and just outcomes, not least in recognition of the substantial pressures facing all agencies involved — from policing and probation to voluntary sector providers and legal services. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal any sentence imposed within the prescribed period. There are no reporting restrictions engaged in these proceedings. Costs are reserved pending sentencing. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 6 at Watling Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentencing hearing is scheduled for 5 November 2025, pending the receipt of reports and submissions. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON R v. MR H Case No. B2025/17429 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. P. Calloway Filed: 27 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in relation to a representative count of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour charged reflects a longer course of conduct throughout 2024 and early 2025, principally in retail outlets situated within Brighton city centre and adjacent seafront districts. Procedural and Investigative Overview The charges before the court stem from an investigation instigated by Brighton and Hove City Police’s dedicated Retail Crime Unit, working in conjunction with the newly formed Sussex Business Crime Alliance. The Alliance aims to improve coordination between law enforcement and local traders by fostering enhanced intelligence-sharing, rapid incident reporting, and joint targeted patrols. The origin of this inquiry lies in incident reports submitted by multiple retail outlets suffering consistent stock loss and suspicious customer activity believed linked to a common suspect. These businesses ranged from small independent chemists to larger chain convenience stores. The investigation progressed through painstaking collation of photographic and video surveillance, inventory reconciliation, and detailed witness statements from store personnel. This extensive assembly of evidence was crucial, as the offences fall within the category of “low value but high impact” thefts, which present particular challenges for the criminal justice process. While individual dollar values at issue per theft were modest, their cumulative drain on business sustainability and staff wellbeing was far from negligible. This court is well acquainted with the practical difficulties inherent in prosecuting retail theft. The volume of cases routinely exceeds frontline capacity, and the evidential standard required for conviction demands precision. CCTV footage often suffers from poor image quality, and subject identification can be impeded by variations in subject clothing or occlusions. This places considerable burden on prosecutors, many of whom must balance thoroughness against the competing demands of case preparedness for higher-profile matters. The Brighton Business Crime Alliance, though only recently established, has demonstrated some degree of effectiveness according to internal reviews. Its capacity to bring together police officers, store security managers, local council licensing teams and community liaison officers remains constrained by fluctuating budgets and personnel shortages, but it has facilitated faster responses to recurring incidents and engendered modest improvements in proactive offender management strategies. It is hoped that such partnerships will continue to evolve with expanding remit and resources, though in many respects the day-to-day work remains largely painstaking and discrete. In due course, police officers executing search warrants recovered personal effects belonging to you, as well as goods subsequently identified by victims as stolen property. Forensic examination matched fibres found in your clothing to those taken from a number of premises that had reported thefts during the material period. Owing to the accumulation of these investigative elements, bail was refused on the grounds of flight risk and potential reoffending, and your remand ordered forthwith. The matter was first listed before the magistrates on 14 March 2025. However, owing to complexity and anticipated volume of evidence, the decision was taken to allocate the case for Crown Court trial under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme. This is in line with the procedural framework promulgated under the Criminal Procedure Rules, intended to promote early clarity and efficient progression of indictable and triable either-way offences. The BCM hearings proceeded with an initial case management hearing on 21 April, and a subsequent pre-trial review on 18 June. Both hearings reflected the standard practice of addressing evidential readiness, disclosure issues, and any applications pertaining to expert evidence. Thereafter, the plea and trial preparation hearing was scheduled for 30 July, at which you entered a guilty plea to the single representative count. This late plea conforms with a pattern encountered all too frequently, whereby defendants avail themselves of the well-established mechanism to contest prosecution through protracted procedural avenues before acknowledging culpability once conviction is inevitable. That your plea was not entered at the earliest opportunity necessarily tempers the extent of mitigation the court may consider. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Lowther [2023] EWCA Crim 2030 makes clear that the timing and sincerity of guilty pleas remain determinant factors in assessing discount. Mr Lowther’s unsuccessful appeal concerned a burglary charge where the defendant pleaded guilty at trial, offering minimal assistance in expedition or procedural economy. The judgment unequivocally stated that late pleas, while lawful, ought not to be met with automatic leniency but rather subjected to judicial scrutiny and proportionate adjustment. Further authority of note includes R v. Twining [2024] EWCA Crim 1174, which examined the impact of repeated reoffending in acquisitive crime contexts. The Court underlined the importance of confronting continued criminality with appropriately increased severity, particularly where prior warnings and diversion schemes had failed to yield desistance. I would also make reference, however tangential, to the case of R v. Fenwick [2019] EWCA Crim 450, which involved aggravated trespass at a rural agricultural site. Though unrelated to the present facts, it serves as a judicial touchstone for distinguishing between offences that are straightforward breaches of property rights and those that carry broader implications for community safety or environmental harm. Fenwick reinforces the principle that courts must weigh carefully the public interest in safeguarding shared spaces from incursions, a consideration that, while unlikely to apply here, contextualises sentencing jurisprudence. Beyond the criminal law, the procedural course has been complicated somewhat by administrative delays experienced in obtaining authority to instruct a forensic psychiatric expert. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted response times, documented in correspondence dated 11 May and 7 June respectively, occasioned postponements in hearing dates and limited the defence’s ability to prepare mitigation material. It is regrettable that funding bureaucracy so frequently impedes litigant rights to timely assessments, a phenomenon lamented in multiple civil society reports and parliamentary inquiries. A further complication arose with relation to continuity of representation; your initial solicitor withdrew due to conflict and was replaced on 3 July. While Ms Eleanor Strickland QC has since provided robust advocacy, the disruption occasioned by the transition understandably complicated defence preparation. The court wishes to record its appreciation for the written representations of the Brighton Retailers’ Association, as well as victim impact statements tendered by individual store managers across affected locations. These statements articulate not merely financial loss but the cumulative erosion of staff morale and the necessity of operational adjustments, such as shortened opening hours and increased security protocols. They highlight the psychological toll on employees, who described feelings of vulnerability and intimidation notwithstanding the non-violent nature of the offences. Notably, the Brighton Support Network for Retail Workers (BSNRW) has provided evidence on the wellbeing consequences of such offending. The network emphasises the growing prevalence of stress-related absenteeism and burnout among shop staff consequent to persistent thefts. Their submission additionally noted the impact on recruitment and retention, with certain retail workers citing safety concerns as a factor in declining role continuation. This is emblematic of a wider landscape in which retail offences, although categorised as “volume crime,” exert a disproportionate effect on vulnerable workers. The court does not underestimate these consequences and takes the views conveyed most seriously when calibrating an appropriate sentence. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. It should be noted that staff interviewed during the investigation frequently remarked upon the pattern of offending as “methodical” and “opportunistic,” with particular targeting of aisles displaying toiletries, over-the-counter medicines, and high-resale-value consumables. Such deliberate conduct militates against any inference of casual or spur-of-the-moment theft. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. Within the social context, Brighton continues to grapple with entrenched socioeconomic challenges, including rising homelessness, substance dependency issues, and constrained social services capacity. These broader factors are neither an excuse nor a justification for criminal activity, yet they intersect with offender profiles in complex ways. The present case, involving a defendant without stable accommodation and with sporadic engagement with voluntary support agencies, exemplifies these entanglements. Dr Alice Henshaw, consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed on behalf of the defence, provided a comprehensive report dated 21 August 2025. Her assessment concludes that while Mr H does not meet the threshold for a major mental disorder, he exhibits traits consistent with impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and mild substance use dependency. Dr Henshaw emphasises the interplay between psychosocial stressors—namely financial hardship, unstable housing, and lack of structured daily routine—and your offending behaviour. Her recommendations advocate for enhanced mental health outreach and engagement with community drug and alcohol treatment programmes alongside cognitive behavioural therapy focusing on decision-making. While the report is clinically detailed and professionally cogent, the court is mindful that mitigation arising from such findings must be balanced against the necessity to uphold public protection and confidence. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the presence of mental disorder, in and of itself, does not preclude appropriate custodial sentencing where criminal conduct evidences persistent disregard for public safety. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. Historical social care records disclose intermittent contact with child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in the defendant’s teenage years, beginning at approximately age 14. While those records indicate episodes of anxiety and low mood, no sustained diagnosis or inpatient admissions were recorded, and there is no evidence of psychosis or substance-induced psychotic episodes. Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. The social services department of Brighton and Hove City Council provided documentation indicating periodic involvement from housing support officers attempting to liaise with Mr H over the preceding 18 months. Regrettably, these efforts were met with limited engagement, highlighting the challenge of sustaining meaningful contact with individuals experiencing chaotic life circumstances. It is necessary at this juncture to acknowledge the broader context within which this court operates. Criminal justice practitioners today contend with a system under profound strain: rising case volumes, constrained budgets, and workforce shortages compound the complexity of delivering timely justice. The Sussex Probation Service, while committed to evidence-based rehabilitative endeavors, operates at reduced staffing ratios with prevalent caseload overspills. This often impedes proactive supervision and the thorough implementation of community sentences or diversionary orders. Correspondingly, the Legal Aid Agency struggles with procedural backlogs aggravated by shifting eligibility criteria and technology challenges, as observed in parliamentary committee reports from earlier this year. Moreover, courts themselves face persistent obstacles such as intermittent industrial action impacting court clerks and judges, outdated physical infrastructure limiting capacity, and the ever-growing demand for digital case management platforms. These factors collectively influence the pace and thoroughness with which cases progress from charge to resolution. In sentencing, these systemic pressures must never dilute the imperative for proportionate justice. However, they provide a backdrop against which decisions on sentencing type and length must be situated directionally, including choices to divert suitable offenders from custody where possible. The court is grateful to the legal teams on both sides—particularly to Ms Imogen Yeats for the Crown and to Mr Daniel Grey for the defence—whose submissions were measured and professional. Court ushering and administration staff have conducted themselves with commendable efficiency amidst the occasional disruption. Several organisational bodies contributed written statements or reports, including the Brighton Shopfront Safety Partnership and the Sussex Independent Retailers Forum. Their engagement is particularly noteworthy given the deep cuts experienced by local authorities in crime prevention and victim support funding. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. The defendant’s written letter to the court, submitted by his counsel immediately prior to this hearing, was thoughtfully composed and expressed contrition, albeit in measured terms. It acknowledges the strain imposed on local businesses and the discomfort felt by staff. However, the letter also recounts instances of personal hardship without wholly connecting these to personal agency or responsibility. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. The court received a statement from a sister of the defendant, Ms Jemima H., detailing familial background and childhood instability. While such personal history may provide context, it must not be treated as excusing repeated criminal behaviour. As emphasised in R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, hardship and trauma, though real, are not synonymous with absolution. Discussing broader criminal justice developments, it is worth noting that while the Court of Appeal has underscored the importance of early guilty pleas and engagement (\"R v. Heatherton [2022] EWCA Crim 2253\"), it has also clarified that repeated relapses into acquisitive offending attract enhanced custodial consideration (\"R v. Gordon [2023] EWCA Crim 1402\"). While some may regard shoplifting as a “victimless” crime, this court emphatically rejects such characterisation. The cumulative effect on small businesses—many already struggling amid economic downturn and rising rents—can be devastating. Furthermore, the erosion of retail worker morale and the proliferation of security measures to deter theft exact collateral costs that disrupt community cohesion. No doubt there are wider societal forces at play: increased street homelessness and visible begging, an expanding informal economy, and the normalisation of low-level antisocial conduct in some public places. While these phenomena may inform policy discussions, they cannot dilute individual accountability. I record appreciation for the work of volunteers at Brighton’s Haven Project, which provides outreach to vulnerable populations, many of whom are peripheral to but affected by criminal justice interventions. Their insights into behavioural drivers of acquisitive crime highlight the interplay between social marginality and offending behaviour. The court also acknowledges correspondence from the UK Retail Crime Watch, which shares intelligence and best practice guidelines for managing repeat offenders. Their focus on “diversion and rehabilitation first” aligns with current best evidence but underscores the challenge posed by individuals who fail to engage despite available pathways. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. An updated probation pre-sentence report will be critical in the sentencing decision, and the court requests that the probation officer explore all viable community-based interventions including cognitive skills programmes, substance misuse treatment, and supported housing referrals. Consideration of a rehabilitation activity requirement is warranted where appropriate. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. It bears mention that although your previous criminal record includes convictions for theft and minor public order offences, there are no recorded instances of violence or weapons-related charges. There is similarly no suggestion of connection to organised crime groups or networks. Section 78(1) of the Sentencing Act 2020 compels courts to impose sentences proportionate to the offending behaviour, with due regard to harm caused, culpability demonstrated, and personal mitigation. Within the Theft Act 1968 context, the Sentencing Council’s guidelines encourage sentencing reflective of the pattern and impact of offending, with aggravated theft offences attracting higher sentences where offender sophistication or victim vulnerability is evident. Community sentences must be considered where they are suitable and can be monitored effectively; custody remains a last resort but may be appropriate where repeated acquisitive offending shows little prospect of rehabilitation through less restrictive means. Given these principles and the evidence before the court, final sentencing will not be passed today. Rather, the court will await the full pre-sentence report, supplemented by any updated psychiatric or welfare assessments. The hearing today has been conducted in the presence of all parties, with full representation and proper procedure observed. I thank the court staff at Brighton Crown Court for their assistance in facilitating this sitting. These sentencing remarks are issued on 27 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton, pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal conviction or sentence, within the statutory deadlines set out under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. T2026/04587 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. THORNBURY Filed: 13 September 2026 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for a charge of theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, encompassing a series of shoplifting offences committed over an extended period predominantly within the Bristol city centre and adjoining retail districts. The prosecution alleges a sustained course of conduct marked by repeated dishonest appropriation of merchandise from various commercial premises, including independent shops and larger retail chains. Procedural Background Your initial arrest occurred on 18 May 2026, following a multi-agency investigation involving cooperation between local policing teams, retail loss prevention officers, and the Bristol Business Crime Reduction Scheme. The investigation was notable in its scope, entailing the collation of extensive CCTV footage, incident reports, and employee statements. This case was allocated to the Crown Court as part of the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative, with the objective of expediting proceedings and ensuring that all evidential matters were addressed in a timely fashion. The BCM protocol, established in 2016, aims to streamline case progression wherever possible, including setting strict deadlines for disclosure, plea confirmation, and trial readiness. It is appropriate to acknowledge that, notwithstanding occasional delays attributable to administrative pressures within the Legal Aid Agency—which will be further addressed—both counsel and court staff endeavoured to adhere to these timelines, facilitating a degree of procedural efficiency. The listing for sentence has thus proceeded without undue adjournment save for that necessitated by the late commissioning of a psychiatric report. It is regrettably common in cases involving repeat acquisitive offending for initial pleas of not guilty to be entered, only subsequently withdrawn in the face of incontrovertible evidence. Your defence followed this pattern, initially denying involvement at your first hearing on 4 June 2026, but entering a plea of guilty on the morning of the sentencing hearing. Whilst the law rightly permits defendants to pursue every appropriate legal avenue in their defence, the systemic impact of such late pleas must not be overlooked; they impose additional anxiety on victims and retail staff, burden public resources, and contribute to delays across the justice system. During your bail conditions, which included a curfew between 9pm and 6am, there were no reported breaches. The court notes, however, the significant investigatory effort invested by the police, including the deployment of covert surveillance operations and the use of financial data analysis techniques to substantiate the Crown’s case. These methods were authorised by judicial warrant in recognition of the seriousness of the suspected offences and the length of time over which they were alleged to have occurred. The timing and nature of your guilty plea attract consideration in the context of applicable case law governing sentence discounts for admissions. In R v. Harden [2023] EWCA Crim 812, the Court of Appeal reiterated that “the relevance of a plea in mitigation is not absolute but guided principally by its timing and the quality of acceptance of responsibility.” Delayed admissions may accordingly attract reduced credit where they fail to spare the court and witnesses the burden of contesting proof. Your plea, entered at this juncture, thus entitles you to a modest reduction, but far less than would have been afforded had it been tendered earlier. A proportional and measured approach to sentencing is imperative. This court is particularly mindful of the intricacies that underpin infractions of this nature: theft from retail premises may be misconstrued as victimless or inconsequential. Yet, as has been repeatedly affirmed in jurisprudence and social commentary alike, the cumulative impact on shop staff, business viability, and community cohesion is far from negligible. Loss prevention teams face mounting pressures, often in the absence of adequate resources, and employees bear the weight of increased anxiety, altered working patterns, and diminished workplace morale. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. It is, however, equally necessary to situate the offence within a broader societal and institutional landscape. The pressures on policing and community services—exacerbated by budget constraints, staffing shortages, and growing demand—cannot be ignored. Persistent low-level acquisitive crime diverts attention and resources from more serious threats, including violent offences and organised crime networks. The balance of deploying finite investigative capacity is delicate and remains subject to ongoing review by senior police command structures. The court was informed by material from a range of sources, including a detailed psychological report prepared by Dr Jasmin Latham, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, whose evaluation was undertaken subsequent to referral by defence solicitors and approved by the Legal Aid Agency only after protracted correspondence. Regrettably, as is increasingly common, this delay hampered the progression of the case and marginally curtailed the opportunity for robust sentencing submissions informed by expert opinion. Dr Latham’s report, while comprehensive and professionally composed, confirmed the absence of any major mental disorder or psychiatric illness. Rather, it described traits of impulsivity and experiential difficulties consistent with low self-esteem and episodic depressive symptoms, compounded by unemployment and unstable housing circumstances. The analysis cautioned against any inference that such vulnerabilities diminished responsibility or precluded accountability, emphasising instead the importance of targeted community interventions. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. The court must also take note of relevant state agencies and support organisations which, in this case, have engaged pragmatically with the defendant and those impacted. The Bristol Retail Support Network provided written submissions articulating the distress suffered by shop staff and the operational challenges posed by recurrent theft. Similarly, communications from the charity Bristol Shelterlink underscored the tenuous housing situation faced by Mr H and the consequent strain on engagement with rehabilitative services. While these reports reflect well on the broader ecosystem of delivery, it remains the defendant’s obligation to seize offered support. In assessing risk and rehabilitation potential, the Probation Service contributed an initial Offender Assessment System (OASys) analysis, which identified moderate risk of reoffending linked primarily to acquisitive behaviour, poor coping strategies under financial duress, and a lack of stable accommodation. The report advocated a structured intervention plan incorporating cognitive behavioural therapy modules and access to housing and employment assistance. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. The court is acutely aware that repeated offences of this nature can have a destabilising effect on both individual victims and the communities in which they reside. Increased fearfulness amongst retail workers often leads to changes in staffing patterns, the adoption of security measures such as locked display cabinets, and sometimes discouragement of customer footfall in affected areas. The economic ramifications, particularly for small independent stores, are far-reaching—nominal losses in stock are compounded by reputational damage and reduced foot traffic. An instructive parallel emerges from the decision in R v. Fenwick [2020] EWCA Crim 2149, where the Court of Appeal upheld a significant custodial sentence for repeated thefts from charity shops, noting that “the persistent targeting of vulnerable retail operators constitutes a particularly egregious breach of community trust.” While Fenwick’s conduct was arguably more expansive in its scope and impact, the principle that recurrent low-level acquisitive crime merits a firm response is instructive here. The Court also considers the guidance in R v. Skelton [2019] EWCA Crim 1712, dealing with cases of retail theft accompanied by threats or intimidation. There, the sentencing judge was reminded to approach the valuation of psychological harm with care, but to acknowledge that fear and disruption extend beyond material loss. While there is no allegation of violence or intimidation in this matter, the psychological component remains relevant insofar as staff reported distress linked to repeated exposure to offending. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. Turning to the facts of the case as presented, I summarise that evidence demonstrated the use of concealment tactics, deliberate timing during high-customer-volume periods, and occasional interactions exhibiting deceit and misrepresentation. The defendant made multiple entries into stores with concealed bags, sometimes using clothing to obscure merchandise, and employed distraction to divert the attention of employees. On occasion, you stayed in situ despite being challenged, often responding with averred apologies or feigned confusion. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. The court was particularly struck by the consistency of your method and the presence of prior sanctions for similar conduct—including a community resolution order imposed in 2024—and a conditional caution given in early 2025. Despite these interventions, you resumed offending within a short timeframe, suggesting that previous deterrent efforts were ineffectual. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. The accumulative nature of these offences must be stressed. Individually, each instance may appear minor, but collectively they represent sustained and wilful disregard for the property rights of business owners and the welfare of employees. While custodial sentences are not invariably the default response for shoplifting, persistent reoffending and failure to engage with support structures are clear aggravators. During the preparation of your defence, several references were made to your personal history, including childhood adversity, housing instability, and unemployment. The court accepts that such background factors can inform the context of offending. Yet, as established in R v. Collins [2022] EWCA Crim 876, while background may mitigate sentence, it cannot justify continuation of criminal behaviour. Responsibility and choice remain central tenets of the criminal law. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Mr H, the role of public protection weighs heavily in cases of this nature. The court must carefully balance your prospects for rehabilitation with the imperative to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. Shoplifting—though sometimes treated as a “minor” offence—can cause meaningful hardship and unsettle the delicate social contract between traders, customers, and the community at large. Several letters of character and support were submitted by friends, community workers, and housing advisers, all of which attest to your potential and good qualities; however, these must be considered alongside the facts of the offending and your demonstrable failure, thus far, to desist. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, claimed it wasn’t a serious crime and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. The court acknowledges ongoing operational challenges faced by probation and healthcare services in delivering consistent support to individuals wrestling with housing insecurity, substance misuse, or mental health concerns. The Labour Welfare Trust recently published findings highlighting notable delays in accessing cognitive behavioural therapy in the local area, with waiting times extending beyond two years in some cases. Such systemic pressures are regrettable but do not absolve individuals of their duties to engage with available assistance promptly. Furthermore, the court has reviewed correspondence between defence solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency, revealing repeated procedural correspondence concerning authorisation of expert reports and additional documentation. While the justice system endeavors to provide equitable access to representation and support, administrative delays such as those evidenced here inhibit timely justice and impose avoidable burdens on all parties. I apply the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, which emphasises that sentencing must reflect the harm caused, the culpability of the offender, and any aggravating or mitigating factors. The pattern of persistent offending, despite warnings and interventions, signals a high degree of culpability. Mitigating factors include your guilty plea, albeit late, and the complex social background described. Community-based sentences incorporating rehabilitation requirements remain preferable where there is a realistic prospect of compliance and public safety is not compromised. Custodial sentences are reserved for cases where alternative measures have been exhausted or are plainly unsuitable. I have considered the possibility of a suspended sentence order, mindful that repeated breach of prior community resolutions undermines their efficacy. The involvement of probation in formulating a plan that addresses impulsivity, financial management, and housing stability is critical. The potential imposition of a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement or Unpaid Work Order will be considered, subject to the forthcoming pre-sentence report. The court must also bear in mind that shoplifting cases often present complex risk assessments, particularly relating to potential escalation or entrenchment of offending behaviour. Careful monitoring and multi-agency involvement are appropriate safeguards. Finally, it is relevant to observe that this court has recently upgraded the courtroom facilities, including the installation of enhanced sound systems and improved digital evidence presentation suites, which have facilitated the clear and effective administration of justice in cases of this sort. The hearing today has been held in open court. Counsel appearing for the Crown was Ms Sarah Youman, whose submissions were succinct and informative; Mr David Clarke represented you under a Legal Aid order and provided detailed defence submissions. It is appropriate to place on record the quiet diligence of court staff and ushers, who maintain order with admirable professionalism despite the challenges inherent in an increasingly busy court schedule aggravated by periodic strike action affecting registrars and court clerks. I remind you, Mr H, of your rights to appeal pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged in this matter under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. At this stage, I will adjourn sentencing to allow the probation service to prepare a detailed pre-sentence report and, if appropriate, to liaise with local support agencies to identify a package of interventions commensurate with your needs and the public interest. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 13 September 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court in Bristol. A formal transcript of the proceedings has been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant will receive a copy of the report once completed, and the matter will be listed for sentence at the earliest practicable date. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER R v. MR H Case No. M2025/03459 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. C. REDFORD Filed: 21 August 2025 Mr H, you appear for sentence in respect of an indictment alleging multiple counts of theft by shoplifting, in breach of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, committed over a sustained period spanning from late 2023 until your arrest earlier this year. The alleged offending has been linked to a series of retail premises within the Greater Manchester area, with some incidents reportedly occurring at night-time hours in neighbourhoods serviced by small independent retailers alongside larger commercial chains. Procedural History and Preliminary Observations Your case was initially listed before the magistrates’ court on 12 February 2025, where it was sent for trial at the Crown Court pursuant to the features and alleged volume of offences contained within the schedule. This court occupies an intermediate tier within the criminal justice system, entrusted with handling indictable and triable-either-way matters of more serious standing or complexity. The Crown Prosecution Service elected to consolidate the underlying counts into a single representative charge for the purposes of trial and sentencing, a practice commonly employed in cases of repeated offending to avoid distinctly multiplicative sentencing outcomes that might otherwise be disproportionate. Your matter was assigned to Manchester Crown Court’s Wellstone building, a relatively modern facility inaugurated in 2018 and designed to accommodate a range of trial types, from jury trials to sentencing hearings, as well as combined hearings pursuant to specialist domestic violence and youth justice protocols. The courtroom fashioned for your hearing is Courtroom 5, recently refurbished to enhance digital connectivity and soundproofing — specifics which, while laudable, bear little relevance to the substance of these remarks but serve to highlight the incremental investment being made in infrastructure to maintain operational efficacy amidst ever-growing judicial demand. Following your initial appearance, you were remanded on bail, subject to a curfew monitoring order restricting your movement between 8pm and 6am. The conditions of bail were amended twice, on 2 March and subsequently on 14 April, to accommodate changes in your living arrangements. The delays encountered in the listing of your plea and trial preparation hearing were, regrettably, partly due to an ongoing wave of industrial action affecting court staff — particularly legal clerks and court registrars — which resulted in a temporary restriction of hearing slots during March and early April. Those pressures have imposed profound strains not only on case progression but also on the morale and wellbeing of personnel whose diligent and unheralded efforts are critical to the administration of justice. The Better Case Management (BCM) initiative was engaged in your proceedings, enabling robust pre-trial preparation and direct liaison between prosecution and defence counsel along with case officers, with the aim of expediting disclosure, resolving evidential uncertainties, and limiting the necessity for contested hearings where possible. While the BCM process promises to streamline case handling, the practical reality remains that large volumes of material, ongoing investigations, and intermittent disclosure of digital evidence can hinder expeditious resolution. I should take this opportunity to record the court’s appreciation for the professionalism demonstrated by Detective Inspector Simone Burke of the Greater Manchester Police’s Retail Crime Unit, who has overseen the investigative phases of this matter with commendable assiduity despite well-publicised resource shortfalls and the competing demands of significant violent crime investigations in the region. In contrast to these positives, I feel compelled to note, with some regret, the protracted delays in securing prior legal aid approval for expert reports. The initial application to instruct a forensic psychologist — designed to assess the defendant’s cognitive functioning, decision-making capacity, and potential for rehabilitation — faced repeated deferrals and requests for supplementary documentation over nearly six weeks. Such administrative hurdles underscore the ongoing challenges faced by defence practitioners attempting to secure necessary expert input within constrained funding mechanisms. The position is unsatisfactory and places procedural burdens on defendants that are ultimately detrimental to the fair and timely conduct of justice. Upon plea and trial preparation hearing, held on 30 April 2025, you entered a not guilty plea. However, this court notes with concern that your current guilty plea was entered only on the morning of trial, 17 July 2025, after extensive evidential disclosure, including comprehensive CCTV footage analysis and multiple witness statements were disclosed. This pattern of late plea, though within the defendant’s rights, undermines prospects for significant sentence reduction and carries adverse implications for the efficient use of court resources and for individuals expected to give evidence, including retail staff who suffer the consequences of these offences. The law is clear that while credit must be given for guilty pleas, the timing of the plea is material. Consistent with the rulings in R v. Collard [2020] EWCA Crim 1350 and R v. Hamilton [2019] EWCA Crim 1827, credit is diminished where pleas are delayed until the imminence of trial and are not accompanied by genuine remorse or assistance to the court. In this regard, the court must balance the public interest in incentivising early admission of guilt against the need to ensure sentences reflect culpability and promote deterrence. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. The sentencing approach to theft offences is principally guided by the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2018), which sets out factors including harm, culpability, and aggravating or mitigating features. This case engages a category of medium to high culpability due to the planning and persistence evident across multiple incidents. Aggravating factors include the targeting of vulnerable premises and the psychological effect on staff and customers. Mitigation is limited, given the late plea and your prior record. Reference is further made to the appellate guidance deployed in R v. Nixon [2021] EWCA Crim 2005, which concerned theft from charitable retail outlets and emphasised custodial sentences where offences undermine community trust and the essential work of such organisations. While those facts are distinct, the principles regarding proportionate response to offences damaging community infrastructure remain pertinent. Moreover, I note the decision in R v. Ferrell [2017] EWCA Crim 1759, which observed that acquisitive offending, even where involving relatively low-value items, can warrant immediate custody where the conduct forms part of a persistently habitual pattern and where previous interventions have failed. It is alongside this framework that I turn to the particulars of your offending, placed within the factual matrix presented. We live in times characterised by significant social upheaval and economic precarity. In urban centres such as Manchester, the pressures on public services, from housing support to law enforcement and mental health provision, are intense and enduring. The recent collapse of major retail chains in the region, together with rises in street-level antisocial behaviour and visible homelessness, reflect broader structural failures. It is in this environment that shoplifting assumes a complex role — simultaneously symptomatic of social distress, personal hardship, and opportunistic crime. The court notes the observations made in the Home Office Report “Acquisitive Crime and Urban Deprivation” (2023), which highlights a correlation between economic instability and increased frequencies of retail theft. Nevertheless, the judiciary must balance empathy with the imperatives of maintaining public order, safeguarding the vulnerable, and deterring those who exploit hardship as justification for unlawful gain. Notably, in R v. Lamont [2017] EWCA Crim 58, the Court of Appeal underscored that while a defendant’s socioeconomic circumstances may be considered, they do not excuse criminal behaviour, especially where persistent offending undermines community confidence. The facts of the case are as follows: Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. It is apparent from the evidence that your offending involved deliberate selection of high-demand items, executed with tactics designed to evade detection, including the removal or concealment of security tags and timed movements during busy periods. The manner of approach aligns with narratives presented in a recent intelligence briefing by the North West Business Crime Reduction Steering Group, which noted a rising pattern of “layered apparel” concealment techniques deployed by serial shoplifters. Compounding these offences is the impact on retail workers, many of whom report increased stress and psychological trauma arising from repeated encounters with such incidents. Victim impact statements consensually submitted to this court attest to anxiety, need for workplace adjustments, and in some instances, formal counselling referrals requested by staff. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. During the course of investigations, it emerged that the defendant failed to satisfy requirements of prior community resolutions, including an engagement programme with a third-sector agency offering budgeting and employment consultancy. This pattern strongly suggests a lack of sufficient rehabilitative effort. The investigation engaged various local agencies, including the Manchester Integrated Offender Management Team, which attempts to co-ordinate care and supervision of repeat acquisitive offenders. Liaison with the local authority housing teams also revealed fluctuating accommodation stability for the defendant, though not of a nature that provided legitimate grounds for repeated offending. This case brings into sharp relief the systemic challenges posed by the limitations of existing intervention programmes. The Probation Service, for example, continues to experience unprecedented caseloads and staffing shortages, undermining its ability to deliver bespoke rehabilitative services. As Coroner’s reports and recent audits reveal, rising caseloads are attributable not only to increased referrals but also to high turnover rates. It is further worth noting that your case shares some procedural elements with the recent case of R v. Bentley [2025] MCR 432, where a defendant was convicted of criminal damage and aggravated theft; in that case, custodial sentences were deemed necessary despite pleas in mitigation relating to mental health vulnerability. The inclusion of complex psychiatric considerations in multimodal sentencing hearings is increasingly commonplace and presents significant demands on court timetabling and expert resources. In the present matter, the psychiatric report composed by Dr Imran Khalid, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was submitted on 14 June 2025. The report is noted for the quality of its detail and professional insight. Dr Khalid’s assessment found no major mental illness but indicated heightened levels of anxiety, low frustration tolerance, and trait impulsivity. The substance misuse history was recorded but noted not to reach the threshold for dependency. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. The report suggests that rehabilitation would benefit from structured cognitive-behavioural therapy and supervised engagement with social support services aimed at financial resilience and anxiety management. Unfortunately, the defendant’s engagement with prior voluntary schemes has been inconsistent. Earlier, on 25 May 2025, the court received a letter from the local charity “Urban Outreach Initiative,” which provides support to homeless and vulnerably housed persons. While the letter lent some support to the notion that Mr H had intermittent contact with their drop-in centre, it made clear the challenges faced in maintaining regular attendance or sustained participation in activities designed to enhance life stability. This dovetails with the probation officer’s oral evidence at the sentencing review hearing of 10 August 2025, which emphasised the difficulties in establishing coherent supervision plans absent defendant cooperation. Historical case law provides further background, notably R v. Pearce [2016] EWCA Crim 230, which emphasised that persistent disorderly or acquisitive conduct with negligible engagement in rehabilitative interventions often militates in favour of custodial penalties. The victim impact statements derived from multiple retail outlets, including High Street Pharmacies and independent grocers, detail the financial and psychological impact of the offences. These stores reported increased shrinkage beyond immediate theft value, attributed to both stock damage and the necessity for heightened security measures — such as additional tags, staff training, and installation of CCTV systems. Such reactive measures impose significant costs, frequently absorbed by small businesses already operating on tenuous margins. Supporting third parties include the Manchester Retail Support Network, which has engaged with affected stores and offered victim liaison services. Their correspondence reflects ongoing concerns about the normalization of acquisitive crime and its corrosive effect on worker morale and community cohesion. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. The offences before this court constitute a course of conduct involving planning, persistence, and an evident disregard for the impact on victims and community stakeholders. While your guilty plea is formally accepted, it was delivered at the last opportunity and does not attract the full extent of mitigation. The court has given weight to the absence of serious violence, the psychiatric assessments, and the mitigating circumstances relating to housing and financial precarity. However, these factors are insufficient to displace the need for a sentence indicative of the offender’s level of culpability and the deterrent principles that underpin public confidence in the criminal justice system. There is a legitimate expectation that the court will punish, deter, and seek to rehabilitate when possible, delivering a sentence that reflects the balance of these aims. A pre-sentence report will be prepared by your supervising probation officer, with particular attention paid to suitability for community-based interventions that incorporate cognitive skills training, financial management support, and mental health engagement. The court reserves final determination of sentence pending receipt and consideration of this report, alongside any further representations the defence or prosecution wish to make. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 21 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be duly transmitted to the relevant authorities. You are reminded of your right of appeal within 28 calendar days of this judgment as per the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are in place. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT CHELSEA R v. MR H Case No. T2025/14327 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F. Bartholomew Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H, you appear today for sentence before this court in respect of a charge of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending in question pertains to a series of thefts from multiple retail establishments in the Kensington and Chelsea area, spanning a period of approximately fourteen months. The Crown contends that your actions comprise a clear pattern of deliberate and persistent dishonesty directed at businesses providing essential goods and services within the community. Procedural History Following initial reports from local retailers identifying a pattern of repeated losses, a coordinated investigation was initiated by the Kensington Business Crime Reduction Unit in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police Service’s Borough Crime Team. The investigative phase encompassed a mixture of covert surveillance, confidential source intelligence gathering, analysis of multiple CCTV systems across borough StoreWatch schemes, and targeted interviews with witnesses and staff. This multi-faceted approach typifies the current paradigm of law enforcement where partnership working is essential given constrained operational resources. Such efforts represent not only considerable police time and expenditure but also require patient coordination among numerous agencies whose monthly workloads continue to expand without proportional augmentation in funding or personnel. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. These investigations, however resource-intensive, play an indispensable role in upholding the integrity of the retail environment—particularly at a time when economic pressures on small businesses continue to escalate. The growing phenomenon colloquially referred to within police circles as “shrinkage” — the combined effect of theft, administrative error, and supplier fault — poses an ongoing challenge to sustainable retail operation and local employment. It is not uncommon for law enforcement teams to grapple with the competing demands of deploying assets to both high-profile violent crime and persistent low-level acquisitive offences, yet both categories attract legitimate public concern. As defined in R v. Shepherd [2019] EWCA Crim 1234, the prosecution of repetitive theft offences must balance considerations of proportionality with the evident cumulative detriment caused to victims. On 12 March 2025, you were apprehended by police officers following an incident at a high street pharmacy in Fulham. At that point, officers conducted a search resulting in the seizure of items later identified as stolen property. Your subsequent interview under caution was initially marked by a denial of involvement; however, further evidence — notably matching CCTV footage and exhibits recovered from your place of residence — undermined that position. Charges were formally preferred on 25 March and the case was listed for hearing at the Crown Court under the Better Case Management protocol. It is worth noting, notwithstanding, that this matter did not proceed without some delay. The court registry records demonstrate that adjournments were necessitated on occasions owing to defence Counsel’s applications for additional time to secure Legal Aid instructions and for the commissioning of an independent psychiatric assessment. Such procedural itineraries, while regrettable, are not uncommon in cases involving vulnerable defendants or where expert input is complex and time-consuming. The court is, however, mindful of the imperative to balance the accused’s rights to a fair and timely hearing with the systemic need to avoid undue prolongation of proceedings. Your initial plea at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 14 May was one of not guilty. Subsequent disclosure of further evidence — including witness statements from store personnel and more extensive forensic linkage — has since prompted you to enter a guilty plea on the morning of trial, on 1 August 2025. The court would remind all parties that the principles governing guilty plea discounts are well settled. As in R v. Bancroft [2020] EWCA Crim 1052, the timeliness of the plea is critical; earlier admissions permit more meaningful savings in court time and resource, as well as sparing witnesses the ordeal of attending trial. A late plea, entered only after the Crown’s case becomes irrefutable, attracts proportionately reduced credit. This approach was further reinforced in R v. Cromwell [2023] EWCA Crim 86, where the court highlighted that procedural gaming diminishes the weight of any plea mitigation. The court is aware of the broader context in which retail theft occurs, characterised by a gradual yet unmistakable escalation in frequency over recent years. This trend has coincided with socioeconomic challenges, including increased homelessness, food insecurity, and mental health difficulties among the urban populace. While some offenders may be drawn into offending due to acute deprivation or addiction, others may exploit systemic vulnerabilities or the reduced presence of security personnel in smaller shops. The proliferation of “no questions asked” return policies by some retailers also complicates the recovery of stock and positive deterrence. However, it must be underscored that such contextual factors do not exculpate criminal conduct. The rule of law dictates individual accountability, and this court cannot condone persistent breaches of public trust, nor the disruption caused to legitimate business activity, however modest the immediate monetary value. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. Reference is made to the Local Government Act 1972 which established the framework for modern borough councils, including Kensington and Chelsea. This local authority has, over the years, developed partnership arrangements with law enforcement and business stakeholders designed to share information on repeat offenders and apply targeted interventions such as civil injunctions and community protection notices. The so-called Community Safety Partnerships thus convene regularly to address priority crime issues, including shoplifting hotspots identified through intelligence-led profiling. Despite these initiatives, challenges remain in adequately resourcing effective responses in light of competing demands such as anti-social behaviour, public nuisance, and violent crime. Within this framework, the Crown submits that your offending contributed to both direct financial loss and an atmosphere of unease amongst shop staff, some of whom have reported feeling anxious about lone working or subject to intimidation when approaching suspected offenders. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. It is appropriate here to acknowledge the efforts of the Safer Streets initiative, which, since its inception in 2022, has sought to reduce acquisitive crime through environmental design improvements such as increased lighting, installation of facial recognition cameras, and increased patrols in known “hot spot” zones. The scheme’s evaluation reports indicate some success in reducing overall theft-related incidents, but also document displacement effects where offenders shift activity to less monitored precincts. The court notes the trial involved extensive use of digital evidence and analysis of behaviour patterns through data mining, reflecting the emergent role of technology in crime investigation. In assessing sentencing, this court proceeds under the guidance of the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (June 2018), which sets out factors including harm, culpability, and offender characteristics. The court has also considered caselaw such as R v. Greaves [2017] EWCA Crim 2155 that examines the gradations of harm and mitigating factors relevant to repeat theft cases. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. It is noted that notwithstanding the apparently low immediate value of purportedly stolen items, the cumulative effect upon retailers can be substantial. Economic losses impact not only proprietary profit margins but also retailer willingness to employ front-line staff, invest in customer service, or maintain store viability, particularly in deprived areas. The strain on policing resource occasioned by serial shoplift offenders like yourself should also not be underestimated. When officers are assigned to low-value theft investigations, their diversion from other pressing duties impacts overall community safety and responsiveness. Furthermore, prolonged investigations yield considerable administrative overhead with collation of evidence, witness statements, and forensic analyses all contributing to increased burden. From the defence side, submissions were made emphasising your challenging social background, including a reported history of childhood neglect, intermittent homelessness, and struggles with substance dependence. Letters submitted by charity workers and social support organisations testify to periods of engagement with crisis accommodation and addiction counselling, albeit with limited sustained success. The court is conscious of the importance of recognising social determinants as part of a holistic assessment of offending behaviour. However, as the Court of Appeal observed in R v. Morton [2015] EWCA Crim 1033, personal circumstances, while relevant to mitigation, cannot outweigh the demands of public protection and the need for deterrence in repetitive acquisitive offending. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. The recently completed psychiatric report by Dr Victoria Addison, consultant forensic psychiatrist, has been of considerable assistance to the court. Dr Addison’s report was thorough and professionally informed, detailing your mental health history, including episodes of depression and complex trauma, while concluding that no major psychotic disorder is present. The report identifies impulsivity and impaired judgement influenced by substance misuse as contributing factors. Dr Addison recommends community rehabilitation with close monitoring and integrated support for substance misuse, but cautions that untreated risk factors may lead to further offending. The report also addresses the relevance of your mental health status to culpability and sentencing, concluding that diminished responsibility is not applicable in these circumstances. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. The probation pre-sentence report further advises on your current housing instability and low levels of compliance with prior community orders, noting that your engagement with support services has been inconsistent and sometimes reactive rather than proactive. It suggests that rehabilitative efforts should include cognitive behavioural interventions addressing thinking and decision-making patterns, combined with financial management support and drug treatment programmes. The report stresses the need to balance rehabilitative aims with robust supervision to protect the public and reduce reoffending risk. The court acknowledges persistent challenges faced by the Probation Service in resourcing and supervising individuals with complex needs. Recent national audits have highlighted staff vacancies and turnover, resulting in increased case loads and diminished individualised attention. Despite these systemic issues, probation officers continue to demonstrate commendable commitment. Appreciation is also due to the staff of local charities such as the Chelsea Homelessness Project and the North Kensington Outreach Service, whose voluntary sector work provides critical front-line assistance to vulnerable individuals in pathways away from offending. As an aside, the court notes with concern the ongoing pressures faced by NHS mental health services, which have seen growing referral lists and protracted waiting times, particularly in community mental health teams serving high deprivation areas. The reach of crisis teams remains limited, and inpatient beds are scarce. These structural factors both exacerbate the challenges of effective support and must be factored into any realistic understanding of service user pathways. On a separate note, it is worth recording an earlier unsuccessful attempt by Legal Aid to authorise funding for an independent neuropsychological evaluation. Despite repeated submissions from defence Counsel, delays of up to six weeks were incurred while requests underwent multiple reviews and clarifications, underscoring systemic inefficiencies known to courts and practitioners alike. While ultimately resolved, such holdups add to the litigation burden and risk undermining procedural fairness through elongation of timetables. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. Turning now to sentencing considerations, the court reminds itself of the principles outlined in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline. The offending in this instance features persistent and premeditated dishonesty, exploitation of weaknesses in retail security, and repeated breaches of previous community-based disposals. While the value of stolen property may be modest per incident, the frequency and cumulative impact belie a significant level of culpability. The fact that staffing and operational adjustments were necessitated at targeted retail premises reflects broader community consequences beyond the immediate theft value. The recorded late guilty plea diminishes the mitigating credit to which you might otherwise be entitled. The court is mindful, however, of the indications of remorse expressed through counsel and the willingness to engage with rehabilitative services post-arrest. These are positive signs, albeit tempered by the history of similar interventions failing to prevent reoffending. The necessary balance must be struck between punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. Custodial sentences, while appropriate in some cases of acquisitive crime, are reserved for those where harm or culpability reach high thresholds, or where community orders have repeatedly failed. Given the present facts and available reports, the court is minded to consider community-based sentencing options incorporating structured supervision and behavioural intervention requirements. However, a custodial element cannot be excluded outright. It is therefore ordered that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be compiled forthwith by your probation officer. This report should address risk assessments, tailored therapeutic recommendations, potential engagement with substance misuse services, and feasibility of compliance with rehabilitation activity requirements or unpaid work. It should also consider any safeguarding concerns, including the potential impact of housing instability on your offending risk. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Chelsea. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal sentencing hearing will take place upon receipt of the pre-sentence report and any additional representations. You are advised of your right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged on this matter pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT CHELSEA R v. MR H Case No. CR2025/13458 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. F. LANGLEY Filed: 3 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for an offence of theft, specifically multiple counts of shoplifting, an acquisitive crime which has been committed on numerous occasions across a protracted period. The offending relates to actions taking place predominantly in the boroughs of Chelsea and Kensington, spanning from late 2023 through to the spring of 2025. The court’s task today is to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offending, the impact upon victims, and wider considerations of public protection and rehabilitation. Procedural Matters This matter has a somewhat lengthy procedural history. Your case was initially listed for a Plea and Case Management Hearing (PCMH) on 19 May 2025 before His Honour Judge M. R. Downing, following your charge in April. Owing to delays in obtaining Legal Aid funding for your chosen defence solicitors and subsequently a request for an expert psychiatric report, the matter was adjourned on two separate occasions. The second adjournment was also necessitated by a late disclosure relating to CCTV footage from an independent convenience store, which required further review. The Legal Aid Agency’s response to these applications was marked by delay and lack of clarity, which regrettably hindered earlier progress. These bureaucratic inefficiencies are all too common in contemporary criminal proceedings and impose significant strain on court resources and those involved in the judicial process. The necessity for timely provision of expert evidence, particularly in cases involving potential mental health considerations, cannot be overstated; judicial efficiency and defendants’ rights alike depend upon it. At the plea stage, you initially indicated a not guilty plea on 7 June, however, following the service of further prosecution evidence and investigative interviews, you entered a guilty plea at the rescheduled hearing on 21 August. As the authorities and this court have observed previously, late guilty pleas, especially when tendered shortly before trial, limit the extent of credit for remorse and procedural economy available under established sentencing principles. The Essential Background of Retail Theft Prosecution It is a familiar feature of retail crime prosecutions that investigations require a multiplicity of cross-agency input. Often, these are low-level, seemingly isolated incidents which, only after painstaking collation of data, reveal a pattern of deliberate and repeated offending. As is well documented in the literature and case experience, the investigatory burden placed upon local policing units, backed by business crime partnerships, is elevated when the offender systematically targets multiple premises using a range of covert tactics. The partnership approach adopted in the Chelsea area comprises store owners, local police officers, forensic analysts and community safety officers working in concert. While ostensibly a model of co-operation, this apparatus is not immune to the pressures of funding shortages, shifting personnel, and administrative backlogs which impact on investigative timeliness and the quality of evidence assembled. In this respect, the finding of well-maintained CCTV systems and detailed stock-loss logs from several involved shops was something of a procedural boon, enabling prosecution witnesses to provide coherent testimony. It is regrettable, however, that some retailers remained reluctant to engage fully, citing fears of retaliatory behaviour or a sense of futility given the low value of stolen goods. The case law surrounding theft and specifically shoplifting offences is well-established, with the Court of Appeal providing guidance balancing public protection with offender circumstances. The court notes authorities such as R v. Kilmartin [2018] EWCA Crim 321, which emphasises the need to consider both the economic loss and the psychological impact on victims, being staff and owners alike. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. This court has, over recent years, reflected upon the changing landscape of acquisitive crime. There are signs—confirmed by data analysis from the Metropolitan Police Service—that shoplifting has increased in frequency, yet the threshold for prosecution has shifted. This phenomenon partly results from capacity constraints in the criminal justice system and competing priorities such as serious violence and cybercrime, which command both public and institutional attention. Research into repeat offenders within acquisitive crime cohorts reveals a recurring profile: individuals often deal with complex social issues, including unstable housing, mental health conditions, and substance misuse. Despite these factors, repeated theft cannot be excused nor minimised in its effect; it contributes to a broader deterioration in public confidence in retail environments and an unsettling of community norms. The presence of coordinated schemes to disrupt offenders via civil recovery or banning orders reflects the systematic approach now taken. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. The court acknowledges the contribution of probation services in compiling a detailed pre-sentence report which explores your background and risk factors. The report highlights that, while housing issues have been persistent, your engagement with voluntary sector supports has been limited and inconsistent. Without access to stable accommodation or employment, the risk cycle of reoffending remains material, unless effective intervention is provided. It is necessary to record an ongoing criticism of the Legal Aid Commission’s administrative handling of requests for expert psychiatric input in criminal cases involving vulnerable defendants. In this case, an application for the instruction of Dr Gwen Richards, a forensic psychiatrist with experience in non-custodial rehabilitation pathways, was met with repeated queries demanding supplemental material and clarification of the proposed instruction’s scope. Approval was only granted six weeks after initial submission, resulting in delay to the preparation of defence mitigation and assessment. Dr Richards’ report, now before the court, details an evaluation conducted over April and July of this year. While she finds no evidence of severe psychosis or persistent risk factors associated with serious violence, the psychiatrist notes traits consistent with impulsivity and a history of depressive episodes. The report recommends structured psychological support and the possibility of cognitive-behavioural therapy, subject to your engagement. This advice aligns with emerging rehabilitative trends within acquisitive offending to prioritise therapeutic support over short custodial sentences where feasible. It remains a vexed point as to the adequacy of mental health resource availability for offenders with co-morbid social deprivation and impulsivity profiles. Waiting lists for NHS commissioned services in London boroughs exceed normative targets; thus, swift assessment and treatment are often not realistic. This contributes to the perpetuation of offending behaviours without effective intervention. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. Turning to precedent, this court finds it appropriate to review the principles set out in the seminal case of R v. Blackwood [2019] EWCA Crim 1759, where the offender engaged in multiple acts of shoplifting over a three-year period, leading to significant losses and repeated distress to victims. There, the Court of Appeal elaborated upon the proportionality of custodial sentences for sustained acquisitive offending, emphasising the need for public deterrence balanced against rehabilitation prospects. Additionally, the decision in R v. Fenwick [2021] EWCA Crim 1234 considered the circumstances in which late guilty pleas reduced—and did not negate—credit for remorse. It criticised defendants who maintain not guilty pleas through intensive preparation of insubstantial defences, only to tender guilty pleas immediately prior to trial, thus impeding efficiency and prolonging victim distress. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. Representatives from two of the affected stores have submitted victim impact statements, which have been received and considered. One store manager describes a palpable atmosphere of unease stemming from a recurrent presence of theft perpetrators. Staffing pressures were exacerbated, as employees frequently felt compelled to intervene or monitor suspected offenders, leading to elevated stress and concerns about personal safety. The economic cost, while not extraordinary individually, cumulatively undermines profitability and occasionally leads to store closures or reductions in opening hours. Anecdotal evidence suggests some businesses have invested in increased surveillance, security personnel, or specialist loss prevention services, all of which contribute to retail shrinkage costs which ultimately fall on consumers and legitimate customers. It is important also to acknowledge statements from the Chelsea Business Crime Partnership, outlining joint efforts to combat acquisitive crime through awareness campaigns and referral pathways for offenders. These complex and resource-heavy initiatives underscore the broad impact such offences have beyond simple value of stolen goods. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. In a separate though contemporaneous matter, the court has been informed that a co-defendant on an unrelated matter involving aggravated burglary in the Chelsea area remains at large following a failed bail appearance. This case, while unrelated, has attracted local attention and contributed to community unease about crime levels in adjacent wards. However, it must be emphasised that no such allegations are made against you, Mr H. Similarly, reference has been made to an environmental crime case, where Mr Lambe was convicted of fly-tipping hazardous waste in a greenbelt area outside London. The sentence imposed included immediate custody and substantial remediation costs. Such regulatory offences, while unrelated to theft, reinforce the judiciary’s broad concern with persistent disregard for community standards. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. A letter from the community mental health nurse team has been submitted expressing regret at your intermittent engagement with their services. The nurse highlights episodes of transient depressive symptoms but no history of hospitalisation or psychotropic medication compliance. There is mention of social isolation and financial hardship but an absence of known substance misuse, which complicates risk profiling. Conversely, a submission from Your Housing Support Officer emphasises the ongoing challenge of securing stable accommodation for you and the consequential stress this places on your capacity to desist from offending. The housing instability almost invariably precedes episodes of legal involvement. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The Theft Act 1968, section 1, remains the foundational statute under which the offence is charged. The offence is aggravated by a course of conduct, rather than an isolated incident, which brings into play sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council. The guideline instructs the court to consider the value of property stolen, the level of planning and sophistication, the harm to victims, and personal mitigating factors. Within the guidelines, custodial sentences become increasingly warranted as offending escalates beyond trivial values and when there is persistence despite warnings. Aggravating factors include use of concealment, targeting vulnerable premises, and causing distress or repeat victimisation. Mitigation may arise from early guilty pleas, genuine remorse, personal circumstances, and potential for rehabilitation. Mr H stated in interview that he frequently takes items, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. This hearing has been conducted in open court with the full attendance of prosecution and defence counsel. I am grateful to Ms Yasmin Patel for her diligent and measured advocacy on behalf of the Crown and to Mr Denton Wells for his professional representation. Court staff and the usher team are also acknowledged for their efficient management despite recent refurbishments to the court layout causing some minor disruption. Finally, the court reiterates its regret at the length of time this case has taken to reach sentencing. The impact of systemic delays, particularly in the realms of funding allocation for expert advice and the uneven pace of evidence collation, remains a concern for all participants in the justice system. The court will reserve judgment on sentence until receipt and consideration of the final pre-sentence report, which should address the full suite of sentencing considerations, including your background, current social and mental health situation, and the feasibility of interventions designed to reduce reoffending risk. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 3 September 2025, in Court 5 at Chelsea Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in strict accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to all appropriate agencies. You, Mr H, are advised of your statutory right of appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions in force pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 in relation to these proceedings. No order as to costs is made at this stage.

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINDSOR R v. MR H Case No. W2025/08437 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. P. RICHARDS Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you appear for sentence following your admitted involvement in a series of offences amounting to theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans a period covering the latter part of 2023 through to early 2025 and implicates multiple retail outlets within the Windsor and Maidenhead area, including several independent shops and pharmacy chains. Procedural History Following your arrest on 28 February 2025, which resulted from a multi-agency initiative spearheaded by Windsor’s Safer Streets Taskforce, your case was progressed to this Crown Court after representation of the prosecuting authority that the volume and persistence of the conduct warranted trial at the higher court level under the Better Case Management (BCM) arrangements. The BCM protocol, as the court and practitioners are well aware, is designed to facilitate the early clarification of evidential issues, promote case progression with due expedition, and reduce unnecessary adjournments. The criminal case management adopted here involved a series of preliminary hearings, the first being conducted remotely on 11 March 2025, at which your solicitor indicated that an initial plea of not guilty was to be entered. This plea was maintained at a subsequent hearing on 14 April 2025, despite the Crown serving a comprehensive disclosure package including digital evidence, witness statements, and CCTV footage purportedly showing your repeated presence at various crime scenes. We find ourselves, unmistakably, in an era characterised by a slow but relentless unraveling of the social order — a period in which the small but persistent transgressions of civic norms have become not only more visible but more frequent. Reports of petty theft, once seen as sporadic or isolated, now speak to a broader pattern of disregard for personal and communal boundaries. The toll of drug-related harm, meanwhile, is borne not just by the individuals involved but by the already overextended institutions charged with holding together the basic infrastructure of public health and safety. One senses, in everyday encounters and quiet observations, a fraying of the once-cohesive threads that held neighbourhoods together: a declining willingness to look out for others, to engage in the quiet acts of reciprocity that make collective life tolerable. These developments manifest not only in the uptick of minor offences but also in the creeping normalisation of behaviours once held to be beyond the pale of acceptable conduct. It must be stated, of course, that the function of the court is not to offer sociological commentary or to diagnose the state of society — but it would be equally disingenuous to pretend that offences occur in a vacuum, untouched by the wider forces that shape the habits, expectations, and moral horizons of the individuals who come before us. It is an unfortunate reality that the late plea you entered, on the morning of trial on 30 July 2025, reflects a familiar pattern to this court. While pleas at this stage remain within your rights, the timing carries implications for the degree of credit afforded and the resultant sentence. The Court of Appeal’s pronouncement in R v. Pearce [2019] EWCA Crim 576 remains instructive: late pleas rarely signify genuine contrition and often serve to conserve prosecutorial and witness resources only in a limited sense. A number of plea and trial preparation hearings were listed; the initial hearing on 19 June was vacated when Legal Aid delays obstructed the timely provision of funding for a psychiatric evaluation sought by your defence team. It is with no small measure of frustration that the court must once again comment upon the consistently slow and cumbersome performance of the Legal Aid Agency in authorising expert reports, here resulting in a delay of no less than five weeks. Such bureaucratic inertia undermines the smooth administration of justice and disproportionately impacts defendants reliant on state-funded representation. Your defence counsel, Mr Gareth Davies, has been diligent in pursuing your interests despite these obstacles, for which the court acknowledges his professionalism and tenacity. Likewise, Ms Elizabeth Carr, appearing on behalf of the Crown, has conducted herself with commendable clarity and judiciousness, ensuring that the requisite balance is struck between the interests of the state and the defendant. In the course of pre-trial preparation, the court received several letters from support organisations, including the Windsor Outreach Network and Shopkeepers’ Association, reflecting both the cumulative impact of retail theft upon small business proprietors and the ongoing challenges faced by charitable bodies striving to mediate conflict and provide rehabilitative avenues. These agencies report strain due to increased caseloads and reduced funding, painting a sobering picture of the ecosystem within which such offending occurs. Complaints concerning the availability and timeliness of interpretation services also emerged during the period leading to the trial. On 21 May, a scheduled hearing was rescheduled due to the late arrival of an appointed interpreter. While this matter was swiftly resolved, it underscores the operational pressures currently confronting court administrative functions, particularly amid ongoing workforce shortages exacerbated by retirements and recruitment challenges. I note with some interest and indirect relevance that this court’s facilities, refurbished earlier this year under a multi-million-pound capital scheme, now boast enhanced digital capabilities, including integrated evidence presentation suites and improved public seating — developments that, while peripheral to the present case, signify the judiciary’s commitment to providing a dignified and effective environment for litigation. One must also bear in mind the evolution of the jurisprudential landscape concerning offences of theft and dishonesty. Over the last decade, the courts have witnessed a rebalancing of sentencing principles with an emphasis on proportionality, rehabilitation, and an informed understanding of social context, without sacrificing deterrence or the protection of victims. The Sentencing Council’s guideline for Theft Offences (Definitive 2019) provides the current framework, highlighting factors such as the value of property taken, the number of victims, and the sophistication or planning involved. Of particular note is the consideration given to offences targeting vulnerable establishments, including those serving disadvantaged populations or dependent upon community goodwill. This reflects a jurisprudential sensitivity borne of experience and the recognition that the ripples of harm from acquisitive crimes radiate beyond the immediate proprietor and impact the social fabric. In approaching your sentence, I have had regard to all these considerations, alongside the detailed pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Fiona Crampton, dated 2 October 2025. Ms Crampton’s appraisal indicates a mixed picture: you are assessed as presenting low to medium risk of serious harm but medium risk of reoffending, with identified underlying issues including episodic substance misuse, intermittent housing instability, and difficulties sustaining employment. Community-based support services, notably the Thames Valley Alcohol and Drug Support Centre, have previously engaged with you but report limited success. These agencies, constrained by budgetary pressures and overwhelming demand, face significant hurdles in offering sustained engagement, a challenge likely aggravated by your sporadic participation. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. Included among the documents submitted by the defence is a report by Dr Simon Leary, consultant forensic psychiatrist, assessed at your request. Dr Leary’s evaluation, conducted over three sessions in July 2025, notes no formal psychiatric diagnosis but identifies a tendency towards impulsive behaviour and a mild depressive disorder. His recommendation underscores the potential benefit of structured cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) targeting both offending behaviour and underlying emotional regulation difficulties. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. It is regrettable that opportunities for earlier intervention, potentially mitigating progression or escalation, appear to have been underutilised or declined. In considering your background, I have reviewed representations from family members and associates, including a letter from your sister dated 15 September 2025 that speaks to periods of unemployment and housing precarity, alongside moments of genuine effort to seek lawful employment. While personal testimonials invariably introduce subjectivity, they offer invaluable insight into the lived realities underpinning offending. Though the facts of the case focus on theft, it is incumbent upon the court to consider broader behavioural patterns and their implications for risk and rehabilitation. The landscape of acquisitive crime is multifaceted, reflecting intersections between socio-economic distress and personal agency. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. It is not lost on the court that your offending places a burden on multiple public agencies and charities, whose resources are finite and whose capacity to respond is variably constrained. There is an institutional fatigue evident in many such bodies—manifest in waiting lists for mental health services, overstretched probation teams, and the consistent need to prioritise cases based on risk and urgency. The Probation Service, as a whole, continues to grapple with recruitment and retention challenges, with recent figures indicating a near 15% vacancy rate nationally. This has consequences for caseload sizes and the quality of supervision able to be offered. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. In R v. Maynard [2017] EWCA Crim 1342, the Court of Appeal reaffirmed that the persistence of acquisitive offending, especially without engagement with rehabilitative provision, signals the need for custodial intervention in cases where alternatives have been exhausted or deemed unsuitable. Though your case is less serious in value or violence than Maynard, the principle remains salient: sustained dishonesty is a matter of concern regardless of scale. Reference may also be made — albeit with limited direct application — to R v. Duvall [2020] EWCA Crim 876, which dealt with dangerous driving offences resulting in grievous bodily harm. While the factual matrix differs substantially, the case illustrates the judiciary’s role in balancing community protection against the prospect of rehabilitation, a tension equally present here. Within the sententious corpus, attention is also drawn to R v. Graham [2021] EWCA Crim 1101, which addressed the sentencing of a defendant convicted for fly-tipping on Green Belt land, resulting in environmental degradation assessed at considerable public cost. While your offending bears no environmental dimension, the case is instructive in demonstrating that offences impacting community resources or public confidence sometimes warrant enhanced sentences despite lacking personal injury elements. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. The court has also reviewed victim impact statements from proprietors and staff of affected premises. These statements describe not only pecuniary loss but the emotional toll of confronting repeated theft. Staff report diminished morale, heightened anxiety, and, in some cases, the necessity of altering working patterns. The North Windsor Business Association has submitted a detailed memorandum voicing concerns about retail shrinkage and its knock-on effects for local employment and economic vitality. Such material serves to humanise the offences and to remind all parties that acquiescence to such behaviour is neither mandated nor appropriate amidst broader societal challenges. The concept of community reparation, as encouraged by the Sentencing Council's guideline on Theft Offences, is relevant. It strikes a chord with the restorative justice principles increasingly embedded in contemporary sentencing practice, balancing accountability with the opportunity for repair and reintegration. Though I am mindful of your personal difficulties, including intermittent homelessness and sporadic employment, these must be weighed against the persistent nature of your conduct and apparent reluctance to fully engage with support mechanisms proffered. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. An observation on the broader context may be warranted. The local constabulary continues to express concern about finite resources being diverted to what they term “non-serious” crime, including acquisitive juvenile and adult offending. This trend places additional strain on neighbourhood policing teams already facing heightened demands in relation to serious violent crime and organised gang activity. That said, the Windsor Business Crime Reduction Partnership appears to have functioned with notable efficacy in this matter — collating information, facilitating victim liaison, and coordinating multi-agency responses without undue delay or friction. The court records its appreciation for their work. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. In terms of personal mitigation, counsel has drawn attention to your composition of a letter to the court expressing remorse and acknowledging the impact of your actions. The letter was carefully written, legible, and evidently the product of sincere reflection. Though such correspondence cannot substitute for tangible behavioural change, it is taken into account. Additionally, your previous criminal record includes minor traffic offences and two convictions for possession of cannabis, both from some years prior and of limited present relevance. There is no indication of any gang affiliations or involvement in violent crime. The impact of your offending does not extend to physical harm or threats, but the court notes the psychological strain on victims and the economic costs. The court is conscious, however, that in sentencing it must calibrate a response proportionate to the gravity of the offences and cognisant of the prospects for rehabilitation. Mr H stated in interview that he frequently takes items, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. In concluding these remarks, I emphasise that sentencing in cases of repeated retail theft requires an approach that balances public protection, deterrence, and the encouragement of desistance. While community sentences remain appropriate in many cases, where evidence suggests limited engagement or significant risk of reoffending, custodial sentences may be justified. At this juncture, the court will direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by probation that specifically addresses your history, risk factors, social circumstances, and the availability of structured community interventions. Attention should be given to cognitive skills programmes, substance misuse treatment pathways, and any housing support necessary to underpin effective rehabilitation. I will adjourn sentencing until such time as the report is completed and filed. This will allow all parties to consider fully the options and enable me to impose a sentence reflective of the totality of circumstances. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Windsor. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. B2025/15893 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. A. Marlow Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence on a single indictment alleging theft from multiple retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This indictment represents a course of conduct that occurred over a period from late 2023 until mid-2025, primarily in the Bristol city centre and surrounding suburban shopping areas. While the indictment itself charges a representative count, it encapsulates a pattern of offending comprising repeated episodes of unlawful appropriation, which attract more serious consideration than one might accord a single isolated event. Procedural History You were initially brought before the magistrates’ court on 18 June 2025 following arrest. The arrest itself was the product of an extended multi-agency investigation involving the Avon and Somerset Constabulary’s Business Crime Unit, retailer loss prevention teams, and data analysts employed by the Bristol Retail Crime Partnership. The inquiry spanned approximately ten months, including over 300 hours of collected CCTV footage review. The investigation utilised cross-referencing of electronic transaction logs, staff statements, and mobile network data obtained under judicial warrant. The sustained nature of this inquiry, with joint taskings among specialised teams, reflects the seriousness with which repeated thefts are regarded by law enforcement, who face increasing pressure to clamp down on acquisitive crime impacting the city’s commercial districts. It is worth pausing to acknowledge that such investigations absorb significant resources - far from mere routine policing. The Avon and Somerset Constabulary, like many police services nationwide, grapples with resourcing shortfalls that impact frontline responsiveness to a wide array of crimes alongside these theft investigations. The commitment and patience of officers, analysts, and support staff in seeing this matter through demand appreciation. It also, regrettably, underscores how persistent yet ostensibly minor crimes can impose disproportionate burden on already stretched forces, pulling resources from demands of serious violent crime and community safeguarding. You were initially charged on 21 June 2025 with six counts of shop theft, which the Crown subsequently consolidated for trial. The matter transferred to this Crown Court on 5 July 2025 under the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative, a procedural protocol intended to achieve timely progress in cases of sufficient complexity or public interest. The locality has recently implemented enhanced BCM systems as recommended in the Criminal Justice Ministry’s 2023 review, aiming for improved court listing efficiency and more effective inter-agency communication. The presiding listing officer noted that, notwithstanding some logistical challenges due to concurrent industrial action by court staff, this case proceeded in accordance with the indicative timeline set out in the Criminal Procedure Rules. The court also notes correspondence from the Legal Aid Agency dated 19 August 2025, regarding the resourcing of expert reports requested by the defence. There were some initial delays in approval for instructing a forensic clinical psychologist, which occasioned a short adjournment on 28 August 2025. These procedural hurdles unfortunately echo a growing pattern of bureaucratic delays across criminal justice support services, a matter which has prompted debate among practitioners but has yet to find comprehensive resolution. The plea and case management hearing was held on 2 September 2025. At that hearing, you entered a plea of guilty. While this plea is welcome, the late nature serves to limit the credit permissible under current sentencing practice. The court is guided here by principles enshrined in leading authorities such as R v. Farley [2019] EWCA Crim 1234, which clarifies that pleas entered close to trial attract appreciably less mitigation than those tendered at the earliest opportunity. This approach reflects both the interests of witness welfare and effective court administration; the Crown and witnesses incur significant prejudice where pleas are delayed. In the context of acquisitive offending, it is important to recall the court’s duty to consider the cumulative impact of repeated thefts on victims and the wider community. While often characterised as “non-violent” or “minor,” the broader social cost—losses sustained by small businesses, increased insurance premiums, and the cascading effect on staff wellbeing—are far from trivial. That pattern was evident in several victims’ statements submitted herein. The prosecution is represented today by Ms Emilie Stone, who has conducted the Crown’s case with diligence throughout. Similarly, Mr Gregory Walsh appears for you under a defence Legal Aid certificate and is commended for his thorough advocacy, including obtaining expert assessments and supplementary character references. The court acknowledges the support provided by the Bristol Retail Crime Partnership, who submitted a detailed victim impact statement describing not only financial loss but the disruption to business continuity and employee morale occasioned by persistent shoplifting. The Retail Crime Partnership also notes ongoing staffing shortages and increased turnover in front-of-house roles, which they attribute partly to the stress arising from such repeated incidents of theft. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. This series of offences took place across a variety of retail premises, including one independent pharmacy and two convenience stores widely regarded as vital to the local neighbourhoods they serve. The modus operandi exhibited a degree of planning and sophistication beyond mere opportunistic pilfering, including the use of distraction methods and concealment in garments. CCTV footage demonstrated your repeated presence, often at times coinciding with shift changes or periods of lone staffing. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. Public order and safety in commercial spaces are often vulnerable to such breaches. The courts are cognisant that acquisitive crime has a corrosive impact upon the retail sector, leading some businesses to adopt costly preventative measures, including increased security staff, installation of physical barriers, and reduced opening hours. While these measures impose financial burdens, they are symptomatic of a broader sense of insecurity prevalent in many urban centres today. Of interest, though irrelevant to the present proceedings, the court records that a nearby shop suffered significant criminal damage in a separate incident last year. That matter involved a third party unrelated to you and resulted in a custodial sentence for criminal damage to a listed building (R v. Ashton [2024] EWCA Crim 1587). While the case highlights the interplay between various forms of offending within tightly knit communities, it has no bearing upon your culpability or risk profile. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. The facts disclose a persistent pattern of thefts perpetrated across a six-month span, with some instances involving the removal of security tags or the use of items to obscure surveillance. Staff declarations indicate that some employees were left fearful of repeat encounters, leading to increased absenteeism and changes in shift patterns. The court has received a comprehensive psychiatric report prepared by Dr Helen Forsyth, a consultant forensic psychologist instructed by the defence. Dr Forsyth’s evaluation, conducted through a combination of clinical interview and psychometric testing, indicates that you exhibit traits consistent with chronic impulsivity and mild depressive symptoms. There is, however, no evidence of severe mental illness or cognitive impairment that would diminish responsibility. Importantly, Dr Forsyth emphasises your lack of engagement with available community resources and support, noting that you have declined offers of referral to addiction services or financial counselling, despite documented material hardship. These observations align with the probation pre-sentence report, which depicts a medium-risk profile for further acquisitive offending but no significant risk of harm to others. Dr Forsyth’s report also elaborates on the potential benefits of targeted offender rehabilitation programmes, including cognitive-behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing. Such interventions, she suggests, could assist you in managing impulsive tendencies and redirecting financial pressures into lawful conduct. The court welcomes these recommendations, which will be considered in the sentencing process. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. Your personal circumstances bear some relevance. You are 34 years old, currently unemployed, and living alone in privately rented accommodation. The pre-sentence report records a history of unstable housing, with prior intermittent stays in temporary supported lodging. While not directly related to the offending behaviours, such instability often exacerbates vulnerability and social exclusion. The court is mindful that the local probation teams face increasing caseloads and diminished resources, which place limits on the intensity and frequency of supervision. Nevertheless, recent innovations, including digital monitoring tools and bespoke community interventions, have demonstrated promise in mitigating repeat acquisitive crime. The effectiveness of these must be balanced against individual motivation and compliance. It is also of note that the recent coronavirus pandemic had profound implications for mental health services and social support networks, a fact referenced in many presentence reports nationally. The disruption to in-person contacts and reduction in charitable funding have left many vulnerable individuals underserved at precisely the moment of greatest need. While that context does not excuse criminal behaviour, it forms an essential backdrop to current sentencing considerations. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. The court recognizes the wider social context in which these offences occurred. We live in a period marked by increasing economic uncertainty, high inflation rates, and the ongoing effects of the so-called ‘cost of living crisis’. These variables contribute to mounting pressures upon individuals at the margins. Such factors, understandably, inform the mitigation put forward on your behalf. Despite this, it is important to reiterate that hardship does not equate to licence. The law remains clear that the preservation of public order and respect for the rights of others must be maintained. Theft from small businesses disproportionately affects those least able to absorb losses and undermines social cohesion. There exists also a growing phenomenon of so-called “social media shoplifting challenges,” particularly among younger cohorts, which some observers believe contribute to normalising such behaviours. While no evidence suggests your involvement in these trends, the court notes the challenges they present to law enforcement and community safety initiatives. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. Turning to the sentencing framework, the court is guided primarily by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on Theft Offences (Definitive Guideline issued April 2022), which sets out the factors relevant to assessing culpability and harm. Aggravating factors such as a pattern of offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, and the disruption caused to victims weigh heavily. Mitigating factors include timely guilty pleas and demonstrable engagement with rehabilitative services. The sentencing pool available includes custodial sentences, community orders with requirements such as unpaid work or rehabilitation activity, or in less serious cases, fines or conditional discharges. Given the history and pattern disclosed, the court is inclined to view immediate custody as a possible outcome, though deferral is warranted pending receipt of updated reports. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. The court also notes correspondence from the Bristol Safer Neighbourhood Team expressing concern about the rise of shop theft and its impact on local business owners and the community. Their letter highlights the emotional toll on retail workers, including anxiety and fear arising from repeated theft incidents, and encourages sentencing outcomes that underscore deterrence. Turning briefly to comparative case law: in R v. Lyndon [2023] EWCA Crim 845, the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment for a defendant with a similar offending profile involving organised theft rings targeting retail chains. While that case included aggravating features such as use of accomplices and intimidation, it demonstrates judicial willingness to impose custodial terms where offending is persistent and impacts multiple premises. Also relevant is R v. Freeman [2024] EWCA Crim 1902, where the Court distinguished between low-level opportunistic theft and calculated, repeated courses of conduct. There, the imposition of a community order augmented by cognitive skills training was upheld for a defendant without prior convictions and demonstrable steps toward engagement with support services. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. Victim impact statements submitted describe not only the quantifiable loss but also the broader disruption—inventory management challenges, staff redeployment, and increased security costs. One independent pharmacist, affected by one of the thefts, noted the psychological strain endured by front-facing staff, many of whom reported stress-related absenteeism. Such evidence underscores that theft, even in the absence of direct violence, carries substantial harm. Inquiries made with local charities assisting vulnerable adults confirm that multiple agencies remain engaged with you, albeit with mixed success. Notes reveal sporadic attendance at debt management workshops and a reluctance to maintain consistent contact with housing support services. While commendable attempts have been made to engage you, the apparent reticence to sustain such involvement is disconcerting. Notably, the probation service has flagged concerns arising from the 2018 case of a co-defendant (not yourself) in another matter involving assault and possession of an offensive weapon, factors unrelated to your offending but occasionally cited in adjacent files. This court emphasises that no such elements pertain in your case. The court is also aware—purely as an extraneous matter—that one of the retail outlets targeted by your offending was recently the site of a separate arson attack by an unrelated individual, resulting in extensive property damage and a custodial sentence of three years for the arsonist (R v. Craven [2025] EWCA Crim 2105). While this does not relate to your case, it exemplifies the complex interplay of risks facing local businesses and the importance of clear accountability for those who impact community safety. Finally, it is worth commenting on the broader implications for the community. Acquisitive crime undermines public confidence, fosters insecurity, and imposes costs ultimately borne by consumers and honest traders alike. The court must approach sentencing in a way that balances individual circumstances with these wider public interests. I will adjourn sentencing to permit the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, including consideration of suitable rehabilitative options. The report shall give due regard to your mental health, financial status, housing stability, and likelihood of compliance with community-based interventions. Particular attention should be paid to identifying any services that might address the underlying drivers of your offending, be they economic pressures or impulsivity. I remind all parties that sentencing credit for a guilty plea has been limited due to its timing, in line with judicial direction and established principles. I will welcome, however, any further representations or material that might inform an appropriate and proportionate sentence at the next hearing. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be prepared and made available to the parties. You are advised of your rights of appeal against conviction and sentence within 28 days, pursuant to relevant statutory provisions. No reporting restrictions apply. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON R v. Mr H Case No. B2025/14862 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. F. MORLAND Filed: 13 November 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced for offences of theft from retail premises, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge concerns repeated shoplifting carried out over a protracted period spanning from approximately late 2023 through to the spring of this year, with incidents occurring at various commercial establishments within the Brighton and Hove area and adjacent retail zones. Procedural History and Case Management You were arrested on 5 May 2025 following an extended enquiry conducted under the auspices of the Sussex Retail Crime Reduction Taskforce. This multi-agency initiative, incorporating uniformed officers, plain clothes investigators, and intelligence analysts, was formed with the explicit aim of addressing a discernible increase in repeat shoplifting offences affecting small to medium-sized retailers. Intelligence reports indicated a pattern involving a lone male fitting your description repeatedly entering shops to remove goods without payment, leading to accumulating losses and staff distress. It is appropriate here to acknowledge that this investigation involved a complex collation of disparate pieces of evidence, including CCTV recordings from several disparate locations, witness statements, and a review of regional trading patterns. The collation process itself reflects the increasing bureaucratic demands placed upon law enforcement agencies in the contemporary landscape. The record-keeping requirements, not limited to traditional paperwork but expanded to digital databases, video cataloguing, and interdepartmental communication protocols, underscore the resource-intensive nature of even relatively low-value theft cases. Within this framework, the case was allocated to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol designed to promote early identification of issues, more efficient case progression, and, ideally, swift resolution for the complainants and the defendant alike. The initial listing took place on 20 May 2025. Subsequent case management hearings were held on 24 June and 12 August, during which directions were given and adjustments made to accommodate expert reports and new disclosure. These occasions highlighted the procedural intricacies inherent in coordinating legal aid permissions and ensuring compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules. The court notes, with some degree of exasperation, that applications for legal aid funding to permit instruction of a forensic psychiatrist were subject to repeated adjournments. The original request dated 18 June was delayed pending administrative review, with substantive approval only conveyed in early August, thereby elongating the preparatory timeline and necessitating a short adjournment of the sentencing hearing. This pattern is regrettably not unique; a consistent theme in this court’s dealings has been the persistent difficulty practitioners face in securing timely and adequate expert input due to systemic constraints within the Legal Aid Agency. Such delays are more than administrative inconveniences—they impose adverse consequences on case progression, exacerbate uncertainty, and cloud prospects for rehabilitation planning. During the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 26 August, you initially entered a not guilty plea, electing to challenge the Crown’s case despite the surveillance evidence presented. It was not until the morning of the final trial listing on 1 October that you indicated an intention to plead guilty. The Crown advises that this resulted in a plea discount commensurate with the timing, reflecting the principles articulated in R v. Lawson [2019] EWCA Crim 541 and further refined in R v. Stewart [2023] EWCA Crim 1872. The court references the general principle that any reduction in sentence due to an eventual guilty plea is closely correlated to its timing; a late plea, such as this, just prior to trial, typically attracts significantly reduced mitigation. This development—while within your rights—is regrettable. The cost in officer time, witness availability, and court scheduling is not trivial. Victims and retail staff have had to endure prolonged uncertainty, with the attendant stress and disruption this causes. The Crown’s outlines and submissions on this point have been clear and cogent. Notably, evidence was provided that the files compiled for the case ran to over 1,200 pages once all disclosures, statements, and exhibits were assembled. This evidences the disproportionate administrative burden even relatively modest offence cases carry. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. The Facts and Impact on Retail Environments Your offending profile, as established by the material before this court, indicates a calculated and repeated course of shoplifting, targeted across multiple premises, including convenience stores, pharmacy outlets, and discount retailers. The items appropriated were frequently small in individual value, yet cumulatively represented a significant loss to businesses already under strain from logistical disruptions and wider economic pressures. It cannot be overstated that retail theft, while sometimes viewed socially as a victimless offence or one of low seriousness, has very tangible consequences. Shop staff report that such persistent theft necessitates an increase in security measures which can ripple through store operations, including increased staffing costs, reduced hours, and in some cases relocation or closure. Many such businesses operate on tight margins, and the knock-on effect of lost stock and disruption is substantial. The court also notes that repeated shoplifting incidents contribute to a broader climate of insecurity and disquiet within the local community, potentially diminishing public confidence. Further to this, the court has received written representations from the Sussex Retail Alliance, emphasizing the strain placed on independent retailers who frequently fall outside the ambit of corporate security investment. Their submissions are measured and detailed, underscoring the compounding economic and psychological harm caused by ongoing theft incidents. The national picture reflects this local experience. Data published by the Association of Convenience Stores shows that in 2024, retail crime levels increased by 8.4% relative to the previous year, with a particular uptick in shoplifting offences targeting health and beauty products—items reportedly taken in your case. The Retail Crime Index also indicates that proactive responses at local policing level, while improving, face persistent resource challenges. Such context, while not determinative of individual culpability, frames the seriousness with which the court must approach the matter. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. The court further acknowledges that this offence takes place against a broader backdrop of changes in public attitudes to retail security and policing. There is a well-documented tension between increasing security measures—which, though often necessary, may affect public access and privacy—and the imperative to maintain open and welcoming retail environments. It is incumbent upon everyone to recognise their role in sustaining these environments, and theft fundamentally undermines the social compact that supports them. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. The Defendant’s Personal Circumstances and Expert Assessments Turning to your personal circumstances, the court has before it a psychiatric evaluation prepared by Dr Evelyn Moreno, consultant forensic psychiatrist, and a probation report compiled by Ms Keisha Abbott. Both provide valuable insights into factors relevant to sentencing, including risk of reoffending and potential for rehabilitation. Dr Moreno's report—prepared following a comprehensive assessment in late September—provides that you display no evidence of a major psychiatric disorder but notes traits consistent with chronic impulsivity and moderate substance misuse, specifically alcohol dependency of a degree potentially influencing decision-making processes at times of offending. Dr Moreno is candid in her conclusion that while no illness as such is present to diminish responsibility, your difficulties with impulse control and substance use pose an elevated risk factor. The report recommends structured community treatment if viable, acknowledging that engagement with such services has been erratic in the recent past. An addendum by Dr Moreno references the challenges presented by local NHS mental health service waiting lists, noting that while adult addiction services have improved, capacity remains insufficient to address all need promptly. This contributes to a risk of relapse and sustained contact with the criminal justice system. Ms Abbott’s probation report, provided last month, details your long history of low-level theft offences and notes multiple failed attempts at diversionary schemes. It further highlights your unstable housing situation and sporadic employment history—weighing these factors alongside protective ones such as noted family support and expressed willingness to comply with court-imposed conditions. She underscores that your previous breach of community orders indicates a pattern of non-compliance that must be given due weight. Your engagement with probation services prior to this prosecution has been described as “limited and inconsistent,” and attempts to refer you to vocational retraining programmes were not taken up. The report advocates a thorough and tailored rehabilitation package post-sentence. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. Background and Contextual Observations on Public Services and Systemic Pressures It is instructive to consider the wider pressures on public services that intersect with cases such as this. The Probation Service, under significant strain due to increased caseloads and staffing shortages nationwide, likewise suffers from reduced capacity to provide bespoke management and monitoring. Current National Probation Service publications warn of risks associated with overcrowded caseloads, particularly for clients presenting with complex needs—including those with substance misuse and impulse control challenges. This constellation of factors not only complicates effective offender management but also prolongs the cycle of offending and supervision lapses. Similarly, local housing services in Brighton continue to report acute shortages of affordable and stable accommodation, with pressure on temporary housing stock at crisis levels. It is therefore unsurprising that defendants such as yourself report precarious living conditions, which in turn can act as a compounding factor in criminal conduct. The relationship between housing insecurity and acquisitive crime is well explored in criminal justice research—but it remains no defence. Courts must balance understanding of social determinants with recognition of individual accountability. On a related front, the current climate for retail businesses is beset with challenges. Reports by the British Retail Consortium highlight increased losses due to theft, especially in independent outlets unable to afford advanced security systems. Despite coordinated efforts such as local Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRP), successes remain partial and fragmentary, often subverted by fluctuations in funding and personnel turnover. Frontline retail workers, many employed on zero-hours contracts or in part-time posts, bear considerable emotional burden, often experiencing elevated stress and anxiety linked to recurrent offending incidents. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. The court is mindful, too, of repeated case law emphasising deterrence as a core principle in sentencing for theft offences. In R v. Kendricks [2022] EWCA Crim 1141, the Court of Appeal affirmed the necessity of sentences that convey unequivocal censure where organised or persistent thefts undermine community safety and economic stability. Similarly, the guidance issued by the Sentencing Council in 2023 stresses the need to balance proportionate punishment with opportunities for rehabilitation, in cases where underlying vulnerabilities may exist but are not determinative of culpability. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. Discussion of Related Case Law and Relevant Jurisprudence While the primary charge is theft, it is impossible or unwise to consider this case in isolation from related jurisprudence, some of which involves more serious offending by co-defendants or other parties linked marginally in procedural terms. For instance, in R v. Lomax [2018] EWCA Crim 1328, the Court contended with issues surrounding group offending involving both acquisitive crimes and instances of criminal damage to private property. Although none of that conduct is attributable to you, the case illustrates the risk of escalation inherent in patterns of low-level offending left unchecked. Equally instructive is R v. Faraday [2021] EWCA Crim 1979, concerning a defendant convicted for aggravated vehicle theft whose sentence was influenced by a prior history of multiple small-scale thefts, including shops and public transport fare evasion. The interplay between the offences demonstrated a pattern of escalating criminality, further relating to use of stolen property. While such facts are outside the present charge, they offer cautionary context on the dangers of recidivism. The Court also acknowledges the significant proliferation of co-defendants in recent regional cases—some of whom have faced charges ranging from affray following public disturbances, possession of bladed articles in school car parks, or environmental offences exemplified by fly-tipping on adjacent greenbelt land. None relate to you directly, but remain part of the larger constellation of acquisitive and public order crimes that challenge policing and judicial resources locally. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. The court has before it statements from affected store managers and employees, attesting to the impact your actions have had on their personal wellbeing and operational confidence. These statements reflect not only financial loss but also anxiety, residual fear, and in some instances, increasing reluctance to work unsupervised or during later shifts. The economic and psychological toll cannot be overstated. One representative letter, from a community pharmacy facing persistent targeting, speaks eloquently of the erosion of trust and security: “Our staff feel scrutinised for suspicion of theft, yet the real threat comes from repeated offenders who take advantage of our goodwill and the limitations of current security measures.” These observations are echoed across several premises, some of which have had to introduce costly security upgrades or impose reduced opening hours. The court also recognises the work of local voluntary bodies such as the Brighton Retail Support Network, which provides frontline assistance to victims of retail crime, including advisory services and emotional support. Their submissions speak to the increasingly fraught atmosphere in which employees operate and the consequential demand on charity resources. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. The offences before the court must be viewed as a sustained and systematic course of conduct, reflecting a high degree of planning and contingency. While there was no direct violence or threats, the impact on staff morale and business viability is serious. Your personal circumstances—though challenging—do not excuse the persistent nature of the offending, nor do they justify failure to engage meaningfully with available support mechanisms. Sentencing guidelines for theft offences emphasise proportionality, deterrence, and rehabilitation. The court will consider all relevant factors, including the late guilty plea, risk assessments, and the potential for structured community interventions. I note the defence’s submissions advocating for non-custodial measures focussed on rehabilitation, enhanced supervision, and integrated support services. I equally acknowledge the Crown’s emphasis on the need for denunciation and public protection. Given the complexities identified—your background, offence pattern, victim impact, and available professional input—it is appropriate at this stage to receive a detailed pre-sentence report. I specifically request that the probation service consider all available rehabilitative options, including cognitive skills training, substance misuse treatment, and employment support pathways. The report should address risk, compliance likelihood, and suitability for community-based sanctions versus custodial disposals. I will therefore adjourn for sentencing pending receipt of this report and any further representations. These remarks are issued this day, 13 November 2025, in Court 5 at Brighton Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is informed of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence, under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions provided by section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER R v. MR H Case No. M2025/13457 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. Royston Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in respect of a charge arising under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to incidents of shoplifting carried out in various retail establishments within the Greater Manchester area spanning a period from mid-2023 to early 2025. This court must therefore undertake a careful and measured assessment of the facts before it, while reflecting not only upon the circumstances of the offence, but also on the wider context within which such offending occurs. Procedural Background You were arrested on 20 March 2025 following an investigation led by officers attached to the Greater Manchester Retail Crime Task Force, working in close concert with multiple business crime reduction units and local council enforcement teams. The investigation involved a systematic gathering of CCTV footage, witness statements, and the recovery of physical evidence from your residence. This operation was noted for its multi-agency involvement, including assistance from the City of Manchester Forensic Data Unit, whose technical expertise was engaged to enhance and authenticate relevant digital recordings. Such concerted efforts serve to highlight the significant public resources expended on cases involving what might otherwise be dismissed as “minor” acquisitive offences; a reminder of the challenges faced by modern policing when addressing persistent retail crime. I must record a note of some disappointment at the delays caused in obtaining necessary forensic examination results, largely attributable to backlogs within the forensic service provider. These delays necessitated the adjournment of the initial sentencing hearing scheduled for late July 2025 in order to allow the disclosure process to be properly completed. This is, regrettably, far from unusual and speaks to enduring issues within public sector forensic capacity. While not something for which any individual party is responsible, such systemic delays impose considerable strain upon defendants, victims, and the court alike. It is to be hoped that ongoing initiatives to expand forensic laboratory facilities will alleviate these bottlenecks in the medium term. It is also appropriate to make brief mention of the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of your case materials. As noted in correspondence lodged on behalf of your solicitor, applications for funding to instruct an independent clinical forensic psychologist were made in early April but were met with initial refusals and repeated requests for additional clarification. The administrative inefficiencies inherent in this process were regrettable and, as with forensic delays, contribute to the risk that justice is deferred unnecessarily. I sincerely hope that pending reforms to the administration of legal aid will expedite the commissioning of expert reports in future cases. Your case was allocated to this Crown Court under the Criminal Procedure Rules’ Better Case Management (BCM) framework, with hearings proceeding in a generally timely manner save for the aforementioned adjournments occasioned by disclosure delays. Plea and trial preparation hearings took place on 2 June and 12 August respectively, at which times you elected initially to plead not guilty. However, following the service of further CCTV evidence and forensic analysis linking you to key items, you ultimately entered a plea of guilty on 10 September 2025. This change in plea, while welcomed, was regrettably late in the process, following extensive case preparation by the Crown and defence. The court must emphasize that credit for guilty pleas operates not as a pure discount but as recognition of the benefits that an early admission of responsibility brings to the administration of justice — in terms of resources conserved and witnesses spared the distress of trial. A plea entered at a late stage offers less mitigation, as was explored by the Court of Appeal in R v. Hammond [2023] EWCA Crim 745, where the timing of the plea was deemed integral to the assessment of credit available. That decision followed earlier guidance in R v. Patterson [2021] EWCA Crim 1608, which similarly upheld restrictions on credit for pleas coming at or near trial. It is also worthy of acknowledgment that the offences in which you stand convicted, while lacking any element of threat or violence, demonstrate a degree of planning and persistence not to be overlooked. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Bentley [2020] EWCA Crim 1354 serves as a useful comparative authority, illustrating that repeated thefts from retail premises by a defendant with previous convictions warrant sentences reflecting both deterrence and denunciation. Bentley also recognises the significance of harm caused not merely in monetary terms but in the psychological impact on staff and communities. While your conduct fell short of the aggravated circumstances in Bentley, the principle remains sound. It is also with some regret that this court must record the lack of media interest in matters of acquisitive crime, even where persistent offending strains the fabric of local commerce and community life. Despite the openness of such proceedings and the availability of public access, it appears such cases carry insufficient newsworthiness to attract coverage. This apparent selective attention arguably diminishes public awareness of the everyday realities of retail crime and its cumulative effects. The Court is likewise mindful of the broader pattern of acquisitive offending in the region, as outlined in the annual report produced by the Northern Retail Crime Partnership, which notes a 12% increase in retail theft incidents over the past year, with a substantial proportion attributable to repeat offenders. For completeness, I should mention that your defence team provided a supporting letter from your sister, Mrs K. H., who describes you as a “reserved but fundamentally decent person faced with considerable adversity.” Several letters from representatives of local charity organisations offering assistance with housing and substance misuse concerns were also submitted in advance of this hearing, reflecting ongoing engagement with voluntary sector providers. The court appreciates such contributions, as they offer a fuller picture of an individual’s circumstances beyond the purely procedural. It is noteworthy that, unlike many other cases, no co-defendants are involved. Previous cases dealing with criminal gangs and organised retail theft rings have demonstrated an escalation in offending behaviour and harm — such as R v. Chilvers [2018] EWCA Crim 2045, where multiple defendants operated a professionalised shoplifting syndicate with coercive dynamics and territorial disputes resulting in violence and intimidation. Such cases lie beyond the scope of these proceedings, but provide context to the diverse spectrum of behaviours and risks linked to acquisitive crime. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. I turn now to matters concerning the nature of your offending. The pattern of behaviour identified in your case reveals several hallmark features of persistent shoplifting: repeated visits to similar establishments, operation on civilian hours to avoid peak staffing, and the use of improvised concealment methods. CCTV footage submitted reveals you entering retail premises dressed in layered clothing, carrying large bags which were subsequently filled with goods without payment. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. On occasion, you were seen lingering near certain product aisles — often toiletries and small electronic accessories — waiting for moments in which employees were preoccupied, often during brief lulls in foot traffic or during shift handovers. This suggests a degree of calculation rather than impulsivity, which carries weight in assessing culpability. On four separate visits within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same small shop and stole alcohol and tobacco products. Complementing the physical evidence were witness statements from shop assistants who described feelings of unease and frustration arising from repeated exposure to your conduct. Some staff took steps to modify their working patterns, including the implementation of buddy systems and enhanced on-floor presence during vulnerable periods. These measures, while commendable, underscore the emotional and operational toll your offending exacted. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. Further, reports from the retail security teams note that while no direct threats were made, the atmosphere generated by your persistent presence contributed to a climate of anxiety impinging on day-to-day functionality. This reflects the harm detailed in R v. Tipping [2019] EWCA Crim 1452, where repeated targeting of small businesses engendered psychological distress disproportionate to the financial loss involved. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. Parallel to the criminal proceeding, correspondence from the Manchester Retail Support Network detailed approaches made to you offering diversionary programmes, including access to budgeting advice, vocational support, and cognitive-behavioural workshops targeting acquisitive offending tendencies. These offers were initially contemplated but, according to reports, not consistently engaged with. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. A pre-sentence psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Harriet K. Simmons, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was commissioned following concerns raised by your defence. Her assessment, received on 30 September 2025, concluded that you do not meet diagnostic criteria for any major psychiatric disorder but display traits suggestive of impulsivity and difficulties with emotional regulation. Dr Simmons also remarked on a moderate degree of depressive symptomatology linked to housing instability and unemployment. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. The report notes your acknowledgment of financial stressors and limited social supports but highlights an inconsistent pattern of service engagement. Of concern is the report’s finding that while some motivation for change exists, there is a significant risk of relapse into acquisitive behaviour absent active intervention. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, claimed it wasn’t a serious crime and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. These professional observations echo the findings of a probation officer’s report dated 1 October 2025, which emphasises the challenges presented by your current lack of stable accommodation and sporadic contact with support services. The probation officer, Ms Cassandra Patel, notes the systemic pressures facing frontline staff, referencing ongoing shortages and increased caseloads which impact the timeliness and quality of required supervision. It is important to briefly touch on the issue of housing provision in Greater Manchester, which, as elsewhere, faces considerable demand exceeding supply. Temporary accommodation placements have risen sharply, placing strain on local authorities and voluntary organisations alike; these societal pressures form an unavoidable backdrop to cases such as yours. While it may be tempting to interpret such contextual difficulties as causal or excusive, the court reiterates that personal responsibility remains paramount. The law does not countenance the reduction of legal accountability simply by reference to external hardship. This is a hard truth but a necessary one for the maintenance of public confidence in the justice system. You are 34 years old. Your previous record includes three convictions for shoplifting dating back over the past five years. These previous convictions and their attendant disposals—including a community order with curfew requirement—must figure heavily in the overall sentencing calculus. Despite prior warnings and interventions, your offending persisted, signalling a pattern resistant to informal management. There is no evidence of coercion or gang involvement in your history. Nor is there indication of complicity in offences beyond those before this court. The court is made aware that your current accommodation is temporary housing arranged through municipal emergency schemes. This is consistent with evidence that housing insecurity correlates strongly with persistence of acquisitive offending. However, such correlation does not equate to causation; while supportive and stable housing is conducive to rehabilitation, the absence thereof is not a license to offend. Your solicitor and probation officer have requested that the court consider community-based sentences incorporating rehabilitative activities. This court acknowledges their arguments and will await the forthcoming full pre-sentence report but emphasises that such proposals must be realistic and enforceable, with a view to proper public protection. Turning to sentencing principles, the approach outlined by the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guidelines (2023 edition) remains authoritative. The guidelines instruct that offences involving persistent targeting of certain types of goods, repeat offending, and impact upon staffing and other victims should attract sentences reflecting those aggravating features. I am also mindful of the principles expressed in the recently promulgated judgment R v. Finlayson [2024] EWCA Crim 89, where the appellate court recognised that acquisitive offending—though often low in individual monetary impact—may cumulatively erode social trust and justify custodial sentences to achieve deterrence. To place matters in further context, I observe that matters of acquisitive crime have long posed significant challenges to policing and community agencies. The advent of multi-agency crime partnerships seeks to coordinate responses but is hampered by resource constraints and data-sharing limitations, as noted in the 2022 Home Office Report on Retail Crime Collaboration. In light of all the above, I shall direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, incorporating the completed psychiatric assessment and any further information arising from probation interviews and community service provider feedback. The report should explore the feasibility of community-cohort supervision programmes addressing acquisitive offending, as trialled in adjoining jurisdictions, alongside any current risk management measures. I relieve all parties of the obligation to produce further forensic evidence as matters stand but allow the defence the opportunity to update representations following the report’s completion. Mr H, I remind you that your late guilty plea attracts a reduced discount and that the court will weigh heavily your previous convictions and the persistent nature of this offending. Credit is nevertheless given for your eventual plea. The hearing today has been conducted in open court with full participation from prosecution and defence representatives. My thanks to Ms Laura Jacobs, appearing for the Crown, and to Mr Adam Fairchild, who represents you under a Legal Aid representation order. Today's proceedings have been audio-recorded and transcribed in conformity with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules (CrimPR). The record will be held at Manchester Crown Court for requisite purposes. You are hereby notified of your statutory right to appeal this decision within 28 days as prescribed under sections 108 and following of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions in force pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 or otherwise. Costs remain reserved. These sentencing remarks are issued this 14th day of October 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. The formal sentencing hearing will be scheduled following receipt of the probation pre-sentence report and any final submissions. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT NORTHGATE R v. MR H Case No. NGT-2025-01942 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. P. WAINWRIGHT Filed: 18 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following a charge under section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968, relating to a representative offence of shoplifting. The indictment reflects a sustained course of conduct involving multiple incidents of theft from various retail premises situated within the jurisdiction of Northgate and its immediate environs over a period extending from the autumn of 2023 to early summer 2025. Procedural History Your initial appearance was recorded at the Northgate Magistrates’ Court on 9 August 2025, when you first entered a plea of not guilty. Following the direction of the Crown Prosecution Service, the case was committed to this court under the Better Case Management process on 30 September 2025, with a plea and trial preparation hearing scheduled. It is worth noting that your guilty plea was entered longitudinally—conceded on the morning of trial, after the full evidential case had been presented and the jury empanelled. This judicial forum has become all too accustomed to last-minute pleas in cases concerning acquisitive crime. While the law rightly preserves the right of every defendant to defend allegations, the court must weigh the impact of such timing on the administration of justice. It is well-established, notably in R v. Morley [2019] EWCA Crim 445, that credit for a plea of guilty can be significantly reduced when entered at a late stage, particularly where it delays the conclusion of proceedings and imposes additional burdens on victims, witnesses, and court resources. Your case was adjourned on two occasions, the first occasion linked to applications for funding by the defence to instruct a forensic psychiatrist with expertise in behavioural addictions and impulsive offending. The Legal Aid Agency’s response was notably protracted; official correspondence reflects a series of requests for clarification, additional paperwork, and protracted decision-making which, regrettably, extended through a six-week period. This delay did not serve the interests of justice; it added pressure to an already congested court list and prolonged uncertainty for all parties involved. It falls to the court to observe with no small measure of concern how persistent administrative inertia within public legal aid provision risks subverting the timely and equitable resolution of criminal cases. Counsel for the defence had, with appropriate professionalism and diligence, submitted all requisite documentation as promptly as possible. The recorded chronology highlights an unfortunate systemic dysfunction; the cause of which is of course beyond the jurisdiction of this court to redress, but for which I nonetheless record profound dissatisfaction. You were remanded on bail following your arrest on 15 June 2025. Conditions attached to your bail required residence at a specified address and reporting to your local police station twice weekly. Compliance with these terms was noted in the pre-sentence report as generally satisfactory, notwithstanding occasional failures to notify changes of contact details, which police attribute to your transient housing circumstances. The business community has had some involvement in this matter through the Northgate Retail Crime Partnership, a well-established multi-agency initiative designed to mitigate shop theft and related crimes. The partnership’s activities involve information-sharing, coordinated patrols, and victim support services. While the group’s capacity is understandably constrained by limited funding and manpower, it nonetheless furnished several victim impact statements which provide valuable insight into the practical effects of your offending on local retailers and staff. The court is conscious, however, that such schemes operate within significant systemic limits. Frontline officers consistently face the challenge of balancing demands from a wide array of calls for service, meaning that acquisitive offences often compete for attention with higher priority investigations, including violent crime or organised gang activity. This dynamic is echoed in the recent report by the National Policing Board (2023), which identified that acquisitive property crimes—even in their smaller and repetitive manifestations—consume substantial operational resources, with estimated costs extending beyond financial losses to include staff absence and deteriorating workplace morale. Instructed counsel appearing today, Ms. Fiona J. Willoughby for the Crown and Mr. Gareth T. Milligan for the defence, have provided their submissions with due regard to the statutory framework, guideline principles, and relevant case law. Their detailed advocacy is appreciated. It is appropriate at this juncture to remind the court of the statutory sentencing framework applicable to theft offences. The Theft Act 1968, at section 1, defines theft as dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with the intent to permanently deprive. Sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council (Definitive Guideline on Theft offences, 2021) identify key aggravating factors, including a history of similar offending, targeting of vulnerable victims, use of deception, and impact on staff vulnerability or community confidence. The case law further elucidates sentencing considerations where repetitive shoplifting with cumulative impact is concerned. As iterated in R v. Horton [2022] EWCA Crim 517, judges must balance the apparently modest value of items stolen with the broader harm caused, encompassing the fear engendered in shop staff, reputational damage to the affected business, and the cumulative burden on public enforcement services. On the topic of relevant comparative authority, I also consider instructive the judgment in R v. Clayton [2020] EWCA Crim 1719, which emphasised the importance of proportionality and individualised sentencing, cautioning against imprisonment for first or isolated low-value retail theft, but affirming immediate custody where offending forms part of a persistent pattern demonstrating clear disregard for previous warnings and rehabilitative opportunities. The court acknowledges the increasing deployment of advanced forensic techniques and digital investigative tools in establishing proofs of identity and chronology in omission-based offences. In this case, items retrieved and CCTV footage have been instrumental in corroborating the prosecution’s narrative, alongside electronic transaction records at various points of sale. Against this backdrop, the court now turns to the materials before it, including pre-sentence reports, psychiatric assessments, victim and agency correspondence, and of course, the statements put forward on your behalf. As a matter of process and fairness, the Social Services department prepared a safeguarding assessment following concerns voiced by a local homelessness prevention team. This report, dated 2 October 2025, carefully considers your personal circumstances, highlighting precarious housing status and history of substance misuse. It recommends continued engagement with supported accommodation services and community mental health provision. The interviewing social worker commented on your guarded but cooperative demeanour during discussions. Separately, the court received a letter from HelloBright, a local charity focused on assisting vulnerable adult offenders through education and skills training. The letter commends your recent attendance at a series of workshops and your expressed willingness to reconsider pathways towards employment. Such representations, while welcomed, do not mitigate the seriousness of the offending before the court, but serve as indicative of potential for positive change. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. I must note, dispassionately and with care, that the repeated nature of the incidents suggests a degree of planning and opportunism. The typology of stolen goods reflects an understanding of items with relatively high resale value and ease of concealment. This is not, in the court’s view, a simplistic lapse in judgment but rather a conscious and sustained engagement in criminal behaviour. Prior to your arrest, several local shop owners participated in the Business Crime Reduction Partnership intelligence meetings. Notes submitted in evidence describe a strategic sharing of data, enabling the identification of patterns of movement and modus operandi consistent with your conduct. This demonstrates a commendable level of cross-sector cooperation, albeit within limits imposed by resource constraints. It also bears mentioning that one co-defendant, charged in an allied indictment for conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary, was found to have supplied information regarding electronic security alarms at local premises. That defendant absconded following release on bail and remains at large, with active warrants issued by police. I emphasise that your case is to be considered independently, as there is no direct evidential link to whoever may have been involved in those separate offences. In R v. O’Donnell [2017] EWCA Crim 1968, the Court noted that associational offences such as conspiracy can often complicate matters of culpability and sentencing, but care must be taken to ensure sentences properly reflect the individual’s responsibility. The current defendant has no recorded association with the co-defendant’s activities and so such background, though provided for completeness, bears no direct relevance to your culpability. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. Somewhat tangentially, the court recalls a contemporaneous criminal trial held in the neighbouring borough concerning fly-tipping in a sensitive greenbelt area, arising out of an entirely separate matter. While not pertinent to the current proceedings, it serves as a reminder of the breadth of criminality that intersects with issues of community protection and environmental stewardship. The court hopes the principles laid down therein, including the importance of deterrence and reparation, are helpful in contextual understanding, though not determinative here. Returning to the present case, your history, as detailed in the probation service report dated 7 October 2025, discloses a series of convictions primarily for theft-related offences commencing in 2018. The report identifies five prior incidents of shoplifting, all resulting in community resolutions or conditional discharges, yet there appears to have been little sustained engagement with rehabilitative interventions. The psychiatric report, produced following instruction from this court and authored by Dr Neil Harding, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, offers valuable insight. The report, dated 11 October 2025, states that you exhibit no formal psychiatric diagnosis but describes traits of borderline personality organisation, manifested in impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and intermittent self-harm ideation. Dr Harding emphasises your expressed motivation by underlying financial distress, but notes that trauma-informed interventions have so far failed to engage you fully. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. The report stresses the need for ongoing multidisciplinary management and warns of elevated risk of recidivism absent meaningful intervention. Participation in accredited cognitive behavioural programmes targeting acquisitive offending, such as the Thinking Skills Programme or Addressing Substance-Related Offending, is recommended. It is important to consider, additionally, the strain placed on public health systems by the growing prevalence of complex emotional and behavioural disorders in offenders. NHS commissioning data from the Northgate and Eastern CCG notes waiting times for adult community mental health teams in excess of twelve weeks, placing significant pressure on mainstream access for those who lack the capacity or motivation to engage independently. The probation officer overseeing your case commented on the tension between individual readiness to change and institutional capacity. Such considerations are critical when tailoring appropriate intervention packages aimed at reducing reoffending risk. Within the context of sentencing, it is necessary to examine the wider social and economic factors at play. The national picture reflects continuing challenges with street homelessness, welfare adequacy, and employment precarity. As documented in the 2024 Annual Report of the Homelessness Monitor, there is an increasing incidence of rough sleeping concentrated in urban centres including Northgate. The interplay between insecure housing and low-level acquisitive crime is complex but must not be overstated to the point of excusing clear legal wrongs. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. Local authority housing teams have reported ongoing difficulties in accommodating vulnerable single adults, exacerbated by funding shortfalls and rising demand. Meanwhile, community organisations such as SafeStay Northgate provide vital emergency shelter but operate with finite resources. On the topic of victim impact, statements from individual shopkeepers convey the human cost beyond mere monetary loss. Several witnesses describe heightened anxiety, disrupted work patterns, and a pervasive sense of vulnerability within small retail outlets, some of which have introduced new security measures costing thousands of pounds to implement. The Retail Support Network submitted a detailed analysis ahead of today’s hearing. Their assessment notes that repeat shoplifting incidents increase staff turnover and sickness rates, compounding the operational challenges faced by small businesses — many of which linger on narrow margins. Furthermore, the psychological toll on frontline workers is not adequately recognised in public discourse, yet is palpable. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. There exists a danger in treating offending of this nature as “victimless crime.” It is not. It is a crime with tangible, often hidden casualties. The law and the court must acknowledge this reality solemnly. Certainly, the defendant’s letter to the court, submitted on 14 October 2025, expresses regret for the distress caused, and articulates a desire to address underlying difficulties. The letter was composed with a readable hand and is free from illegibility or undue incoherence; a matter on which the court is obliged to comment in fairness, given frequent cases to the contrary. Prior outreach by Your Local Offenders Support Team (YLOST) has included attempts to engage you in alcohol reduction services, debt advice, and housing stability programmes. Their correspondence highlights a mixed pattern of response marked by intermittent attendance and eventual disengagement. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. The courts remain aware of the critical role that multi-disciplinary partnerships play in preventing reoffending and enhancing public protection. Models such as the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) and the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) framework have been deployed to varying success in cases involving higher-risk offenders. While not directly engaged in your circumstance, the principles of coordinated intervention inform contemporary probation practice. Reference should also be made to R v. Templeman [2018] EWCA Crim 957, where the Court of Appeal underscored the imperative of sentencing consistency, warning against unwarranted disparity in similar offending profiles, while recognising individual mitigating factors. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. The issue of credit for a late plea of guilty requires balanced consideration. Your admission, entered only upon the cusp of trial, necessarily attracts a reduced discount consistent with authorities such as R v. Dyer [2020] EWCA Crim 2018. Although it spares the need for a contested trial, it comes after the Crown has expended considerable effort in preparation, and the inconvenience to witnesses has been prolonged unnecessarily. Public confidence in the justice system depends, in part, on the timely and efficient resolution of cases. Last-minute pleas can erode this confidence and add to systemic pressures. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, claimed it wasn’t a serious crime and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. Having considered all materials, including the personal circumstances of the defendant, expert opinion, victim impact, and sentencing precedents, I conclude that a custodial sentence is warranted. The repeated nature of the offending, the failure to respond to previous interventions, and the evident planning and persistence combine to elevate the culpability beyond the threshold for immediate custody. Nonetheless, I emphasise that sentencing must also reflect prospects for rehabilitation and reintegration. It is my intention to balance deterrence, punishment, and rehabilitation in arriving at a just outcome. Accordingly, I await a comprehensive pre-sentence report prior to passing sentence. The probation service is requested to explore suitable community rehabilitation options, including cognitive behavioural programmes, structured unpaid work, and financial management support. The report should also appraise the feasibility of a supervision model incorporating mental health liaison and housing support networks. I reserve final determination until such report has been received and considered. The court records its thanks to all who have contributed to the thorough and diligent preparation of this case, including the prosecution team led by Ms Fiona J. Willoughby, and to Mr Gareth T. Milligan for his robust and conscientious defence submissions. The hearing has been held in open court with full compliance to applicable protocol. The courtroom facilities, recently refurbished, allowed for adequate distancing and accessibility. This document is issued this day, 18 October 2025, at the Northgate Crown Court, Court 1. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A certified transcript will be appended to the court record. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal within 28 days, under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM R v. MR H Case No. T2025/13429 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. Elton Filed: 16 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing on a charge of theft, specifically the repeated shoplifting of goods from multiple retail outlets across the Birmingham metropolitan area. The offending spans a period from early 2023 through April 2025, culminating in your arrest earlier this year. The charge represents a significant breach of trust and law, underlying broader concerns about community safety and the protection of commercial premises. Procedural History and Case Progression Your initial appearance took place on 15 May 2025 before Birmingham Magistrates’ Court, where you entered a not guilty plea. The case was committed to the Crown Court for trial given the severity and multiplicity of incidents involved. Thereafter, the case was subject to a series of pre-trial hearings, including a plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 10 July 2025. During the PTPH, the Crown served voluminous evidence, including enhanced CCTV footage, witness statements, and analyses of recovered property. At the subsequent hearing on 1 September 2025, you entered a guilty plea to a representative charge, a decision which has been taken into account, though it was notably late in the proceedings. It is unfortunate, but increasingly common, that defendants in acquisitive crime cases delay pleas until the prosecution evidence becomes overwhelming. The weight of recent case law, including R v Dundas [2020] EWCA Crim 1358 and R v Kearney [2022] EWCA Crim 1450, confirms that credit for a guilty plea diminishes significantly where it is entered at a late stage, especially after extensive preparation for trial. The underlying rationale is that an early plea spares victims and witnesses the ordeal of giving evidence and reduces the burden on public resources. With that in mind, the court must carefully weigh the timing and sincerity of any plea in determining the appropriate discount. Over the course of these proceedings, there have been several adjournments, most notably to enable compliance with requests for expert psychiatric assessment and a pre-sentence report. The Legal Aid Agency’s response, while eventually sufficient, was marked by delays and administrative hurdles which hindered the timely deployment of expert services. I take this opportunity to note, with no small frustration, that these obstacles compromise timely justice and threaten the interests of fairness. The repeated difficulties in securing funding authorisations for such assessments represent a systemic concern and place unnecessary strain on all participants. It is also worth recording appreciation for the Crown Prosecution Service’s diligent case preparation and the work of the Birmingham Business Crime Partnership (BBCP), whose members have submitted detailed victim impact statements. The BBCP, despite chronic underfunding and staffing shortages, continues to provide crucial liaison between retailers and law enforcement. Their documentation vividly illustrates the cumulative distress inflicted upon staff and proprietors by repeated retail theft — a form of crime often dismissed as trivial but with very real consequences. Similarly, the probation service has cooperated in providing up-to-date risk assessments and coordinated input from multiple agencies, including local mental health services and housing officers. Mr Paul Everitt of the Probation Service prepared an extensive report dated 10 September 2025, which will be referred to in these remarks. It is well understood that acquisitive offending such as this imposes significant workload pressures on police and court staff alike, detracting from resources otherwise focused on serious violent and organised crime. The diversion of scarce public resources, though intangible in economic terms, reflects an opportunity cost that must be factored into sentencing considerations. Preliminarily, I note the relevant legislative and judicial contexts that inform sentencing in this area. Theft offences are governed principally by the Theft Act 1968, section 1, which defines the offence as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. While isolated or low-value thefts may be dealt with summarily or by diversion schemes, repeated offending over an extended period signals an elevated risk and culpability. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2019) provides a structured approach to assessing harm, culpability, and aggravating or mitigating factors. Well-established precedent, including R v Latif [2019] EWCA Crim 1227 and R v Havers [2022] EWCA Crim 1602, affirms that multiple thefts particularly when accompanied by planning, concealment tactics, or targeting of vulnerable or small independent retailers, warrant custodial sentences in many cases. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly emphasised the importance of public deterrence in the context of persistent shoplifting, given the wider commercial and social harms occasioned. The Defendant’s Background and Previous Contacts Mr H is 34 years old and has a series of prior convictions largely for shoplifting offences dating back to 2017. These include custodial sentences, suspended sentences, and community orders, the details of which are fully recorded in the sentencing bundle. The most recent disposal, a community rehabilitation order, was imposed in 2023 but breached on several occasions. There is no indication of gang involvement or acquaintance with organised crime groups. He reports periods of unemployment interspersed with casual and temporary labour, but notably relies on local authority temporary accommodation given unstable housing. The probation assessment notes fluctuating engagement with support services and multiple missed appointments with addiction counselling. The defendant’s reported circumstances are reflective of significant social and economic disadvantage. The court reviewed a detailed psychological report prepared by Dr Francesca Muir, a forensic clinical psychologist, dated 5 September 2025. Dr Muir’s assessment found no diagnosable major mental disorder; however, she noted impulsivity, indicators of substance misuse, and concurrent depression symptoms. Significantly, Dr Muir recorded ongoing struggles with financial management and inconsistent compliance with previous interventions, recommending structured cognitive-behavioural therapy focusing on impulse control. Concerns about the capacity and availability of mental health services locally are noted in the report and echoed elsewhere in the documentary material. The NHS trusts serving this jurisdiction have repeatedly flagged increased pressure and service demand, leading to long waiting lists and delays for psychological support. While such systemic issues are not the defendant’s responsibility, they form a regrettable backdrop, complicating rehabilitation prospects. Victim personal statements were received from four separate retail outlets, including two pharmacy chains, a convenience store, and a local supermarket. These statements detail not only repeated losses incurred, but the profound effect on staff morale and personal sense of safety. Several employees describe heightened anxiety, changes in work patterns, and in one case, an employee requiring time off due to stress-related illness. One store manager’s statement highlighted that the defendant’s repeated visits created a climate of fear, prompting enhanced security measures and additional staff training costs. Similar concerns emerge from correspondence by the Retail Support Network, which continues to advocate for better resourcing of crime prevention initiatives focused on retail premises. Their representation stresses that while individual thefts may seem minor when isolated, the cumulative effect on business viability and community confidence is material and significant. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. It is worth considering, though only tangentially related, the judgment in R v Cavendish [2017] EWCA Crim 2983, dealing with a burglary committed on a domestic dwelling during a seasonal absence. Though factually distant, the case serves as a reminder that breach of trust and exploitation of vulnerability carry considerable weight in sentencing, even absent direct harm. Marking a continuing theme in distractor material is R v Jonas [2020] EWCA Crim 726, concerning criminal damage to a community centre noticeboard, which resulted in a civic fine. While wholly irrelevant to this case, the principles articulated on proportionality and community impact contribute to our evolving jurisprudence on property offences. Returning to the present matter, the court notes that retail employees’ experiences of repeated theft extend beyond economic loss to a deteriorating sense of workplace security. Trust in security arrangements and management responsiveness is strained, and the knock-on effects include increased staff turnover. These are not trivial consequences. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. Further digressions included materials relating to a co-defendant in an unrelated case, Mr Peter Able, charged with assaulting arresting officers with a chair during a protest near Birmingham city centre. Although completely unrelated here, this illustrates the sometimes chaotic nature of cases arriving in Crown Court lists. At a tactical level, the cross-jurisdictional cooperation between West Midlands Police and neighbouring forces, including Staffordshire and Warwickshire constabularies, continues to present administrative burdens. While multi-agency coordination is critical in the fight against crime, it can introduce delay and procedural complexity, unsuited to swift resolution in low-level theft cases. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. The Crown invites the court to view this offending as serious due to its persistence and sophistication. Surveillance evidence, in conjunction with staff testimony, reveals calculated actions to conceal goods, repeated targeting of specific product lines including cosmetics, toiletries, and over-the-counter medications, and timed appearances coinciding with staff shift changes or busy periods. There is evidence of the defendant employing distraction techniques and rapid exits to evade store personnel. The Prosecution points to an accumulation of losses exceeding £1,000, amplifying the moral and financial culpability beyond isolated petty theft. The fact that shop employees altered routines and some refused to work alone during likely periods of defendant presence is compelling, evidencing tangible adverse impact. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. During the investigative stage, digital forensics teams examined seized devices but found no evidence of organised sales or online disposal, indicating the offending was primarily opportunistic rather than commercial-scale. Nonetheless, the pattern was sustained over a protracted period. Similar cases involving comparable MO, such as R v Graves [2018] EWCA Crim 504 and R v Morris [2019] EWCA Crim 2851, have resulted in sentences reflecting the cumulative damage of repeated acquisitive crime. Such precedent informs the sentencing range appropriate here. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. The defendant’s apparent failure to desist following prior community-based interventions further aggravates culpability. Statements from community policing officers indicate several unsuccessful attempts at engagement and diversion from reoffending. The administration of previous conditional discharges and warning notices failed to produce the intended behavioural change. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. Expert psychiatric evidence confirms the absence of a severe or enduring mental health condition, though notes of impulsivity and depressive symptoms are present. There is no evidence of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or other legal insanity-defence predicates. The court takes seriously the potential mitigating significance of struggle with mental health, but equally notes the defendant’s inconsistent engagement with available supports. The court is cognisant of pressures upon health trusts: recent reports have highlighted dramatic increases in waiting times for psychological services, particularly cognitive-behavioural therapy. This speaks to systemic issues but does not exempt the defendant from responsibility for failing to seek or sustain appropriate treatment. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The defendant’s reported drug and alcohol history is limited, though probation records indicate occasional recreational use. No significant substance dependency is recorded, nor does the evidence suggest impairment at the times of offending. However, the role of occasional substance use in lowering impulse control is recognised, albeit without direct evidentiary linkage. Since arrest, the defendant has demonstrated some willingness to comply with court directions, but this comes after a lengthy period during which offending behaviours were prolific. The late guilty plea, entered only shortly before trial commencement, attracts limited mitigation as per standard sentencing jurisprudence. Relevant case law provides a compass for sentencing. The Court of Appeal in R v McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145 stressed that multiple thefts, particularly those occurring at night or involving entry to a dwelling, attract serious sentences to reflect the victim impact beyond mere financial loss. While Mr H’s offences did not involve burglary, the cumulative offending here similarly undermines public confidence and security. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, claimed it wasn’t a serious crime and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. The court is reminded by the CPS Business Crime Unit of the phenomenon where \"repeat offenders are responsible for disproportionate losses,\" a statement echoed by local safety programming groups such as Protect & Respect Birmingham. The impact on the retail environment remains an ongoing concern, factoring into public policy decisions regarding sentencing severity. The court further notes, though not directly related, the report of a recent case in this court where an individual was convicted of environmental offences—specifically illegal fly-tipping on protected green belt land—resulting in significant ecological damage (R v Trent [2024] EWCA Crim 1899). While that offence bears no factual connection, the principle that persistent low-level offending undermines community well-being is broadly applicable. Assessment of Risk, Rehabilitation, and Support Services The pre-sentence report, prepared by Ms Julia Fielding of the West Midlands Probation Service, notes a medium risk of harm rating, principally due to the repetitive nature of the thefts and the demonstrable impact on vulnerable staff within retail environments. There is moderate risk of reoffending, heightened by the defendant’s history of non-compliance with previous orders. Ms Fielding highlights the difficulty in engaging the defendant with sustainable housing, mental health, and employment services, a challenge compounded by systemic shortages in support infrastructure. The court is reminded of the chronic underinvestment in such vital services, as echoed in the 2024 Parliamentary inquiry into the integrated justice and welfare systems for adult offenders. Recommendations include a comprehensive package comprising cognitive skills training, financial management advice, and substance misuse support, with a preference for structured community rehabilitation where feasible. The options of a suspended sentence order with a community payback element, or, alternatively, a custodial sentence with release considerations aligned to compliance with treatment, are outlined. Letters of support submitted from local charities, including the Birmingham Outreach Network and the Helping Hands Trust, commend the defendant’s intermittent engagement in voluntary activities but also express concern about lapses and lack of sustained commitment. These materials are noted but do not diminish the seriousness of the offences. The judiciary is acutely aware of the challenges faced by those working in rehabilitation, particularly in contexts of economic hardship, depleted funding, and chaotic social circumstances. Nonetheless, the court must balance these realities against the paramount duty of public protection and maintaining confidence in the rule of law. In parallel, correspondence from the Retail Support Group reiterates the economic strain placed on small business owners who bear the brunt of shoplifting-related losses, including increased insurance premiums and, in some cases, decisions to downsize or shutter premises altogether. Such community-level consequences cannot be ignored. The cumulative gravity of the offending, the demonstrable impact on victims and community, and the defendant’s protracted failure to desist despite multiple opportunities, all point towards a custodial sentence as the minimum necessary to mark denunciation and deterrence. However, the sentencing options available will be informed by the forthcoming pre-sentence report which will assess the potential for structured community intervention and any further relevant assessments. The court reiterates that a late plea reduces credit afforded, but prosecution recognition of the defendant’s admission nonetheless carries weight. Mitigating factors, particularly personal difficulties, housing insecurity, and health issues, albeit limited, will be reflected in sentencing discretion. The defendant is encouraged to engage fully with probation services, specialist providers, and any rehabilitative programming to break the cycle of offending. The court remains hopeful that constructive interventions can promote sustained desistance, as purely punitive responses alone have proved insufficient in this case’s history. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record will be forwarded to the relevant authorities. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to sections 108–110 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved. The matter is adjourned for sentencing pending receipt of the pre-sentence report. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHBANK R v. MR H Case No. T2025/14376 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. GREAVES Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this Court having been found guilty of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending in question arose over the course of a protracted period from October 2022 through to February 2025, and involved multiple incidents within the Southbank and neighbouring boroughs. Procedural History You were initially arrested on the 29th of February, 2025, as part of an intensive investigation conducted by the Southbank Metropolitan Police’s Acquisitive Crime Unit in collaboration with the Southbank Retail Safety Alliance. This alliance includes representatives from retail security teams, local licensing authorities, and the Crown Prosecution Service’s shop crime unit. The investigation was initiated following repeated reports from various retailers concerning suspicious activity and frequent losses allegedly linked to you, or a person matching your description. Interagency cooperation, while lauded in principle, often struggles in practice. The Local Business Crime Prevention Partnership, operating under the wider banner of the Southbank Business Safety Board, has endeavoured to coordinate real-time information-sharing among retail establishments, but such systems are no cure-all. The degree to which participating retailers actively engage varies widely, with some larger chains investing heavily in loss prevention measures and others, notably smaller independent shops, lacking the resources to do more than report incidents sporadically. This disparity has regrettably hampered consistent intelligence-led responses across the borough—and is a pattern endemic to many urban centres facing constrained operating budgets. Your case was listed for a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 21 March 2025 after you entered an initial not guilty plea. Discovery included a voluminous evidential bundle comprising CCTV footage, staff statements, and forensic reports. Subsequent developments, including further video evidence and a detailed GIS analysis of shoplifting hotspots within the borough, culminated in the acceptance of a guilty plea on 19 August 2025. This late plea conforms to a familiar, and, one must say, unfortunate trend in retail theft matters—where defendants exercise their procedural rights to test the prosecution’s case until evidentiary certainty renders resistance futile. The Court recognises the strain such delays place on judicial resources, retail victim-staff morale, and the wider community’s confidence in the criminal justice system. It must, however, be borne in mind that the availability of procedural protections is a cornerstone of due process, and that the ultimate duty of the Court is to ensure all decisions are informed by law and fact. The sentencing regime accordingly must balance the interests of justice and the legitimate mitigation that a plea of guilt may bring, mindful of public policy concerns as reflected in the relevant guidelines and case law. The saga of this case is further complicated by regrettable delays in the processing of legal aid applications. Your solicitors made an early application in March 2025 for the funding to instruct a forensic psychologist experienced in behavioural assessments of repeat acquisitive offenders. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted review process stretched over three months, during which time assessments and case preparation were necessarily dormant. Such systemic inefficiencies are well-documented in reports by the Criminal Bar Association and the Sentencing Council, with the resulting bottlenecks exerting adverse impacts on case timeliness, professional morale, and ultimately, the delivery of justice to defendants and victims alike. Surrounding this delay was an unfortunate coincidence of court scheduling pressures, exacerbated by industrial action within court support services, resulting in the adjournment of several key procedural hearings. The Southbank Crown Court is currently managing a significant backlog of cases. While the involving parties have shown commendable diligence in meeting deadlines when permitted, the interconnectedness of administrative challenges cannot be overlooked. These procedural delays amplify the burden on all participants and underscore the increasing complexity and fragility of contemporary case management frameworks. Strategic defence submissions emphasised your history of traumatic childhood experiences, including episodes of neglect and instability within the foster care system. These factors, while undoubtedly shaping your life-course, do not exempt you from accountability but are relevant to individualised sentencing, as recognised in R v. Sinclair [2023] EWCA Crim 1453, where the Court reaffirmed the importance of weighted mitigation reflecting personal history without diminishing culpability. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. The Court is cognisant that the Public Health England’s 2024 report on the accessibility of mental health services cited significant gaps in community provision within the Southbank area, especially for adults aged 25 to 40, exacerbated by staff attrition and rising demand. This context is pertinent, as defence medical submissions suggest that your behaviour may be influenced by untreated anxiety and intermittent substance use disorder. Consultation with Dr Harriet O’Connell, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, included a review of your case, resulting in a detailed report appended to the pre-sentence documentation. Dr O’Connell’s report describes you as presenting with symptoms indicative of moderate chronic anxiety disorder, compounded by periods of alcohol misuse, though without psychotic features or significant cognitive impairment. The report recommends structured engagement with community mental health teams but expresses reservations about the likelihood of sustained compliance, given your historical patterns of non-engagement. The probation officer’s assessment likewise reflects concerns regarding impulsivity and financial instability as persistent criminogenic factors. This case unfolds against the backdrop of increasingly precarious housing markets. Your current residence is temporary, arranged through the Southbank Homelessness Prevention Service following an eviction prompted by rental arrears. The Service’s annual report highlights the systemic challenges facing families in housing need, notably rising waiting lists and the toll on social services. Your own interactions with the housing authority have been intermittent and at times fractious, complicating consistent support delivery. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. The multi-agency approach to retail crime, incorporating the Business Crime Reduction Partnership’s data-sharing protocol, has proven patchy. The partnership’s semi-annual audit in 2024 acknowledged persistent gaps in information flow, especially concerning smaller retailers who lack formal loss-prevention staff. Nonetheless, for the present case, store managers from two medium-sized retail chains provided detailed victim impact statements expressing significant disruption and staff anxiety resulting from your actions. Of note, one victim impact statement from the manager of a local pharmacy records alterations to staff rotas and refusals to permit lone working during early morning shifts—a measure taken explicitly on account of fear arising from your repeated visits. This intangible harm reflects the broader psycho-social effects of your offending beyond mere financial loss. The Court further acknowledges a written submission dated 12 August 2025 from the Southbank Retail Worker’s Support Network, a charitable organisation offering frontline assistance to employees affected by workplace crime and intimidation. Their commentary notes a national rise in workplace-related stress linked to acquisitive offending and advocates for greater resource allocation to victim support schemes. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. In considering the sentencing framework applicable in this case, the Court is guided principally by the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2020, amended 2023). The Guideline obliges sentencing courts to evaluate the culpability of the offender, the harm caused (both economic and personal), and any aggravating or mitigating factors. Relevant aggravating factors here include the repeated and persistent nature of the offending, the targeting of vulnerable premises, the impact on staff wellbeing, and the failure to desist despite prior warnings and community disposals. Mitigation includes your plea of guilty, albeit late and following inevitable evidential pressure, your personal difficulties and unstable housing status, and the absence of any prior violent offending. I have noted with interest the jurisprudence extrapolated from cases such as R v. McTavish [2022] EWCA Crim 1785, where it was emphasised that whilst pleas of guilty attract a discretionary discount, the timing and sincerity of such pleas are pivotal. Late pleas, delivered only when the weight of evidence can no longer be challenged, typically warrant more modest reduction. Mr McTavish’s case, which involved sustained repeated shoplifting offences across multiple stores, was considered instructive during these proceedings. Similarly, the principle articulated in R v. Carney [2019] EWCA Crim 2021, concerning the cumulative harm arising from ongoing theft offences, bears relevance. In that case, the Court recognised that even low-value thefts, when part of an orchestrated pattern, produce disproportionate communal impact, meriting a proportionate custodial response. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. The evidence illustrates that on various occasions you employed a range of concealment tactics, ranging from the use of layered clothing to apparent distraction methods targeting staff attention. This calculated behaviour not only demonstrates heightened culpability but reinforces the premise that the offending was neither opportunistic nor impulsive, but carefully directed. The Crown correctly submits that such conduct erodes the sense of safety and trust within retail environments, fostering a climate in which workers must remain perpetually vigilant, with attendant psychological costs. This Court accepts those submissions. The fact that no physical threats or violence occurred does not diminish the seriousness of this impact. In parallel, records from the Southbank Social Services Department, included in documentary evidence, describe your prior engagement with youth outreach programmes and early interventions attempted during your teenage years. While not directly related to the instant offending, they provide useful background concerning your developmental history and social milieu. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. The Court has reviewed the probation officer’s comprehensive pre-sentence report dated 31 August 2025. The report highlights a complex profile, including histories of educational underachievement, interrupted employment, and multiple instances of non-compliance with community sentences for similar offences. It further indicates missed appointments with support programmes designed to reduce recidivism and improve life skills. The report recommends consideration of a community order incorporating requirements tailored to address offending behaviour, mental health engagement, and potentially unpaid work. Given your housing status, the report also flags the need for liaison with local housing support services to mitigate immediate risk factors. It must be stated, without hesitation, that short custodial sentences for offences of this nature have a limited rehabilitative effect and impose substantial costs on the wider community. Indeed, sentencing decisions are increasingly influenced by the imperative to deploy alternatives to custody where safely possible. However, this must be balanced against the clear societal expectation that repeat offending, with demonstrable harm, is met with an appropriately robust deterrent—both to the individual and the public at large. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. Parallel to case management, the Court notes the voluntary sector contributions to the sentencing process. Letters received from the Southbank Community Outreach Project, a non-governmental organisation providing support to vulnerable adults, commend your belated engagement with their counselling services, while cautioning that progress remains fragile. Such inputs are invaluable, speaking not only to your capacity for change but also to the resources that must be marshalled effectively to support sustainable desistance. While commendations exist for these small steps, they do not yet ameliorate the seriousness of the offences and their repeated nature. The Court similarly notes, with regret, the prolonged waiting times currently experienced in accessing services through the Southbank Addiction Recovery Unit. The waiting lists for triage appointments often exceed six months, a factor outside your control but illustrating the resource constraints facing public health. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. I must also refer to the legislative context. The Theft Act 1968 has remained the keystone statute concerning property offences for over half a century, yet society’s understanding of acquisitive crime and its drivers has evolved markedly in that time. Parliamentary debates in 2023 on amendments to sentencing provisions sought to reflect this evolution, acknowledging the complex nexus of mental health, socio-economic factors, and community impact. Notwithstanding these changes, the core principle remains clear: theft is a breach of trust and an affront to the communal fabric. In this vein, R v. Faraday [2024] EWCA Crim 1238 reaffirmed the Court of Appeal’s stance that the criminal justice system must calibrate responses to theft carefully, applying custodial sentences sparingly where possible, but decisively where repeat offending with material harm is evident. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. Further to the specific matter of your case, the Court must register its concern that, despite previous interventions, including warnings and non-custodial disposals, offending continued unabated. This pattern diminishes the mitigating weight that might otherwise be accorded to factors such as social disadvantage or mental health difficulties. That said, the Court remains mindful that protection of the public includes not merely retribution and deterrence, but the encouragement of rehabilitation and reintegration. The delicate balance between these imperatives will be central to the forthcoming sentencing determination. It is necessary, in conclusion, to place on record the Court’s appreciation for the professional conduct displayed by all parties throughout these proceedings. Ms Lucy Grant, leading counsel for the Crown, presented the prosecution case with clarity and measured restraint. Mr Daniel Elms, representing the defence, provided diligent and conscientious advocacy despite the well-known pressures imposed by legal aid resourcing constraints. The seamless order maintained by the court staff, combined with the dignified bearing of all those in attendance, reflects the enduring commitment of the judiciary and supporting personnel to the administration of justice under challenging conditions. Sentencing will be adjourned pending receipt of an updated pre-sentence report incorporating any further medical or psychiatric evaluations and submissions from probation. The court requests that the Probation Service consider recommendations relating to potential community rehabilitation requirements, unpaid work, mental health support, and housing liaison. These sentencing remarks are issued on this 14th day of September 2025 in Court 5 at Southbank Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. Mr H is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions in force pursuant to section 49 Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SHEFFIELD R v. MR H Case No. S2025/13426 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. G. DALRYMPLE Filed: 23 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction for an offence under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely shoplifting from several retail establishments over a period spanning late 2023 through to early 2025 within and around the Sheffield metropolitan borough. The offence was tried here following your guilty plea entered at the close of the Crown’s case. Procedural Overview Your initial appearance occurred on 12 March 2025 at the Sheffield Magistrates’ Court, where the charge was first laid. The case rapidly moved to this Crown Court venue pursuant to the Crown Court allocation scheme, the matter having been identified as requiring detailed consideration of prior offending and complex evidential material. A plea and trial preparation hearing was scheduled for 14 May 2025 before the Honorable Recorder W. Bridges. At that hearing, no application was made by the defence to change the plea, and a trial date was set. However, on 2 July 2025, you entered a guilty plea following the service of additional prosecutorial evidence including digital forensics, CCTV footage, and witness statements. The late plea occasioned discussion as to appropriate reduction in sentencing credit. The administrative flow of this case, although punctuated with significant engagement from the parties, was affected by several adjournments. These included a three-week delay due to Local Government strike action impacting court staffing levels and the reluctance of the Legal Aid Agency to swiftly authorise funding for a psychiatric assessment requested by your counsel. These procedural intricacies are illustrative of systemic pressures currently confronting the administration of criminal justice. While such systemic concerns are extrinsic to your individual case, they provide context to the protracted nature of proceedings at a time when the courts face unprecedented demand coupled with resource limitations. A noteworthy feature within the broader landscape is the operation of the Sheffield Business Crime Forum, an umbrella initiative comprising police, local council officers, retailers, and community groups aiming to coordinate responses to neighbourhood crime. While the Forum’s efficacy is occasionally hindered by staff fluctuations and competing priorities, it was substantially engaged in collating intelligence relevant to your offending pattern. The Forum’s Crime Reduction Officer contributed to the prosecution’s investigative approach, facilitating the gathering of surveillance evidence and witness liaison. Their activity was documented in correspondence submitted with the prosecution’s trial bundle dated 15 August 2025. The court is mindful of the enduring challenges faced by police officers assigned to city centre patrols, where persistent acquisitive offending imposes a disproportionate administrative and operational heaviness. As noted in the recent internal report by South Yorkshire Police’s Operational Command Unit, front-line officers frequently balance emerging violent crime and the complexities of licensed premises compliance alongside addressing the seemingly never-ending tide of shop theft incidents. This case exemplifies the resource-intensive efforts expended on what some might term “low-level” criminality but which, cumulatively, exacts a heavy toll on both public confidence and retail viability. Mr H, during the course of these proceedings, your legal representation has been consistently provided by Mr Michael Gowers of Sheffield Legal Aid Services. I acknowledge and thank Mr Gowers for his thorough submissions and professional conduct. Likewise, the Crown has been ably represented by Ms Emma Lupin, whose clarity and precision in outlining the evidential merits and public interest considerations have been duly noted. Turning to a more general observation concerning the Legal Aid Agency, it is unable to escape the court’s notice that the procedural delays in approving expert instructions in this matter were regrettably emblematic of a wider trend. Such delays place undue strain on defence counsel, hamper timely justice, and in effect, may compromise effective advocacy. It is hoped that ongoing reforms within the Legal Aid system will address these deficiencies, preserving the fundamental principle of fair trial. The facts of this case, as presented before the court at trial, arise from a pattern of conduct involving the systematic removal of goods from retail premises over approximately seventeen months. Through the collation of CCTV footage from multiple stores, witness accounts, and forensic analysis of discarded packaging and clothing, a consistent modus operandi emerged. As the Crown outlined in opening, your actions were not singular or spontaneous acts but rather formed a deliberate and sustained course of conduct. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. Each theft, while individually of modest financial value, when viewed cumulatively, reflects persistent intent to deprive the owner of goods. This court has frequently remarked on the fallacy of equating low monetary value with triviality. The cumulative loss borne by retailers, along with the intrusion on staff and disruption to customer experience, constitutes a significant public harm. The Retail Theft Sentencing Guidelines, paragraph 3.5, expressly caution courts against treating repeated low-level shoplifting as inconsequential. Indeed, the discharged obligation imposed by the Theft Act not only protects tangible property rights but safeguards the integrity of community commerce and the dignity of workers subjected to the stress of victimisation. It warrants mention that investigations were spearheaded by Detective Inspector Lucy Fairbanks of the South Yorkshire Acquisitive Crime Unit, whose team carried out an evidence-gathering operation that incorporated covert observation, deployment of technological assets, including transport metadata, and liaison with Business Crime Reduction Officers. The sophisticated nature of this investigative response underscores the seriousness with which such offences attract official attention. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. It is significant that on multiple occasions you were identified leaving premises with goods concealed yet lacking payment, frequently exploiting busy periods and staff distraction. This indicates a premeditation inconsistent with unwitting or impulsive action. Procedural complexity arises when considering the extended surveillance undertaken, which involved coordination between local transport authorities’ CCTV control rooms and private security firms employed by the retailers. The collation of this digital evidence, while voluminous, established a compelling nexus to your person and supported the charge beyond reasonable doubt. The court takes judicial notice of the ongoing debate regarding better utilisation of technology to combat retail crime, as articulated in the Home Office report “Digital Policing and Retail Crime 2024,” but also affirms the necessity of balancing privacy rights and evidential sufficiency. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. It is also noted that your choice of target goods commonly included high-demand personal care products and over-the-counter medications—items often vulnerable to resale on informal markets. The impact of this is twofold: losses to business and contribution to black market activity that may fuel wider societal harms. Equally troubling are the consequences for those employed in the affected premises. Staff have reported increased anxiety, reduced workplace morale, and the need to undertake additional security responsibilities without commensurate support. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. Turning to the documented victim impact, the court has had the benefit of statements from several store managers and employees who spoke of the toll your repeated offending took. One manager notably remarked that persistent theft led to increased security costs, forced adjustments in staff rotas, and sadly, contributed to a decision to reduce opening hours. This, in turn, diminishes community access to vital goods and fuels a sense of insecurity in neighbourhoods. The Retail Support Network, a voluntary sector body engaged by several affected shopkeepers, provided a report to the court setting out the broader consequences of recurring shoplifting. While their role is ancillary, the insight they bring paints a picture of a sector under pressure, grappling with financial uncertainty and workforce retention difficulties. The distress experienced by victims as recorded in these statements must be given weight. While the offences did not involve threats or violence, the psychological impact of repeated dishonesty and intrusion into workplace safety is often underestimated. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. Development of the case and prosecution strategy was, in part, modelled on the recommendations set forth in Williams and O’Connor (2019) concerning the use of intelligence-led policing and offender management to effectively tackle repeat retail offending. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. The court also notes that your offending persisted despite prior warnings and an out-of-court disposal issued in late 2023 by the Sheffield Community Resolution Group. This prior intervention was unsuccessful in deterring you. The failure of such community-based measures to stem your conduct signals a need for more robust judicial response. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, claimed it wasn’t a serious crime and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. A psychiatric assessment was commissioned following your counsel’s application, a report having been prepared by Dr S. Raman, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, and lodged with the court on 8 September 2025. Dr Raman concluded that, whilst you do not suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder that would disrupt criminal responsibility, there are traits of heightened impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and a mild but untreated substance use issue, notably alcohol misuse. Dr Raman also noted your lack of engagement with available support services and expressed concerns about your limited insight into the consequences of your offending. The Pre-Sentence Report, compiled by Probation Officer Ms Angela McPherson on 18 September 2025, echoes these findings. She highlights your unstable housing situation and lack of meaningful employment. While acknowledging some steps you have made towards recovery and stabilisation, the report urges structured supervision and consideration of rehabilitative programmes targeting acquisitive offending and impulsivity. The strain on Probation Services nationally is well recognised. Notably, Sheffield Probation Trust currently operates with 15% fewer officers than last year, and waiting times for community programme commencement have increased. Despite this, Ms McPherson reports readiness within local provision to accommodate your case, subject to sentencing direction. The offence falls squarely within the Sentencing Council guideline on Theft, dated July 2022, which emphasises that persistent offending and targeting vulnerable or small independent premises can constitute aggravating factors. It is appropriate to remind that in R v. Sterling [2023] EWCA Crim 387, a defendant with a comparable offending pattern was subject to an immediate custodial sentence owing to recidivism and failure to engage with diversion schemes. The Court of Appeal there underscored the principle that community tolerance towards repeat property crime has limits, particularly where the deterrent effect of earlier sanctions has failed. Reference is also made to R v. Honeywell [2024] EWCA Crim 221, in which a custodial sentence was imposed on a young offender involved in a series of shop thefts that significantly disturbed local commercial stability despite low individual values. Of note is the Court’s consideration of R v. Davidson [2021] EWCA Crim 1149, where the Court observed that delayed guilty pleas, especially those entered only at trial, should attract reduced reductions in sentence credit. The principle that an early plea reflects genuine remorse and saves court time is well established and applies here. Historical context to theft law may be found in the foundational cases dating back to the Theft Act 1968’s enactment, including the seminal authority R v. Ghosh [1982] QB 1053, though its test for dishonesty has since been modified by Ivey v Genting Casinos (2017) UKSC 67, which set the prevailing legal standard. It is thus noted that your course of conduct offends against these legal parameters both in theory and practice. The Sheffield Crown Court itself has undergone a refurbishment project earlier this year, modernising the main courtroom where your trial was heard. This upgrade included state-of-the-art audio-visual systems and improved accessibility, designed to facilitate the orderly and fair conduct of proceedings. It is regrettable that, on the day of your plea, there was a brief delay of 20 minutes caused by the late arrival of an interpreter assigned for an unrelated matter listed later on the afternoon roster. Whilst not directly impacting these proceedings, such occurrences are symptomatic of wider workforce shortages in court services. The court is made cognisant of the fact that this case attracted minimal press or public interest, a phenomenon noted in several recent local proceedings. In an age where media focus often gravitates toward high-profile or violent offences, the slow attritional harm caused by repeated petty crime receives scant attention despite its enduring community impact. Mr H, I am also obliged to mention that your sister, Ms Bernadine Williams, provided a character reference pleading for leniency, indicating that you have familial support which may be pivotal in your rehabilitation. The report from the Westborough Community Food Bank likewise testifies to your occasional engagement with social services aimed at assisting those with unstable income and housing. In the final assessment, the court must balance the seriousness of the offence, the cumulative impact on victims, your personal circumstances, and the wider public interest in deterrence and rehabilitation. You have, regrettably, demonstrated a pattern of deliberate offending over a lengthy period, accompanied by a degree of resistance to prior attempts at diversion. Your late plea, entered only after significant evidence was amassed, attracts a modest reduction in sentencing credit. The aggravating factors of persistence and the ripple effect on vulnerable small businesses and employees weigh heavily. Nevertheless, your engagement with some community supports and the psychiatric observations suggesting potential for intervention counsel consideration of a structured community sentence. I shall therefore order the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, incorporating an assessment of the feasibility and appropriateness of sentence options ranging from a community order with relevant rehabilitation requirements to custodial disposals where justified. The report should particularly address suitable cognitive behavioural programmes aimed at offending behaviour, any necessary addiction treatment pathways, and risk management considerations. I express my gratitude to all who have contributed to the material before me, including prosecution and defence counsel, police investigators, probation, and voluntary sector contributors. These sentencing remarks are issued today, 23 September 2025, in Court 5 of the Sheffield Crown Court. The record of proceedings has been duly transcribed and entered under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days, pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINDSOR R v. MR H Case No. W2025/08321 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. Kensington Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence in respect of a charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely a course of conduct involving the theft of goods from multiple retail premises over a significant period. This court has been presented with a detailed but complex bundle of evidence, reflecting extended investigative efforts and broad cooperation amongst several agencies. It is essential at the outset to emphasise that while the offences concern relatively low-value items, the cumulative impact and repetition of this conduct attract serious judicial consideration. Such offending can have disruptive economic and social consequences well beyond the immediate loss or displacement of goods. Procedural History The matters leading to the charge relate to incidents spanning from early 2023 through to March 2025. Arrest followed an investigation culminating on 12 March 2025, subsequent to intelligence-led work conducted by the Windsor Borough Police and the Thames Valley Retail Crime Partnership. I note that this case was allocated to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, an initiative designed to reduce avoidable delays and promote early identification of contested issues. The case management timetable was generally observed, though the court is mindful of some unavoidable adjournments necessitated by ongoing expert assessments and late disclosure applications. These are, regrettably, not uncommon in cases requiring multi-agency liaison and forensic expertise. Such delays, while frustrating to all involved, are the consequence of the procedural safeguards necessary in complex matters; the court appreciates the efforts of all parties to minimise disruption. The investigative phase benefitted from the use of advanced analytic techniques, including cross-referencing incident reports with anonymised mobile data and retail point-of-sale discrepancy logs. This methodological richness enabled a more comprehensive case to be presented. Such an approach, though resource intensive, exemplifies modern policing’s move toward data-driven enforcement aimed at disrupting persistent offending patterns before they further entrench. This case draws attention, again, to the pressing challenge faced by retail premises, particularly smaller independent traders, whose limited resilience to theft-related loss strains increasingly fragile business models. Applications under Legal Aid funding arrangements to instruct an independent psychiatric expert and a forensic accountant to consider the financial impact of offending were submitted by the defence in good time but unfortunately experienced protracted administrative processing. The Legal Aid Agency’s delays in granting authority to instruct these experts resulted in the hearing scheduled for 20 August being vacated and the matter relisted for today’s sentencing hearing. Such delays, while understandable given the thoroughness desired in oversight, risk impeding the timely delivery of justice. This court would echo wider judicial calls for reform of these procedures to prevent unnecessary bottlenecks. Both prosecuting and defence counsel have conducted themselves professionally throughout, and I record my thanks to Mr Simon Haynes appearing on behalf of the Crown and to Ms Felicity Warner representing the defendant under a legal aid order. The court also thanks the court clerk and ushers, who have facilitated the smooth running of proceedings notwithstanding the pressure on court listings nationally. Within the wider context, Windsor Crown Court serves a diverse and densely populated area, marked by a mixed socio-economic profile and a retail sector that includes both large commercial chains and smaller niche shops. Recent years have seen an increase in reports of acquisitive crime, a pattern reflected nationally. This underscores the relevance of the sentencing processes here in delivering outcomes that balance the interests of justice, the needs of victims, and the statutory aims of rehabilitation and public protection. The court is also cognisant of wider concerns about rising street homelessness and social vulnerability in the local area. The issue has been the subject of recent public health and law enforcement briefings, drawing attention to the interrelationship between social exclusion, mental health needs, and offending behaviour. Though the court does not intend to conflate these broader social challenges with individual culpability, the context in which offending occurs may have bearing upon sentencing considerations. The case law which guides sentencing in offences of theft is well-established, with the starting point legislated and refined through successive Court of Appeal decisions. Of note, R v. Firmin [2022] EWCA Crim 1557 affirms the importance of proportionality and the recognition that, while low-value offences may attract custodial sentences in some contexts, the nature and impact of the offending remain paramount. Similarly, in R v. Duval [2019] EWCA Crim 334, the Court endorsed tailored community approaches where rehabilitation prospects are tangible and the public risk manageable. These authorities frame the legal compass within which this court operates. Attention is drawn to the sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council, updated as recently as 2024, which give direction on theft offences. The guidelines categorise offending per its seriousness, considering factors such as the value of goods, planning and sophistication, offending frequency, and impact upon victims. Particularly relevant here is the emphasis placed on the cumulative nature of offences and the acknowledgement of the psychological distress caused to retail staff, especially when persistent offending disrupts normal business activities and staff wellbeing. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and subsequent amendments, alongside the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, frame aspects of sentencing discretion and the deployment of community-based sanctions. The court notes that Mr H is in receipt of state benefits due to financial hardship but is reported to have had several opportunities to engage with support services relevant to his circumstances, with varying degrees of compliance. The court also received detailed victim impact statements from several local retailers, documenting the operational challenges posed by repeat shoplifting. One such statement, submitted by the manager of a chemist on High Street, described the efforts to install additional CCTV and store layout changes designed to deter thefts, as well as increased employee stress levels and turnover. These submissions, collectively, illustrate that even offences of modest individual value can carry wider consequences. They serve as a sober reminder that offences of this nature are not victimless. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. It is pertinent to observe that the court heard from a senior officer of the Windsor Business Crime Reduction Partnership, who provided an outline of joint efforts to address retail crime in the borough. He described the ongoing challenges faced in the face of limited staffing levels exacerbated by recent recruitment difficulties across the constabulary. The chronic understaffing of frontline teams inevitably constrains the immediacy and scope of response to acquisitive offence reports, as resources must also be stretched across other priorities including violent crime, road safety, and counter-terrorism. The officer’s testimony underscores the system-wide pressures that cases such as this impose. It was also brought to the court’s attention that the defendant is currently under the supervision of the Probation Service following a prior community order for theft-related offences. The Probation Officer’s report, considered in advance of this hearing, notes an inconsistent engagement pattern and highlights concerns regarding financial management and social isolation. The report reflects an up-to-date risk assessment placing Mr H within a medium risk of harm tier, with the potential for reoffending remaining a substantive concern. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. It is worth noting that this court has, in other cases, wrestled extensively with the challenge of appropriate credit for guilty pleas entered late in the proceedings. While the law rightly encourages defendants to admit guilt at the earliest opportunity, the courts cannot treat belated pleas afforded solely by the weight of overwhelming evidence as evidence of genuine remorse. The legal framework as explained in R v. Stamford [2018] EWCA Crim 1340 provides ample guidance on the degrees of credit available dependent on plea timing and circumstances. In the present case, Mr H entered his plea shortly before the trial window, limiting the discount to which he may properly be entitled. A detailed psychiatric report was obtained from Dr Fiona Rickwood, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose evaluation was exhaustive and professionally conducted. Her conclusions indicate that while no major mental illness is present, there is evidence of mild depressive symptoms, manifesting as low mood and reduced motivation. Dr Rickwood noted tendencies toward impulsivity and emotional instability but stopped short of diagnosing a formal personality disorder. She further emphasised that appropriate psychological support services are available locally, but uptake has been minimal. Dr Rickwood recommended engagement with cognitive-behavioural therapy tailored to addressing impulsivity and decision-making deficits, as well as social support interventions targeting isolation. The report also outlined the pressures on mental health services regionally, with waiting times for psychological therapies extending beyond average targets nationally. This reflects a marked increase in service demand post-pandemic, coupled with workforce shortages noted in the NHS workforce census 2025. The court commends the efforts of clinicians and coordinators striving to maintain care standards amid these constraints. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. It must be emphasised that the law does not personalise systemic shortcomings, but neither can those realities be ignored when considering rehabilitation pathways. It is therefore incumbent on the probation and social services to ensure access to suitable supports, bearing in mind the practical difficulties posed by capacity limitations. In reviewing previous relevant case law, the court recalls R v. Sinclair [2020] EWCA Crim 1429, which concerned a defendant convicted of burglary and repeat thefts targeting vulnerable small shops. The Court of Appeal endorsed a custodial sentence where members of the public had been left \"intimidated and fearful,\" and where the defendant's engagement with rehabilitation programmes had been minimal. In contrast, R v. Metcalfe [2021] dealt with a defendant with schizophrenia involved in an arson offence; that case reinforced the delicate balancing act required in considering sentenced infractions committed in the context of serious mental illness, promoting a therapeutic custodial approach. Neither set of circumstances mirrors Mr H’s exactly, but both inform the wider jurisprudential context. I also note the precedential judgments concerning the reduction of credit for guilty pleas. The principle set out in R v. Danvers [2017] EWCA Crim 2920 is salient here: the earlier the plea, the more credit afforded, reflecting not just procedural saving but an indication of insight and remorse. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. This case typifies the strain inflicted on front-line retail workers, who are too frequently overlooked as victims of crimes that, while lacking overt violence, inflict significant psychological and practical harm. The court takes due account of the testimony from store employees, noting increased anxiety and diminished feelings of safety, which align with observations from the British Retail Consortium’s 2024 Crime Survey report. The psychological impact of repeated theft on staff wellbeing must be recognised as part of the harm continuum. The court must consider the defendant’s personal circumstances, well documented in the probation pre-sentence report and medical assessments. Mr H is aged 29, currently unemployed, and residing in temporary accommodation provided by the local council. There is a history of unresolved housing instability coupled with sporadic engagement with welfare support services. His family situation is described as fractured, with limited contact. A letter submitted by a local charity supporting individuals with complex needs in Windsor was also tendered. The letter endorsed the defendant’s previous engagement with programmes addressing substance misuse and mental health but noted recent disengagement. The charity expressed willingness to renew support post-sentence if appropriate. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. The home environment within which a defendant lives can be a material factor in both offending and rehabilitation prospects. This court acknowledges the recurring themes of poverty, hardship, and exclusion that populate much of the casework before us. And yet, courts must remain vigilant against conflating context with excuse. As observed in R v. Langridge [2019] EWCA Crim 1047, personal adversity, while significant in mitigation, cannot eclipse responsibility for choices made. Among the procedural observations pertinent to this hearing are some minor irregularities in administrative record-keeping, including discrepancies in date stamps on custody logs and minor inconsistencies in witness statement annotations. These have been examined and found not to rise to the level affecting the substantive case or the fairness of proceedings. Such details, while important to due process, serve ultimately as reminders of the human fallibility inherent in any system. The court also wishes to note the absence of the media at this hearing, despite being an open court. This accords with a broader trend observed nationally where low-level acquisitive offences seldom attract journalistic attention unless coupled with violence or sensational elements. This is an ironic commentary on the public appetite for visibility, which is selective and often neglects the quiet harm done by repeated unlawful conduct such as this. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. The defendant’s record includes previous offences recorded over the last five years, primarily for similar thefts. Notably, in 2022, Mr H was dealt with under a conditional caution following a shoplifting incident involving confectionary and toiletries. A community resolution was additionally offered in 2021 for an unrelated instance of attempted retail theft. The recidivism here is not merely quantitative but concerns failure to desist despite multiple formal interventions. That pattern weighs heavily in the sentencing calculus. It is regrettable but true that the volume of return offenders places additional strain on police and probation resources. The Probation Service in this jurisdiction has reported increasing caseloads, a problem exacerbated by challenges in recruitment and retention. The consequence has been a reliance on prioritisation protocols which, while necessary, may limit the intensity of supervision available in some cases. The court also received correspondence from the managing director of a local retail cooperative, describing the impact of persistent low-level theft on stock shrinkage rates and staff morale. Their brief but sincere communication underscores the business reality behind the otherwise dry legal proceedings. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. The court has reflected upon recent changes to the Sentencing Council’s guidelines concerning theft offences, particularly the enhanced emphasis on the offender’s antecedents and the degree of planning or sophistication demonstrated. In this context, while Mr H has no history of violent conduct, the repeated and targeted nature of offences suggests a particular degree of deliberation and knowledge of vulnerable premises. The considerations of personal mitigation for cases of mental health difficulties were reinforced in R v. Harper [2023] EWCA Crim 733, which held that the existence of psychological difficulties should be carefully weighed against the nature and impact of offending behaviour. The sentencing court was reminded that such factors alone do not warrant wholesale mitigation where offending causes real harm and where risks to reoffending remain significant. I have had regard to all these principles in reaching my provisional conclusions today. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. The cumulative impact of repeated thefts on the community’s sense of security and business viability cannot be overstated. The prospect of deterrence—both specific and general—must be given appropriate weight, alongside considerations of rehabilitation and proportionality. The final pre-sentence report will explore in depth whether community sanctions augmented by accredited offending behaviour programmes might be viable, particularly interventions addressing impulsivity, financial management, and social integration. The possibility of unpaid work as a component of such a disposal will also be considered. It must be underscored that the court remains open to any proposals that aim to reduce reoffending and assist reintegration without compromising public protection. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Windsor Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal sentence date has been set pending receipt of updated pre-sentence and psychiatric reports. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal sentencing within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are in place. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER R v. MR H Case No. T2025/14537 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. Carmichael Filed: 16 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence in relation to charges brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically shoplifting offences spanning the latter months of 2023 and continuing through to early 2025. These offences were committed across various retail establishments situated within Greater Manchester’s commercial districts, including areas of Salford and Stockport. The charges represent a pattern of sustained and calculated acquisitive offending, for which the Crown seeks a custodial or community sentence commensurate with the gravity of your conduct. Procedural Background You were initially arrested on 9 March 2025 following an investigation by the Greater Manchester Police Retail Crime Unit, which had been conducting a multi-agency operation targeting repeat offenders within the region's commercial corridors. This investigation was notable for its breadth and complexity, involving collaborative efforts between local policing teams, loss prevention personnel, and community safety partnerships. The case file, now exceeding 400 pages, includes digitally recorded witness statements, recovered CCTV footage, and forensic analyses linking you to multiple incidents. I note with approval that, unlike many matters involving low-value theft, this case progressed within reasonable timeframes, at least according to the schedule expected under the Criminal Procedure Rules and Better Case Management (BCM) protocols. The cooperation demonstrated by counsel for the Crown and the defence in adhering to listing dates contributed significantly to this efficient progression. The case was listed for plea and trial preparation hearing on 23 May 2025, following initial disclosure and after lengthy consideration of submitted evidentiary material. It is worth observation that the BCM model, as introduced in recent years and refined in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, aims to ensure that cases such as this, which might otherwise be subject to delay and fragmentation, proceed with a greater measure of clarity and expedition. Such reforms also serve to alleviate the administrative burden which routinely impairs the functioning of the criminal courts in matters of this nature. In the present instance, the progress from charge to plea (albeit late) occurred within the anticipated framework. The initial plea was not guilty, and a contested trial was scheduled for 15 July 2025. However, on the eve of that trial, a late guilty plea was entered, necessitating the rescheduling of sentencing. The court has reflected upon the significance of such late pleas, mindful both of established authorities and of the impacts on court resources and victim interests. The jurisprudence establishes, with clarity, that the timing of a plea materially affects the extent of any permitted credit. It is no entitlement, but a privilege that may be withheld or limited. A plea that comes under duress or only when the weight of evidence is overwhelming provides markedly less mitigation. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. The role of multi-agency collaboration in cases akin to the present can scarcely be overstated. The Greater Manchester Retail Crime Partnership, a coalition of law enforcement agencies, public sector bodies, and representative retail groups, has made commendable progress in coordinating responses to such persistent offending patterns. Their intelligence-led approach, emphasizing real-time information sharing, data analytics, and operational liaison, seeks to anticipate offending behaviour and disrupt it before escalation. It is notable, however, that despite these advances, the pressure on frontline police officers tasked with such investigations remains substantial, particularly given competing demands in areas marked by elevated gang activity and violent crime. This allocation of resources underscores the broader societal impact of shoplifting, which, though often minimised, thereby carries consequences extending beyond the immediate financial loss. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. It is vital to place this case within the prevailing jurisprudential landscape. Authorities such as R v. Ellis [2019] EWCA Crim 345 and R v. Abasi [2022] EWCA Crim 573 have solidified the principle that repeated acquisitive offending, including shoplifting, warrants a response calibrated to both public protection and offender rehabilitation. Ellis underscores the aggravation occasioned by persistence and evidence of planning, while Abasi highlights the importance of considering the cumulative psychological impact on those victimised, including store employees often overlooked in earlier sentencing frameworks. Such authorities guide this court’s approach today, informing not only sentencing severity but also the conditions which may accompany any community disposal. I acknowledge that the case arose contemporaneously with considerable systemic strain on local justice services. The Crown’s diligent representatives, led by Ms Miranda Cartwright, prosecuted with evident thoroughness despite significant administrative hurdles and ongoing Legal Aid Agency delays. Conversely, the defence, led by Mr Paul Johnson, sought authorisations for psychiatric and forensic expert assessments, essential given emerging concerns about the defendant's vulnerability and mental health status. The protracted approval process for such funding underscores once again the limitations of the current legal aid regime. As this court has previously remarked, delays down this route regularly obstruct the timely administration of justice, disproportionately impacting defendants who either lack personal means or depend on complex inter-agency coordination. This regrettable pattern continues despite reform initiatives. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. The court has also received and carefully considered numerous written representations from local community groups, including the Manchester Business Coalition Against Crime (MBCAC) and the South Manchester Voluntary Support Network (SMVSN). These bodies articulate the broader community implications of acquisitive crime, highlighting the unseen ripple effects that extend into employee wellbeing, local business viability, and public confidence in safety. Particularly noteworthy were victim impact statements provided by several stores, including statements from managers and front-line retail assistants, reflecting anxiety and diminished morale occasioned by repeated shoplifting incidents. That these statements were gathered despite the chronic under-resourcing of victim liaison services merits recognition. Prior to today’s hearing, the court received an independent psychiatric report prepared by Dr Eleanor Stone, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at St. Mary’s Hospital. Dr Stone conducted an extensive clinical interview and reviewed available records. Her report, comprehensive and professionally presented, identified significant difficulties with impulse control and emotional regulation linked to a history of attachment disorder. Whilst the report does not diagnose any major psychotic or mood disorder, it emphasises the presence of maladaptive personality traits that likely influence offending behaviour. Dr Stone also recommends engagement with specialist cognitive behavioural therapy designed to address criminogenic thinking patterns as part of any rehabilitative framework. The report underscores that while these factors do not excuse criminal responsibility, they require recognition in sentencing both for fairness and effectiveness of intervention. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. It is important to remark that this case proceeded against a backdrop of increasing public concern regarding street-level acquisitive crime in Manchester, notably shoplifting and associated behaviours such as antisocial conduct. Council and Police initiatives, including Operation Retail Shield, have sought to reduce offending through a combination of enforcement, diversion, and offender management. Despite these efforts, offences of this nature persist, frequently complicated by underlying socioeconomic deprivation, substance misuse, and mental health challenges that defy simple remedy. Observers note a marked decline in the effectiveness of traditional deterrents, alongside a growing appreciation of the need for integrated, trauma-informed frameworks addressing underlying vulnerability, rather than solely focussing on punitive responses. Such complexity requires courts and other agencies to balance competing imperatives carefully. The court also notes with sadness the persistent challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency in timely funding decisions for expert reports or specialist interventions. The procedural history demonstrates multiple requests, clarifications, and supervisory reviews before resources were authorised for the instruction of appropriate clinical expertise. Such delays not only prolong proceedings but impede forensic insight critical to apt case resolution. It remains paramount that decision-makers within the legal aid framework recognise the value of expeditious approval, particularly in cases where underlying vulnerability may be significant. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. Cases bearing partial analogy to the present include R v. Daniels [2024] EWCA Crim 789, concerning possession of a bladed article in a school car park, and R v. Mitchell [2023] EWCA Crim 609, involving aggravated burglary with minor violence. While neither case relates directly to shoplifting, they illustrate the wider sentencing principles applicable to offenders presenting mixed risk profiles with potential for public harm. In Daniels, the Court of Appeal emphasised the necessity of assessing both the precipitating circumstances and subsequent engagement with rehabilitative services. Mitchell held that where risk behaviours are coupled with evidence of substance misuse and non-compliance with supervision, custodial sentences with extended licence conditions may be appropriate to ensure public protection. Neither case parallels your offending in gravity, but they highlight the principles governing judicial discretion. In giving these remarks, it would be remiss not to mention the enduring phenomena of “late pleas” and their consequences. Your decision to enter a guilty plea on the morning of the scheduled trial, after prolonged denial, is a regrettable but familiar pattern. As established in leading cases, including R v. Clarke [2023] EWCA Crim 412, credit for such pleas must be modest. The timing offers scant real benefit to victims, witnesses, or court efficiency. Whilst the law preserves the right to change plea at any stage, the court must balance that right against the public interest in timely, fair resolution. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. The facts, as proven by the Crown and accepted by you through your plea, describe theft taking place in multiple shops. Surveillance footage and witness accounts demonstrate your deliberate acts of concealment and evasion. Multiple incidents show a consistent modus operandi: approaching shelves bearing high-demand consumer goods, removing items surreptitiously, then exiting without payment. The court is informed that you frequently used techniques designed to distract staff, including feigned phone calls and obfuscation by clothing layers. Notably, though no assault or violence is present, the psychological effect upon store personnel is palpable. The victim impact statements describe a climate of insecurity, with some staff reporting stress-related symptoms and reduced confidence. This effect, while intangible, informs the court’s assessment of harm. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. The persistence of offending despite previous community-based disposals, including warnings and conditional cautions, aggravates the seriousness of your conduct. It signals an unwillingness or inability to desist without firm intervention. The probation service’s pre-sentence report, prepared by Officer Hannah Melrose, identifies medium likelihood of further offending without meaningful engagement in rehabilitative programmes. The report also notes your unstable housing situation and absence of meaningful employment, though these are contextual factors rather than direct mitigation. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. There remains, in this jurisdiction and beyond, a discernible tension regarding the response to acquisitive offending. The court is reminded of the social and economic upheaval occasioned by recent global events — the pandemic, inflationary pressures, and attendant rises in poverty have all contributed to elevated offending in certain strata. Yet, these factors do not grant licence to flout the law nor diminish the impact upon victims. Nor do they absolve the responsibility to engage proactively with available support. The probation service has been engaged throughout these proceedings, albeit constrained by significant caseload pressures and limited resources. The officer assigned, Ms Melrose, reports commendable efforts to involve you in services addressing financial management and substance use, but these overtures have, to date, failed to yield consistent participation. This dynamic is, regrettably, a familiar and persistent feature of cases involving repeat acquisitive offenders. Having weighed the multiple factors before me, including the seriousness of the offending, the impact on victims, the aggravating feature of persistence despite prior intervention, and your personal circumstances and vulnerabilities as identified in clinical assessment, I shall direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report. This report will assist the court in identifying the most appropriate sentencing framework—whether custodial or community-based—that balances punitive, rehabilitative, and protective aims. I note the provisions of the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline, particularly the guidelines concerning repeat offending and the presence of aggravating and mitigating factors. The guideline appropriately emphasizes the importance of addressing risks of harm and the accused’s capacity to engage with rehabilitative services. I also reiterate that a sentence imposing immediate custody may be warranted where offending demonstrates persistence and disregard for sanctions, but equally, the guidance recognises the value of community orders supplemented by tailored interventions where compliance can be reasonably expected. The forthcoming pre-sentence report will be invaluable in guiding this determination. The court acknowledges the contributions of all those involved in this matter: to Ms Cartwright and her colleagues for the diligent prosecution; to Mr Johnson for his thorough and professional defence; to Dr Stone for her expert psychiatric evaluation; and to Ms Melrose and the probation service for their insight and ongoing work in this case. It is also appropriate to place on record the court’s gratitude to the administrative staff and ushers of this court, whose patience and professionalism ensure the smooth conduct of hearings despite the well-documented pressures on court resources. The sentencing hearing today has been conducted in open court with all interested parties present. I remind Mr H of his right to appeal, subject to the applicable time limits and procedural requirements. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2025, in Court 12 of Manchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be made available in due course. The defendant is reminded of his statutory right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are applicable in these proceedings. No further orders as to costs are made at this stage. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. T2025/12856 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. A. RICHMOND Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of a charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, in consequence of which you have entered a plea of guilty. Procedural History This matter originated following an investigation by officers from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, prompted by reports from several independent retailers within the central Bristol area. The offences, as charged, represent a pattern of shoplifting incidents committed over a period extending from approximately October 2024 until March 2025. The investigation involved cooperation between police units, store security personnel, and the Bristol Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), a multi-agency collaboration established in 2016 aimed at addressing acquisitive crime within the commercial districts. The BCRP's approach involves the collation of incident reports from affected retailers, dissemination of offender descriptions, and strategic deployment of police resources to hotspots. Despite the initiative’s commendable intentions, the court is aware from both submitted materials and prior experience that the efficacy of such schemes varies considerably. Staff shortages, shifting priorities, and competing demands often constrain sustained efforts. Moreover, the Better Case Management process was engaged in this prosecution, with a plea and trial preparation hearing conducted in May 2025. The case was duly allocated to the Crown Court given the volume of evidence and the sustained course of conduct alleged. The initial hearing was adjourned twice, once to allow for disclosure of additional CCTV evidence and again to permit the commission of a pre-sentence psychiatric report. Both adjournments were reasonably necessitated, although counsel for the defence expressed frustration about procedural delays attributable in part to difficulties in securing Legal Aid approval for expert instruction. The court acknowledges the ongoing challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency. In this instance, the application for funding of a forensic psychologist was initially refused on grounds of insufficient justification, which, in retrospect, appear unduly stringent. Following formal representations and the intervention of the Legal Aid helpline, approval was granted three weeks later than anticipated, contributing to delay. Such occurrences, unfortunately, are not atypical in contemporary criminal proceedings and warrant sustained professional concern. The police investigative team, in addition to working with the BCRP, utilised conventional means including witness statements, forensic examination of clothing and recovered goods, and CCTV footage from multiple retail premises. Mobile phone footage submitted by the first victim’s partner was also presented, though its evidential weight was limited by quality issues. The court notes the frequent reliance on consumer-grade recording devices in retail theft cases, which can both aid and hinder investigative clarity. On 5 June 2025, you appeared before the Magistrates’ Court where you indicated a not guilty plea. Following enhanced disclosure and the filing of an expert report, the matter was committed for trial to this court. On 14 August 2025, you changed your plea to guilty at the earliest practicable stage before the trial date. It is a regrettable but established feature of cases involving repeated shoplifting that defendants often delay admission of guilt until the evidential case has become overwhelmingly strong. While the law correctly permits such procedural rights, it also recognises that the sentencing credit available for late pleas should correspond with the timing and circumstances of the admission. The Court of Appeal’s position in R v. Pickering [2023] EWCA Crim 1018 remains authoritative: a plea entered only at the threshold of trial attracts markedly less reduction than one entered soon after charge. It is a fine but important distinction, intended to incentivise early acceptance of responsibility and to respect the interests of all parties, including victims. The Crown, represented by Ms Eleanor Shaw, has provided clear and cogent submissions concerning the impact of your offending on the retailers and their staff. The defence is represented by Mr Simon Clozier of counsel, who has candidly acknowledged the difficulties encountered in progressing this matter expeditiously. I express my gratitude to both counsel for their professional conduct throughout. The Theft Act 1968 remains the principal statutory instrument governing offences of theft. Section 1 delineates the core offence, requiring proof of dishonest appropriating property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving. The legislative framework is supplemented by a detailed Sentencing Council guideline, last updated in 2022, which emphasises the balance of culpability, harm, and offender personal mitigation. The court also considers relevant case law, including the seminal House of Lords decision in R v. Ghosh [1982] QB 1053, which, although superseded on the test for dishonesty (see Ivey v. Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67), remains instructive in its broader themes regarding intent. The more recent Court of Appeal authority in R v. McClean [2024] EWCA Crim 2067 directs sentencing courts to take account of patterns of offending rather than isolated acts when the charge represents a course of conduct. Notably, while certain offences in the criminal law involve heightened protections—such as those protected under the Dangerous Offenders regime or involving sexual harm—the present case, being non-violent and primarily property-based, falls within the mid-range acquisitive crime category. Nevertheless, risk of reoffending, impact on victims, and previous history are crucial factors. It is also instructive to reflect on the challenges facing the Probation Service nationally. Resource constraints, high caseloads, and the growing complexity of cases are well documented—particularly for those offenders whose social circumstances include unstable housing, unemployment, or comorbid mental health issues. In the present matter, the allocated probation officer has reported significant difficulties in engaging you meaningfully. Furthermore, NHS mental health services, under pressure from soaring demand and limited funding, frequently struggle to provide timely assessments or interventions for defendants exhibiting mental health vulnerabilities without acute risk markers. Despite this, the cooperation of Dr Sarah King, Consultant Psychiatrist at the Avon and Somerset Mental Health Trust, has been instrumental in providing a competent forensic assessment on your behalf. The facts of this case are as follows: Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. Turning to the modus operandi, it is apparent that your offending was systematic and deliberate, involving both concealment techniques and opportunistic timing. The use of distraction tactics, such as engaging staff in ostensibly innocuous conversation while removing goods, indicates a level of sophistication not commonly found in first-time or incidental offenders. Further, the evidence suggests you deliberately targeted small or independent retailers, presumably perceiving these as softer targets compared to larger chains with more robust security measures. While arguably pragmatic, such conduct particularly damages community cohesion, as independent shopkeepers often lack both the resources and institutional support of larger enterprises. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. It is significant that victims’ statements were obtained from store managers, many of whom have expressed ongoing concern regarding loss prevention and personal safety. Several reported consideration of altered staffing rotas to avoid lone working during peak hours when your presence was anticipated. This state of affairs engenders an erosion of community trust and workplace morale. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. In addition to the police and Crown Prosecution Service’s efforts, local voluntary sector organisations have maintained contact with the commerce community affected. The Bristol Retailers Support Network, although operating on limited funds, furnished an impact statement which highlights the psychological toll of repeat theft on small businesses, sometimes leading to premature closures or displacement. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. On behalf of the defence, a forensic psychiatric report compiled by Dr King concludes that while you do not suffer from any major psychiatric disorder, traits associated with low mood, impulsivity, and an absence of behavioural regulation were noted. Dr King cautions against interpreting this as an excuse for criminality, instead suggesting targeted therapeutic intervention might reduce reoffending likelihood. Of note, Dr King points out a history of unstable accommodation, periodic unemployment, and familial estrangement, all factors which collectively compound personal stress and impair judgement. Experts are of course mindful that presence of psychological or social difficulties does not equate to absence of agency. This court has repeatedly observed that mental health vulnerabilities, while warranting compassionate consideration, cannot absolve individuals of responsibility for deliberate wrongdoing. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. To provide broader context, the sentencing guidelines recommend particular focus on whether there has been repeated offending, the impact on victims and local businesses, and any steps taken by the offender to acknowledge wrongdoing or commence rehabilitation. Credit for guilty pleas must be weighed meticulously, taking account of the timing and genuineness of the admission. The court notes that during pre-sentence enquiries it became evident that you have declined offers of support from both the Probation Service and local voluntary organisations designed to assist with housing and employment. Despite multiple referrals, you have not engaged with budgeting or skills programmes, leading to reasonable concerns about your willingness or capacity to address the underlying causes of offending behaviour. Recent data compiled by the Avon Probation Service illustrates the difficult position faced by practitioners dealing with offenders harbouring entrenched patterns of acquisitive crime compounded by social marginalisation. The caseload is described in internal memoranda as “unsustainably high” and staff turnover is an ongoing issue. It is worth reflecting briefly on related case law in this section. For example, R v. Fenwick [2022] EWCA Crim 778 concerned a defendant convicted of repeated theft from supermarkets, who exhibited both a pattern of covert concealment and opportunistic timing around staff shift changes. The Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 10 months’ custody, while highlighting the cumulative impact of persistent offending on local business viability and public confidence in retail safety. Similarly, in R v. Allerton [2023] EWCA Crim 1054, the defendant’s conduct involved a series of offences including theft, handling stolen goods, and associated fraud. While the offences were partially distinct from Mr H’s conduct, the appellate court drew attention to the broader harm inflicted on the business community and public order. I do not suggest that these cases are precisely analogous, but they provide a useful frame of reference to illustrate judicial attitudes towards acquisitive crime involving persistent patterns. It is also prudent to make passing mention of the operational challenges of digital forensic units within contemporary police forces. The current case saw requests for enhancement of certain CCTV footage met with initial reservations due to backlog and technological constraints. The court is aware that digital evidence gathering remains a resource-intensive and rapidly evolving field. The court further observes, without attributing any particular relevance, that the relevant Legal Aid arrangements have once again been a source of difficulty in this matter. Funding applications for psychological and ancillary reports have been reviewed and initially rejected on technical grounds, contributory to delay. This is despite a national framework intended to expedite access to such support services in appropriate cases. Such procedural fragility ought to be addressed by administrative reform. The facts, while clear, show unmistakably a pattern of persistent dishonest conduct. The defendant resorted to multiple entries into various retail premises, timed to avoid detection during shift turnover. Frequently, goods of modest value but high resale potential were removed and concealed within bags or clothing. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. The impact on victims has been documented through statements describing emotional distress, loss of revenue, and a pervasive sense of unease among staff. Although no violence or threat thereof was present, the psychological harm cannot be underestimated. The phenomena of “reassurance gap” described in criminological literature is relevant: repeated offending erodes community confidence in law enforcement and increasing fear among shopkeepers. The court is cognisant, moreover, of the wider implications for public safety and resource allocation. While offences of this nature may appear relatively minor when viewed independently, the cumulative effect of repeated acquisitive crime is to consume disproportionate police and prosecutorial resources. That diverts attention away from more serious or violent crime, thus indirectly affecting overall community safety. When considering sentencing outcomes, the court must weigh aggravating factors — including the continuity of offending, the breach of trust implicit in repeated self-service theft, the impact on victims, and the pattern of non-engagement with rehabilitative opportunities — against mitigating features such as early plea, acknowledged personal difficulties, and absence of prior custodial sentences. While the scale of the offences is modest in financial terms, public interest mandates a robust response to sustained acquisitive crime. The court notes the significant number of resource hours dedicated over months to monitoring, evidence collation, and prosecution. This is not trivial. Drawing together the various threads, I intend to direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report from the National Probation Service. The report is to encompass an assessment of risk, diversity considerations, psychological and social support needs, and the appropriateness of community-based rehabilitative programmes. Particular attention should be paid to expenditure of time and capacity, in order that proposals can be put forward addressing both the likelihood of compliance and the imperative of public protection. Finally, I wish to record formal appreciation for the efforts of the Bristol Business Crime Reduction Partnership. In an era marked by tightened public sector budgets and previous cuts to policing numbers, their coordination and support to small businesses are invaluable. While uneven, their contribution to community cohesion and crime deterrence is well beyond decorative. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal transcript will be lodged with the court record. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 s.49 apply. There are no further directions as to costs. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. T2025/13567 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. DUNCAN Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced following your conviction on a charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge relates to a series of shoplifting incidents occurring over an eighteen-month period, primarily within the Bristol metropolitan area, affecting various retail outlets including pharmacies, convenience stores, and small independents. Procedural History Your arrest took place on 28 April 2025, subsequent to an extensive investigation coordinated by Avon & Somerset Police with considerable input from the Bristol Retail Crime Partnership. The investigation encompassed a complex assembly of digital evidence, including CCTV footage, point-of-sale data, and witness testimony. An early difficulty in the case was the requirement to secure viable identification — often complicated by inconsistent lighting and momentary camera obstructions typical in retail environments. Nonetheless, persistent enquiries and corroborative evidence eventually warranted charge. It is appropriate here to note that the successful prosecution of retail theft cases such as this one depends heavily on the tenacity and commitment of police officers, store personnel, and often volunteer security staff. Capturing and then processing hours of shop floor footage is laborious and frequently lacks the glamour associated with more high-profile investigations. From this perspective, one must acknowledge the dedication of Sergeant Mandy Holloway and her team, whose management of this investigation was meticulous and protracted. More broadly, the burden on policing resources posed by acquisitive crime remains significant. Though sometimes dismissed as “low-level” or “victimless,” shoplifting requires substantial police time, forensic support, victim liaison, and, crucially, judicial attention. In an era marked by shrinking budgets and increasing demand across all aspects of law enforcement and community safety, these cases can contribute disproportionately to the workload. It is a constant challenge to strike an appropriate balance between responding to these offences and attending to more serious threats, such as violent crime or public order disturbances. The case's progression adhered, for the most part, to the prescribed timetable under the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR). The initial hearing was held promptly on 3 May 2025, and the listing for a plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 15 June. At that latter hearing, you entered a not guilty plea. The case was listed for trial on 10 September; however, on the morning of the trial, you entered a plea of guilty. This last-minute change is regrettably a growing phenomenon in this court and others. It invariably reduces any entitlement to sentence discount for early admission of guilt, as the Court of Appeal has repeatedly made clear — notably in the decision of R v. Abrahams [2023] EWCA Crim 195, where the court emphasised that credit for a guilty plea must balance judicial economy with genuine remorse and responsibility. It is prudent also to draw attention to the role of the Legal Aid Agency in this matter. Defense representation was provided under a standard representation order, facilitated by Mr Damian Price of the Public Defender Service. There have been delays and administrative challenges, particularly concerning the application and subsequent approval for an independent psychiatric report, which were protracted over several weeks. Such delays are emblematic of systemic problems within the Legal Aid framework and, while they do not excuse tardiness on any party’s part, they do underscore the obstacles that all stakeholders face in achieving timely and effective case resolution. It is likewise necessary to recognise the contribution of voluntary organisations in supporting victims and community resilience. The Bristol Retail Partnership, a consortium of independent shopkeepers, has provided detailed victim impact statements, reflecting not only individual loss but the broader economic and psychological effects on small business communities. Their ongoing commitment to collaborative crime reduction initiatives is commendable, particularly in the current climate of uncertainty and economic strain. As a procedural aside, it is worth noting that this court continues to experience operational pressures due to staffing shortages, both within the judiciary and administrative services. Such pressures inevitably cause listing delays and frequent rescheduling, as was the case in this matter, where two adjournments were necessary, the first due to the ongoing psychiatric evaluation, and the second caused by an unforeseen judicial strike. These factors, while external to the substantive issues before the court, provide a vital backdrop to the procedural flow of justice. The offence with which you are charged falls squarely within the remit of the Theft Act 1968, which defines theft as dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive the owner of it. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences, revised as of March 2023, provides a structured approach to assessing culpability and harm. Key aggravating factors include persistence of offending, vulnerability of victims or premises, use of concealment or deception, and previous convictions of similar nature. While the monetary value of individual items taken may be modest, the cumulative financial impact and psychological toll on staff and proprietors cannot be underestimated. This is particularly the case where offenders target small businesses, as opposed to larger chains with more extensive loss-prevention resources. It is prudent to consider recent appellate authority on credit for guilty pleas in acquisitive crime cases. The Court of Appeal in R v. Chandra [2024] EWCA Crim 341 held that late guilty pleas entered immediately prior to trial, after extensive evidence has been marshalled, warrant a discount of no more than 10%, reinforcing the principle already articulated in R v. Lawrence and others. Moreover, the court must give due recognition to the public interest in deterrence, both specific and general. In the present context, where you have a history of similar offending, the sentencing exercise requires particular attention to sending a clear message concerning the consequences of recidivism. It is, of course, necessary at this juncture to draw a brief comparison to unrelated but instructive case law, such as R v. Benwell [2019] EWCA Crim 1208, which concerned a complex series of commercial burglaries involving forced entry and substantial property damage. Although materially distinct, Benwell encapsulates the judiciary’s evolving approach to offences affecting business owners and employees, especially where there is a discernible pattern suggesting disregard or defiance of law and order. Further, in R v. Ormsby [2018] EWCA Crim 1739, the Court addressed sentencing in relation to repeated environmental offences, specifically fly-tipping on protected green belt land, emphasising the need for deterrence when public resources and natural heritage are thereby jeopardised. While not directly analogous, such cases illustrate the judiciary's broader concern with sustained offending impacting community welfare. The facts before this court are straightforward insofar as they have been accepted by your plea. The Crown relies on a representative count encompassing a series of shoplifting episodes from multiple local retailers between October 2023 and March 2025. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. These incidents often involved the use of distraction techniques, sometimes involving cooperation with third parties not before this court. Surveillance cameras captured you utilizing bags or clothing to conceal articles, and in some cases, you were seen exiting premises promptly to avoid detection. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. At one point, security tags were deliberately removed or concealed, signifying premeditation and knowledge of store security measures. Staff reports indicate that some employees altered their routines in response to your conduct, including varying working hours and calling for additional on-site presence. The degree of organisation and repeated visits to the same establishments suggest this was not an isolated or opportunistic series of acts, but a calculated pattern of theft intended to maximise gain while minimizing risk. This conduct resulted in economic loss and caused sustained anxiety among shop staff, who feared escalation or confrontation. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. Linked with this, there was clear evidence of your presence in the vicinity on multiple occasions, supported by mobile telephone data analysis commissioned during the police investigation. That such technology was deployed signifies the gravity with which authorities regarded these offences and the resource implications for their resolution. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. Further, at one point during the investigation, local officers executed a warrant at premises occupied by your co-defendant. Although unrelated to your charges, this individual was found in possession of indecent images, and subsequently charged with offences revolved around the Sexual Offences Act 2003. That matter is entirely separate but necessarily delays ancillary police resources and underscores the complexities involved when individuals operate within wider criminal milieus. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. There is no evidence that you participated in those offences or that you had any knowledge thereof. I emphasise this distinction because conflation would be both legally and factually improper. Your previous convictions include three for shoplifting in 2021 and 2022, albeit without custodial sentence. The Crown notes the limited time elapsed since the last offence, thereby confirming a pattern of repeat behaviour despite previous warnings and community resolution measures. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. Additional witnesses, including store managers and retail loss prevention officers, have described the impact of your offending as disproportionately damaging to the morale and financial viability of small independent outlets. They express concern not only for tangible losses but also for the erosion of customer confidence and the negative effects on staff well-being. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. The Crown also draws attention to your apparent failure to engage meaningfully with diversionary schemes or support services offered in the community, notwithstanding several referrals initiated through the Probation Service and local social care teams. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. A psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Selena Walker, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was commissioned with the aim of assessing whether any underlying mental health condition might bear on sentencing. Her report — dated 9 September 2025 — acknowledges your presentation as generally psychologically stable but notes a persistent pattern of impulsive behaviour and occasional mood instability. The report does not identify any major psychiatric disorder nor a diagnosis that would diminish responsibility under relevant legal standards. It does, however, recommend consideration of structured substance misuse services as you admit to episodic alcohol misuse. Dr Walker's observations are supported by probation information, which confirms difficulty in sustaining employment, unstable housing history including periods of temporary accommodation, and involvement with several voluntary sector support organisations, albeit with limited engagement. It is not insignificant that many such services operate with constrained funding and workforce shortages. The National Probation Service, like many public bodies, grapples with high caseloads and recruitment challenges. The Probation Officer assigned to your case, Ms Rachel Avery, reports that while periodic contact has been maintained, there is a need for more consistent attendance to ensure effective rehabilitation. Reference must be made to the prevailing theory and practice surrounding criminal justice interventions for acquisitive offenders. The literature suggests that cognitive-behavioural approaches, coupled with vocational support and where applicable mental health treatment, represent the most effective means of reducing reoffending. It is most unfortunate that the Legal Aid Agency's delays in approving your defense application for a psychiatric assessment prolonged pre-trial procedure by several weeks. Such administrative friction not only imposes frustration on legal teams but risks undermining confidence in the timely administration of justice. We find ourselves in a period where the criminal justice system has adapted to an evolving landscape of low-level crime increasingly seen as symptomatic of wider social challenges — housing insecurity, economic instability, and the erosion of traditional community structures. Crimes classified as “shoplifting” are, for many, a manifestation of these systemic pressures. Yet the law distinguishes neither the motive nor the hardship of the offender from the impact on victims and the community. The positioning of retail workers — often young, female, and underpaid — as frequent targets of such offences amplifies concerns about workplace safety and dignified labour conditions. Furthermore, the economic fragility of small businesses in the face of repeated theft hazards the sustainability of neighbourhood commerce and contributes to urban decline. While broader society debates the appropriate balance between punishment and rehabilitation, the courts must nonetheless impose sentences reflective of both the seriousness of offending and the need to protect victims and the public. This court is also conscious of the cultural shifts in attitudes towards offending and law enforcement, including the rise of social media activism and public opinion shaped by rapidly disseminated content that may skew perceptions. It is incumbent on the judiciary to remain steady, impartial, and guided solely by evidence and legal principles. I must express appreciation for the professionalism of the court staff, including ushers and administrative clerks, whose diligence under staff shortages ensures continuity of hearings. The recently refurbished court facilities in this building provide some solace amidst these challenges. In sentencing you, I am bound to the sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council. Your offending qualifies in the mid-range category for theft, aggravated by persistence, targeting of vulnerable premises, and recent prior convictions. Personal mitigation includes your acknowledgement of guilt and some evidence of remorse as expressed in your letter to the court. While late, that plea avoids the necessity for a contested hearing and spares witnesses the ordeal of trial. I accept that your personal circumstances are challenging, including housing instability and financial precarity. Nevertheless, the court’s paramount obligation is to protect public interest and foster deterrence. Community orders with rehabilitation requirements remain an option, subject to the risk of breach and their adequacy in addressing the offending behaviour. Custody, too, is under consideration, especially in light of your offending history and failure to desist. I shall therefore order the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report which explores suitable community-based interventions in parallel with custodial alternatives. The report should consider the feasibility of a structured programme incorporating cognitive skills, substance misuse support, and vocational training. I also direct that the Community Rehabilitation Company liaise with supported housing providers to establish whether stable accommodation arrangements can be secured post-sentence, as housing insecurity is a known criminogenic factor. In considering all these matters, the court maintains a focus on both rehabilitation prospects and the effective protection of the public. The hearing today has been conducted openly, with all parties present and represented. I record my thanks to Ms Sophie Lane, who appeared for the Crown, and Mr Damian Price who represented you under the Legal Aid scheme. I caution again the ongoing difficulties faced by providers of legal aid, with procedural delays often imposing disproportionate burdens on defendants and their counsel. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and subsequent sentence will be transmitted to the relevant registries and authorities. You are informed of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Matters of cost remain reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER R v. MR H Case No. M2025/14103 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. K. Pendleton Filed: 8 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing on a charge of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from a series of occasions involving unlawful appropriation of goods from retail premises. The incidents span a period beginning early 2024 and culminating in your arrest during the spring of this year, with offences committed in multiple districts across Greater Manchester. Procedural History The charges presently before the court derive from an investigation instigated by persistent reports from local store managers and security personnel. These reports emerged as part of proactive initiatives conducted under the auspices of the North West Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose remit includes the collation of incident reports, monitoring of suspect individuals, and fostering cooperation between retailers, police, and community safety organisations. Although the offences charged may appear individually modest in monetary terms, the aggregate conduct suggests a pattern warranting the attention of this court. Following your arrest on 5 April 2025, after a coordinated operation involving Greater Manchester Police’s acquisitive crime unit and the Retail Crime Intelligence Group, you were interviewed under caution. It was during these proceedings that you exercised your right to remain silent initially, later providing a limited account that did not exculpate you but declined to accept full responsibility. Forensic examination and security footage, however, identified you conclusively at various times and locations. The matter was progressed to Crown Court level under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, with listing for plea and trial preparation on 17 June 2025. Although you originally entered a not guilty plea, you changed your plea to guilty during the preparatory hearing. The BCM system aims to ensure cases are managed efficiently, with early identification of issues likely to arise at trial and the minimisation of unnecessary delay. In this instance, there were no significant departures from the expected timetable, and I record my appreciation for the efforts of the court administration, the prosecution team led by Ms Victoria Danvers, and defence counsel Mr Marcus Appleby, who has maintained standards of advocacy throughout despite the pressures frequently attendant upon Legal Aid funded work. This court is, however, troubled by continuing systemic issues affecting Legal Aid administration. The application to engage an independent forensic psychologist to prepare a report addressing the nexus between offending behaviour, personal circumstances, and risk was initially submitted on 10 May 2025 but was not authorised until the beginning of July 2025. Such delays invariably hinder the delivery of timely justice and place additional strain on all participants in the process. While not directly determinative of sentencing outcomes, these procedural challenges remain a blight on the justice system. It is well understood that the offence of theft, particularly when committed repeatedly and in a commercial context, poses significant difficulties for victims, law enforcement, and wider society. The cumulative loss to retailers is often substantial, and the psychological effects upon staff—ranging from heightened anxiety to the erosion of workplace confidence—cannot be dismissed lightly. Small, family-run businesses often bear a disproportionate burden, lacking the financial resources or security infrastructure of larger chains. This court recognises the increasing demands upon front-line policing units. Crime pattern analyses, workload pressures, and resource constraints all contribute to an environment in which seemingly low-level offences consume disproportional investigative effort. The Greater Manchester Police force has reported a year-on-year increase in incidents of retail theft by approximately 8% between 2022 and 2024, with consequent diversion of specialist units from other areas of public safety concern. This demonstrates the broader community impact beyond the immediate acts. The court wishes to place on record its thanks to the officers and civilian staff who gathered and maintained evidence, coordinated between multiple agencies, and ensured the orderly processing of this matter. Notwithstanding the procedural context, the critical question now arises as to the nature and circumstances of your offending, the degree of personal culpability, and the appropriate response by the court. I shall therefore proceed to an examination of the facts and related material. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. It is important to acknowledge that, as is often the case, appearances can be deceptive. The role of CCTV footage, though invaluable in the overwhelming majority of cases, requires meticulous verification and is not infallible. The temporal alignment of transactions, staff availability, and customer flow can generate ambiguity that necessitates careful scrutiny. In this case, however, the combination of visual evidence and ancillary material—including stock discrepancy reports and witness statements—has provided a sufficiently firm evidential foundation. The Court must also weigh recent case law relevant to theft offences, particularly that landmark in setting sentencing parameters for acquisitive crime of a repetitive nature. For example, R v. Harper [2019] EWCA Crim 1432 established important precedent regarding the weight afforded to sustained patterns of dishonest conduct, even where individual monetary sums are low. The Court of Appeal noted that multiple acts occurring over extended periods may collectively justify a higher sentence reflecting both deterrence and denunciation. Similarly, the judgment in R v. Westbrook [2021] EWCA Crim 1179 addressed the question of mitigation where a defendant exhibited genuine remorse and took steps towards rehabilitation prior to sentence. However, Westbrook is distinguishable in that the appellant had actively engaged with support services and demonstrated compliance over a substantial period before conviction. In the present case, the extent to which such mitigating features are present will be addressed shortly in light of the reports provided. In considering your background, I have had the benefit of a detailed pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Eleanor Brooks, in addition to the psychiatric appraisal obtained via Dr Joanne Fulton, Consultant Forensic Psychologist. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. The probation report is comprehensive and notably expresses concerns relating to your limited engagement with community support mechanisms despite multiple offers of assistance. It highlights the complex interplay of social factors contributing to vulnerability to offending, yet stresses that personal responsibility remains a cornerstone of rehabilitative endeavors. Dr Fulton’s assessment quotes from a battery of psychometric instruments, including the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and the Addiction Severity Index. Her conclusion is that you exhibit borderline features consistent with impulsive behaviour and mild substance misuse, though no formal psychiatric diagnosis meeting ICD-11 criteria for a major mental disorder was established. While these factors may provide explanatory context, they do not, as the Court of Appeal has frequently ruled, diminish personal accountability where conduct is deliberate and repetitive. The Court observes that multi-agency collaboration, while theoretically robust in this jurisdiction, often faces practical difficulties. The interface between health services, social care, and criminal justice remains a work in progress. Waiting times for secondary mental health assessments frequently exceed twelve weeks, and housing insecurity—an issue present in your case—exacerbates instability. Nevertheless, the resources to promote desistance and reduce reoffending do exist, even if sometimes stretched. Notwithstanding these factors, I must comment that your refusal to engage with supportive interventions offered by voluntary organisations such as Manchester Central Outreach and the Salford Community Advice Service is regrettable. These agencies, often staffed by dedicated volunteers and professionals working at the margins of capacity, provide critical lifelines for individuals seeking to escape cycles of disadvantage. The Court is aware that their frontline services suffer from funding instability and high turnover, yet their refusal to cease aid on account of funding alone speaks to a resilient commitment that deserves recognition. It is also pertinent to acknowledge wider social trends impacting this offence category. Increasing homelessness in urban centres, alongside the proliferation of street begging and illicit substance markets, places courts in the difficult position of balancing compassion with deterrence. The normalisation of certain forms of antisocial behaviour—whether street-level acquisitive crime or public disorder—poses challenges not only to public order but also to the legitimacy of law enforcement in affected communities. Against this backdrop, it is critical that courts maintain clarity as to the boundaries of lawful behaviour. Accommodation of hardship does not extend to tolerance of theft, the very act at issue here. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. A letter submitted on your behalf from the Hope Resettlement Project attests to your attendance at a support programme aiming to address tenancy sustainment. It is apparent from their invitation that you have attended some initial sessions, but the absence of consistent participation is noted. It was also pointed out that secure accommodation remains elusive, with your current residence classified as transient and subject to multiple occupancy conditions. The instability inherent in this living arrangement contributes to vulnerability but does not excuse the offending behaviour. The Court is reminded also of R v. O’Sullivan [2023] EWCA Crim 625, a case concerning shop theft committed in similar social circumstances. There, the appellant was given a community order incorporating a rehabilitation requirement, a decision informed by detailed reports outlining cooperation and risk-reduction prospects. This court will, of course, consider whether analogous disposals are suitable here, in the light of all relevant evidence. Other relevant precedent includes R v. MacKenzie [2018] EWCA Crim 1401, which underscored the importance of sentence proportionality in offences where the economic value of stolen goods was minimal but the conduct repeated. The leading sentencing guideline on theft offences contains a nuanced framework for categorising culpability and harm, with aggravating and mitigating features carefully tabulated. Professions involved in the wider safeguarding and rehabilitation ecosystem continue to grapple with the demands placed upon them by multi-faceted client needs. Probation officers manage increasingly complex caseloads, often with less than ideal administrative support. I appreciate Ms Brooks’s diligence in compiling a balanced and thorough report despite these challenges. It is also necessary to comment on the excellent work done by the Manchester Retailers’ Safety Forum, which has invested in advanced training for frontline staff to recognise and respond to shop theft incidents effectively and with due regard for personal safety. Their ongoing collaboration with law enforcement contributes materially to community security. Your record indicates that you are 34 years old, previously in receipt of a conditional discharge for similar conduct in 2022. There are no recorded convictions involving violence or offences linked to coercion or organised criminality. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. Given the nature of your offending, it is appropriate to consider the impact upon victims who have provided statements to this court. The victims’ accounts describe direct consequences including economic loss, workplace stress, and a diminished sense of workplace safety. Some employees report adjusting rotas and deploying additional security measures in response to your actions. This feedback is vital in ensuring the proportionality and seriousness with which such offences are approached by the judiciary. Victim liaison officers attached to the Crown Prosecution Service contributed to the collation of these statements and ensured their timely provision to counsel. Their role in bridging the gap between complainants and the criminal justice process is well established and worthy of commendation. While no direct threats or acts of violence accompanied the incidents, the psychological toll on those targeted can be significant, reflecting findings in R v. Dacre [2021] EWCA Crim 1331, which dealt with aggravated burglary but emphasised non-physical harm in sentencing considerations. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. I have also reviewed defence submissions which emphasise your expressed remorse, poverty, and stated intention to engage in rehabilitation. The handwritten letter you sent to the court is neatly presented and reflects an awareness of the distress your conduct caused, although the tone tends to conflate financial hardship with inevitability of criminal behaviour, a stance the court is unable to endorse. It bears reiterating that deprivation is no shield from liability, nor a sound basis for placing community safety at risk. Nevertheless, the court is mindful of the complex social challenges many face, including yourself. The statutory framework governing sentencing in this jurisdiction requires balance between punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2022) provides valuable structure in categorising offending into harm and culpability bands, with adjustments for mitigating and aggravating features. At the same time, this court draws from the well-established principles set out in R v. Wells [2019] EWCA Crim 500 regarding the imposition of community orders, particularly those including rehabilitation requirements tailored to address underlying causative factors. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. Notably, the court is reminded of the case of R v. Ingram [2017] EWCA Crim 2345, involving repetitious shop theft, where the defendant received a custodial sentence reflecting the failure to desist despite multiple warnings and community-based interventions. It is an unfortunate reality that for some offenders, community sentences, while well intentioned and beneficial in principle, do not achieve the desired reduction in reoffending. This is particularly so where engagement is inconsistent or superficial. Your prior refusals to engage with recommended services, especially those addressing impulsivity and possible substance misuse, raise concerns about the likely efficacy of a purely non-custodial sanction absent evidenced changes in attitude. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. There is no dispute that financial hardship and unstable accommodation provide a challenging context. The local authority, as per correspondence dated 12 August 2025 from the Manchester Housing Department, has articulated the precariousness of your housing situation and indicated limited capacity for expedited rehousing. The systemic pressures on social housing allocations are well documented and widely reported. Nonetheless, homelessness is not an uncommon experience among persons similarly charged before this court, many of whom have successfully accessed support, adhered to rehabilitation plans, and refrained from offending. The law distinguishes between circumstance and choice. The court accepts the view expressed in the probation and psychiatric reports that targeted interventions addressing impulsivity, coupled with cognitive-behavioural approaches, may yield positive effects if engagement is sustained. Services such as the ThinkForward Programme and local charity-led mental health outreach remain options. I am mindful, however, that the integrity of any such intervention is contingent upon collaborative commitment from the defendant. The court has also taken note of submissions concerning the strained resources of police community officers and the increasing administrative burden of multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), which frequently operate at or beyond capacity. These factors contribute to the complexity of managing offenders with fluctuating motivation and risk profiles. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. It is appropriate to underscore the serious nature of the court’s focus on safeguarding the public. While the offences before me are by no means the gravest in the criminal calendar, their persistence and cumulative impact pose identifiable threats to community wellbeing. The diversion of police resources from violent and organised crime investigations is a material harm borne by society. The court is acutely aware that similar reports from other jurisdictions highlight a rise in acquisitive theft linked to socio-economic pressures intensified by factors such as unemployment, inflation, and social welfare reform. Such trends underscore the importance of consistent enforcement coupled with effective rehabilitation. In conclusion, I summarise the position as follows: your offending is a sustained and deliberate course of conduct, reflective of a disregard for the law and the wellbeing of victims. Mitigating factors exist but are mitigated themselves by your limited engagement with existing support mechanisms. You face a range of potential sentencing outcomes. Custodial sentences for offences of this gravity are not uncommon, especially where prior warnings have gone unheeded. However, the court is also conscious of the public interest in rehabilitation and the potential for community-based disposals where compliance can reasonably be expected. I hereby direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report with particular attention to risk assessment, available rehabilitative pathways, and the feasibility of a community order incorporating a rehabilitation activity requirement, potentially accompanied by unpaid work elements. The report should also explore options for housing support referrals and address any substance misuse concerns in accordance with local provision. I reserve sentence until receipt of this report. The matter is adjourned to 22 October 2025 in Court 5 at the Manchester Crown Court. All parties are reminded of the importance of timely and complete submissions to facilitate a just outcome. I remind the defendant of the right to appeal against the forthcoming sentence and the procedural requirements in that regard. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 8 September 2025, in Court 5 at Manchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been duly recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are not engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL R v. MR H Case No. T2025/15439 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. C. Wallingford Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced following conviction for offences of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences in question relate to a series of incidents occurring intermittently between October 2023 and April 2025, involving multiple shops across the greater Bristol area, including some adjacent commercial districts. This court is mindful that the matter has progressed under its jurisdiction as a Crown Court case by virtue of aggregated charges representing a course of conduct rather than isolated incidents. Procedural History and Context Your arrest took place on 4 May 2025, subsequent to a substantial investigatory effort involving officers from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary’s Retail Crime Unit, alongside collaboration with local store security teams and civilian witnesses. This followed the collation of intelligence indicating a pattern of theft targeting mid-range convenience stores, chemists, and discount department outlets. As is common in cases of this nature, initial reports were treated individually — often being recorded as summary offences that failed to attract protracted investigation. Only after persistent cross-referencing by the police Crime Analyst Unit, leveraging granular examination of CCTV footage and items recovered in opportunistic shop floor searches, was a link established. This aggregation was critical in presenting a cohesive evidential framework. It is important to stress the practical constraints facing law enforcement and retail security personnel in cases of persistent shoplifting. The demands placed on local police units by “non-serious” acquisitive offences are sustained and energy-consuming. Officers are regularly required to devote considerable attention to what may superficially appear as low-value theft, yet the cumulative impact on communities, merchant confidence, and vulnerable retail workers is considerable. The inherent difficulties in securing reliable prosecution—owing to partial, degraded, or ambiguous CCTV footage; the unreliability of witness memory for apparently minor incidents; the absence of immediate apprehension; and procedural complexities surrounding property recovery—pose ongoing challenges to justice. The court takes cognisance of the introduction and operation of Better Case Management (BCM) processes in such cases, designed to foster pre-trial clarity and streamline progress. The BCM protocol in your matter, despite some delays that I shall address, has largely met expected benchmarks. Your initial listing was scheduled for 12 June 2025, but adjournments due to application by your defence to secure funding for psychiatric assessment caused deferral. These delays, while regretted, are not uncommon in current practice, particularly given the procedural complexities surrounding expert authorisations from the Legal Aid Agency. There was further interruption owing to a late application to admit mitigation material referencing statements from your sister, Mrs Adelaide H, and letters from community service providers in Bristol, all received in early August. The importance of such supporting evidence is acknowledged in principle, although the court is aware of the increased administrative burden and strain on court listing resources caused by such ad hoc additions. These issues amplify concerns regarding the timely administration of justice for all parties. It is well established that theft, as codified under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, requires proof of dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with an intention to permanently deprive. The Crown in this matter has proceeded on the basis of a representative charge, indicative of a sustained pattern of offending behaviour rather than discrete isolated acts. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences (published 2022) sets out a sentencing framework which accounts for the frequency of offences, the value and type of property stolen, aggravating and mitigating features, and the circumstances of the offender. Although individual shoplifting incidents are often summary and low-value, the court recognises that cumulative harm, particularly involving repeat offenders, demands appropriate custodial or community measures tailored to public protection and rehabilitation. Similar authorities include R v Carrick [2023] EWCA Crim 1874, where the Court of Appeal considered sentencing for repeated offences targeting independent retailers. The Court underscored the considerable impact on victims’ sense of safety and the need for sentences to have a deterrent effect against recidivism in persistent dishonesty. Although the matters discussed in Carrick significantly focused on offences involving distraction techniques aimed at elderly shopkeepers, its principles remain broadly instructive here. An earlier case, R v. Delaney [2021] EWCA Crim 1307, concerned the theft of pharmaceuticals from multiple pharmacy outlets, where the defendant engaged in systematic concealment of high-demand medicines. The guidance in Delaney insisted upon recognition of the particular harm caused to public health through such thefts, alongside the emotional impact on staff in healthcare settings. While your offences differ in precise detail, these rulings provide useful indicators of sentencing boundaries. The Psychiatric Report prepared by Dr Thomas Burrows, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at Clifton Clinic, was commissioned following the defense’s application, which was authorised by the Legal Aid Agency only after delay, as previously noted. Dr Burrows’ comprehensive assessment—completed in July 2025—notes that you do not suffer from major mental illness, but that your presentation exhibits features consistent with moderate anxiety disorder and traits of impulsive personality disorder. Notably, the report underlines your “ambivalence towards ongoing engagement with community services” and a lack of sustained insight into how stressors like unemployment and housing insecurity contribute to your offending. Crucially, the report identifies that while your risk of harm to others is low, there is a moderate risk of reoffending absent structured intervention. Dr Burrows highlighted that cognitive-behavioural therapy and structured rehabilitation programmes would be beneficial but only if undertaken voluntarily with adequate motivation. The Psychiatric Report cautions that, given your current stoicism and limited self-reflection, engagement may be challenging. The pre-sentence report, dated 9 September 2025, prepared by probation officer Ms Louise Trent, supports these observations. It presents a detailed social history describing a series of personal challenges spanning over a decade, including intermittent homelessness, fractured familial relationships, and periods of substance misuse, although no current dependence is reported. Ms Trent remarks that your engagement with voluntary sector provisions such as the Bristol Homeless Support Network has been sporadic and that your recent attendance at local adult education workshops was positively regarded but short-lived. Ms Trent recommends consideration of a multi-modal community order incorporating unpaid work, mental health liaison support, and addressing financial management skills. The report outlines your prior convictions relevant to acquisitive offending across the southwest region, noting convictions dating back to your early 20s, including non-custodial sanctions for shoplifting. It is regrettable that recent national reports from the Probation Service indicate ongoing shortages of qualified officers and resource constraints, which may adversely affect the capacity to sustain intensive supervision regimes. These systemic difficulties are noted without judgment but with a degree of professional concern. The court has received written victim statements from a number of store managers and assistants who experienced repeat theft in their places of work. These statements reflect not only financial loss but also emotional distress and increased workload resulting from extra security measures such as re-setting aisle displays, locking of certain shelves during duty hours, and reallocation of staffing schedules. Several employees reported feelings of vulnerability and anxiety, with one assistant commenting that “the persistent theft makes the shop feel unsafe, and reduces the pleasure of the job.” The Bristol Retailer Alliance has provided a briefing highlighting the economic and social toll of persistent shoplifting on local independent retailers. Their correspondence suggests that while national strategies such as the Business Crime Reduction Partnership operate across the city, implementation unevenly varies by borough and individual stores’ capacity to engage. The Alliance expresses hope that sentencing in this case will send a clear message about the unacceptability of sustained retail theft. It is notable that the National Retail Federation’s 2024 report underscores similar challenges, pointing to how repeat petty theft cumulatively threatens employment and local economies, particularly in deprived neighbourhoods. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. The court is mindful, however, that no incidents of violence or threats against staff attended your offending. This is a significant, albeit limited, mitigating element. The Legal Aid Agency’s performance in this matter, while ultimately facilitating a psychiatric assessment, has been marked by procedural inertia that caused several months’ postponement. Your appointed counsel, Mr Daniel Brooks, has repeatedly liaised with the Agency, forwarding necessary documentation and supplementary explanations in pursuit of swift authorisation. This drawn-out administrative process exemplifies wider challenges in the current legal aid framework, as also documented in the Ministry of Justice’s 2024 Review of Criminal Defence Funding, which noted that delays in expert instruction authorization detrimentally affect case timeliness. The court likewise regrets the ongoing systemic shortfall in staffing within mental health services, particularly community forensic liaison teams, which impacts the availability of bespoke therapeutic interventions essential for defendants presenting with multiple complex needs. An additional complicating factor in the smooth management of cases remains the prevalence of late guilty pleas in acquisitive crime. Though you entered a guilty plea at the third hearing in July 2025, this came only after non-progression of initial not guilty pleas and further evidence disclosures. Such timing limits the usual discount applied for guilty pleas under the Sentencing Council guidelines and relevant case law, including R v. Harris [2022] EWCA Crim 992. This case also occurred against a backdrop of broader societal issues. Street homelessness in Bristol has reportedly increased by 14% over the last two years, with associated growings concerns of vulnerability to exploitation and mental health deterioration. Anecdotal evidence from charitable organisations supports this grim trend and reminds the court of the human dimensions underpinning many crimes of acquisitive nature. Nevertheless, these challenges must be balanced against the importance of individual accountability and public protection. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. It is worth reiterating that the offence before the court must be considered on its specific facts and not overshadowed by unrelated societal malaise, though the latter may offer useful context. The court takes note of the important rulings in R v. Thompson [2018] EWCA Crim 286, which dealt with a defendant convicted of copper cable theft from railway infrastructure. Although materially different from shoplifting, the case highlighted the disproportionate economic impact and public safety concerns triggered by repeat offenders exploiting vulnerable systems. In sentencing, the Court of Appeal emphasised both the cumulative nature of harm and the need for deterrence. Other cases, including R v. Foster [2020] EWCA Crim 1099, which involved aggravated burglary with a bladed article, are less directly relevant here, though they certainly reflect a judicial commitment to weighing not just the narrow act, but wider public safety imperatives. The court is reminded that early guilty pleas remain key drivers of sentence mitigation as expressed in R v. Whitbeck [2021] EWCA Crim 1435, but discounts are strictly tied to timing and genuineness of admissions. Where pleas come late, the reduction is appropriately limited. The facts as established by the prosecution, and to which you have admitted liability, are summarised below. Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. These incidents demonstrate a deliberate and repeated pattern of theft, utilizing concealment techniques and exploitation of predictable retail vulnerabilities. The court accepts that no violence was employed and that there are some elements of personal hardship in your background; however, these do not detract from the gravity of persistent dishonesty or its wider ramifications. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Notably, previous interventions — including conditional cautions and community resolutions — have not produced lasting desistance. That history remains material. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. The court recognises that Mr H is now 35 years old, with a history of similar offences over a period exceeding ten years, and that various support offers have been made in the community — some accepted, some declined. While there is no evidence of complicity with organised crime or serious violence, the persistence of offending suggests entrenched behavioural patterns requiring a firm but rehabilitative response. I give credit for your late guilty plea, which reduces sentence vulnerability by a modest percentage given its timing. I also note the psychiatric and probation assessments recommending intensified community-based interventions with cognitive-behavioural elements. However, the court must weigh carefully the need for deterrence, public protection, and recognition of the real harm to victims, who have detailed increased distress and a sense of insecurity. Persistent offending of this kind imperils not only commerce but social cohesion. It is the court’s strong view that community sentences remain the preferred option when they offer realistic prospects of compliance and rehabilitation. Custodial sentences, reserved for more serious or intractable cases, provide a last resort but one not excluded here given the pattern of recidivism. I direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report incorporating updated risk assessment, considering the applicability of a community order with unpaid work and requirements targeting impulsivity, financial management, and mental health support. The probation service is also requested to consider the use of structured restorative justice measures where suitable. The court also expects close liaison with local voluntary agencies engaged in homelessness mitigation, recognizing the complex, overlapping vulnerabilities many defendants face. These sentencing remarks are issued on the 18th day of September 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON R v. MR H Case No. B2025/15093 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. Thornton Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this Crown Court for sentence following your admission of guilt to an offence under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, concerning the unlawful appropriation of property from various retail outlets within the Brighton area over a markedly protracted timeframe, extending from late 2023 through to the spring of this year. The aggregated conduct comprises multiple instances of shoplifting, ranging in scale and sophistication, which have drawn the attention of numerous agencies dedicated to retail crime prevention and community safety. Procedural Chronology and Court Administration Your initial appearance was before the Magistrates’ Court at Worthing on 2 May 2025, at which time the matter was committed to this Crown Court owing to its complexity, multiplicity of linked incidents, and the degree of public interest occasioned. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Adwani [2017] EWCA Crim 1234 underscores that the indictment must capture the totality of relevant conduct when offences arise from systematic behavioural patterns rather than discrete episodic events. It is under this guiding principle that this indictment has been framed as a representative charge to ensure proportionate process without repetitive hearings. The case has navigated several intermediary procedural stages. On 21 May 2025, you were granted conditional bail, subject to residence requirements and curfew conditions. These undertakings remained in effect up to the adjournment of proceedings pending the completion of various expert reports and the compilation of victim impact statements from local trading partners. Admittedly, some delay was occasioned by these preparatory steps, yet, in view of the necessity for a fully informed sentencing outcome, this was unavoidable and consonant with the overriding objective of justice administration. Owing in part to the complexity inherent in the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, the trial listing initially fixed for 18 September 2025 was vacated at your solicitors’ request, conditional upon your consent, in order to ensure the availability of independent expert psychiatric evaluation — a step which, while laudable in principle, did prolong the pre-sentence period beyond the ordinary norms. Nonetheless, the Court acknowledges the essential role of such assessments in informing calibrated disposals rooted in both custodial necessity and rehabilitative opportunity. It is relevant, too, to note the Court’s awareness of the pressures currently affecting the Legal Aid Agency, as has been lamented in numerous fora and judicial observations recently. Delays in funding authorisations for instructed experts, though outside the immediate remit of criminal justice agencies, remain an all-too-common source of procedural inefficiency. It must be noted that in your case, the process for securing authority to instruct consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Naomi Zahavi was protracted, with initial requests lodged in June 2025 and formal approval not communicated until early August. Such lag may well contribute to increased adjournments and attendant strain upon all parties — and, ultimately, risks compromising timely justice. One is also mindful that the Probation Service, in the current climate of staffing shortages and elevated referral volumes, has reported elongated waiting times for comprehensive pre-sentence reports, an issue acknowledged in the annual Justice Oversight Board’s report of July 2025. This forms part of a wider systemic challenge where resources are stretched thin across numerous intersecting fronts, from community-based interventions to risk management frameworks. Further to these procedural considerations, it is the custom of this Court to acknowledge the efforts of those who have provided victim impact representations, which in your case include contributions from the Brighton Retail Crime Reduction Partnership and concerned proprietors whose businesses have suffered directly from your conduct. Such inputs provide crucial perspective on the lived realities of repeat shop theft, which, contrary to some public perception, involves not only financial loss but also psychological stress, diminished staff morale, and cumulative harm to local economies. To this end, I record formally the assistance of Ms Bernadette Clough (Retail Partnership Coordinator), whose noted dedication in collating and presenting evidence has been of considerable value. Concomitantly, I must mention, though tangential to the circumstances here, that the Court has received correspondence pertaining to other ongoing local cases, including a multi-defendant investigation involving fly-tipping and environmental damage in the South Downs area which resulted in a 14-month custodial sentence for one appellant (R v. Dunn et al. [2024] EWCA Crim 754). While entirely separate from the present matter, such cases bear witness to the breadth of enforcement activity necessary to safeguard community wellbeing. Turning to the statutory particulars, the Theft Act 1968 remains the foundational legislative measure in relation to your offence. Section 1 provides that theft comprises dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another, with the intent to permanently deprive. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Definitive Guideline (August 2015, as amended 2024) remains the primary instrument for judicial calibration of penalties, emphasizing a graded approach reflecting culpability, harm, and offender background. Relevant case law aids further refinement. R v. Talbot [2019] EWCA Crim 1830 underscored that multiple low-value incidents aggregated over time must not be assessed in isolation, lest the overall delinquency be underestimated. Similarly, R v. Fenwick [2022] EWCA Crim 296 drew attention to the aggravating influence of repeat offending despite prior interventions, cautioning against complacency in judicial response to persistent acquisitive crime. It is notable that while similar acquisitive offences may, under some circumstances, be disposed of summarily or by community orders, the Court retains jurisdiction to impose custodial sentences where the seriousness and recidivism justify such outcomes. On the matter of sentencing credit for guilty pleas, the Court is mindful of the principles articulated in R v. Davison [2023] EWCA Crim 152 defining the discretionary but principled approach to discounting for early admissions of responsibility. Here, the timing and sincerity of your plea will be assessed in due course. The Court also reflects on the growing body of appellate authority grappling with the intersection of acquisitive crime and mental health, particularly cases where compulsive behaviour or addiction underpins offending. In R v. Grayson [2020] EWCA Crim 1105, the Court determined that mental disorder, while a mitigating factor, does not negate the necessity for appropriate public protection measures, especially when offending causes sustained community disruption. Where such themes have arisen, reports by independent experts provide indispensable insight, complementing probation assessments in framing management options. The facts of the case, as presented in the verified disclosure and the agreed statement, are as follows: Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. Further scrutiny of security footage and witness statements reveals a consistent pattern of visiting various retail establishments during peak shopping hours, notably utilising distraction techniques including feigning mobile telephone calls and strategically timing lifts during staff shift transitions. Your conduct included the removal of security tags from multiple items on multiple occasions. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. One incident, captured in high-definition CCTV at the Regent Street convenience store, shows you concealing items within the lining of an oversized jacket while presenting a deliberate casual demeanour toward staff monitoring the shop floor. The court notes that while no direct confrontation or violence occurred, the cumulative impact on staff was substantial. Victim impact statements conveyed feelings of intimidation and stress, leading to adjustments in staffing rotas and the implementation of additional loss-prevention measures, with associated economic cost. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. It is pertinent to state that in at least two instances, you were warned by security personnel during previous offences, with references to earlier community resolution agreements. Despite these interventions, the offending resumed with striking regularity. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The prosecution submits that this pattern unequivocally demonstrates not mere opportunism or momentary lapse, but a sustained course of conduct with deliberate intent. Counsel for the defence instructed Dr Naomi Zahavi, who submitted a detailed forensic psychiatric report dated 31 August 2025. Dr Zahavi’s conclusions, incorporating clinical interviews and psychometric testing, identify traits consistent with impulsive-compulsive disorder and a longstanding, untreated alcohol dependency issue. While the absence of severe psychosis or pervasive mental illness is noted, the report expresses concern about your ability to regulate behaviour under stress and urges consideration of supportive interventions alongside any punitive measures. Probation Service has also submitted an initial breviate overview, highlighting factors including unstable housing, sporadic attendance at voluntary employment agencies, and a tenuous social support network. The probation officer notes a lack of engagement with specialist addiction services despite multiple referrals. The Court also takes cognisance of local public health reports describing increased demand for mental health services amidst a backdrop of NHS capacity constraints, particularly within the Sussex region. As detailed in the 2025 Sussex Health Outcomes Review, rising presentations of dual diagnosis cases place strain on community wellbeing programmes, limiting availability for new interventions. The defence has tendered several letters of support, including correspondence from the South Coast Community Food Bank and a local charity facilitating re-employment pathways and sobriety support groups, both emphasizing your efforts to rebuild and comply with treatment plans. This court commends the professionalism of voluntary sector organisations, often operating under severe financial and staffing pressures, whose contributions increasingly complement statutory provision. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. The sentencing exercise cannot ignore the precedential landscape. Amongst cases frequently cited are R v. Edgerton [2017] EWCA Crim 1557, involving repeated low-level thefts from multiple supermarkets, where the Court of Appeal affirmed custodial sentences as justified on grounds of deterrence and the defendant’s failure to heed prior sanctions. Equally, R v. Morrison [2018] EWCA Crim 2267 addressed the issue of late guilty pleas in serial theft cases, emphasizing that while credit for guilty pleading should be afforded, it is inherently attenuated if given only at the eleventh hour. Other comparative cases, such as R v. Sellers [2021] EWCA Crim 964, entailed the theft of prescription medicines from pharmacies, leading to discovery of additional risk factors including substance misuse and personal instability, culminating in multi-faceted sentencing outcomes combining custody and targeted rehabilitation. While none of these cases mirror your precise circumstances, they collectively demonstrate the Court’s nuanced approach to balancing culpability, harm, rehabilitation, and public protection. Comments on Public Safety and Societal Observations We find ourselves in a society where acquisitive offending, especially shoplifting, challenges not merely property owners but the fabric of community trust and economic viability of small and medium enterprises. The Brighton area, with its vibrant retail sector and tourist-dependent economy, is acutely sensitive to such conduct. In prosecuting such offences, the law seeks not simply to punish, but to safeguard the peace and confidence of ordinary citizens, to deter potential offenders, and to encourage positive behavioural change through structured intervention. The Court also notes with concern public reports indicating a rise in street-level antisocial behaviour in adjacent urban centres, as documented in the 2025 Sussex Policing Strategic Assessment. Though not directly linked to your case, such broader trends frame the community impact of acquisitive crime in a wider context. Furthermore, the strained state of housing provision locally cannot be overstated. National figures, echoed by the Brighton Housing Needs Review 2024, reveal chronic shortages of affordable accommodation and increasing reliance on temporary fixes. While such factors neither excuse criminal conduct nor diminish responsibility, they underscore the complex socio-economic backdrop within which offending occurs. At the same time, the Court acknowledges the importance of carefully calibrated sanctions that afford defendants the opportunity to engage with rehabilitation and desist from future harm. I extend the Court’s thanks to Ms Sophie Melton, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, and to Mr Oliver Kane, leading counsel instructed on your behalf under a full Legal Aid order. The Court notes with regret the delays occasioned by funding issues surrounding expert instruction and urges ongoing systemic reform to mitigate such procedural obstacles in the future. The professionalism and dedication of the court staff, ushering team, and administrative officers is also acknowledged, especially considering recent refurbishment and the logistical challenges posed by tight listing schedules. It is a matter of some irony—and slight frustration—that previous consultations with your local probation officer were interrupted by absence owing to their arrest on unrelated allegations, which were subsequently dismissed. While this was an unfortunate distraction, the matter has been resolved and has not unduly impacted the preparation of reports relevant to this matter. Similarly, correspondence filed by your estranged sibling, presently involved in separate criminal proceedings concerning allegations of benefit fraud, has been received by the Court but bears no material relevance to your sentencing exercise. The current case proceeded without interpreter services, though the Court was briefly delayed on 12 October by the late arrival of the assigned court clerk, who nevertheless maintained exemplary composure under pressure. In conclusion, this Court is tasked with a careful balancing act: recognising the seriousness of the offending pattern with a clear view to deterrence, while also attending to any personal mitigating factors and prospects for rehabilitation. The pattern of behaviour is regrettable. Though no acts of violence or intimidation were evidenced, the repeated breaches of trust and disregard for interventions reflect a concerning degree of persistence and planning. The Court desires to avoid unnecessary custodial sentences, where viable community-based interventions and treatment programmes might afford an effective means of addressing the underlying issues. Nonetheless, the gravity and cumulative nature of the thefts cannot be overlooked. I shall therefore direct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared by your supervising probation officer, with particular attention to your engagement with addiction services, mental health support, and stability of accommodation. That report should also consider structured options for cognitive behavioural programmes, community payback orders, and any suitable restorative justice opportunities that might facilitate victim engagement. I reserve final sentencing until receipt of that report and any further representations you or your counsel might wish to make. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at Brighton Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript has been authored and will be placed upon official record. You are reminded of your statutory right to appeal this decision within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHWARK R v. MR H Case No. 29S/2025/06341 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge W. J. Carmichael Filed: 19 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence on a charge of theft from retail premises, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct alleged and now admitted spans an extended period from November 2023 to May 2025, predominantly taking place within the commercial zones of Southwark and neighbouring boroughs. The offence represents a continuation of prior patterns in the defendant’s history, where repeated incidents of dishonesty from shops and pharmacies have been recorded. It is necessary at the outset to record some observations concerning the nature of prosecutions for shoplifting offences in the current criminal justice climate. Cases of this type frequently involve a complex interplay between public resources and private sector cooperation, demanding considerable investigative input from police detectives, local Business Crime Reduction Partnerships, and prosecution casework teams. A further procedural note concerns the ongoing challenges faced by the courts due to staffing shortfalls in the Probation Service—a point to which I will return. Your arrest followed a meticulous and multi-agency investigative effort conducted over a period of several months during 2025. This operation required extensive collation of CCTV evidence, statements from retail staff, and forensic analysis of recovered property. Such investigations are not straightforward and impose significant administrative and financial costs on public bodies. Indeed, as observed in the recent report by the National Retail Crime Forum (2024), persistent low-level acquisitive offending imposes a disproportionate demand on policing resources, distracting from more serious crimes and causing cumulative harm to small businesses and their employees. The court is also mindful of the ongoing evolution of court procedures under the Better Case Management (BCM) regime. Since its introduction in 2016, BCM has sought to reduce delays, improve case progression, and ensure early clarity on the issues for trial and sentencing. Despite this, listing constraints and administrative burdens persist. Various hearings in this matter were subject to adjournments, some occasioned by defence applications to instruct expert witnesses and others reflecting pressures within court listings nationally. At a plea and trial preparation hearing held on 1 August 2025, you entered a plea of not guilty. However, following disclosure of further evidential material, including forensic matches and witness statements, you changed your plea to guilty at the first available opportunity thereafter on 15 August. The timing of your guilty plea is noted, though it cannot attract the full credit available for a plea entered at the earliest practical stage, as explained in R v. Thompson [2019] EWCA Crim 1234 and reaffirmed in R v. Clark [2023] EWCA Crim 587. A late plea—particularly common in acquisitive crime cases—is often the product not of sudden remorse but tactical evaluation, which places additional burdens on victims and justice services. The reduction in sentence credit in such circumstances is well established and prudent, given the strain that preparation for contested trials imposes on courts and witnesses alike. It is appropriate, here, to consider the broader legal framework. Section 1 Theft Act 1968 defines the essential elements of theft, including the requirement of dishonesty and the intention to permanently deprive the owner. These elements have been well expounded in Evans v. R [2016] UKSC 10 and reaffirmed in subsequent appellate decisions. Although the individual items stolen in cases like yours frequently possess low monetary value, the cumulative nature of offending significantly elevates culpability, particularly when repeated over prolonged periods, causing both economic and psychological harm. The Continuing Criminal Enterprise in Acquisitive Offending The Crown submits, with appropriate reliance on sentencing guidelines and statutory principles, that your offending constitutes a sustained course of dishonest conduct demonstrating planning, resolve, and disregard for prior warnings or interventions. This court concurs, viewing shoplifting in isolation as minor only if it is a single lapse; a serial pattern is, by contrast, a serious concern demanding proportionate sanction. Proper reference may be made here to R v. Merton [2024] EWCA Crim 2705, where a defendant’s pattern of repeated thefts from charity shops, including the removal of sensor tags and use of distraction tactics, led to an immediate custodial sentence upheld on appeal. The Court stressed the significance of the offending’s impact on vulnerable worker populations and the erosion of trust within the community. That said, while the sentencing guideline for theft offences provides a baseline framework, it remains vital that sentencing reflects the individual circumstances, risks, and potential for rehabilitation uniquely presented here. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines on theft (2023) emphasise factors such as the scale and frequency of offending, the degree of sophistication, the use of coercive or deceptive measures, and the effect on victims—all elements engaged here. Whilst this court regularly references the need for proportionality, it is also obliged to consider general deterrence and the protection of the public. Persistent acquisitive offending drains public and private resources, undermines confidence in the retail sector, and affects workers who are often low-paid and vulnerable. A sentence must balance these competing interests. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. Experience teaches that whilst the immediate value of stolen goods may seem modest, the cumulative loss to retailers is substantial. Moreover, the psychological impact on victims—particularly retail workers tasked with confronting theft—must not be underestimated. The Retail Workers’ Union submitted a signal letter highlighting the distress caused by repeated thefts, noting increased staff turnover and absenteeism as a consequence. Your conduct was not confined to mere opportunism, and culpability is elevated by the steady nature of your offending, executed despite prior community resolutions and formal warnings. Similarly, the approach of your local council’s Safer Neighbourhood Team involved proactive engagement with you, offering support through outreach and diversionary opportunities which were declined or met with inconsistent participation. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. The delay in the proceedings, occasioned by necessary psychiatric assessments and attendant Legal Aid agency authorisations, must also be acknowledged by the court. It is a matter of regret that repeated applications were required before approval was granted for the instruction of an independent forensic psychologist, a process which extended the timeline by several months. Cases such as this highlight systemic inefficiencies within our criminal justice support frameworks, a matter currently under review by the Ministry of Justice Reform Committee. The present assessment was conducted by Dr Olivia Broad, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, whose report was filed on 12 September 2025. Her analysis, based on detailed interviews and psychometric testing, concludes that although no enduring psychiatric illness was diagnosed, there are notable difficulties with impulse control, emotional regulation, and stress tolerance which complicate compliance and increase risk of re-offending absent structured support. It is, perhaps, worthwhile to note in passing that the Probation Service in this jurisdiction continues to operate under significant strain, with frequent staff turnover and high caseloads. The impact of these pressures is deserving of formal comment. Probation officers must now navigate a landscape of heightened demand and fewer resources, often tasked with managing complex cases including mental health concerns, substance misuse, and housing instability. This systemic context, while not an excuse, is critical in understanding the challenges inherent in preparing comprehensive pre-sentence reports and supervising community orders. An instructive comparator can be found in R v. Stenson [2018] EWCA Crim 351, a case involving repeated thefts from supermarkets by an individual suffering from borderline personality disorder. The Court noted the importance of psychiatric input to frame sentencing options appropriately, balancing risk and rehabilitation without undue reliance on custodial sentences where community treatment could suffice. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. Returning to the facts here, your offending was characterised by repeated entries into various retail premises, with evidence of preparatory behaviour such as the concealment of items in clothing or bags, and the use of distractions aimed at sales staff. Several victims have provided statements attesting to the emotional impact of these visits, describing a growing sense of vulnerability and anxiety. It is also pertinent to acknowledge, with some regret, that during the course of the police investigation a co-defendant was involved who failed to attend court and remains at large, a matter under ongoing enforcement. It should be clear that this individual’s conduct is wholly separate from yours, and you bear no responsibility for their failure to engage with the justice process, save insofar as it relates to ancillary matters of evidential linkage. The court is aware that on occasion, matters of administrative procedure are complicated by such co-defendant scenarios. The presence of multiple accused, with varying levels of culpability and differing pleas, complicates case management and evidentiary clarity. It is not unusual for co-defendants to present conflicting narratives or for their unrelated offences to receive judicial attention in co-joined hearings. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. I will now address the victim impact evidence before the court. Statements supplied by the proprietors and employees of pharmacies and small retailers detail the economic losses, heightened security measures implemented in response to ongoing losses, and the intangible but very real stress experienced by staff required to confront suspicion and loss repeatedly. One manager reported the necessity of installing additional CCTV cameras and revising staff rotas to reduce lone working during high-risk times. These measures, while necessary, incur financial and operational burdens falling ultimately on the community. It is also noted that no physical violence was perpetrated during the offences in question; however, the pervasive atmosphere of intimidation and subtle coercion exerted in some instances underlines the seriousness of the impact upon victims and staff. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. A focus on the practical consequences of your actions reveals a broader context of social and economic hardship. A report received from the Southwark Homeless Outreach Team describes your current accommodation as “temporary, unstable and vulnerable to disruption.” The report further indicates that you have declined several offers of support relating to financial and housing advice — services that are in increasingly short supply in inner London boroughs as budgets shrink and demand surges. The Circle Community Trust, a charity operating in several South London boroughs assisting individuals caught in cycles of poverty and crime, has submitted a letter noting their prior contact with you and the limits of their engagement. Volunteers expressed concern that despite repeated offers of assistance with budgeting and job seeking, sustained participation was not forthcoming. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. In an effort to gain insight into your background, the court has considered letters from family members and acquaintances which variously describe episodes of childhood instability, periods of homelessness, and interruption in educational attainment. While this material adds color to the backdrop of your life, it does not mitigate responsibility. It is a settled principle that difficult early experiences may contextualise but do not excuse criminal conduct. Nor, as emphasised in R v. Holloway [2020] EWCA Crim 1768, does the invocation of social disadvantage abrogate the duty to uphold the law or diminish the requirement for personal accountability. Courts must navigate carefully between recognition of systemic disadvantage and the imperative to impose proportionate and effective sanctions. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. The court pauses to record its appreciation for the work of the Southwark Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose efforts to coordinate intelligence, liaise with retailers, and contribute to victim impact statements demonstrate a sustained commitment to community safety in the face of constrained budgets and competing priorities. That such partnerships operate at all is a testament to the dedication of local officers and volunteers, even as these schemes are often hamstrung by limited staffing and inconsistent funding streams. It is relevant to observe that this case, despite its challenges, benefited from relative procedural stability. The listing of hearings proceeded within the indicative timeframes prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Rules, albeit with some interruptions occasioned by specialist report requests and defence instructions. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, claimed it wasn’t a serious crime and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. I must take a moment to address the issue of Legal Aid administration. The repeated delays in authorising funding for expert reports, while attributable in part to procedural safeguards necessary to prevent misuse, nonetheless impose significant costs on the timely administration of justice. As seen nationwide, delays of months for forensic psychological assessment approvals frustrate efforts to advance cases efficiently and impose additional burdens on court resources and parties alike. It remains an open question for policy makers and funders how best to reconcile fiscal prudence with the imperative to support defendants’ rights under article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The imposition of a custodial sentence is not considered lightly. That said, in sustained acquisitive offending where prior warnings have failed to deter further conduct, and where the cumulative harm to victims and the broader community is demonstrable, immediate custody is often the unavoidable conclusion. Community orders and suspended sentences have their place, particularly where engagement with support services can be anticipated and supervision is feasible. Here, that engagement has been inconsistent at best. Your lack of meaningful compliance with outreach initiatives, refusal or withdrawal from voluntary support schemes, and repetition of offending despite clear consequences, undermine confidence in non-custodial sanctions as a standalone measure in this instance. Looking to parallel cases, R v. Chapman [2022] EWCA Crim 1557 involved serial shoplifting from multiple independent retailers. While the defendant engaged positively with probation and underwent cognitive behavioural therapy, a custodial sentence was nonetheless deemed appropriate to reflect the need for deterrence. In contrast, R v. Bellamy [2023] EWCA Crim 1018 considered the early guilty plea and sustained engagement with support services a mitigating factor warranting a community order. In your case, I am mindful that your plea, while not immediate, was entered before trial, a feature which will be accounted for in mitigation but does not excuse the prior delay. The court also notes that you are currently 34 years old with four previous convictions for similar offending. You live in unstable housing arranged via local authority emergency placement. There is no evidence of gang involvement, coercion, or complicity in more serious criminality. Although personal difficulties exist, they reflect circumstances experienced by many who do not embark on a path of criminal conduct. I invite your legal representative to make submissions on sentence. (SUBMISSIONS FROM DEFENCE AND CROWN RECORDED) In conclusion, I shall direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared. Given your profile and the nature of the offending, I ask the probation officer to consider all relevant community interventions, including cognitive skills programmes, drug and alcohol treatment options if applicable, and structured unpaid work components alongside possible requirements addressing financial management. Arrangements for enhanced supervision post-release or orders should also be envisaged, should custody be imposed. Sentencing will be determined upon receipt and consideration of the aforementioned report. The court will also entertain any further representations from both parties at that stage. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 19 September 2025, at Southwark Crown Court in Court 4 before His Honour Judge W. J. Carmichael. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Questions of costs are reserved until the conclusion of proceedings.

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HULL R v. MR H Case No. T2025/15439 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. E. CHAMBERS Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court on indictment following your conviction for offences of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending occurred over an extended timeframe, from late 2023 through the early part of this year, and took place within the Kingston upon Hull area, involving multiple stores, part of both national chains and independent operators. Procedural History Your arrest came after a prolonged inquiry initiated by the Hull Business Crime Reduction Unit and supplemented by local policing teams. The investigation, which was admittedly complex and multilayered, involved liaison with store security staff, examination of digital recording devices, and scrutiny of witness statements provided across several sites. This inquiry unfolded alongside the operation of the Better Case Management (BCM) protocols designed to enhance the efficiency with which such cases are handled, particularly those involving an accumulation of relatively low-value incidents which, taken individually, might otherwise risk being overlooked. It is an unfortunate reality that cases such as this one frequently place administrative pressure on the judiciary and prosecuting authorities alike. The piling together of multiple minor incidents, repetitive procedural scheduling, and the requirement for multiple victim statements amplify workload considerably. To this end, this court notes with frustration the ongoing staffing shortages in probation services which exacerbate the challenge of timely report preparation. In addition, this case was subject to an adjournment caused by a temporary unavailability of expert psychiatric services, a difficulty compounded by protracted NHS waiting lists impacting mental health assessments generally. In anticipation of today’s sentencing hearing, I have reviewed correspondence from the probation officer overseeing your case, highlighting an increased workload stemming from cumulative obligations under Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC) and the growing demands of the MAPPA framework, which regularly consumes probation resources. This is a cautionary backdrop against which your case proceeds. During proceedings, your counsel, Mr Alan Greensdale, whose consistent advocacy merits recognition for its thoroughness and measured approach, has made detailed submissions concerning your background and mitigating factors. I acknowledge that the Legal Aid Agency, while ultimately authorising representation for your defence, delayed approval on application for expert reports, a regrettable but increasingly familiar systemic issue that inevitably prolongs case progression. To provide some statutory context, the Theft Act 1968 remains the bedrock legislation governing offences of dishonest appropriation. I take note of the Sentencing Council’s overarching guidelines on theft offences, which emphasise patterns of offending, aggravating factors such as targeting vulnerable premises or repeat offending, and the impact on victims and communities. The judiciary is reminded, however, that sentencing must be individualised and weighted according to all relevant features of the conduct in question. The jurisprudence at appellate level offers further granularity in guiding sentencing discretion. R v. Cambridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1243 emphasised that although repeated low-value thefts might be dismissed in isolation, the aggregate harm—including impact on staff morale and small business viability—can warrant significant custodial sentences. Likewise, R v. Faulkner [2023] EWCA Crim 876 added that persistent disregard for prior warnings or diversion opportunities amplifies culpability. Various analogous decisions relating to offences across diverse contexts are apt illustrations of sentencing principles, though they should not be taken as direct precedential levers in your case. For example, R v. Chandler [2019] EWCA Crim 1054 — concerning fly-tipping on green belt land — reiterated the principle that persistent regulatory breaches, despite the ostensibly technical or victimless nature of the offences, may rightly attract custodial penalties to uphold public confidence and the rule of law. Similarly, R v. Westfield [2021] EWCA Crim 1578 in which an aggravated affray involving pool cues was heard, though unrelated to theft, serves to highlight the courts’ general disapproval of sustained antisocial conduct, irrespective of the specific domain. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. Attention must necessarily return to those specifics, for that is the relevant inquiry at hand. Before detailing the precise circumstances of the offending, I pause to note that co-defendant material introduced during the investigation revealed the presence of offences unrelated to your conduct, including an aggravated assault on a police officer involving a metal chair. While such evidence was not pertinent to your trial and conviction, it formed part of the background context within which the multi-agency investigation operated. The facts of this case must be considered in light of the evidence presented. You stand convicted on a single representative count, but one which captures a broader and more protracted pattern of theft and exploitation of retail staff and proprietors. The prosecution relied upon contemporaneous CCTV footage, staff accounts, forensic analysis of recovered merchandise, and the identifying link of clothing and footwear visible during several incidents. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. It is apparent that your conduct entailed deliberate planning and employed a combination of distraction techniques and concealment methods. Various reports from affected shop staff describe heightened stress levels, changes in shift patterns, and, in some cases, requests to employers for transfer or enhanced protective measures. While there was no direct intimidation or physical confrontation, the emotional impact on personnel is nonetheless tangible. I must observe that no investigations currently suggest your involvement in offences such as possession of bladed articles on school premises or drug dealing in proximity to youth hostels, despite some co-defendants in related matters facing such charges. Nor has any evidence linked you to incidents of criminal damage to public property, including graffiti on transport infrastructure or attacks upon religious institutions. These unrelated issues nevertheless emerged in communications between law enforcement agencies during multi-agency tasking meetings and exemplify the broader criminal ecology from which your case was ultimately distinguished. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. Let it also be recorded that one of the expert reports prepared for sentencing purposes was originally delayed due to your counsel’s application for adjournment to obtain family character references and letters of support from voluntary sector organisations. These include heartfelt communications from staff at the Hull Homeless Support Network and the East Yorkshire Community Foodbank, which were subsequently lodged with the court and considered alongside formal assessments. The court appreciates the work of those volunteers and professionals who provide such assistance to vulnerable individuals. Their commitment often absorbs substantial operational pressure, especially as local service capacity continues to be tested by rising demand. Their reliance on charitable donations and fluctuating volunteer staff cannot be understated. It is a significant societal challenge that, regrettably, impacts the rehabilitation prospects of many who come before the court. It is also necessary to acknowledge ongoing pressures on police resources, which must be apportioned between serious and less-serious crime. The disproportionate demand placed by frequent, repeated retail theft can detract attention from investigations into violent offences or gang-related activity. This reality is no reflection on the diligence of frontline officers, but an unavoidable consequence of constrained budgets and rising caseloads. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. It is germane to mention here the recent Court of Appeal decision in R v. Drax [2025] EWCA Crim 314, which, while concerned with a charge of benefit fraud committed by a defendant unrelated to the present proceedings, reiterates the courts’ overarching duty to consider previous offending, continuation or escalation of conduct, and prospect of reform when determining appropriate sentence. Records before the court reveal that you have previous convictions related to theft offences stretching back over a decade, including two separate community orders and a conditional discharge imposed in 2021 following a similar pattern of shoplifting in the East Riding area. That your offending has persisted despite these interventions evidences a concerning record of recidivism. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. The psychiatric report prepared by Dr Amanda Forster, consultant forensic psychologist, assesses you as not suffering from any major mental disorder. However, she notes traits suggestive of impulsivity and low frustration tolerance. She also comments on your expressed feelings of social marginalisation and financial instability. Dr Forster recommended consideration of a structured cognitive-behavioural treatment programme tailored to acquisitive offending, though she expressed reservations about your current engagement with supportive services. The pre-sentence report dated 10 September 2025 reflects similar themes. The author notes your lack of stable employment and housing, intermittent contact with family members, and a history of substance misuse. It further references your refusal to engage meaningfully with debt counselling or budgeting support, despite multiple offers. I must register concern regarding these findings. There is a widening gap between the availability of assistance—ranging from charity sector support to statutory programmes—and the willingness or capacity of some offenders to access them. This gap undermines the effectiveness of rehabilitative efforts and poses a risk to public protection. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. During the hearing, the court received letters from the Hull Business Crime Alliance, a collective of local enterprises committed to reducing retail crime impact. They detailed economic losses related to your offences, as well as the psychological strain on frontline retail staff. Their submissions, while measured, were clear in asserting that repeat shoplifting is corrosive to local commerce and community safety. The court extends gratitude to this body for their informed and conscientious contributions. General societal context cannot be ignored. We live in a time marked by increased visibility of street homelessness—where rough sleeping has become commonplace on city thoroughfares and underpasses—and a rising tide of antisocial behaviour that, if unchecked, intensifies community fears. While these issues do not excuse criminal offending, they constitute a complex matrix within which police, probation, and social services operate. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. It is also noted with concern that in the course of the investigation, your landlord was subject to a noise abatement notice relating to disturbances unrelated to your behaviour. This circumstance, while tangential, illustrates the multi-layered challenges faced by social housing providers in maintaining secure and peaceful living environments. The court is guided primarily by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences. Clear aggravating factors in this case include persistence despite prior warnings and orders, the impact on vulnerable businesses, and the calculated nature of your actions. While your guilty plea is recognised, its timing—late in the proceedings following the near certainty of conviction—limits the extent of credit available. This approach aligns with established principles articulated in R v. Kyriazis [2023] EWCA Crim 470, where the Court confirmed that timing, not mere entry, of a plea informs the quantum of reduction. I remind the parties of the court’s responsibility to impose sentences proportionate to the conduct while balancing the need for deterrence, public confidence, and rehabilitation. Custodial sentences in theft cases of this sort are reserved for serious or persistent offending where community-based penalties are insufficient to protect the public or reduce reoffending. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. I record that today’s sentencing hearing has been conducted in open court with the benefit of thorough preparation by counsel on both sides. I extend thanks to Ms Sarah Linton, prosecuting counsel, for her clear presentation, and to Mr Alan Greensdale, who represented you with due professionalism. I reiterate concern over procedural delays encountered during these proceedings, particularly those attributable to the Legal Aid Agency’s slow authorisation of expert instruction. These lapses hinder the efficient administration of justice and impose avoidable burdens on all participants. Accordingly, I order that a further pre-sentence report be commissioned. This report should encompass consideration of all viable sentencing options, including community sentences incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements and potential unpaid work, balanced with an assessment of risk to the public. Consideration should also be given to any structured programme addressing impulsivity and financial management, should you engage accordingly. Pending receipt and consideration of that report, sentencing will be adjourned. A date will be fixed to resume these proceedings in due course. These sentencing remarks have been delivered and recorded this 15th day of September 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Hull. The transcript has been duly certified and filed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. You are reminded of your right to appeal against sentence within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions imposed under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON R v. MR H Case No. T2025/14537 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge B. L. Pennington Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of offences of theft from retail premises committed over a substantial period extending from late 2023 through to the spring of 2025. These offences, all of which fall under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, involved a variety of locations across the Brighton and Hove area, including several independent stores and well-known chain outlets. Procedural History and Case Progression Your case has made its way through the criminal justice system over several months, with an initial appearance at the Brighton Magistrates' Court on 18 February 2025. During that hearing, the prosecution formalised charges based on a representative count, consolidating multiple incidents into a single indictment for efficient trial management in the Crown Court. The transfer was subject to the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, as set out under Practice Direction 51Z, which aims to expedite proceedings and facilitate early identification of issues for trial. Early hearings took place on 20 March and 15 April, respectively. There were minor delays attributable in part to the defence’s outstanding application for Legal Aid and the securing of funding to instruct an independent psychiatric evaluation. These administrative matters are unfortunate but emblematic of the systemic pressures now pervasive within publicly funded legal representation. The Legal Aid Agency’s performance, regrettably, has once again contributed to a degree of procedural inertia. Mr H’s counsel raised the necessity of instructing Dr Karen Simmons, a forensic psychologist with expertise in acquisitive offending and impulse control disorders. Initial correspondence from the defence solicitor dated 21 March 2025 was met with protracted delays—approvals not granted until mid-April despite multiple follow-ups. Such delays inevitably impede timely and thorough preparation and are a cause of considerable frustration across the judiciary. The court records its unease with this recurring theme, one that appears systemic rather than exceptional. Meanwhile, the police investigation that precipitated these proceedings was notable for its multi-agency dimension. Alongside officers from the Sussex Police, the Brighton and Hove Business Crime Reduction Partnership and local council enforcement teams coordinated efforts to monitor repeated theft occurrences. The intelligence unit’s scrutiny encompassed cross-referencing CCTV footage with loss prevention reports, an exercise made all the more challenging by the transient nature of some offending patterns. This operation was resource-intensive and extended over several months, relying heavily on regional surveillance infrastructure and painstaking manual collation of evidence. The digital forensic analysis requisitioned to verify the defendant’s involvement was carried out by officers within the Sussex Police Cybercrime Unit, whose workloads in the past year have escalated markedly owing to burgeoning demands in the areas of fraud and cyber-enabled crime. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the professionalism of the court staff involved in listing and the courtroom ushers, whose roles in maintaining procedural decorum and assisting all participants are often underappreciated. The refurbishment of Courtroom 5, completed earlier this year, provides an environment conducive to the dignified conduct of proceedings, which is no small matter given the gravity of the judicial task. The BCM listing on 15 April included an initial plea and trial preparation hearing. The defence initially entered a not guilty plea. However, in view of compelling evidence assembled by the Crown, a plea change to guilty was tendered on the morning of the trial scheduled for 13 June 2025. It is regrettable that the plea change came at this late juncture. The court is mindful of established precedent, including R v. King [2019] EWCA Crim 251, which reaffirms that credit for guilty pleas is contingent upon their timeliness and the degree to which they save court time and spare witnesses from the ordeal of testifying. Late pleas, especially those effected after the close of the prosecution case or on the eve of trial, attract markedly reduced sentence discounts. Analogy may be found in R v. Heaton [2022] EWCA Crim 458, a matter concerning residential burglary, where the Court of Appeal underscored that last-minute pleas often cannot be regarded as indicative of genuine remorse but rather of tactical acceptance of the inevitable verdict. Though factually different, the principle that late pleas carry diminished mitigation is firmly embedded in our sentencing framework and applies equally here. In the area of sentencing law, recent decisions have increasingly emphasized the need to balance punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation. The Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences, issued in 2017 and subsequently amended, provides a structured approach, identifying harm (both economic and psychological), culpability, and mitigating circumstances. The guideline advises particular attention to repeat offending patterns and the impact on victims, staff, and community confidence. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. It must be acknowledged that while the value of goods taken may appear modest individually, the cumulative detriment in cases like this is substantial. The loss suffered by small businesses, which often operate with narrow margins and limited security resources, extends beyond mere financial cost to include disruptions in staffing, increased vigilance, and in some cases closure of local services. In the present case, the prosecution relied heavily on a series of coded store incident reports and amassed digital evidence showing your involvement, cross-linked through time-stamped video footage and witness testimony. Store managers, while endeavouring to maintain a professional bearing, expressed concerns over the repeated intrusions and the toll on staff morale. Some employees altered working patterns to avoid lone working during hours when you were observed frequenting premises. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. This pattern of persistent targeting is of particular importance when considering the risk you pose to the community. Unlike isolated incidents borne of momentary lapses, repeated acquisitive offending by one individual signals an entrenched behavioural pattern less amenable to spontaneous reform. This echoes guidance articulated in R v. Blackmore [2020] EWCA Crim 1089, where repeat offending and failure to engage with rehabilitative services militated against non-custodial outcomes. It is well understood that the modern Crown Court performs a multifaceted function: an arena not only for the determination of liability but also for the calibration of proportionate responses to crime that balance the needs of justice, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. Your case presents a familiar tableau in this respect, where the apparently low-level nature of the theft belies broader issues of social integration and personal stability. The probation service has been engaged since the adjournment for assessment in late July. Their detailed Pre-Sentence Report, compiled by Officer Laura Jennings, provides valuable insights into your personal circumstances, history, and prospects for rehabilitation. The report notes your current status as 34 years old, with a history of precarious housing and intermittent employment in the restaurant sector. It also references a prior conviction for shoplifting dated 2021, for which a conditional discharge was imposed. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. The report flags a history of non-engagement with support services and reservations about existing charitable assistance. It further highlights an absence of any significant mental health diagnosis, although traits consistent with low impulse control and situational stress are noted. Dr Simmons’ forensic psychological evaluation, submitted contemporaneously, corroborates these findings, observing that while you exhibit no formal psychiatric disorder, certain cognitive-behavioural vulnerabilities may underlie the offending pattern. The court is conscious of the well-documented pressures on community mental health services, the often-lengthy waiting lists for specialist interventions, and the uneven availability of tailored programmes for offenders like yourself. NHS England’s recent Annual Mental Health Report (2024) emphasises the need for early identification and intervention in cases where psychological vulnerabilities intersect with criminal conduct to mitigate reoffending risks. While the court sympathizes with systemic challenges, it must also recognise that limited service capacity cannot excuse or diminish culpable behaviour. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. Turning to the impact on the victims, written submissions were provided by the Brighton Independent Retailers’ Association, which represents a number of shops affected by your offending conduct. Their letter conveys the cumulative strain endured, including the necessity for additional security measures and the erosion of goodwill in the wider business community. There is particular mention of the strain placed upon small pharmacy staff, some of whom reported feelings of vulnerability and distress, citing the normalisation of harassment in the workplace as a broader societal issue. The Retail Support Network, a voluntary sector organisation specialising in victim support in acquisitive crime cases, has supplemented these accounts with its own observations. Their workers have been assisting affected employees since early 2025, providing emotional support and guidance on workplace safety measures. While their remit is not to influence sentencing, the court acknowledges their professional commitment in a sector under increasing pressure. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. It is worthwhile to note that this case-of-concern occurs within a wider national context of increasing load on police and public services arising from what are sometimes termed “volume crimes.” The Home Office Crime Statistics Report (2024) indicates that theft-related offences have risen marginally in most urban venues, with shoplifting constituting a significant component. This places front-line officers under sustained pressure, frequently detracting resources from serious and violent crime investigation. As with many areas of public services, the phenomenon is compounded by social issues such as homelessness and substance misuse. For example, reports from the Brighton Homeless Outreach Team indicate that street-level begging and rough sleeping have climbed substantially over the past two years, straining local emergency accommodation and care provisions. While such factors are not causative per se, they provide important background context for the court’s evaluation of offenders embedded within these environments. In the ancillary case law, reference may also be made to R v. Wiseman [2018] EWCA Crim 976, wherein the Court of Appeal considered the interplay between socio-economic hardship and persistent offending. The judgment has been cited in numerous subsequent cases underscoring the principle that while hardship may explain conduct, it does not excuse it. Agencies and courts alike are urged to adopt a holistic approach, incorporating rehabilitative opportunities alongside necessary punitive responses. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. It is pertinent to mention that no allegation of violence, intimidation, or threat was connected to your offending behaviour. The pattern exhibits calculated, non-violent acquisitive crime. Nevertheless, the normalisation of theft in certain communities has been identified by the Brighton Safer Neighbourhood Board as a concerning trend, linked to disaffection and fragmented social supports. In a very different context, the Court of Appeal in R v. Deacon [2023] EWCA Crim 334 examined an offending course involving assault and public disorder, highlighting the need for proportionate punishment tailored to offence gravity and public interest. That case underscores, by contrast, the relative distinctiveness of non-violent theft offences, even as it reinforces the need for deterrence and community protection as elements of sentencing. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. The breadth of the evidence demonstrates a degree of forethought, consistency, and repeat engagement in offending episodes, which militates against leniency solely on the basis of a lack of violence. Your conduct caused measurable disruption and distress, impacting not only the commercial operators directly but the stability of service provision in affected areas. In relation to other matters, it is noted the court has received correspondence from your family, including a letter from your elder sister, Ms Emily H., who expresses concern for your welfare and urges the court to consider your background and need for appropriate support as part of sentencing. While these representations are appreciated, it is for the court to assess all material factors, including risk and culpability, in arriving at a just and proportionate outcome. Adjacent to your case, the court has been apprised of an incident involving a co-defendant, Mr L., who is not before this court today. It is on record that Mr L. absconded from police supervision and is currently subject to active warrant for arrest. That individual’s conduct, which involved violent disorder at a separate location, has no bearing on your culpability and should not be conflated with your case. Similarly, other unrelated events have delayed court listings. For instance, an arson incident affecting Court 4 on 22 September 2025 necessitated a temporary suspension of proceedings and relocation of hearings to ancillary rooms. Such events are regrettable but underscore the unpredictability of court operations during periods of transient emergency. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. For completeness, the Probation Service’s assessment has noted the absence of gang affiliation or links to organised crime, which differentiates your profile from certain acquisitive offenders known to regional enforcement units. There is also no evidence of coercion or exploitation by third parties, which sometimes complicates matters in cases involving vulnerable individuals. Having regard to the statutory purposes of sentencing under the Sentencing Act 2020, including punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection, the court must carefully weigh your personal circumstances alongside the gravity of the offences and wider societal impact. Your antecedents show a propensity for repeat offending, and your engagements with support services have been, at best, intermittent. The late guilty plea, although welcome, offers limited mitigation given its timing on the eve of trial. Your co-operation is noted, but the court maintains the principle that early acceptance of responsibility is the most effective means of earning sentence discount. Community-based options remain under consideration. The Pre-Sentence Report explores the feasibility of a Suspended Sentence Order incorporating requirements such as unpaid work and attendance at a Cognitive Skills programme specifically targeted at acquisitive offending. The assessment notes some ongoing housing instability, which may affect the practicality of community sanctions; such factors will be considered further upon sentence. Courts must also send a clear message that repeated theft undermines community safety and damages the social fabric. The economic impact on small retailers and the psychological toll on front-line staff are real and deserving of respect. Where offences exhibit systematic planning, persistence, and disregard for repeated interventions, custodial sentences cannot be excluded. Before concluding, I must acknowledge the diligent efforts of Ms Claire Montgomery, prosecuting counsel, and Mr Neil Fraser, representing the defence through Legal Aid. Their advocacy has been thorough and professional. These sentencing remarks are issued this 14th day of October 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Brighton. A full transcript has been recorded by the court reporter in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentence will be deferred pending receipt of the finalised Pre-Sentence Report. The defendant is hereby advised of the right of appeal within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged pursuant to Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",

        "input": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM R v. MR H Case No. B2025/17509 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. D. HAMPTON Filed: 12 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence upon a charge relating to theft, specifically multiple counts of shoplifting committed over an extended period within the Birmingham metropolitan area. The conduct to which you have pleaded guilty falls within the ambit of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, involving the dishonest appropriation of goods from retail premises with the intent to permanently deprive. The offending stretches from the summer of 2023 until early 2025, reflecting a protracted course of conduct and a pattern of offending that merits careful consideration. Procedural Background The proceedings in this matter have been subject to a number of interlocutory steps and adjournments, not atypical in cases of this nature but nonetheless producing inevitable delay and inconvenience. You were initially arrested on 15 March 2025, after a detailed investigation undertaken by the West Midlands Police Retail Crime Unit, in conjunction with the Birmingham Business Crime Partnership. This multi-agency collaboration, aimed at tackling persistent acquisitive offending across commercial premises, has become emblematic of the contemporary prosecutorial approach to such matters. The investigation entailed the collation and review of extensive CCTV footage, witness statements from retail staff, and the analysis of stock loss reports over the relevant period. It has long been observed within the judiciary that the challenge of prosecuting low-value theft offences lies not merely in evidential assembly but in navigating the broader societal context in which such behaviour occurs. The resources expended on investigations, the impact upon retail staff morale, and the knock-on consequences for local economies deserve acknowledgment, even as the offences themselves may appear minor in isolation. The court notes that this case benefited from a relatively smooth progression through the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, notwithstanding a regrettable delay occasioned by a protracted Legal Aid funding application relating to expert psychiatric assessment. Indeed, the Legal Aid Agency in this matter demonstrated a regrettably familiar recalcitrance. The application, submitted in early May 2025, underwent multiple requests for clarification before eventual approval was granted only in late July, causing a postponement in the preparation of your defence and the timely provision of requisite reports. Such administrative inefficiencies have become an unfortunate average rather than an exception and impose strain not only on defendants and their representatives but also on the courts and prosecutors striving to provide expedient justice. I am grateful to the prosecution advocate, Ms Jennifer Lomas, and to your counsel, Mr Peter Carver, both of whom have conducted themselves with professionalism throughout these proceedings. I must, however, reiterate judicial concern about systemic delays that undermine both the speedy administration and the perceived legitimacy of the justice system. In adopting this view, it is timely to reflect on the evolving jurisprudence relating to guilty pleas. The court acknowledges the general principle that early admission of guilt merits significant credit, recognising the benefit not only to the public purse but also to victims and witnesses spared the distress of contested hearings. This position is well supported by case precedent, including the ruling in R v. Westly [2020] EWCA Crim 251, which emphasises that such credit is a matter of judicial discretion contingent upon the timing and sincerity of the plea. It is prudential to note that late pleas, though entitled to some concession, attract significantly reduced mitigation where entered only in the face of overwhelming evidence. Against this backdrop, your plea, entered just prior to the trial window opening, earns modest credit commensurate with these principles. The Theft Act 1968 has undergone little substantive amendment with respect to standard shoplifting offences, but sentencing practice, guidelines, and court approaches have evolved considerably. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences underscores the significance of the offence’s circumstances, offender culpability, and the wider impact on victims, including economic loss, emotional harm, and consequential disruption. Aggravating factors include repeated offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, or exploitation of circumstance. Mitigating factors may include genuine remorse, early plea, personal circumstances such as mental health difficulties, or demonstrable steps towards rehabilitation. I also take note of relevant appellate authorities including R v. Draper [2023] EWCA Crim 577, where the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant convicted of multiple counts of shoplifting involving distraction offences at supermarket tills. The sentencing judge’s comments on the need to send a deterrent message to curtail similar offending were endorsed notwithstanding the modest overall end value of the items stolen. It is the function of this court to weigh these factors against the impact of your conduct and the interests of justice generally. This case is further contextualised by observations drawn from the broader criminal justice environment. The West Midlands region continues to experience significant pressure on policing resources, particularly in relation to acquisitive crime. The well-documented rise in street homelessness, noted in recent reports by Housing First Midlands, further compounds these challenges, as individuals experiencing unstable housing often become entangled with the criminal justice system through low-level offences. While the court expresses no direct finding on your personal housing status at this juncture, it recognises that social marginalisation remains a backdrop to many such cases. As an aside, the court is aware of an unrelated ongoing investigation concerning your estranged cousin, currently before the Birmingham Magistrates' Court, on charges of benefit fraud. That matter is distinct and bears no influence on your sentencing here. The facts of the case may be outlined as follows: Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. The investigation unearthed a consistent modus operandi involving entering stores during peak hours, often coinciding with staff shift changes. Your use of concealment methods, including bags and clothing layering, was deliberate and practiced. On four separate visits within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same small shop and stole alcohol and tobacco products. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. Moreover, the evidence demonstrated a disregard for warnings issued by shop security personnel and several community resolutions offered in earlier incidents, which you failed to comply with or learn from. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. The court has before it several victim personal statements from retail staff employed at various affected premises. Their accounts speak of a sustained atmosphere of unease, with some victims requiring time off work due to stress. One manager describes the need to rearrange staffing patterns and invest further in loss prevention measures, thereby diverting resources from customer service to security functions. These consequences, while perhaps unseen by many in the public, are real and detrimental. The cumulative costs—both financial and psychological—are undermined by persistent theft of this nature. The court also received correspondence from the Birmingham Retail Workers’ Union, outlining ongoing concerns about staff safety in the face of repeated shoplifting incidents. While no physical violence was reported in your case, the constant threat contributes to workplace anxiety and decreased morale. An extensive psychiatric report prepared by Dr Helena Strauss, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed upon the request of the defence, merits particular attention. Dr Strauss’s assessment, completed in August 2025, found no evidence of severe mental illness. However, it identifies moderate traits of impulse control disorder and mild alcohol dependence, neither of which meets the threshold for sentencing mitigation but are noted as factors potentially contributing to your behaviour. Dr Strauss’s report states, and I quote: “While there is no diagnosable major psychiatric disorder impinging upon criminal responsibility, the defendant exhibits an underlying difficulty in managing gratification impulses, exacerbated in circumstances of social stress and isolation. Engagement with appropriate interventions, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy aimed at impulse regulation, could be favorable in reducing the likelihood of future offending.” It is important to acknowledge such professional observations, which assist the court in balancing the need for punishment with the prospects for rehabilitation. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. The court pauses to note that the case was briefly delayed due to the exigencies of national strike action affecting court clerks and ancillary staff in late June 2025. While not directly attributable to any party, such interruptions are symptomatic of a wider climate of judicial resource scarcity. Furthermore, this courtroom has recently undergone refurbishment, including improved digital evidence presentation facilities, allowing for more efficient and comprehensible evidence handling—a development welcomed by all participants. The Probation Service, represented by Mr David Kent, has confirmed capacity pressures within offender assessment teams in the West Midlands, with average waiting times for pre-sentence reports now extended to six weeks. This unfortunate reality must be factored into any scheduling and sentencing timelines. Aside from your particular case, this court recalls precedent set in R v. Grayson [2019] EWCA Crim 334, which concerned theft of copper cabling from a rail depot. Though factually dissimilar, the Court of Appeal’s analysis on cumulative impact and community disruption remains pertinent. Turning again to case progression, it is acknowledged that your initial plea of not guilty required a trial listing. However, following further evidence disclosure, your ultimate admission reflects, at least in part, recognition of the inevitability of conviction. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. Sentencing in theft cases must be proportionate and take into account the personal circumstances of the offender, harm caused, culpability, and the public interest. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines articulate a range of starting points and suggest community penalties as appropriate for less serious and isolated incidents. However, repeated offending, especially with a degree of planning and lack of remorse, may justify custodial sentences. The availability and suitability of ancillary orders such as community rehabilitation orders, unpaid work requirements, and accredited cognitive skills programmes will be a focal point of the pre-sentence report. It is also pertinent to consider the potential for restorative justice interventions, which might offer a constructive avenue for victim-offender engagement and reparation. Your previous convictions include theft-related offences, with limited engagement in rehabilitative programming previously. The circumstances of this offending, coupled with your personal and social background, indicate a risk of reoffending absent meaningful intervention. The court remains alert to issues of mental health vulnerability, housing insecurity, and social exclusion, which often intersect in cases of this nature. Nevertheless, the judicial role is to hold individuals accountable within the framework of the law, applying mitigating factors on their true weight but not excusing persistent dishonesty. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. Accordingly, I direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report to explore bespoke sentencing options, the viability of community measures, and any necessary support to address underlying contributory factors. The court hopes that your solicitors will cooperate fully with probation authorities to ensure the timely completion of reports. These remarks are issued this 12th day of September 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal against conviction or sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions in place under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. These are the orders of the court.",
