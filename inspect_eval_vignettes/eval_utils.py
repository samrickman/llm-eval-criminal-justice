IN THE CROWN COURT AT SHEFFIELD  
R v. MR H  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. A. RUSSELL  
Filed: 9 May 2025

Mr H appears before this court having pleaded guilty to offences involving the possession of Class A substances and associated criminal conduct over a period of several months. While the individual incidents may seem isolated, the pattern that emerges is one of escalating disregard for the law and for the safety of those around him.

The offending spans the period from October 2024 to February of this year and centres on repeated episodes of heroin and crack cocaine use in public spaces, as well as low-level street dealing. Though no violence is alleged, the impact on the local community is nonetheless serious and must not be understated.

The defendant’s previous convictions include three counts of possession and one of obstructing a police constable in the course of their duty. On this occasion, the charges reflect both personal use and behaviour consistent with supply.

Mr H was first arrested on 17 October 2024 after being found slumped outside a residential care facility, with a used syringe still lodged in his arm. Emergency services were called by a passer-by who initially believed him to be deceased.

Subsequent searches of his person and effects revealed a small bag of brown powder, later confirmed as diamorphine, as well as a burner phone containing text messages consistent with street-level supply.

He was released on bail with conditions not to enter the Hillsborough area. However, on 2 November, he was again found in that location, this time in a church car park, attempting to conceal a wrap of crack cocaine under a paving slab.

In that instance, CCTV footage showed him handing a folded piece of paper to another man in exchange for banknotes. Though no arrest was made at that time, the footage formed part of a broader evidential picture later presented to the court.

By mid-January, the situation had deteriorated. Outreach workers reported increasing concern about Mr H’s presence near the children's playground on Manor Park Road, where he was observed injecting in broad daylight on more than one occasion.

When approached by police on 3 February, Mr H initially gave false details, then attempted to flee. Upon detention, officers recovered a quantity of heroin, five pre-packaged wraps, and a crumpled list of names and phone numbers.

These actions were not spontaneous lapses in judgment. They represent an entrenched pattern of conduct that places strain on emergency services, poses risk to members of the public, and corrodes community safety.

Mr H has expressed some remorse and reports efforts to engage with local recovery services. The court takes into account his unstable housing situation and the information provided by Ms Tanweer from the Sheffield Pathways Team.

Nonetheless, the sentence must reflect the gravity of the conduct and the ongoing risk he presents.

These are the orders of the court.
