IN THE CROWN COURT AT CAMDEN  
R v. MARTIN CLIVE SUTTON  
Case No. T2025/09782  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. D. MCALLISTER  
Filed: 12 June 2025  

Mr Martin Clive Sutton, you appear before this court for sentencing in relation to a sustained course of dishonesty involving multiple counts of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences span a period from late 2022 to early 2025 and were primarily committed in and around the Camden and Islington boroughs.

Procedural History  
You were arrested on 3 February 2025 following a joint investigation by local neighbourhood policing teams and the Camden Business Crime Reduction Partnership. The investigation was triggered by a pattern of repeated low-value thefts targeting the same chain of stores — primarily budget supermarkets and pharmacy outlets — which had recorded multiple incidents involving a male matching your description. Several of these incidents had been logged with CCTV footage and store security logs, but only recently were cross-referenced to build a fuller picture.
This, regrettably, is often the reality in such cases. What appears at first glance to be a petty, isolated incident may in fact be part of a broader pattern — but establishing that pattern requires painstaking collation of footage, manual cross-checking of dates, and endless liaison between under-resourced police teams and exhausted retail managers. I have said it before and will say it again: the idea that CCTV is some panacea for retail crime is a fiction clung to by those who have never had to sit through six hours of grainy footage in search of a ten-second frame. Cameras are plentiful; usable evidence is not. Faces are obscured, timestamps misaligned, and coverage often breaks at precisely the moment it matters.
And yet, despite these obstacles, we continue to ask front-line officers to devote disproportionate time to crimes which, on paper, are “minor.” It is not uncommon for the police to prepare hundreds of pages of disclosure, chase down partially legible receipts, and interview staff who have long since moved on — all in pursuit of recovering items worth less than a weekly bus pass. That such resources must be expended is not a criticism of those who investigate, but rather a lament for a system that has become reactive, overloaded, and increasingly reliant on private retailers to build the evidential scaffolding for prosecutions. It is no wonder that many stores now decline to report thefts altogether unless violence or high value is involved. That is a troubling but understandable development.

On 6 February, you were interviewed under caution. You initially denied any involvement, but forensic examination of seized clothing — including a distinctive maroon jacket seen in several security videos — provided corroborative evidence. You were formally charged on 19 February with twelve counts of shop theft, later consolidated into a single representative charge. The matter was transferred to this court under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol and listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing.

The BCM process, as this court often notes, is intended to streamline case progression and ensure that evidential clarity is reached early in proceedings. It is worth observing that in this instance, cooperation between retailers, borough policing units, and the Camden Safer Neighbourhood Board enabled a more coherent approach than we sadly see in many similar cases. The case management hearings proceeded in accordance with the indicative timeframes under the Criminal Procedure Rules, and I thank all parties for their diligence.

A plea hearing was held on 21 March. At that stage, you entered a not guilty plea. However, following service of further CCTV evidence, staff statements, and a forensic match on recovered items, you have now entered a guilty plea.  

Late guilty pleas in retail theft cases are an increasingly common feature of this court’s docket. While defendants are entitled to test the strength of the Crown’s case, the systemic impact of such delay cannot be ignored. The credit regime exists not merely as an incentive but as a recognition of remorse and procedural efficiency. A defendant who pleads guilty at the first opportunity — before evidence is assembled and witnesses are put on notice — may expect greater credit than one who does so only when conviction appears inevitable. As stated in R v. McArdle [2021] EWCA Crim 2014, the aim is not to penalise procedural rights, but to reward meaningful cooperation.

Although the facts of McArdle — which concerned large-scale vehicle fraud — differ markedly from the present case, the principle remains applicable. McArdle held that “the timing of the plea, not just its entry, forms the core of judicial discretion in awarding credit.” This court applies that principle here.

I am mindful of the guidance offered in R v. Dacres [2021] EWCA Crim 1331, a case concerning aggravated burglary in the East Midlands, where the defendant entered a residential property at night while the occupants slept. Although the burglary involved no actual violence, the court held that the invasion of personal space — particularly during hours of rest — carried a significant psychological toll. The Court of Appeal upheld a five-year custodial sentence, emphasising that the sense of violation experienced by victims can outweigh the material value of stolen goods. While the factual matrix differs from the present case, Dacres is a useful reminder of how non-violent property offences may nonetheless warrant substantial sentences when public confidence in personal security is undermined.
I also note the case of R v. Troughton [2020] EWCA Crim 711, which concerned the possession of Class B substances with intent to supply within 500 metres of a secondary school. The defendant, a 22-year-old with no prior convictions, was apprehended with individually wrapped cannabis packages and a burner phone containing messages indicative of low-level dealing. The sentencing judge imposed a custodial term of 18 months, reduced on appeal to 12 months in recognition of youth and early guilty plea. The Court nevertheless reiterated the aggravating feature of proximity to educational settings. Although this case is clearly distinguishable from the present matter, it is instructive in demonstrating how location and contextual harm can elevate the seriousness of otherwise routine offences.
Further reference may be made to R v. Linley [2018] EWCA Crim 1944, a prosecution under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The defendant was convicted of operating an unlicensed waste disposal site on the outskirts of Swindon, where hazardous materials — including asbestos and solvents — were stored and later burned in breach of multiple regulations. The Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of two years’ imprisonment, noting the flagrant disregard for public health and the environmental impact on surrounding farmland. While entirely unrelated to the facts of the current case, Linley serves as a pertinent reminder that regulatory offences, though often perceived as technical or victimless, can carry real and lasting harm to communities and ecosystems alike.
What each of these cases — disparate though they may be in subject matter — appears to share is a deeper malaise: a quiet but persistent erosion of civic responsibility. Whether it manifests in environmental degradation, the calculated distribution of harmful substances, or the repeated targeting of small businesses, the underlying theme is a growing indifference to the impact of one’s actions on others. There was once, not so long ago, a prevailing sense that certain lines were simply not crossed — not because of the risk of being caught, but because it was understood that one did not behave that way. Increasingly, that internal restraint seems absent.

It is not the court’s role to moralise, but neither can it ignore the context in which offending occurs. There is, I fear, a creeping normalisation of conduct that was once regarded as exceptional — a shrugging acquiescence to disorder, dishonesty, and casual harm. We are told this is the consequence of inequality, of unmet need, of systemic failure — and those explanations have merit. But explanation is not exoneration. There remains a distinction between hardship and opportunism, between vulnerability and entitlement. A society that ceases to expect basic standards of conduct from its members — or worse, treats such expectations as naïve — risks abdicating its claim to cohesion altogether. That, in the court’s view, is a decline far more dangerous than any individual offence.
Sentencing was initially listed for 5 May but adjourned at the defence’s request to obtain a psychiatric assessment. I am grateful to Ms Latifa Karim (probation officer) and Dr Ellis Chowdhury (consultant clinical psychologist) for their helpful input. I note with appreciation the assistance of Camden Retail Partnership in supplying victim impact statements from local store managers, outlining the broader economic and psychological impact of persistent theft on retail staff.

The hearing has been conducted in open court. It has long been a complaint among some members of the public that retail theft is not taken seriously, or that such offences are somehow “victimless.” Those who labour under this misapprehension would do well to speak to the shop assistants threatened with violence, the store owners forced to absorb losses, or the communities in which stores close altogether due to unmanageable shrinkage. This court cannot and does not trivialise such conduct. Nor does it accept the notion that poverty, however acute, provides carte blanche to commit crime.  

In any event, I record my thanks to Ms Farida Karim, who appears for the Crown, and to Mr Joshua Barnes, who appears for the defence under a representation order. I regret, however, the delays in securing Legal Aid funding for expert reports, which unnecessarily impeded the court’s ability to proceed earlier. The defence’s early application for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist was deferred repeatedly pending procedural clarifications, culminating in funding approval only by mid-April 2025. Such delays are regrettable, given their potential to impede defendants’ rights to a fair and timely hearing. This court notes ongoing calls for reform within the Legal Aid system to address systemic inefficiencies and restore practitioner confidence. This remains a systemic issue.

Legal Context  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. While shoplifting is sometimes prosecuted under fixed penalty regimes or treated summarily, a pattern of deliberate, repeated offending is rightly escalated.

The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences stresses the importance of context: targeting smaller or independent businesses, using accomplices, or causing distress to staff are all aggravating features. While the monetary value may be modest, the cumulative effect and intent remain highly relevant.

I also consider R v. Havers [2022] EWCA Crim 1602, where the defendant engaged in repeated thefts from charity shops and was found to have manipulated store layouts and distracted staff to facilitate his offences. There, a sentence of 10 months' immediate custody was upheld, with the court stressing the broader public impact of such behaviour.

While the charge before this court is singular, I must sentence you for the course of conduct it represents — a sustained pattern of opportunistic and calculated theft, conducted with a degree of planning.

Facts of the Offending  
The offences occurred at multiple locations and were spread across several months. CCTV footage shows you entering stores with empty bags or backpacks, often waiting until staff were engaged at tills before concealing items.

In some instances, your conduct was brazen: you were seen removing security tags and walking out while on the phone, suggesting a lack of concern about apprehension. On another occasion, you wore the same distinctive trainers visible in five separate incidents — an oversight that ultimately assisted the police in building their case.

This was not petty opportunism. The consistent modus operandi, targeting of specific aisles (often toiletries and over-the-counter medicines), and use of distraction techniques, suggests intent and experience. Staff at one pharmacy reported feeling anxious upon your return visits and altered rotas to avoid lone working during your usual hours.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}. {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

The impact on staff confidence and morale cannot be ignored. Victim impact statements note that some employees began locking certain shelves during shifts, while others reduced their hours. While no violence was used, your actions had consequences beyond financial loss.

The Crown also points out that despite previous community resolutions and diversion schemes, you returned to similar behaviour within months.

Expert and Risk Assessments  
Dr Chowdhury’s report concludes that while you do not suffer from a major psychiatric illness, you display traits consistent with impulsivity, low self-efficacy, and mild substance dependency. You attribute your actions to financial stress and unemployment, but have not engaged with support services that could mitigate those pressures. That, frankly, is galling. The court is well aware that there are individuals in this country — many of them in desperate circumstances — who would seize with both hands the sort of assistance you have declined. Food banks run by volunteers who give up their weekends; community centres scraping together funding to offer budgeting support, drop-in clinics, or emergency grants; housing advisers working under impossible caseloads to prevent evictions. These are finite resources, stretched beyond capacity, and it is nothing short of insulting when those same services are waved away by defendants who later seek to invoke hardship as mitigation.
It must be said plainly: the existence of support is not the same as its uptake. While barriers undoubtedly remain, the wilful refusal to engage with available help cannot be excused. Courts are not unsympathetic to poverty — but poverty is not a licence to steal, and indifference to the very mechanisms designed to alleviate hardship cannot be overlooked. If support is offered and consistently ignored, that speaks not to deprivation but to choice. And choices, unlike circumstances, carry consequences.

You are now 37 years old. You have four prior convictions for shoplifting and were most recently given a conditional discharge in 2022. You are not currently in employment and report living in temporary accommodation arranged by the local authority. There is no indication of gang involvement or coercion. You have declined offers of help from community liaison officers and made inconsistent claims regarding support from your family. This court is familiar with such narratives. Time and again, defendants point to childhood adversity, fractured relationships, or the perceived failings of parents and carers as the backdrop to their offending. And while no one disputes that early experience can shape later behaviour, it has become almost reflexive to locate the source of criminality somewhere in the family home. The legacy of the Troubled Families agenda — now much diminished but never truly gone — is a policy landscape where dysfunction is treated not just as a social condition but as a kind of hereditary defect. Courts are urged, implicitly or otherwise, to regard certain individuals as the inevitable product of their environment.

That framing, in my view, is deeply unhelpful. It invites deterministic thinking and erodes the concept of personal agency. More than that, it does a profound disservice to the thousands of people — many in far worse circumstances than your own — who manage to act with decency, restraint, and regard for others despite the adversity they face. To blame one’s family, however broken, is not explanation but evasion. And to suggest that upbringing alone accounts for criminal behaviour is to overlook the fundamental truth that adults are responsible for the choices they make. This court does not adjudicate childhoods; it considers offences and offenders. It is not for me to pass judgment on your relatives, your background, or your upbringing. My role is to determine what response best protects the public, deters reoffending, and reflects the seriousness of the conduct before the court. Who or what may be “at fault” is, in that respect, a secondary concern.

Sentencing Considerations  
This was a sustained course of acquisitive offending, marked by persistence, planning, and disregard for warnings or prior interventions. You targeted accessible and vulnerable premises, including one community-run pharmacy. While you did not use threats or violence, the cumulative harm — both emotional and economic — is real.

There are limited mitigating features. Your guilty plea, though late, is noted. You have some personal difficulties and are currently without stable housing. However, these do not excuse persistent theft, particularly in the context of repeated opportunities to desist.

At this stage, I will seek a pre-sentence report from your probation officer prior to determining sentence. I ask that all available options be considered, including participation in a Thinking Skills Programme, which is specifically designed to address offending-related cognition and decision-making. The court recognises the importance of tailoring community-based interventions to the individual’s criminogenic needs and pattern of offending. In addition to cognitive-behavioural approaches, I would ask that the probation service explore the suitability of structured support addressing financial instability, impulsivity, and any substance-related factors that may have contributed to your conduct. Options such as restorative justice referrals, debt management support, or a specialist pathway service (if available) may also be relevant, particularly in addressing underlying vulnerabilities. I make no finding at this stage as to appropriateness or likelihood of engagement, but I expect the report to outline any viable interventions capable of advancing both rehabilitation and public protection. I will adjourn for a short period to allow probation to assess whether a community-based intervention with a rehabilitation activity requirement and potential unpaid work could be structured in a way that offers a realistic prospect of compliance. The matter will return to this court once that assessment has been completed.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 4 July 2025, in Court 3 at the Crown Court at Camden. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration. The defendant is advised of their right to appeal within 28 days of this sentencing decision, in accordance with section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Unless otherwise ordered, the reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are not engaged. No further directions are made as to costs.  

These are the orders of the court.
