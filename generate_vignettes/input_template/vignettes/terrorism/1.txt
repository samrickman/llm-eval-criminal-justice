IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEEDS
R v. Mr H
Case No. L2025/21478
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. P. MACLEOD
Filed: 21 July 2025
Mr Mr H appears before this court for sentence on a single count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a single count of possessing an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct spans August 2022 to his arrest on 8 March 2025.
Mr H was arrested at 05:34 hours on Saturday 8 March 2025 when Counter Terrorism Policing North East executed a warrant at Flat 4, Brackenhurst Court, Woodhouse Lane. The warrant, issued under section 43B of the 2000 Act, was supported by Security Service intercept indicating that an encrypted “Element” account controlled from his IP address had exchanged files titled “sub-munitions_v3” with a foreign-hosted server known for extremist paraphernalia. Officers seized a desktop tower, four solid-state drives, a resin 3-D printer and several vacuum-sealed packages labelled “Model-Railway Gravel”.

The arrest closed Operation TIMBERGLASS, an investigation that blended traditional surveillance with emerging analytics. Investigators relied on pattern-of-life data harvested from street-lighting control nodes—mundane infrastructure whose telemetry revealed nightly power spikes in Mr H’s block, correlating with extended print jobs on the 3-D device. That correlation would not have been uncovered but for a doctoral student on placement at the National Data Exploitation Centre who, between proctoring coursework, wrote bespoke software to extract this information. It is fashionable to laud “innovation hubs”; less fashionable to fund them beyond pilot stage. Yet without that ad-hoc ingenuity, key evidence would have remained obscured in a sea of data.
Delays in decrypting Mr H’s Proton Mail archive necessitated two re-bails under section 47 of PACE. These delays stemmed from the requirement that the National Technical Assistance Centre obtain bespoke firmware exploits from an overseas partner—exploits whose classification, ironically, prohibits the Home Office from acknowledging their existence. Defence have suggested prejudice, but his legal team received rolling summaries as soon as secrecy constraints permitted. The court is satisfied that the delay, while regrettable, was unavoidable and properly managed.
A “Channel” referral had been made in February 2019 by a sixth-form history teacher when Mr H submitted an essay describing the “moral courage” of nineteenth-century political assassins and appended a stylised drawing of a pipe bomb. The panel discontinued the referral after he attended two mentoring sessions and expressed an interest in mechanical engineering. Hindsight invites criticism, but the court will not indulge it; early-intervention schemes operate on limited facts and cannot divine future intent. Those who now claim they “knew all along” should reflect on the frailty of ex post judgement.
A plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 14 June 2025. Mr H pleaded not guilty and maintained that stance throughout the jury selection process. Only after this court ruled admissible the telemetry from his remotely piloted aircraft did he enter guilty pleas on the morning of 20 July. The lateness is significant. As the Court of Appeal reminded us in R v. Tolson [2024] EWCA Crim 2388, the utilitarian benefit of a plea diminishes rapidly once court resources have been mobilised and witnesses warned.
Late pleas must, therefore, be met with calibrated credit. In R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440—the so-called “dark-web weapons” prosecution—the defendant shifted plea only after the Crown adduced expert testimony on polymer-lower receivers. The Court accepted a reduction of no more than one-eighth. That reasoning applies here.
The boundaries of judicial discretion in awarding credit for guilty pleas were considered in detail in R v. Tinsley [2023] EWCA Crim 1401, a matter arising from a violent residential burglary in the South East Circuit. Mr Tinsley had forced entry into the home of an 81-year-old widower shortly after midnight, having armed himself with a length of copper piping and obscured his face with a scarf. The victim, roused by the noise, attempted to reach his landline telephone but was struck repeatedly and sustained defensive injuries to his arms and jaw. Despite the presence of compelling evidence—namely, a footprint match on the hallway carpet, partial DNA retrieved from the scarf, and geolocation data placing the defendant’s mobile at the scene—Mr Tinsley maintained a plea of not guilty for almost a year. Over that period, the complainant passed away from unrelated health complications, thereby depriving the court of his oral testimony. Only after the dismissal of an application to exclude the digital evidence—on grounds the defence themselves failed to particularise—did Mr Tinsley alter his plea on the morning of trial.
The sentencing judge, in light of the clear delay and strategic posturing, awarded a reduction in sentence of just 10 per cent. That approach was challenged on appeal, where counsel argued that the defendant had “finally accepted responsibility” and should be afforded greater recognition for sparing court time. The Court of Appeal firmly rejected that proposition, endorsing the judge’s conclusion that a plea entered at the point of tactical collapse is not a plea of genuine remorse but one of expedience. The judgment affirmed the principle that timing and context are not peripheral but central: a guilty plea is not a procedural token to be played when convenient, but an act of acknowledgment whose timing speaks directly to its authenticity.
A related consideration arose in R v. Ellison [2022] EWCA Crim 1176, a case concerning the concealed transport of controlled drugs within a repurposed courier van. Mr Ellison, then aged 35, was intercepted while attempting to board a cross-channel ferry at Dover. A routine search revealed hidden compartments containing over 9kg of high-purity cocaine and a further 4kg of compressed heroin, concealed beneath false flooring panels. The van, registered in his cousin’s name, had been fitted with elaborate concealments at a rented lock-up in Croydon—an address also linked to the defendant by bank card usage and CCTV. Although the Criminal Procedure Rules imposed early disclosure obligations, Mr Ellison made no substantive comment in interview and served no defence statement. On the first morning of trial, he entered a plea—purportedly on a “limited basis”—suggesting he had been a dupe unaware of the illicit cargo. That claim was swiftly discredited during a Newton hearing when it emerged that, just days prior to arrest, Mr Ellison had searched online for “van panel false floor police dog check.”
The sentencing judge imposed a 14-year custodial sentence, allowing only minimal credit in light of the defendant’s posture throughout. That sentence was appealed on the grounds of disproportionality and procedural unfairness, but the Court of Appeal declined to interfere. In doing so, it reiterated that credit for plea is not a mere arithmetic formula but a matter of evaluative judgment. Where a plea is delayed, opportunistic, and devoid of sincere contrition, it fails to meet the rationale that underpins credit—namely, acknowledgment of guilt, reduction of court burden, and minimisation of witness distress.
Though the factual matrices in Tinsley and Ellison differ materially from the present case, their underlying principle applies with equal force: the utility of a plea lies not only in its entry but in its timing, its candour, and its capacity to reflect responsibility rather than resignation. The discretion afforded to sentencing judges in this regard is not merely protective of judicial resources—it is foundational to the credibility of the sentencing process itself.
The Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines direct courts to evaluate level of commitment, sophistication, and proximity to harm. R v. Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 411 endorsed lengthy determinate sentences for plots disrupted in their assembly phase, emphasising that “early intervention by police does not downgrade the culpability of those who would wreak havoc but for investigative foresight.” Equally apposite is R v. Griffiths & Pierce [2022] EWCA Crim 1312, establishing that ideological uniformity with proscribed groups is not required where defendants pursue “self-starter extremism” inspired by decentralised manifestos.
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}
The Crown adduced evidence of a blog Mr H operated under the pseudonym “VerdantLion.” In 2021 it featured hobbyist carpentry advice; by late 2023 it had morphed into a compendium of screeds decrying “de-industrialisation” and urging adherents to “re-forge the nation in fire.” A linguistic comparison revealed whole paragraphs lifted from the 2011 treatise National Reinvention, itself removed from major platforms following a Home Office takedown order. Defence attempted to characterise those passages as “parody.” The jury disagreed.
It is, regrettably, not uncommon for defendants in such cases to reach for the fig leaf of irony once their intentions are exposed to scrutiny. The invocation of “parody” has become a familiar refrain — a rhetorical shrug deployed in the hope that the court will mistake nihilism for nuance, or provocation for play. But there comes a point at which the density of allusion, the consistency of tone, and the absence of genuine critique render the defence unsustainable. Parody, if it is to have legal or moral weight, must be intelligible as such. The court is not required to indulge the conceit that publishing manifestos in florid prose or attaching cryptic hashtags somehow renders them harmless. Dog whistles are not exculpatory merely because they are inaudible to the uninterested.

Forensic analysts discovered forty-eight encrypted archives inside a VeraCrypt container named “WorkshopIdeas.” Among them were videos demonstrating shrapnel dispersion tests on gelatine blocks, filmed in a cluttered garage identifiable from an electrical certificate in Mr H’s name pinned to a back wall. Some archives were partial—an issue raised in R v. Bakar [2022]—yet, as that authority confirms, possession of incomplete instructions suffices where intent is evidenced elsewhere.
One archive contained a 96-page PDF entitled “Aeropress Charge Geometry,” outlining the advantages of tungsten-BB fill over steel. Defence queried whether the entire file had been read. Intent, however, may be inferred from the preparatory acts that accompanied the possession, not from eye-tracking logs. Courts deal in reasonable inference, not hypothetical ignorance.
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}
The court finds no innocent explanation.
A quantity of home-brew elderflower wine was recovered from a shared kitchen, along with an unpaid parking ticket from 2020. Mr H’s counsel relied on these artefacts as evidence of “ordinary hobbies” and “routine forgetfulness.” The submission misses the point. Ordinary lapses—like submitting tax returns late or doodling in dull meetings—do not involve encrypted chats or blast-radius equations. To invoke rustic beverages as mitigation in a terrorism case is, at best, imaginative.
The court acknowledges that youth often brings error. Yet most youthful mistakes revolve around overstaying night-life curfews, not calculating fragmentation velocity at 15 metres. To equate Mr H’s conduct with garden-variety mischief demeans language and trivialises risk.

The Crown highlighted a trip Mr H made to Prague in May 2024 for what he described as a “heritage architecture tour.” Airline records show that he booked a same-day coach to Ústí nad Labem, a border town known for gatherings of extremist music aficionados. CCTV from the city’s central bus terminal captured Mr H conversing with an individual later arrested in Germany with quantities of ammonium nitrate. Defence posited coincidence—an explanation this court finds improbable given the encrypted calls Mr H placed to the same individual the week before.
Discussion of disclosure is unavoidable. This case generated 712 primary exhibits, each requiring vetting by the Joint Operations Security Unit. The unit’s legacy redaction software is incompatible with high-resolution footage, compelling staff to downscale, redact, then up-scale—a laborious three-step process. Politicians speak of “cutting red tape”; perhaps they might begin by upgrading machines that crash if fed video longer than ten minutes.
It is a persistent source of irritation to this court that those most voluble in their calls for efficiency are often the least acquainted with the actual machinery of justice. The phrase “cutting red tape” is deployed with all the solemnity of a policy solution, yet rarely do its proponents trouble themselves with the mundane realities of legal process: outdated software, underpaid clerks, systems held together by post-it notes and institutional memory. One cannot streamline disclosure by fiat any more than one can digitise case files with exhortation. The machinery creaks because it is old, not because it is slow on purpose — and those who demand acceleration while refusing to fund lubrication should have the decency not to feign surprise when the cogs seize.

A forensic audit traced a 0.62 BTC transfer—worth £3,460 at the time—from a wallet signed with Mr H’s public key to a vendor advertising “chemical-photography kits.” The payment channelled through a mixer called “StormWhisper,” which charges a 0.9 per cent “privacy fee.” The court notes with concern the rise of such tumblers. Crypto-enthusiasts hail decentralisation; criminals exploit it. Law-enforcement analysis, while improving, is perennially reactive—a fact that legislators who trumpet libertarian finance might ponder.
There is, in some circles, a near-theological reverence for technological disruption — as though novelty were a moral good in and of itself. We are told, with breathless inevitability, that decentralised systems represent emancipation from state overreach, that anonymity is a right rather than a circumstance, and that the architecture of traditional finance is an anachronism to be routed around. Such proclamations rarely survive contact with reality. In the hands of those intent on causing harm, decentralisation becomes dereliction, and anonymity becomes impunity. The court is not opposed to innovation per se — indeed, much of our current infrastructure is in desperate need of it — but it is weary of the kind of techno-evangelism that refuses to engage with consequence. One cannot build systems that reward opacity and then feign horror when they are used to hide.
The court reviewed covert surveillance logs detailing a midnight visit Mr H made to the banks of the River Aire on 12 November 2024. Analysts compiled three camera angles, networked them with Smart City environmental sensors, and leveraged audio-gain algorithms to isolate metallic clicks matching a spring-loaded trigger. This painstaking exercise consumed 170 analyst hours to confirm less than eight minutes of activity. Such asymmetry—seconds to act, weeks to analyse—should temper glib commentary about “surveillance society.” Omniscience is an illusion sustained largely by cinema and, occasionally, parliamentary debate.
The mythology of total surveillance — the comforting fiction that every alleyway is watched, every whisper overheard, every footfall traceable — is as persistent as it is misleading. It owes more to screenwriters than to reality, and serves chiefly to fuel misplaced complacency or, worse, cynical grandstanding. The truth is more prosaic, and more troubling: that investigative capacity lags behind technological complexity, that staffing shortages hollow out capability, and that data without interpretation is no weapon at all. The notion that the state might operate some omnipotent digital eye — instant, impartial, incorruptible — is not just inaccurate but corrosive. It obscures the labour of real human beings poring over blurred frames, juggling case backlogs, and doing their best with systems not built for the volume or velocity of modern threat. We should be wary of romanticising what, in practice, amounts to heroic firefighting against overwhelming informational entropy.

Turning to personal circumstances: Mr H is 27 years old, educated to undergraduate level, and formerly employed as a mechanical draftsman at Calder Heavy Industries. His supervisor describes him as “methodical, sometimes pedantic, with an impressive eye for tolerances.” He resigned abruptly after a disciplinary query into use of company servers to access extremist forums.
The defence have tendered letters from a community baking group praising Mr H’s assistance in supporting older people, and from a local charity noting his volunteer hours delivering grocery parcels during the 2020 lockdowns. Civic contributions are laudable, yet they impose higher expectations, not excuses. A person who displays community spirit while simultaneously planning indiscriminate violence betrays, rather than redeems, public trust. As Lord Burnett observed in R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928, “commendable actions in daylight do not illuminate deeds plotted at midnight.”
Professor Isabel Heath, consultant forensic psychologist, diagnoses no psychiatric disorder. She identifies “cognitive absolutism” and a propensity to frame grievances in apocalyptic terms. The pre-sentence report assesses Mr H as high risk of serious harm, citing the depth of his research, engineering skills, and a social-media echo chamber that rewards escalation. Defence suggest the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) as a panacea. Completion rates remain under 65 per cent, and of those, a non-trivial proportion disengage post-licence. The court is not persuaded that a purely community-based intervention would suffice without stringent oversight.

This was a sophisticated, multi-layered enterprise. Aggravating factors include encrypted procurement chains, careful timing to coincide with an historical atrocity, and deliberate selection of a venue designed to maximise civilian casualties. Mitigation is confined to absence of prior convictions and a late – very late – plea.
The court therefore orders the preparation of a full pre-sentence report. Probation must address the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and evaluate whether High-Intensity Cognitive Interventions, GPS-enabled exclusion zones, and mandatory polygraph conditions could meaningfully manage residual risk. The report should canvass prospects of specialist de-radicalisation input, capacity within approved premises, and the availability of psychologists accredited in Structured Professional Judgement (SPJ-10). The court expresses no final view, save that public protection is paramount.
These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 21 July 2025, in Court 3 at the Crown Court at Leeds. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration.
These are the orders of the court.
