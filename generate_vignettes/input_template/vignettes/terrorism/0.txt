IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER
R v. Mr H
Case No. M2025/23117
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. R. LIVINGSTONE
Filed: 13 July 2025
Mr Mr H appeared before this court for sentence in respect of one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct spanned the period between June 2023 and his arrest in February 2025.
Mr H was first arrested at 06:12 on 22 February 2025 after Counter Terrorism Policing North West (CTPNW) executed search warrants at an address in Cheetham Hill. The warrants were issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 following intelligence from the Security Service indicating that an encrypted messaging account associated with his alias had shown increased traffic to a server known to disseminate extremist manuals. At the time of arrest, he was in possession of a laptop and various electronic storage devices.
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}
The arrest came after months of parallel investigation. CTPNW, working with the National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES), had been engaged in painstaking forensic reconstruction of deleted chat logs. That process was protracted owing to the use of open-source virtual machines and a customised Linux kernel that complicated ordinary metadata analysis. Precisely because NDES resources remained severely stretched—at the time, their triage backlog exceeded 17,000 devices nationally—priority was afforded to cases with a live attack planning indicator. Mr H’s case fell into that category when analysis of server uptime logs showed his machine synchronising during the same three-minute window as a known overseas facilitator’s.
During the initial bail period, because of administrative delays in securing authorisation to disclose certain intercept products, he was twice re-bailed under section 47 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The court notes that these delays, though concerning, did not ultimately prejudice his position. They do, however, underscore the strain under which investigative agencies operate. While the public often supposes that intelligence can be conjured up at will, the truth is that disclosure obligations, protective markings, and cross-jurisdictional liaison impose significant friction on the flow of information—friction that cannot simply be wished away by ministerial exhortation.
It should also be recorded that a so-called “Prevent referral” had in fact been made in 2021 by a further-education college tutor after Mr H submitted a sociology assignment quoting long passages from extremist manifestos with insufficient critical commentary. That referral did not progress beyond an initial Channel panel because, at that time, there was no evidence of material support or ideological legitimation. Whether that decision was wise is a matter for policymakers, not this court.
A plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 6 June 2025. Although he initially indicated not guilty pleas, he offered guilty pleas to both counts on the morning of sentencing. The court acknowledges the change, but the lateness of it—after service of significant expert reports and after pre-trial rulings on bad-character evidence—limits the credit properly available.
It is increasingly common for defendants to wait until the eleventh hour to change their plea, only after the strength of the prosecution evidence becomes undeniable. While the system rightly allows for credit to be given for guilty pleas, that credit is intended to reflect genuine remorse and a willingness to spare witnesses the stress of a contested trial — not simply an acknowledgment of the inevitable. The court is not blind to this trend, nor to the costs it imposes on public resources and victim confidence. It must be understood that delaying a plea in the face of overwhelming evidence does not entitle a defendant to the same reduction as an early admission made at the first opportunity.
The principles governing credit for guilty pleas were revisited in R v. Collingridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1873, a case concerning aggravated burglary in the Midlands Circuit. Mr Collingridge was charged with forcing entry into the home of a 78-year-old pensioner at 2:15am while wearing a balaclava, armed with a crowbar. The victim sustained injuries to her hands and face while attempting to protect her jewellery box. Despite clear CCTV footage, fingerprint evidence on the kitchen window, and a partial DNA match on the crowbar, the defendant maintained a not guilty plea for eleven months, during which time the victim died from unrelated causes, depriving the court of her testimony. Only on the first day of trial — after a failed abuse of process application — did he change his plea. The Court of Appeal upheld the sentencing judge’s decision to reduce credit to 10%, holding that the plea was not timely and had not saved substantial court time or spared witnesses.
While the factual matrix in Collingridge is plainly distinct from the present case, it serves as a useful reminder that the timing and context of a plea are as important as the plea itself. Credit is a judicial discretion, not a procedural entitlement.
Further guidance on the limits of sentencing credit can be found in R v. Haslett [2021] EWCA Crim 902, which involved the importation of Class A drugs concealed in vehicle bodywork. Mr Haslett, a 34-year-old HGV mechanic from Crawley, was intercepted at the Port of Dover while driving a modified panel van containing 8.4kg of cocaine and 3.1kg of heroin hidden behind false interior panels. The van, registered in a relative’s name, had undergone extensive modifications in a disused agricultural workshop traced to the defendant’s family farm.
Despite early disclosure obligations under the Criminal Procedure Rules, the defendant offered no explanation until the day of trial, when he entered a plea on a limited basis, claiming he had been “duped” by associates and was unaware of the vehicle’s contents. That basis was rejected by the Crown and found unsubstantiated in a Newton hearing, during which the trial judge observed inconsistencies in the defendant’s account and noted evidence that he had Googled “best border crossing cocaine dog check” two weeks prior to arrest.
The sentencing judge imposed a 14-year custodial sentence with a 10% credit, which the defendant appealed on grounds of excessive severity and procedural unfairness. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, reiterating that lateness of plea, absence of contrition, and tactical delay all undermined the purpose of credit, which is to reflect genuine remorse and procedural economy — not opportunism.
Although the offending behaviour in Haslett differs significantly in type and context from the present case, the court finds its approach instructive in emphasising that timing, cooperation, and credibility all bear upon the credit afforded.
The maximum sentence for an offence under section 5 of the 2006 Act is life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines require the court to assess culpability by reference to factors such as the level of commitment, sophistication, and proximity to potential acts. Relevant case law includes R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, dealing with the breadth of “terrorist purpose,” and R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which emphasises the need for long determinate or extended sentences even where plots are disrupted at an early stage. The court is also guided by the five-judge decision in R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, which makes plain that the primary sentencing objectives in terrorism cases are deterrence and public protection.

Mr H’s conduct must be seen against a backdrop of escalating grievance narratives. An open-source blogging platform he maintained under the pseudonym “UrbanEsprit” initially contained innocuous commentary on local planning disputes and transport policy; by late 2023 it regularly featured relativising references to attacks abroad. The Crown relies on expert linguistic analysis indicating that certain phrases mirrored English-language propaganda produced by an organisation proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

Digital forensic analysis recovered twenty-three PDF files stored in a hidden VeraCrypt partition labelled “SupperRecipes.”
Interestingly—though ultimately irrelevant to sentence—one of those PDFs was corrupted at page 59, which led the defence to surmise that Mr H might never have accessed its final section. For reasons set out in the pre-hearing ruling on “mens rea and incomplete materials,” that submission does not affect culpability when the broader circumstances are considered.
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}
Although counsel for the defence suggested this might have been part of a legitimate interest in aerial photography—an interest apparently documented on a dormant Instagram account showing benign scenic footage—the court is satisfied, given the context, that the adaptation had no innocent purpose.
The court records for completeness that a small quantity of cannabis resin was recovered in the kitchen of the shared house. No charge has arisen, nor does it aggravate terrorism offending; it is noted only because it appeared in the defence mitigation as putative evidence of “normal student lifestyle.” Similarly, mention was made of a 2019 fixed-penalty notice for fare evasion on the Manchester Metrolink. Neither is relevant save that they illustrate counsel’s attempt to paint a picture of youthful indiscretion rather than ideological zeal. The court will not be deflected by such flourishes.
The court accepts that individuals err in their youth. However, the vast majority of such errors do not involve encrypted messaging platforms, subscription to proscribed organisations or associating with convicted terrorists. Youthful indiscretion typically manifests in missed deadlines, poor judgement in friendships, or an unfortunate haircut preserved forever in social media archives — not in the methodical planning of indiscriminate harm. To conflate ordinary adolescent missteps with ideologically motivated behaviour is to trivialise the latter and misrepresent the former. The court is not in the business of punishing character flaws or lapses in maturity; it is concerned with actions that cross the threshold into calculated criminality. Counsel’s suggestion that a cannabis flake and a fare-dodging incident somehow provide exculpatory context is surprising.

During his trial preparation, much attention was given to a conference Mr H attended in Istanbul in April 2024, ostensibly on charitable relief logistics. Immigration records, however, also show he booked a same-day return ticket to Gaziantep on the Turkish-Syrian border—though he never completed that journey because the domestic flight was cancelled due to industrial action by airport staff. Whether he would have proceeded had the flight not been cancelled is an open question, but the planning reveals motivation to situate himself closer to a conflict zone favoured by extremist recruiters.
This court does not overlook the extraordinary resource commitments inherent in counter-terrorism work. The disclosure schedule in this case ran to 527 primary items and required vetting by both the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division and the Security Service Disclosure Unit. That process illustrates the tension between open justice and national security. As Lord Thomas CJ remarked in R v. AB and CD [2014] EWCA Crim 354, a criminal trial “must expose its workings to scrutiny save where the risk to life or limb is clear and present.” The balance here was struck, appropriately, by heavily redacted schedules and a closed-material procedure under section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013 for a tightly confined set of intercept transcripts.
The court notes, parenthetically, that the Legal Aid Agency authorised a maximum of 140 hours’ preparatory work for the defence. That cap appears implausible when one considers the volume of digital material—over 1.9 terabytes—and the need for specialist review software. It is a perennial frustration that defence teams in terrorism cases must repeatedly justify the very existence of complex disclosure. Cost-capping of this kind risks systemic unfairness, a point made forcefully (though perhaps undiplomatically) by the Criminal Bar Association in its 2024 consultation response. That said, counsel in this case have navigated those constraints with commendable professionalism.

A forensic accountant instructed by CTPNW traced a £2,750 cryptocurrency transaction from a wallet registered to Mr H’s email alias “mindspanner@protonmail.com” to a secondary wallet associated with an online marketplace.
The court notes with grave concern the proliferation of unregulated cryptocurrency transactions in the context of serious crime. While cryptoassets may have legitimate applications — and indeed are championed in some quarters as innovations in financial autonomy — they have also become the payment method of choice for those who wish to mask illicit conduct. The opacity of blockchain obfuscation tools, the ease with which wallets can be generated without identity verification, and the cross-jurisdictional complexity of enforcement collectively pose a significant challenge to public authorities. This is not merely a matter for financial regulators. The criminal courts now see, with increasing regularity, the use of decentralised currencies to procure weapons, controlled substances, and, as in this case, dual-use materials with potential application in terrorism. The law must not lag behind technology where public safety is at stake.
The court has also reviewed covert surveillance logs documenting a late-night visit Mr H made to the River Irwell embankment on 3 September 2024. The disproportionate resources required to examine this footage is emblematic of the broader strain under which covert operations now function. The public may imagine that surveillance involves banks of operatives monitoring feeds in real time, yet the reality is often a painstaking post hoc trawl through hours of indistinct recordings — fogged lenses, oblique angles, and the ubiquitous interference of passing traffic. In this instance, analysts were required to synchronise footage from three separate vantage points, cross-reference time stamps with network latency discrepancies, and manually stabilise low-light imagery to confirm Mr H’s identity. That this effort was necessary to verify activity lasting less than ten minutes illustrates both the meticulousness of the investigators and the asymmetry of modern criminal enterprise: where the planning of harm can take seconds, but its detection may require weeks of labour by overstretched personnel.
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}
Turning now to Mr H’s personal circumstances. He is 29 years of age, with a first-class honours degree in mechanical engineering from a reputable university. Until June 2023 he was employed as a junior design consultant at an aerospace subcontractor. His line manager, in a character reference, describes him as “diligent, punctual, and somewhat introverted,” but also notes that he resigned abruptly after a disagreement concerning a background-security questionnaire for a NATO supply-chain accreditation. That resignation preceded the commencement of the covert operation by only a fortnight.
Redundant, but nonetheless curious, are the letters submitted on his behalf from a community gardening society in Prestwich, praising his volunteer work in refurbishing raised flower beds. While civic engagement is ordinarily mitigating, it pales when set against the seriousness of terrorism planning. Good deeds in one domain do not neutralise malevolent intent in another. Indeed, there is a respectable line of reasoning — one this court does not discount — that individuals who demonstrate pro-social conduct in other areas ought to be held to higher, not lower, standards when they breach the law. A person who has proven capable of civic contribution, who has shown an understanding of community responsibility, cannot plausibly plead ignorance of the consequences of their actions. When such individuals nevertheless choose to pursue destructive paths, the sense of betrayal — to their community, to shared values, and to the implicit trust their prior conduct engenders — may aggravate rather than mitigate. It is not cynicism to expect moral coherence; it is justice.
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}
Professor Amelia Griggs, consultant forensic psychologist, notes that Mr H exhibits “elevated cognitive rigidity and a propensity for binary moral reasoning,” but she diagnoses no formal mental illness. The report assesses him as posing a high risk of serious harm to the public and a continuing risk of involvement in extremist activity upon release without intensive management. Defence counsel has advanced the proposition that his ideological fixation may be ameliorated through structured disengagement programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). While the court welcomes rehabilitative pathways, it is well aware that participation does not equate to success, and failure rates remain significant.
It is also right to acknowledge the impact that heightened threat levels have on minority communities. Submissions from the Council of Mosques in Greater Manchester plead that inflated sentencing might inadvertently stoke alienation. The court understands the concern but must remain guided by legal principle and public safety imperatives. In any event, it is societies grounded in the rule of law that best protect minority rights; leniency for planned violence would undermine, not strengthen, communal cohesion.
This was a sophisticated, multi-faceted enterprise. The level of commitment, as evidenced by the encrypted procurement chain, the testing of components, and the drafting of contingency notes, places this firmly in the highest culpability bracket under the Guidelines. Aggravating features include the intention to cause indiscriminate harm and the timing of research to coincide with the anniversary of a previous attack—an anniversary widely exploited in extremist propaganda for symbolic resonance.
Mitigation is limited to Mr H’s lack of previous convictions, his educational achievements, and a measure of belated cooperation manifested by the guilty pleas. Those pleas were entered at a stage that does little to spare witnesses or court resources; accordingly, credit is confined to a reduction of one-sixth.
The court will direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report. The probation service is asked to consider the suitability of a Cognitive Skills Booster Programme and other targeted interventions addressing impulsivity and acquisitive behaviour. Assessment should also explore structured debt advice, community payback, and, where applicable, vocational referrals. The court expresses no view as to ultimate sentencing, but requires a report setting out viable options that meet the dual aims of reducing reoffending and promoting compliance.
These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 13 July 2025, in Court 7 at the Crown Court at Manchester. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration.
These are the orders of the court.
