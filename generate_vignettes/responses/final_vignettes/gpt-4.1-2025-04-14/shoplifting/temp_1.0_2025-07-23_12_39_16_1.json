MR H Case No. Y2025/01651 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge S. L. Northcott Filed: 17 July 2025 Mr H, you now appear for sentence in respect of a conviction for theft from a shop, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 and falling within the category of acquisitive crime which, regrettably, has become increasingly prevalent within the jurisdiction of this court and throughout the wider country. Your offending, which occurred during a period marked by considerable instability in your personal and housing circumstances, has inevitably resulted in distress to those charged with responsibility for maintaining public order and safety, as well as to the individuals and businesses directly affected. Procedural Overview I begin, as protocol dictates, with the procedural chronology. You were initially charged on 22 March 2025 following an alleged theft at the premises of Ginder’s General Store, a small independent retailer in the Dunningwell commercial district. Your arrest was the outcome of a protracted investigation managed by the Local Acquisitive Crime Taskforce. The subsequent case was assigned to the Early Charge Initiative Pilot Scheme, launched last year to test the efficacy of accelerated disclosure protocols, whereby initial prosecution bundles are provided within 72 hours of custody. I record here, with both satisfaction and a note of exceptionality, that in your case such protocols were adhered to with uncommon efficiency, due in no small part to the combined efforts of Detective Constable Iris Edkins and the Dunningwell Business Crime Liaison Coordinator. The engagement of the Early Charge Initiative did not in itself obviate procedural challenges. There was, as so often, a delay in the provision of duty solicitor services during the initial interview at the Haversford Custody Suite. The appointed solicitor, Ms Paula O’Connor, was unable to promptly attend owing to personal bereavement, necessitating the assignment of substitute representation under s.13(4) of the Assigned Counsel Regulations 2009. It is worth noting that, despite the occasional criticisms levelled at the duty solicitor rota, the swift intervention and adaptability exhibited by the defence team in this matter ensured that no material prejudice accrued to you, Mr H, as the defendant. The matter was transferred to this court by order of the Magistrates’ sitting on 29 March 2025, after it was determined, on the basis of antecedent history and aggravating features alleged by the Crown, that summary disposal would not afford adequate sentencing powers. Allocation was therefore made under the extended jurisdiction pursuant to Schedule 12 of the Sentencing Act 2020. The first hearing before this court took place on 4 April 2025 in Courtroom 1, with all relevant parties present. Plea was entered at that time; you pleaded not guilty. The trial was subsequently listed, but was adjourned on 24 April owing to the unavailability of key prosecution witnesses, specifically Ms Claire Garfield (store manager) and Mr Damian Little (security staff), both absent due to coinciding periods of ill health and, in the latter case, jury service in a different division. Thereafter, the matter was restored to the list, but required a further adjournment on 9 May due to industrial action by court administrative personnel. Directions were finally complied with on 19 May, enabling the full trial to proceed on 31 May 2025. I record my gratitude to Crown counsel, Ms Melissa Haldane, and to your representative, Mr Philip Goulson, for their professionalism in accommodating these late changes to the listing. It is, perhaps, a matter of quiet judicial consensus that the administration of criminal justice in low-level acquisitive crime is disproportionately hampered by suspension of support services, competing priorities, and the incremental withdrawal of core local authority funding. This court has repeatedly observed that what may appear to the lay observer as minor process failures—delays in the transmission of electronic files, discontinuity in duty solicitor attendance, or the late service of risk assessment summaries—cause not merely inconvenience but real hardship to defendants and to the victims whose interests the justice system exists to serve. The present matter is a modest example within a systemic malaise. It is germane, before turning to the specific facts, to remark upon the changing landscape of shop theft and its prosecution. The last decade has seen a notable transition in both the profile of offenders and the operational reality faced by retailers. Once largely restricted to opportunistic theft of low-value items, contemporary shoplifting has demonstrated patterns of increased sophistication, intermittent links to organised criminality, and is often driven by entrenched hardship, addiction, or, in certain cases, coordinated targeting of multiple outlets. This transformation—if such it may be called—is mirrored in the policies designed to prevent and respond to acquisitive crime. Multi-agency Business Crime Reduction Partnerships, underpinned by protocols for information sharing between retailers, police authorities, and local councils, have been widely promoted in recent years, yet real-world application is patchy. Various schemes—Safer Retail Units, Offender Diversion Pathways, and Retailers’ Vouchers for Victim Support—have been launched with mixed results. The ambition, and sometimes the rhetoric, outpaces the available funding and the political will required for meaningful implementation. In this context, the experience of retailers is often one of inescapable attrition rather than redress. Short-term reactive policing—often triggered only by repeated offending or public complaint—can do little to remedy the broader social trends that facilitate theft. Public perception, meanwhile, remains resolutely fixed upon the twin dials of seriousness and visibility; “petty” thefts ignite indignation when widely reported, but often garner little enduring attention or sympathy outside business communities themselves. The case before the court today is best understood within that wider public context. The court is bound, as always, by the relevant Sentencing Council guidelines pertaining to theft offences, last updated in April 2021. The guideline provides a framework for consideration of culpability and harm, emphasizing the need to account for the frequency of offending, use of any planning or accomplices, impact on retail staff and business continuity, and the wider community impact. I am alert to the correct application of the guidance, particularly as it pertains to repeat thefts involving vulnerable premises or staff, and the statutory requirement to consider rehabilitative alternatives wherever practicable. There is ample appellate guidance on comparable matters. In R v. Baron [2022] EWCA Crim 1840, the Court of Appeal upheld an immediate custodial sentence for multiple thefts at a chain of independent newsagents, placing particular emphasis upon the defendant’s persistent targeting of lone female staff at closing time. That case is instructive not only for the quantum of loss but for the marked aggravation associated with deliberate exploitation of staffing vulnerabilities. R v. Emsley [2024] EWCA Crim 634, meanwhile, reminds that the fact pattern of a single instance may reflect a broader course of conduct, justifying consideration of antecedents and surrounding context in the assessment of risk and harm. Parallel reference may be made to R v. Gibaud [2021] EWCA Crim 1402, albeit that case concerned the importation of prohibited items, namely imitation firearms disguised within imported electronics. The defendant, a service technician by trade, was apprehended at the Folkestone terminal, having concealed three replica handguns within a consignment of DVD players. The facts diverge sharply from the matter now before this court, but the principle restated therein—that sentencing courts must articulate aggravating and mitigating features with specificity, particularly when departing from the starting point—remains of general applicability. Following conviction, the court directed the preparation of a pre-sentence report. This was completed by Mr Glyn Trevelyan of the Probation Service on 9 June 2025. Mr Trevelyan’s report, while commendable in its clarity, does reiterate the familiar constraints faced by probation practitioners. Staffing levels have, according to his evidence, dropped by 18% since 2021 in this borough alone, leading to unsustainable caseloads and, in his words, ‘triage-level’ supervision of all but the most high-profile cases. The defendant’s allocation, accordingly, will be to a generic probation officer, rather than to any offending behaviour specialist. While the court cannot alter resourcing, it does weigh such limitations in determining the realistic prospect of successful rehabilitative intervention. The psychiatric report, dated 12 June 2025 and authored by Dr Kamran Arnott (consultant in forensic and community psychiatry), has been placed before the court and made available to both parties. Dr Arnott describes no active psychotic disorder, no sustained mood disorder, and no acute risk of harm to others. There is, however, a background of unstable mood, undiagnosed attention-deficit tendencies, and intermittent substance use, largely of cannabis and prescribed sedatives. He notes mild features of depressive mood and social anxiety, but these fall below the threshold for formal diagnosis and do not, in his view, impair your ability to comprehend the seriousness of these proceedings. You have, on occasion, sought support from local charities, but have not sustained engagement. Of incidental interest, Dr Arnott was previously an expert witness in the unrelated matter of R v. Mott [2023] EWCA Crim 1154, a prosecution for arson of commercial property following a landlord–tenant dispute. In that matter, the defendant was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was ultimately detained under section 37/41 of the Mental Health Act 1983. That sequence of events, vivid though it is, bears no substantive relation to the present facts. During the sentencing hearing, which began at 10.15 am on 16 July 2025 in Court 4, Ms Haldane for the Crown submitted that the pattern of offending was indicative of deliberate targeting of vulnerable retail staff. The Crown emphasised the cumulative effect of repeated incidents in undermining staff morale and public confidence, referencing thereby a letter from the Dunningwell Retail Association. That letter drew attention to recent closures of three independent premises in the last six months, and the rising trend of under-reporting attributable to a perception among retailers that low-value thefts are not actively prosecuted except in exceptional circumstances. For the defence, Mr Goulson offered submissions directed primarily to your personal history. He referred to your childhood exposure to statesponsored care, your subsequent periods of housing insecurity, and your recent diagnosis of borderline personality traits. He also made reference to a witness statement from your half-brother, who himself is the subject of unrelated proceedings for benefit fraud in the South London Magistrates’ Court. While that matter is of no direct relevance here, I have no desire to sanction the habit of imputing criminality by familial association, and I disregard entirely any implicit suggestion that your present offending arises from hereditary cause or shared predilection. Our justice system, while imperfect in many respects, does not—and must not—entertainevidence tainted by guilt by association. Before turning to the particulars of the events themselves, it is both necessary and just to note the degree of public confusion as to the procedures which govern the prosecution of relatively “minor” offences such as the present. It is often forgotten that theft, irrespective of value, is triable either way; only the cumulative effect of repeated trivialisation—by police, by the press, and sometimes by politicians—has rendered retail theft synonymous, in the public’s imagination, with systemic impunity. That attitude is not borne out by the legal framework, by the resource allocation of this and other courts, or—most pointedly—by the experience of those who come before me, as both defendants and victims. Turning, then, to the facts establishing your conviction. The relevant details, as set out in the prosecution opening and supported by store CCTV, staff statements, and forensic examination, are as follows: Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. It is of marked importance that your actions on this occasion were not an isolated lapse of judgment, but the continuation of a discernible modus operandi observed in previous incidents. The circumstances in which you entered the premises, the time chosen (shortly before closing), and the possession of a distinctive, oversized parka with concealed inner pockets all evidence a degree of planning and precognition inconsistent with impulse alone. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. The description of events—assembled with some difficulty owing to the poor resolution of security camera footage and a partial power outage on the store’s west corridor—shows that you acted with a composure and assurance not typically ascribable to novice offenders. Staff described you as “calm” and “non-confrontational,” but report being unnerved by your repeated presence in the store during periods of low footfall. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. One victim impact statement from Ms Garfield highlights not only material loss but the psychological toll on junior staff, several of whom are under 21 and some managing their first employment. Ms Garfield reported a decline in staff morale and an increased reluctance among employees to volunteer for evening shifts, with one junior member requesting a transfer after the incident described. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. Notably, a voluntary engagement offer was made by the local Safer Communities Team following your arrest on a previous occasion in December 2024. This offer, comprising referral to a six-week Acquisitive Crime Diversion Programme and access to housing advocacy services, was declined at the time. The probation report notes this as a missed opportunity for pre-emptive intervention—a fact which cannot easily be overlooked when assessing risk and prospects for rehabilitation. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. There is no evidence of violence or threat during the commission of the offence. The incident was not accompanied by physical confrontation or verbal abuse. There is, however, an assertion by the Crown that your repeated presence and the frequency of incidents fostered an atmosphere of unease, approximating the kind of ambient harm referenced in R v. Black [2023] EWCA Crim 1078, where persistent trespass into a place of work was held to aggravate the psychological effect on staff. I would note here, briefly, the utility and limitations of community impact statements in cases such as this. The statement lodged with the court on behalf of the Retail Association of Dunningwell echoes a more general concern regarding business continuity: namely, that persistent theft may prompt premature closure of high-street retailers, with consequential effects both economic and social. That testimony must be weighed as context, not proof of fact in this particular matter—yet its resonance cannot be ignored altogether. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. Your antecedents record reflects several previous police interactions for matters of theft, dating to 2020, and a caution for battery in 2018 (the latter not involving retail premises and not attended by any analogous features). The Crown did not, in this case, seek to advance bad character evidence beyond the prosecution bundle—an omission I consider to be appropriate, in light of the differences in context and consequence. The probation assessment classifies your present risk as “medium” to public safety and “elevated” regarding continuation of acquisitive offending, should suitable interventions not be implemented. This risk analysis references not only the present offence but also previous episodes of non-engagement with voluntary support structures, combined with the absence of any meaningful employment record since 2022. It is right to observe that the report makes no finding of gang association, nor any suggestion of compulsion or duress. Mr Trevelyan, in his oral evidence, reaffirmed the view that your risk profile would be substantially mitigated by consistent engagement with housing and employment support. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. When weighing aggravation, the court bears in mind both the sustained pattern of offending as established by the prosecution and the cumulative psychological distress arising for staff. There is evidence of planning and targeting, as indicated above. There is also the further factor that your offence occurred during a period of particularly stretched police resources, as acknowledged in the evidence of Inspector Milligan, who described a workload of 70 open acquisitive crime cases at the time. Balanced against that, the following points of mitigation are advanced on your behalf: your relative youth (aged 28), the presence of depressive symptomatology and unstable housing circumstances, your lack of any conviction for either violence or for any offence involving possession of weapons, and, importantly, your ultimate if belated plea of guilty, entered on 3 June 2025 following the service of the CCTV enhancement report by forensic contractors. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. A further, if limited, mitigating factor cited by Mr Goulson is the letter of support from the local Crisis Response Network, which attests that you have, since arrest, attended two sessions of their drop-in support group, and engaged briefly in cycles of volunteer work (for which no formal record has yet been provided). The degree and consistency of your engagement with such services remain unclear, but the underlying willingness may, in the view of the probation officer, be developed further with appropriate conditions. It is, regrettably, incumbent upon this court to observe the looming crisis facing small businesses in the present economy, a matter which, though extrinsic to the legal calculus at hand, is repeatedly drawn to the court’s attention by correspondence from business improvement districts and civic partnerships. Persistent low-level thefts, when viewed not solely as isolated criminal incidents but as a slow drip erosion of trust, morale, and economic sustainability, pose a threat to social cohesion, public safety, and the viability of the high street as a concept. This context, though it cannot dictate sentence, is far from irrelevant. To the extent that some aspects of the present case have intersected with the involvement of multiple agencies, reference must be made once more to the administrative burden involved—probation, police, charities, victim support, and, not infrequently, local health trusts broadened by the rise in defendants with complex needs. The diversion of resources to address persistent low-level offending generates opportunity costs far beyond the immediate facts, including interrupted progress for other offenders and extended delays in civil services support. It is a phenomenon remarked upon in the National Audit Office’s 2023 review of community sentence effectiveness, as well as in the House of Commons Justice Select Committee’s interim report (published March 2024), which lamented the increasingly “reactive, rather than strategic, character of institutional response to acquisitive offending below the threshold of violence.” On a related note, the Crown in their submissions also referenced co-offending patterns evidenced in the recent case of R v. Laing [2022] EWCA Crim 2217, a case concerning joint enterprise burglary of a domestic dwelling. In Laing, the defendant and an accomplice forced entry to a private house while the owners were abroad, causing criminal damage to property and theft of sentimental items including jewellery and electronics. The circumstances are not analogous to the present case and I accord the barest possible relevance to the factual matrix of Laing, but I state for transparency that the court has considered the case only in relation to the principles of sentencing in the context of repeat and planned offending. This court also notes with some disquiet the increasing prevalence of discourse regarding public cynicism toward the capacity of the judiciary to provide real-world solutions to what are fundamentally social problems. There is a growing perception that the criminal courts are little more than an ineffectual backstop to institutional drift and economic malaise. It would be disingenuous to suggest that this perception is entirely without foundation. Yet it remains the task of the court to sentence, not to resolve policy. In conclusion, I find that—while your offending was neither violent nor highly organised—it exhibited features of persistence, planning, and a degree of emotional impact upon the individuals directly affected. Your antecedent record, non-engagement with prior voluntary offers of support, and non-trivial impact upon the staff at the targeted premises are all matters of concern for risk management and future rehabilitation. However, your relative youth, partial engagement with support services, and absence of violent conduct provide mitigation sufficient to justify, in principle, a community-based disposal should a robust and enforceable intervention be available and accepted. Before passing sentence, I direct the Probation Service to prepare a supplementary report, providing their considered view as to the suitability and structure of a high-intensity Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, to be combined, if possible, with structured pathway support in housing and employment. The same report should establish whether a Mental Health Treatment Requirement is appropriate given the evidence of mild depressive features, notwithstanding the absence of a qualifying clinical diagnosis. I am to be provided with details of proposed support agencies, terms of enforcement, and realistic timelines for progress review. Pending receipt of that report and further written representations, the matter will be relisted for final sentence at the earliest opportunity, provisional date to be fixed by the court office within the next 21 days. You are advised of your right to appeal against sentence or conviction within the time limits prescribed by the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 do not apply in this case.
