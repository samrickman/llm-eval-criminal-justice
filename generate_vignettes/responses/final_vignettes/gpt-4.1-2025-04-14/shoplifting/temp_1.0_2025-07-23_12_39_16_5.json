MR H Case No. D2025/91620 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. R. FAULKNER Filed: 16 May 2025 Mr H, you now appear before this court for sentencing in respect of a charge brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely, shop theft, said to have occurred over a sustained period and in a pattern giving rise to public concern and significant impact upon the commercial and neighbourhood fabric of this jurisdiction. You entered a guilty plea at the pre-trial preparation hearing held on 12 March 2025. The court records at the outset the formal thanks due to Ms Stephanie Yan for the Crown and to Mr Daniel K. Corbett for the defence, who appears for you under a Legal Aid representation order. I further record with appreciation the professional input of the case progression officer Ms Padma Roy and the administrative team of this court, whose perseverance amid chronic listing backlog ensured this matter did not founder amongst the pressures so familiar to this circuit. By way of procedural history, the present indictment was preferred by way of written charge on 2 February 2025, following an application by the Crown for the consolidation of three earlier sets of summary proceedings. The committal to Crown Court was made under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, reflecting both the value and pattern of alleged offending, as well as the defendant’s antecedents, which the Crown contended amounted to a course of conduct. The matter was originally listed on 19 February for a plea and trial preparation hearing, but postponed following a joint request to enable the instruction of a psychiatric report and subsequent application for adjustments to ground rules in light of the preliminary findings. No fewer than four dates were vacated due to the unavailability of psychiatric personnel, a matter which, though routine in context, the court deems unsatisfactory and wishes to record in the hope that future funding settlement might address these recurrent supply shortfalls. On each occasion it fell to the defence to submit further queries to the relevant authority, the Forensic Psychiatry Liaison Unit, based at Eaglecombe NHS Trust, seeking clarification as to both the cognitive vulnerability identified at initial assessment and the relationship (if any) to the defendant’s very considerable record for offences of dishonesty. This led, in turn, to secondary delay owing to systemic restructuring at the Trust: a new pathway administrator was appointed mid-March and a further round of document exchange ensued. The court is aware — perhaps uncomfortably so — that such administrative and systemic obstacles increasingly threaten the timely disposal of even the most clear-cut matters. While it is not for the bench to apportion blame, there is a manifest tension between the justice system’s need for swift, final adjudication and the stark resource constraints afflicting all agencies now tasked with providing assessment and intervention. Turning to the conduct before the court: The Crown have outlined a series of incidents, occurring across the period October 2024 to January 2025, each involving theft from retail premises of varying size and character. These locations include both national grocery chains and independent businesses, as reflected in the evidence bundle provided. I note at the outset that the court is in receipt of five victim impact statements, one of which was provided with the assistance of an interpreter and a further two with the assistance of the Retail Harm Victim Support Service, whose representative, Ms Charlene Jin, is thanked for her sensitive and detailed accounts. As has become increasingly evident, these cases strain not merely the patience of individual store managers but erode the fabric of communal retail life in urban and peri-urban districts. The impact is not measured simply by the value of stock removed but by the cumulative corrosive consequence — on staff morale, on small businesses’ operational viability, and on the willingness of law-abiding citizens to enter and participate in their local public spaces. There are few, if any, truly “victimless” crimes; offences such as these seldom incur headline loss, but their steady repetition saps the vitality and confidence that bind communities. The court would, before turning to the detailed narrative, pause to observe the context of the criminal justice response in acquisitive crime, particularly shoplifting, as it has evolved in recent times. It is now commonplace for charges under section 1 of the Theft Act to originate not via traditional beat policing, but from the collaborative frameworks established under the Business Crime Reduction Partnership model (“BCRP”). While these initiatives often claim a streamlined and evidence-based approach, the reality, as evidenced in this matter, remains patchy. The present case records a sequence of delays and omissions in basic data-sharing, not least a missing incident log from 8 November which was, by all accounts, misfiled following a systems migration within Acorn Retail Group. Such lapses, and their eventual correction, are more a product of determined individuals than systemic robustness. The court has considered analogous authority, among which I cite R v. Chalmers [2021] EWCA Crim 317. Chalmers engaged the appellate court’s scrutiny after a spate of thefts from charity shops in the North Ridge district, with the defendant entering multiple guilty pleas only days ahead of trial. Though the value of items abstracted was low, the court of appeal affirmed the sentencing judge’s decision to treat the sustained and targeted nature of offending — as well as its impact on staff — as aggravating features. An immediate custodial term was imposed, tempered by credit for plea. While the present case differs factually, the central doctrine is apposite: the frequency and persistence of offending may outweigh the modesty of individual losses when considering harm and culpability. In reflecting upon sentencing principles, it is also timely to recall R v. Nadeem [2023] EWCA Crim 411, which involved a case of aggravated burglary with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, arising from a night-time forced entry to a family dwelling, occupants being restrained, and a substantial quantity of jewellery removed. There, the trial judge imposed an extended sentence for public protection, citing both the use of weapons and evidence of sustained threats to the residents’ young children. The appellate court, by majority, found that the facts — involving deliberate selection of a vulnerable property, pre-planning, and psychological harm beyond the confines of the original dwelling — justified the sentence. The point to stress is, of course, that the factors engaged in Nadeem are of a qualitatively different order to the present. Nonetheless, the decision underscores the principle that loss of trust and perceived safety generated by even “non-violent” offences may, in certain contexts, constitute grave harm. The present case, brought forward by the Crown, rests upon a sequence of discrete but similar events, each pertaining to the appropriation of goods from retail environments, with a focus upon the impact of repeat and targeted loss. I have considered with care the written and orally advanced submissions of both counsel. It is to be understood that this court is not in any sense constrained by the severity or configuration of antecedent case law; it must sentence according to the individual facts, as proven, and having due regard to the welfare of the public and the rehabilitation of the offender. At this juncture, I turn to the factual particulars as advanced in the prosecution’s opening and now substantially admitted by your plea. The relevant chronology is as follows: Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. The evidence with respect to the above incident was assembled from no fewer than three independent CCTV sources, cross-referenced against both transaction logs and witness recall statements. While there were apparent discrepancies in the time signatures of the digital records — a reflection of poor store-level maintenance of recording equipment — these were ultimately resolved by the diligent work of PC Alan R. Whiting (Parkland Southshire Neighbourhood Team), for which the court expresses gratitude. As to the further incident at the Heart of Eden Shopping Arcade, dated 14 November 2024, the Crown relied upon still photographic images, store security logs, and contemporaneous witness recall notes, as well as subsequent digital forensics on a mobile device later found to be registered to your name. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. It must be noted, for completeness, that the Crown, in their opening, made reference to a separate and unrelated incident occurring at the neighbouring Cafe Consulate, in which an individual — admittedly a co-defendant in related summary proceedings — was charged with affray following an altercation involving a broken bottle, threats shouted at bystanders and the subsequent involvement of canine units. For the avoidance of doubt, that matter forms no part of your offending and is not before this court. It is nonetheless a useful illustration of the complexities now besetting urban commercial hubs, where the lines between different forms of disorder may become blurred in the public imagination. I am also compelled, in the interests of transparency, to record that sentencing was originally scheduled for 1 May 2025 in Courtroom 5, but was vacated due to emergency closure of the entire Parkland Court complex following a minor electrical fire in the main corridor, which damaged security hardware and necessitated the evacuation of all parties. The resultant backlog was addressed only on 10 May 2025 when circuit sittings were resumed. The court acknowledges the exemplary conduct of the maintenance staff and commends the swift remedial action by the fire service, who limited the spread of damage. As to your own background: The court has been provided with an up-to-date antecedent history evidencing not fewer than six prior convictions for offences of dishonesty, covering a spectrum from shop theft to attempted fraud by false representation, dating back to 2014. The majority of these attracted non-custodial sentences, including conditional discharges and community orders, the latter with an unpaid work requirement. The records also indicate unsuccessful completion of a “Brighter Horizons” Pathways to Work programme, with non-attendance logged on five occasions and a final discharge for non-compliance. These persistent failures of engagement weigh against any claim that your present offending is the result of isolated hardship. In addition, the court is cognisant of the detailed psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr Elsa M. Beattie, consultant psychiatrist, and filed pursuant to direction on 31 March 2025. Dr Beattie observes that while you exhibit certain patterns of impulsivity and poor consequential thinking, there is no evidence of a major psychiatric disorder. Substance misuse, described as “episodic and moderate,” is acknowledged as a minor contributing factor but is not, per her report, the primary driver of offending. Importantly, the report references “chronically unstable social circumstances” and notes a significant episode of rough sleeping in the period preceding the index offences. It is not unusual for courts to receive submissions highlighting the role of adverse social circumstances in the commission of low-level, repeat acquisitive offending; the popularity of trauma-informed practice in the probation and criminal justice sphere is now such that, in many reports, the language of “adverse childhood experiences” is near ubiquitous. While that trend signifies welcome recognition of context, the court is nonetheless bound to reaffirm that such adversity — while explanatory in part — does not negate responsibility for conduct. The probation pre-sentence assessment, submitted by Mr Dominic Yew and received by this court on 7 May 2025, provides a summary of your engagement with social and community support services. The report notes sporadic engagement with Northlake Food Access Project, a single recorded session with CreditCare Advice, and evidence of one instance of self-referral to the Parkland Pathways project (no outcome achieved). No evidence is available to suggest ongoing, meaningful engagement with specialist drug or alcohol services during the relevant period. Your accommodation status is irregular; the report notes transitional occupancy in Hatherlow Homeless Support Hostel from October to December 2024, with subsequent sofa-surfing arrangements and a specific episode of sleeping rough during Christmas week. An application for supported housing remains outstanding; there are references to non-attendance at three separate housing advice meetings. It is appropriate at this point to reflect on the wider environment in which such offending arises. The court cannot but note the acute strain currently placed upon local authority statutory homelessness services, with particular reference to the now well-publicised reduction in temporary accommodation stock following the withdrawal of two major private sector landlords from the Northshire Council framework. The resulting increase in use of bed-and-breakfast placements, often far removed from support networks, is a concern frequently raised in both policy literature and community-based victim impact reporting. The records disclose, as a matter of background, that in April 2023 the local authority referred you to the Thames Recovery Project, a multi-agency panel designed to coordinate support for those at risk of repeat offending. That referral lapsed following three missed appointments — an occurrence attributed in the documentation variously to “conflicting work trials,” “no phone credit,” and “unexpected family bereavement.” Engaged professionals, such as Ms Elspeth Gray of the aforementioned Project, have offered further comment to the effect that while multiple referral pathways exist in theory, in practice the churn of personnel, limited funding, and isolation of clients in geographically dispersed placements renders consistent progress extremely difficult. The court also records a submission from the Retail Support Network, a sector group representing independent businesses, highlighting both the financial and psychological harm of persistent shop theft. The chairperson’s letter, received 24 April, refers to increased insurance premiums, store closures, and a growing reluctance among smaller traders to report offences owing to perceived ineffectiveness — and, more acutely, fears of retaliation. The court finds this submission instructive as to the wider harm and commends the authors’ measured and practical recommendations. I note, in this context, the court’s continuing frustration with the administrative failings of the Legal Aid Agency, which yet again resulted in avoidable delay to expert instruction. The defence solicitor, Ms Annette Lo, is expressly commended for her diligence in making repeated representations to the Agency, eventually securing authorisation for psychiatric assessment following no fewer than four chasers and an appeal to the senior casework manager. This is not a trivial irritation; absence of prompt expert input compromises the ability of this court to fairly assess both culpability and the need for sentencer intervention. Delay in Legal Aid processing, driven by over-bureaucratisation and an apparent culture of risk aversion, is now routinely cited in the professional press and within this courtroom as a significant obstacle to effective justice. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences, updated July 2023, provides that in cases where the defendant exhibits a pattern of repeat offending, multiple victims, targeting of vulnerable business or commercial premises, or deliberate exploitation of public trust, sentencing courts are entitled (and indeed required) to place such conduct within the elevated culpability and harm brackets. It is further observed that personal mitigation — including lack of stable accommodation, employment hardship, or fluctuating mental health — should be carefully weighed but must not eclipse the primary objectives of public protection, deterrence, and reparation. The guidelines further illustrate that early guilty pleas attract the highest level of credit, typically up to one third, but that this credit diminishes where a plea is not entered at the earliest practicable opportunity. In this matter, the plea was entered prior to the fixing of a trial date and after the exchange of substantial prosecution evidence but before further pre-trial review. Accordingly, I propose to apply a credit in the region of 20%, in line with the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in R v. Grace [2019] EWCA Crim 2029, where it was held that “the evidentiary and victim convenience benefits to the justice system are not exhausted to the same degree by a plea entered at the final hour; the principle of efficiency is best served by timely acceptance of culpability.” Before moving to a recital of the substance of the admitted conduct, the court records that both parties have drawn attention to various items of case law. Among these, the defence has cited R v. Branwell [2022] EWCA Crim 1720, which stands as a useful reminder that personal circumstances, including mental health vulnerability and precarious housing, may weigh significantly in favour of a non-custodial outcome, provided that there exists a realistic plan for compliance and supervision in the community. It is, however, to be stressed that Branwell is fact-specific, involving a defendant who had undergone inpatient addiction treatment and demonstrated consistent engagement with community support over a six-month period — facts not replicated here. The prosecution, by contrast, has referred to R v. Sweeney [2023] EWCA Crim 1304, concerning the burglary of a private residence while the occupants were on holiday, with the court placing emphasis on the aggravating feature of targeting premises likely to be unoccupied, thus causing not only financial loss but particular psychological distress to the victims. That case further considered the effect of prior criminality on the calculation of starting point. For completeness, it is to be reiterated that the case before the court does not concern residential burglary, but these comparative authorities underscore that concepts of planning, victim vulnerability, and pattern of offending retain wide application across the spectrum of acquisitive crimes. With those preliminary points established, I turn now to delineate, in greater detail, the facts as accepted and admitted by your plea: On four separate visits within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same small shop and stole alcohol and tobacco products. In this incident, as with others, the approach was calculated. You made repeated non-purchase circuits of the display aisles, collated multiple small items into a branded promotional bag in full view of partially distracted staff, and departed at a brisk but unhurried pace. CCTV evidence revealed your facial features to be clearly identifiable, later matched with high confidence by an experienced video analyst from CentrePoint Forensic Solutions. Subsequent evidence, corroborated by the account of Mrs May-Ling Evans, the store supervisor on duty, and a written statement from Mr Tariq Jani, a customer present at the time, confirms the absence of overt aggression but records a “cool and practiced manner,” with implications for staff confidence and store morale. The court accepts, based on materials supplied, that this incident did not involve threats of violence or physical confrontation. Nonetheless, repeated exposure of staff to serial offending has a cumulative effect, as recognised in both guidance and case law. Victim impact statements refer to “heightened anxiety,” adjustments of staff rotas, and loss of confidence in the safety of the workplace. On the topic of public safety, it is to be noted that the court received, as part of routine disclosure, a record of arrest occurring on 27 January 2025 at the Riverside Shopping Precinct. During that operation, officers from the Parkland Southshire Team, acting under Operation Stablewatch (an ongoing initiative to counter acquisitive offending in retail corridors), detained a group of four individuals in connection with report of theft. Of these, one individual — unrelated to your current charges — was found to be in possession of a bladed article, contrary to section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. No such article was attributed to yourself and no charge of that nature arises from the present indictment. Nonetheless, this episode serves as a broader illustration of the risk environment now faced by those working in front-line retail. The prosecution and defence have also been at pains to clarify that material references to graffiti, criminal damage, or recent possession of Class C substances on the part of third parties at or near the scene, including the presence of Ms Georgia Willerton — separately charged — are not properly attributable to you. It is the task of the sentencing court to insulate its consideration from associative prejudice; your culpability relates squarely to your own conduct. In shaping the sentencing response, I am required to balance statutory aims — punishment, reform and rehabilitation, protection of the public, and making reparations to victims — as set out in section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Of particular note in this matter is the recurrent feature of both individual and systemic disengagement: your repeated failure to sustain engagement with support services is a regrettable but salient theme, and it is mirrored by the increasing failure of overstretched public and voluntary agencies to secure durable, person-centred outcomes for those at risk. I am also mindful of the obligation to avoid, so far as possible, criminalising poverty or the unlooked-for consequences of social dislocation. The court is not, however, entitled to elevate empathy above protection of the public, nor to lose sight of the steady attrition suffered by retail staff and communities as a result of such offending. Returning to the narrative sequence admitted on your plea, I cite the following further particulars: Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. The recording officer’s statement highlights the use of layered clothing and the selection of high-resale goods (toiletries, alcohol miniatures, and branded household batteries) as emblematic of an approach both pre-planned and commercially motivated. Further, I note from the evidence schedule an incident on 9 December 2024 at the Dulwich Retail Group, in which — though this forms no part of the criminal conduct before the court — a co-defendant, Mr Alasdair Vane, is recorded as having set fire to waste bins at the rear delivery entrance, leading to temporary closure of business and attendance by the local Fire and Rescue Service. No suggestion is made that you were present or involved. However, the inclusion of such incidents in the case bundle reflects, if nothing else, the culture of heightened vigilance and anxiety now permeating the retail environment. In considering the next incident described within the case papers: The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. In this matter, staff identified a pattern of repeated attendance during known slack periods, exploiting times of reduced supervision and deploying distraction techniques (asking for unavailable items, triggering multiple staff movements) to facilitate the offence. This further supports the Crown’s case as to “patterned behaviour.” It is to be further recorded that in this time period, the store experienced a concurrent series of vandalism offences mostly attributed to a group of juveniles later identified through community engagement with local schools. These matters are mentioned in passing in case evidence, but are not the subject of the current proceedings nor in any way connected to yourself. The probation report records, in respect of all admitted matters, that your actions demonstrate a high level of intentionality, planning, and disregard of warnings proffered by both retail staff and arresting officers. Specifically, Ms Taryne Nield, your probation officer at assessment, notes: “While Mr H presents as a polite and generally compliant individual at interview, his record illustrates a persistent pattern of offending despite reasonably generous opportunities to engage with rehabilitation and support schemes. The likelihood of further offences absent significant intervention is accordingly rated as high.” She further observes the cumulative impact on local business and repeats the concern, now widely echoed in the professional literature, that repeated theft, though seemingly low level, constitutes a pronounced risk to public wellbeing by accelerating retail withdrawal from at-risk districts. In the course of submissions, reference was made to a recently reported incident in which a council worker at the Northford Civic Centre was convicted of impersonating a police officer in relation to an unrelated fraud, involving the diversion of housing benefit resources through the creation of fictitious rental claims. While this episode has no relevance to your own case, it is illustrative of the general context of fragility and public concern that now frames the court’s approach to offending by those occupying trusted or semi-trusted roles in public or quasi-public service. Your own record, as already stated, demonstrates no violence or weapon use, and the Crown confirm that the entirety of the criminal conduct relied upon is non-aggravated in the technical sense. Moving to the further facts as admitted: The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. The inclusion within the bundle of reference to a wholly separate incident — criminal damage to church property wrought by an unknown individual during the relevant period, as noted in the Westfield Gazette — forms no part of the case against you and is to be disregarded. As the court brings together the strands of fact and context, it is pointedly aware that the criminal justice response to persistent “minor” offending cannot, over time, remain limited to admonishment or conditional diversion. The evidence before this court, corroborated by both professional and lay witnesses, demonstrates a settled pattern of dishonest conduct, a high level of planning and functional sophistication, and an ongoing risk both to commercial and community security. Further particulars of offence are documented in prosecution evidence as follows: On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. With each such incident, incremental yet real harm is visited upon retail staff, customers, and the durability of public trust in the routine functioning of neighbourhood commerce. The public safety dimension of this pattern is not speculative, but grounded in a clear trajectory of repeat conduct and a marked failure to even transiently desist following prior intervention. While no successful engagement with restorative justice or rehabilitation is documented in your history, the court nonetheless remains obliged to press for possible community-based interventions, consistent with national guidance on the reduction of reoffending. Your most recent history — as illuminated in the up-to-date probation assessment — contains no indication of co-offending or association with networks engaged in more serious forms of retail crime. The suggestion, made in defence mitigation, that criminality here is “purely opportunistic and not associated with a wider group” is noted and tentatively accepted, absent contrary evidence. I am mindful too of the general social and economic backdrop, particularly the declining efficacy of shop exclusion orders and the consequent adaptation of offender tactics (namely, the selection of target premises in areas with reduced private security presence and the use of face coverings configured to defeat facial recognition technology). The case before this court, while not at the most sophisticated end of the spectrum, does nonetheless engage with these broader themes. The final set of facts follows: Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. In considering the appropriate sentencing response, the court’s starting point is that a custodial sentence is plainly merited. The persistent and patterned nature of the conduct, the failure of both prior court intervention and community support routes, and the manifest harm to both victims and the public at large, all point to the necessity for a sentence that is both punitive and preventative. The mitigation available — early background hardship, periods of homelessness, lack of current substance dependence — is limited in either scope or practical effect, given the persistent refusal to engage with even basic assistance. Nevertheless, before determining the exact parameters of sentence, I direct the probation service to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report that addresses not only the conventional risk of reoffending but also the practical prospect of compliance with a community-based intervention, to include where appropriate a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, Unpaid Work Element, and the targeting of structured support services aimed at both financial management and employability. Any report should be structured in full accordance with current National Probation Service standards and should also explore, albeit briefly, the existence of any collateral obligations or restrictions arising from housing or civil family proceedings. In accordance with standard practice, sentencing is adjourned pending receipt and analysis of the said pre-sentence report, and for such further submissions as may be necessary in respect of mitigation or potential ancillary orders. The defendant is advised of his continuing right to seek legal advice and to present any further submissions of fact or mitigation by the time of the adjourned hearing. The proceedings are formally transcribed under the authority of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. These are the sentencing remarks of Her Honour Judge M. R. Faulkner, delivered this day, 16 May 2025, in Court 2 at the Crown Court at Parkland. Pursuant to section 174 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, reasons for sentence and analysis of all relevant materials are hereby recorded. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted in due course. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days of the date of sentencing. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved pending the outcome of sentencing.
