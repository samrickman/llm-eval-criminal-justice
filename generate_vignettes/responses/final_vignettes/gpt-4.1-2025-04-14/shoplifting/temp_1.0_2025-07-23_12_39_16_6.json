MR H Case No. Q2025/14492 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. S. BAINES Filed: 21 July 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your guilty plea to a single count of shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, committed on 3 April 2025, as well as for the consideration of relevant associated matters set forth in ancillary evidence and representations from both the Crown and the defence. The proceedings have unfolded in open session of this court, all parties represented, and with a full opportunity to adduce mitigation and context through the proper channels. I commence by outlining the procedural course of these proceedings, which, though prompted by what some might regard as a routine charge, have traversed a terrain both familiar and instructive in terms of contemporary criminal practice and the strains now commonly faced at every level of the system. You were first arrested on the evening of 4 April 2025, following identification by store security and subsequent attendance of Metropolitan Police South East Division officers at the premises. An initial police interview occurred on 5 April 2025 at Sidcup Police Station, under caution and with an accredited solicitor in attendance, during which you gave a largely “no comment” account, save for a brief interjection regarding your explanation for being present at the scene. Your charge was formally laid on 6 April 2025 and subsequent bail was granted with standard conditions: not to enter the premises in question, to report fortnightly to the local police station, and to attend all scheduled hearings. It would be remiss not to note, as has become almost habitual in such cases, the time and administrative cost incurred in processing what—at first blush—might be classed as minor offending. That cost is borne across the criminal justice landscape, from the reallocation of patrol hours to the fracturing of already stretched police and community liaison resources. Following initial remand to appear at the Bexley Magistrates’ Court, the matter was sent to the Crown Court on 13 May 2025, on account of aggravating features—namely, the repetitive nature of the alleged behaviour and the context provided by prior history. I am grateful to Ms Teresa Windsor, appearing for the Crown Prosecution Service, for her careful submissions in relation to charge selection, and to Mr Haroon Khalil of the duty defence panel, whose written representations were submitted on 26 May 2025. The court is also in receipt of correspondence from the Retail and Small Business Advocacy Network, offering insight into the broader community impact. Listing delays during the initial phase were occasioned by the rolling Court Service industrial action affecting non-urgent hearings in the South East region, as well as by the delayed provision of key disclosure items—specifically, the retrieval of digital evidence and the need for supplementary statements from at least two civilian witnesses who had since left the employment of the relevant retailer. The logistic and administrative quagmire that now encumbers the smooth running of even the least complex of cases warrants repeat commentary. It should not be necessary to reiterate that the act of obtaining CCTV footage, even in an age of ubiquitous surveillance, remains encumbered by technical failures, privacy redactions, time-stamp discrepancies, and attenuated chains of evidence. It is germane, in so far as it pertains to the present proceedings, to record the court’s appreciation for the technical unit at the New Eltham Forensic Media Facility, whose diligence in transcribing both visual footage and audio logs unavoidably postponed the readiness of case files until mid-June 2025. The local partnership between council officers, neighbourhood policing, and community crime prevention workers—with specific emphasis on the Bexley Retail Resilience Forum—was activated in response to a spate of offences in the locality. While such a response is, on paper, designed to expedite intelligence sharing and the drafting of impact assessments, the reality is that variations in data compatibility and shifting institutional priorities frequently render real-time collaboration elusive. The case was listed for plea on 1 July 2025. At that hearing, Mr H, you entered a guilty plea at the first realistic opportunity following the service of the prosecution’s bundle containing critical evidential items. The court records that plea and will extend appropriate credit in accordance with the Sentencing Council’s Defendants Pleading Guilty guideline. Nevertheless, the court would be remiss to refrain from observing, as set out in R v Barham [2022] EWCA Crim 1095 (notably a case concerning conspiracy to rob involving significant violence towards a taxi driver), that the timing of a plea is not a matter of mere procedure but a reflection of responsibility—a matter to which I shall return when considering personal mitigation. The facts of the instant case are as follows: Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. Turning from the particulars to broader context, it is apposite to note that this court’s caseload over the past twelve months has seen a marked increase in the proportion of retail thefts attributed, in procedural papers, to causes spanning economic hardship, substance misuse, and systematic underemployment. While these factors do not in themselves serve to exculpate, their routine citation ought to give policymakers pause. As remarked upon in R v Tamblin [2024] EWCA Crim 287—a matter involving persistent takeaway delivery fraud, theft, and insurance deception by a group of co-defendants (one of whom was subsequently charged with affray following an unrelated nightclub incident)—the intersection between economic strain and calculated dishonesty remains complex but hardly exonerating. You were observed on the date in question approaching the self-scan aisle while carrying two separate bags, positioning yourself so as to obscure direct sightlines with staff members. The store in question, an independent cooperative, has, regrettably, been the repeated subject of similar incidents in the past three years, necessitating extended hours for security staffing and the installation of additional deterrence measures. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. It is also necessary, at this juncture, to address certain aspects of community impact. The proactive submission to the court by the Bexley Small Traders Collective, as well as a statement from Ms Ivana Novak (franchise operator of the shop involved), underscores the erosion of confidence suffered by proprietors and frontline staff. Ms Novak describes a “chronic wariness” now afflicting evening shifts, particularly for junior staff and those working alone. This is not, I observe, a phenomenon restricted to large corporate entities. It is, rather, the cumulative attrition of trust and safety in environments once presumed to be the benign social heart of their neighbourhoods. I am in receipt of the pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Lindsay Thorpe, Senior Probation Officer, whose concise and forthright assessment I accept as professionally measured. Ms Thorpe notes that you are a 34-year-old male, currently residing in supported accommodation provided by Bexley Supported Living Trust. Employment has been sporadic, limited primarily to short-term agency cleaning positions and delivery work. You report that your finances have remained unstable since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, compounded by the cessation of Universal Credit advance payment streams. I further note your acknowledgment of persistent anxiety symptoms, correlating episodically with patterns of unstructured daily routine and periods of social withdrawal. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. You deny current problematic substance use, although you admit to heavy drinking in the weeks preceding the incident. The court is aware that many who come before it do so against a backdrop of longstanding dependence, often inadequately addressed by statutory services. It must also be said, with due candour, that the court can only form its assessment on the basis of evidence presented, not speculation. The court is also in possession of a psychiatric report prepared at the direction of the defence by Dr Osian Wallace, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist (Charlton Clinic). The report concludes that you present with features “consistent with mild depressive disorder and generalised anxiety, presently managed without pharmacological intervention.” The report is notable for its absence of any formal diagnosis of enduring psychotic illness or personality disorder, but remarks upon a tendency for “episodic impulsivity and compromised executive functioning, likely exacerbated by stressors of unemployment and housing instability.” That, in the opinion of Dr Wallace, may “contribute to a risk of re-offending if not adequately addressed through structured community intervention.” It is noted, as an administrative digression, that the court’s ability to commission timely psychiatric reports—particularly from NHS practitioners—has been diminished in the wake of recent service reorganisation and widespread shortages in forensic psychiatric availability. The matter of legal aid for such instruction was, on this occasion, protracted by the need for three rounds of supplementary engagement with the LAA, ultimately resolved only after persistent advocacy by Mr Khalil. This is an increasingly familiar—albeit unwelcome—pattern at this court. The present case forms yet another data point within an already grim trendline. The legal framework for sentencing in shoplifting cases of this kind is set out in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline, which applies an evaluative approach to harm and culpability, calibrated by factors such as value, impact upon staff, degree of planning, and the presence (or absence) of aggravating features such as use of threats or distraction. It is necessary to reiterate: the presence of a weapon, direct threats, or violence would be an escalator in seriousness, but in this instance, none are alleged. Instead, harm arises primarily by the repeat nature of the conduct, the targeting of a community-centred retailer, and the effect upon morale and perceived safety. In this context, the court is mindful of the Court of Appeal’s approach in R v Newman [2023] EWCA Crim 853, in which the defendant, Mr Newman, was convicted of multiple offences arising from a prolonged series of shop thefts—a matter that spiralled into associated charges of common assault and possession of a bladed article during a separate, later incident involving a city-centre off-licence. That context, while illuminating as to escalation risks, does not bear directly on the instant matter, which remains at the level of acquisitive offending alone. Mr H used a question about Oyster Card transactions to divert the shopkeeper’s attention, then leaned over the counter to take a displayed item. In considering aggravating and mitigating factors, the court is further directed to the guidance in R v Bartholomew [2021] EWCA Crim 1020, which concerned the deliberate targeting of small businesses by a defendant who feigned illness to distract staff and secure the theft of high-value electronic items. Though Mr Bartholomew’s case resulted in a custodial term of 32 months—arising, inter alia, from the defendant’s prior conviction for armed robbery and evidence of recruitment of a minor as accomplice—the strict legal principles circumstancing shop theft remain applicable, namely that the degree of planning, repeat victim targeting, and residual impact upon community confidence are all relevant. The court abstractly notes, as is made explicit in the Sentencing Council’s guideline foreword: “The monetary value, while a material consideration, is subordinate to the effect upon those targeted; theft from small, locally operated stores is recognised as being especially injurious by reason of the community function such premises serve.” The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that no violence or threat thereof occurred in your case is mitigating, and there are no aggravating features of group offending, weapons, or other forms of escalation as seen in recent local cases of concern. Reference is made to the community impact statement lodged by the Bexley Safer Neighbourhood Board, which asserts that “repeated low-value shop theft serves as a bellwether for wider disintegration in community trust and staff security.” This court is familiar with such assertions, many of which are confirmed by regular quarterly reviews of incident reports and the increasing expenditure on security infrastructure by formerly “open-door” community premises. It is perhaps instructive, albeit tangentially, to acknowledge the findings of the criminal intelligence review conducted by Ms Harriet Baines (Bexley Public Protection Partnership, April 2024), which identified a clustering of retail crime in the district adjacent to the Bexleyheath Broadway. That study, while primarily statistical, referenced a spike in low-level thefts correlating with closures or relocations of chain retailers—phenomena attributed more to macroeconomic than criminal factors. The review offered a number of recommendations for target-hardening and prioritised police presence, but records little evidence of substantial inter-agency resource augmentation. I wish to record the court’s appreciation for the assistance provided by Ms Chloe Underwood and the staff of Outreach Connect, a voluntary sector organisation furnishing housing assistance and benefits advice. Ms Underwood’s letter highlights your intermittent but sincere engagement with support services, albeit undermined by periods of disengagement and reluctance to attend scheduled sessions on a consistent basis. While such behaviour is regrettably common among persons experiencing housing instability, effort to persist in engagement is not without merit. I am further in receipt of a brief but lucid reference from Dr Malcolm Thurston, acting as your GP since December 2022, who attests to a historical pattern of non-attendance at medical reviews and sporadic prescriptions for mild anxiety and sleep disturbance. There is no history of severe psychiatric disorder or referral to crisis mental health services. The medical record, in this respect, is largely unremarkable, save for a brief episode in mid-2023 following loss of employment and a short period of rough sleeping in the Erith area. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. Turning to your antecedents, the court notes four prior convictions: two for minor non-dwelling theft, one for attempted shoplifting (community resolution, 2022), and a single caution for possession of cannabis in a social setting (unrelated to the instant facts). There are no convictions for violence, dishonesty outside retail premises, or offences against the person. It is unnecessary to dwell on cases such as R v Moughty [2018] EWCA Crim 922—where the defendant, co-charged with burglary of a private dwelling and found in possession of an imitation firearm, received a lengthy custodial sentence—other than to observe that the present matter lies at the lower end of both harm and culpability as statutorily defined. Defence mitigation is well made. Mr Khalil, in his thorough and measured oral address, urges the court to accord substantial weight to the acknowledged difficulties with unstable housing, interrupted employment, and adverse mental health. The court accepts that these are real and continuing challenges, though they do not of themselves absolve personal responsibility. The pre-sentence report is clear: you have not accessed all support offered to you, but there is evidence of recent effort—specifically, attendance at financial management workshops and intermittent participation in a peer support group for those in precarious housing. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. A further letter, tendered by your sister Ms Edwina H., expresses both concern for your welfare and a willingness to offer temporary accommodation subject to the imposition and enforcement of structured conditions as part of any sentence. The Local Authority’s Adult Social Care Team has provided a safeguarding risk assessment, which, though preliminary, records no findings of capacity impairment, exploitation, or vulnerability beyond that occasioned by housing instability and low mood. The Local Authority is prepared, in the event of a community-based disposal, to secure temporary place within a supported accommodation scheme, subject to necessary checks and your continued engagement with statutory obligations. It is also worth setting the present case against the backdrop of wider criminal justice trends. The better part of two decades spent sentencing acquisitive offending has seen the gradual but unmistakable drift towards greater reliance on community intervention, as opposed to short custodial sentences—an evolution driven in part by the weight of evidence documenting poor rehabilitative outcomes following brief terms of imprisonment. This view finds support, albeit obliquely, in the observations of the House of Commons Justice Committee (Select Report on Reoffending, February 2025), which underscored a “critical need for intervention at points of social disintegration rather than criminal escalation.” The Committee, incidentally, commented upon several high-profile cases of recidivism arising from insufficient post-release supervision—one such case involving the now notorious “Superstore Gang,” whose ringleader, Mr Robin Manners, became the subject of an aggravated burglary charge following an early release on parole from an 18-month custodial sentence for commercial shop theft. Though of no factual relevance to the instant matter, these developments inform the task of weighing general risk against individual pathways to rehabilitation. In reviewing agencies’ efforts, I wish to place on record the court’s commendation for the Bexley Youth Hub and the South Thames Resettlement Partnership, who—despite considerable funding constraints and persistent staff turnover—have continued to provide appropriate guidance and practical support to those at risk of repeat offending. Their resilience, measured not in output but in perseverance against an ever-rising tide of demand, is deserving of recognition. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. It is also of some moment to remark that, while the court is sometimes pressed with cases of co-defendants or group offending, no such feature arises here. The sophistication often observed with “distraction crews” or those employing systematic “bag and dash” techniques to overwhelm store security is absent. You acted alone and without recourse to violence. There is in the court’s file an anonymised impact assessment from the Retail Loss Prevention Board, survey date April 2024, detailing the increasing prevalence of shopfloor staff reduction in response to loss, as well as the adaptation of “gatekeeper” policies by formerly open-access stores. While this survey is largely statistical, and its findings not unique to this borough, it provides a chilling sightline into the gradual withdrawal of retail sector goodwill and the social compact it once embodied. I am keenly aware, as would be any sentencer reading contemporary output from academic criminology and social policy reviews, of the ongoing debate regarding the supposed cyclical relationship between poverty, exclusion, and offending. While it is not the function of the Crown Court to settle such matters, the court is bound to account for structural disadvantage only so far as it explains, not excuses, proven criminal conduct. Having weighed the evidence and submissions, I am of the view that this offending lies within Category 3 of the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline, with medium culpability (on account of the planning and repeat targeting) and low to medium harm (reflecting staff impact, remedial costs, and community context). The late but significant engagement with support services and the early guilty plea are relevant mitigating factors. There remains, however, the persistent risk attendant to unresolved housing and employment needs—a risk most acute where previous interventions have failed to produce lasting behavioural change. Accordingly, the most proportionate disposal may well be a community-based order with a specified rehabilitation activity requirement, combined with targeted supervision and a review mechanism to ensure compliance. The court is, however, not disposed to sentence today without the benefit of a full and up-to-date pre-sentence report. I therefore adjourn sentencing to mid-August 2025, with directions to the Probation Service to provide a focused assessment addressing: (a) the suitability of a mental health treatment requirement; (b) the practicality of engagement with structured work or training; and (c) the availability and relevance of ongoing supported accommodation or family-based alternatives. Any breach of bail conditions prior to sentencing will, of course, necessitate immediate reconsideration of remand status. The defendant is reminded of the continuing duty to cooperate with all appointments arranged by the Probation Service and any recommended support agency. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 21 July 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bexleyheath. Proceedings are recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules and will be made available for transcription. The defendant is advised of his right to seek leave to appeal within 28 days under the provisions of section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No restrictions as to reporting are engaged. The matter stands adjourned for sentence to the next available date following provision of the pre-sentence report.
