MR H Case No. T2025/17652 Sentencing Remarks of Her Honour Judge M. I. FRAMPTON Delivered: 7 May 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing in respect of one count of theft from a shop, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The events in question occurred over a period stretching from late January to mid-March 2025, principally within the Southfield District Shopping Quarter and adjoining retail parks. The charge is a representative one and the facts have been accepted by you in full following a late plea of guilty. This court is convened in accordance with the rules of open justice. Proceedings have been transcribed and all parties are present: Ms Jasmine Bellew for the Crown, instructed by the Southfield Branch Prosecution Service, and Mr Simran O’Rourke for the defence, acting further to a grant of Legal Aid representation. It is necessary and required for the record to reflect the procedural journey which has preceded this sentencing hearing. You, Mr H, were first arrested on 14 March 2025, after receiving three warnings under the town-centre exclusion protocol and on the authority of a Section 136 dispersal notice issued by Inspector K. A. Miller of the City Response Unit. Your arrest was the culmination of several weeks’ co-ordinated operation by Southfield Community Policing in conjunction with the Retail Crime Intelligence Group, involving the collation and cross-referencing of incident reports submitted by a variety of local businesses, including national chains and independently owned outlets. Initial summaries flagged a pattern familiar to those acquainted with contemporary urban retail crime: items of relatively modest value being taken on a frequent, almost routine, basis; staff demoralised and discouraged from reporting due to the perceived futility of repeated engagement with overstretched authorities. This court, regrettably, is well versed in the realities and consequences of acquisitive offending of this type. Despite the frequency of its occurrence, the harm caused—emotional, social, and financial—is neither abstract nor trivial. The well-worn assertion that shoplifting is a 'victimless' crime finds little support in evidence or in lived experience. The effects extend far beyond simple monetary loss. One cashier describes feeling “unsafe closing up in the evening”; a security guard reports repeated abuse from defendants emboldened by a culture of perceived impunity. There is an undeniable cumulative toll—on small business viability, on staff retention, and on the broader fabric of neighbourhood trust. The procedural history of this matter is not without its own catalogue of complexities and frustrations. This case was first listed in the Magistrates’ Court on 18 March 2025. At that time, the defendant was unrepresented owing to an administrative bottleneck within the Public Defender Service arising from a simultaneous relocation of its Southfield offices. The hearing was adjourned and transferred to this court under the provisions of the Early Guilty Plea (Retail Theft) Protocol and on account of a stated intention to enter a guilty plea to the consolidated charge sheet. Subsequent hearings were subject to delay due to the unavailability of an approved interpreter for the defendant’s mother, who attends all court proceedings as next of kin and for oversight under the provisions of the Carers and Supporters Charter 2019. It is lamentable, though by no means unique, that cases such as this are increasingly deferred or complicated by issues originating well beyond the control of either defence or prosecution—ranging from interpreter shortages to last-minute withdrawal of legal aid authorities, and further to strike action affecting the Independent Court Clerks’ Association on 22 March. This is but one more example of the external forces which, however indirectly, serve to protract proceedings, weaken public confidence, and inflate the human and administrative cost associated with the prosecution of acquisitive offending. I intend, for the purposes of the record, to place on file my appreciation for those agencies who have contributed detailed reports to this court. In particular, the Court thanks the Duty Probation Officer, Ms J. Tilling; Mr Mauricio Kelleher, Community Sentences Liaison from the Pathway Trust; Dr Charlotte Ng, Consultant Forensic Psychologist whose expertise was sought—after inevitable and regrettable delay—via the Legal Aid Agency’s emergency panel; and finally, the Safer Retail Coalition, whose written submission has shed welcome light on patterns of harm encountered by frontline retail staff. Such submissions bring into sharp relief the pressures currently experienced not merely by victims, but also by those tasked with the administration of even the most basic forms of justice. The recent report commissioned by the Southfield Chamber of Commerce revealed that 42% of small retailers have considered reducing opening hours due to persistent low-level theft, whilst 18% reported a direct effect on decisions to hire new staff. That these impacts are unevenly borne—falling most heavily on neighbourhood stores dependent upon thin margins—is a reality which must inform, even if not drive, the exercise of sentencing discretion. It is customary, though often overlooked, to acknowledge the conduct of parties and counsel. I wish to express my gratitude to Ms Jasmine Bellew for her clarity and restraint in presentation, and to Mr Simran O’Rourke who, despite being granted carriage of this matter at short notice owing to consecutive illness of his instructing solicitor, provided a careful and measured set of submissions. In a climate where delays are routinely exacerbated by procedural and resource-related bottlenecks, such professionalism ought not to pass unnoticed. I am, however, obliged to place on record my growing concern regarding the increasing administrative burden imposed on both the court and legal practitioners by the Legal Aid Agency’s current approach to expert funding. In this case, an initial request for authorisation to commission a clinical psychological assessment was submitted as early as 28 March. No substantive response was received for over three weeks. It was only after multiple chaser emails, intervention from the Southfield Law Centre, and an unorthodox application under Standing Order 14 that approval was grudgingly provided. Such delays have a domino effect: hearings must be relisted; practitioners cannot properly advise; defendants remain in uncertainty as to their ultimate fate. The broader question—whether, and for how long, the publicly-funded defence can sustain routine exposure to such administrative attrition—remains unanswered but is increasingly unavoidable. Before turning to the facts of the current case, it is, I think, nudged by practice and prudence to consider briefly the wider context in which retail theft has become so prevalent a feature of the criminal justice landscape. There is, unmistakably, an atmosphere of normalisation at work—a sense in which low-level but persistent acquisitive offending is tolerated with a degree of bureaucratic resignation. Comments from the Pre-Sentence Report submitted by Ms Tilling are indicative: “It must be noted that patterns of reoffending exhibit a significant correlation with factors identified as external to character or personal resolve, including—but not limited to—unstable accommodation, substance-adjacent environments, and disruption to benefit entitlement.” This climate of expectation—almost of inevitability—has a corrosive effect. Staff on modest wages are left to shoulder the burden of repeat, demoralising encounters; the volume of paperwork required to sustain even the possibility of a prosecution grows disproportionately; and neighbourhood retail diversity, once seen as a strength of the community, is steadily eroded. There is a tendency to view these developments in the abstract, but they have intimate and personal consequences for those whose livelihoods and peace of mind are most directly affected. The court is aided by community impact statements, one of which I quote from directly: “We have stopped stocking certain high-value items because the risk of theft is too great. This means loyal customers are inconvenienced and, over time, we lose their regular business. It’s getting to the point where we question whether remaining open is viable.” Such statements are as sobering as they are familiar. Turning now to the facts, I will summarise the gist of the Crown’s case and your admissions, Mr H. It is in accordance with the usual practice to set these out, not by way of elaboration—since your plea obviates the need for proof—but to ground my later remarks in a foundation of what has been accepted and established. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. It is admitted by you that, over several distinct occasions, you acted alone and with a measure of premeditation. You were apprehended in possession of a distinctive holdall, matching the description given by several eye-witnesses, containing various items with labels still affixed—suggestive not of opportunistic impulse, but of calculated intent. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. Further, on at least two separate dates, you returned to the same premises notwithstanding the earlier exclusion notice issued by store management under the Southfield Safe Retail Scheme. Video evidence supplied by the Crown consists of multiple CCTV clips depicting you in acts of concealment and hurried departure; these, when taken with supporting witness statements from retail staff, create a body of evidence that is both detailed and persuasive. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. On arrest, you made no reply to cautions but subsequently provided a brief written statement through your solicitor, in which you accepted responsibility but attributed your conduct to a confluence of financial distress, recent relationship breakdown, and emotional instability. The presentence documentation highlights a sporadic work record, periods of unstable housing, and intermittent engagement with local support services, particularly the Southfield Community Recovery Initiative, whose case notes—while incomplete—do flag a period of abstinence from petty offending during the latter half of 2024. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. At this stage it falls to me to consider the relevance of your personal circumstances in mitigation. Dr. Charlotte Ng’s forensic psychological report, commissioned after noted delays, details longstanding issues with impulsivity and maladaptive coping. The report is explicit that Mr H “does not suffer from a diagnosable major mental disorder; rather, the clinical picture is one of ongoing difficulty with emotional regulation, compounded by a sense of transience and absence of positive adult anchors.” The history of prior engagement with addiction services, though sporadic, is at least indicative of some recognition, on your part, of the need to address offending behaviour. Nevertheless, that engagement was neither robust nor sustained. The court cannot ignore the reality that the mechanisms for diversion and support do exist, even if increasingly strained by high caseloads and reduced funding. There remains an expectation, not just from the public but from the law, that those who seek mitigation on the grounds of hardship at least demonstrate some positive effort to avail themselves of that support. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. For completeness, I must also refer to your criminal record. You have five prior convictions, four of which are for shoplifting and dishonesty-related matters, the most recent resulting in a suspended sentence order handed down by the Northborough Magistrates’ Court on 21 September 2023. The breach of that order is acknowledged on the breach notice dated 2 April 2025 and constitutes an aggravating feature to which the court must have due regard. The criminal history is, as Ms Bellew notes, not so extensive as to be irredeemable, but neither is it trivial nor remote. I read with particular attention the record of compliance with previous probation appointments—it is, at best, inconsistent. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. The Sentencing Council guideline on theft offences is explicit both as to the general threshold for severity and the factors—aggravating or mitigating—with which the court is required to engage. The repeated targeting of the same or similar premises; entry in defiance of civil exclusion orders; impact on vulnerable or isolated staff working alone or during late hours; these features are all present to some degree in this case. I remind myself of the principle articulated in R v Jefferies [2022] EWCA Crim 1157, where the Court of Appeal reaffirmed that “patterned and persistent retail theft…must not be treated as a matter of mere administrative burden, but rather as conduct which, left unchecked, rapidly erodes the conditions of public trust upon which civil commerce depends.” Though Jefferies involved a large-scale conspiracy network orchestrating theft from major department stores, its observations regarding the cumulative effect of offending are salient. It is, however, important not to be distracted by the factual extremes of appellate case law. I am conscious that R v Brayshaw [2023] EWCA Crim 1915 involved persistent burglary of commercial units, conducted during hours of darkness, with forced entry, and accompanied by damage to property, including the disabling of CCTV. There, the sentence of four years’ immediate custody was upheld. The factual matrix in Brayshaw is vastly more aggravated than the present matter and I do not permit it to unduly colour my analysis. I must also specifically address an argument advanced by the Crown this morning: namely, that proximity of the retail units to the Parkview Under-16 Community Centre constitutes a statutory aggravating factor. This is not correct. While Parliament has seen fit to introduce location-based sentencing enhancements for certain drug-related and violent offences near schools and youth provision, there is no corresponding provision for retail theft. The temptation to analogise must not obscure the limits of the current legislative framework. It is appropriate, for completeness, to mention that co-defendant Tanya J, originally charged under the same information and alleged to have been present during one incident on 7 March, was neither required nor called at any stage of these proceedings. The Crown confirmed in open court that the charges against her in relation to possession of a prohibited article—a can of incapacitant spray located in her handbag during arrest—were discontinued for lack of evidential sufficiency. There is no suggestion on the materials before me that her conduct bears in any way upon the behaviour for which Mr H is to be sentenced today. At this juncture I pause to correct a matter raised in correspondence from the Southfield Tenants’ Association. There is reference in their letter to a recent burglary of a flat at Larchworth House, reportedly committed while the occupant was on holiday in Spain. I have reviewed police attendance logs and am satisfied that this incident is wholly unconnected to Mr H or to the present proceedings. I make no finding, express or implied, as to the defendant’s proximity or involvement in that matter and disregard the reference as non-probative. Turning back to the personal mitigation, I have considered the letter written by your stepfather, Mr Lubin, and the supporting affidavits from Ms Priya Kaur, Community Engagement Lead at Roots Homeless Outreach, and Mr Anthony Black, Caseworker at the Open Horizons Supported Housing Trust. These materials depict a complex personal background of instability and periods of estrangement from family members. While I acknowledge the adverse circumstances described—namely, the breakdown of parental relationships and a sequence of short-term housing placements—I am mindful of the need to situate such factors within the framework of personal accountability outlined at paragraph 18 of the Sentencing Council’s Guidelines (2021 revision): “Context and adversity provide explanation; they do not absolve an adult of decision-making responsibility.” On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. The defence, through Mr O’Rourke, has asked the court to give weight to the evidence of recent attempts at voluntary work with the Park Lane Reuse Centre and an application (currently pending) for supported employment through the Southfield Employability Pathways Project. These are positive steps and, while I make no ruling at this stage as to the likelihood of sustained engagement, I accept that they evince, at least in part, a recognition of the negative cycle in which you have been caught. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. Before moving to the procedural conclusion, I am obliged to reflect briefly on two further matters which have, in recent months, affected the wider context in which sentencing for retail theft is undertaken. First, the continued expansion of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership model—which, in the Southfield area, has enabled a more coherent flow of intelligence and a marked increase in both reporting and detection rates—should be acknowledged. While the national picture is uneven, the local scheme has drawn particular praise from the Chamber of Commerce and the Retailers’ Federation, and the court records the professionalism of all those involved. Secondly, I must address the persistent challenge posed by diminished local authority funding for specialist housing and addiction support. The written evidence from the Pathway Trust includes a note that their Southfield outreach team, which was historically staffed by eight full-time caseworkers, has now been reduced to three. The result, as outlined by Ms Kaur and endorsed in the pre-sentence report, is an inevitable thinning of provision, longer waiting lists, and a greater reliance on non-statutory and voluntary sector actors. I note, in this context, that cases such as yours—where underlying instability and disconnection fuel recurring cycles of crime—cannot be fully resolved by sentencing alone. The capacity of the justice system to address root causes is, however, circumscribed by operational and resource realities. I remind myself, finally, that sentence in this court must serve not only the ends of punishment and deterrence, but must also pay heed to the prospects for rehabilitation and reductions in future risk. The paramount statutory purpose, as set out in section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, remains the reduction of crime and the protection of the public. It is with that in mind that I determine, as a matter of law and of discretion, that a pre-sentence report is required. There is insufficient up-to-date information available to guide the court as to the suitability of a community order incorporating a structured intervention under the Community Rehabilitation Company, or as regards the appropriateness of an immediate custodial sentence, short or suspended. The Probation Service is to produce a full report within 21 days, to include recommendations as to any rehabilitation activity requirement or unpaid work element, and to address explicitly the issue of compliance with previous supervisory orders. This matter will therefore stand adjourned for the purpose of obtaining that pre-sentence report. Mr H, you are remanded on unconditional bail until that time. You are advised of your right to legal representation and to make further written or oral submissions at the resumed hearing. Any ancillary reporting restrictions already in force under section 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 shall continue until further order.
