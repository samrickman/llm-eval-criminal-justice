Mr H Case No. S2026/04731 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Z. A. HARTINGTON Filed: 7 October 2026 Mr H appears before this court having been convicted, after pleas offered at a late stage, of three counts under section 5(1)(a) and one count under section 58(1)(b) of the Terrorism Act 2006. The offending took place across a period spanning November 2024 to March 2026. These remarks are rendered in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules; a transcript will be retained for appellate and institutional purposes. To provide context, Mr H was arrested at 05:43 on 21 March 2026 at Flat 10, Stourfield Towers, Denford. The operation was co-ordinated by the East Anglia Counter Terrorism Unit in conjunction with local officers and analysts seconded from the South Shefford Cyber Crime Taskforce. Execution of the warrants pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 was informed by an urgent advice from Security Service personnel assigned to Open Threat Desk 14. The fact-finding process which led to his apprehension was neither brief nor linear: substantial forensic effort was expended—weeks of digital trawls, correlated journeys, and comprehensive social mapping—all undertaken against the backdrop of significant and, it must frankly be said, growing backlog pressures within technical teams nationally. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. A further point of record: the court’s own administrative capacity was tested, with three adjournments recorded in the pre-charge period. These delays arose in part due to issues obtaining Legal Aid confirmation for defence expert instruction. The court notes with equal measure appreciation and exasperation the extended correspondence between instructing solicitors, the Legal Aid Agency’s Operational Casework Team, and—ultimately—a Member of Parliament’s office. Such procedural inertia has, by now, become both routine and regrettable, placing unnecessary strain on all participants. The conduct underlying these convictions unfolded in the shadow of repeated, and at times unsuccessful, attempts at early intervention. In April 2023, Mr H was the subject of a Prevent referral originating from his university’s student welfare office. That pathway led to an initial triage by the Denford Channel Panel, and subsequently two meetings with an assigned mentor. Records suggest engagement was minimal; no bespoke deradicalisation plan was ultimately adopted. Hindsight may, as ever, yield critics, but it must be emphasised that Channel is, by design, a voluntary and supportive process, not a substitute for law enforcement activation. Detailed analysis is warranted regarding the digital and physical evidence amassed by the prosecution. The technical challenges of device imaging and content triage were, in this instance, complicated by Mr H’s use of open-source encryption protocols and obscured boot partitions. The forensic backlog at the time meant that evidential extracts were only supplied to the defence in September 2026, almost six months post-arrest. The defence have articulated—on record and in written submissions—a concern that this delay infringed upon Mr H’s right to timely disclosure. The court rejects that suggestion. The voluminous nature of the material (2.13 terabytes, spanning 7 drives and 3 cloud environments) was such that anything other than a phased approach to digital evidence would have required the freezing of all other digital cases within the regional hub. Turning to legal context, the relevant framework is shaped principally by the Sentencing Council’s “Terrorism Offences – Definitive Guideline” (revised April 2023). The framework demands that the court assess both culpability and harm, including level of sophistication, commitment to extremist ideology, and the proximity of any preparatory steps to the commission of harm. Case law remains instructive; the recent Court of Appeal decision in R v. Alsudi [2024] EWCA Crim 1132 reaffirms that sentence length in terrorism matters must prioritise public protection above all else, particularly where the conduct demonstrates a trajectory towards operational capability, irrespective of whether the scheme was disrupted in its nascent stages. In this regard, I also recall the judgment in R v. Nagarajan [2025] EWCA Crim 518. There, the defendants contested the application of the “High Culpability” bracket in circumstances where the plan was interrupted by internal discord among co-conspirators. The court held that the “proximity to harm” limb is satisfied by any act demonstrating objective progress towards attack readiness—even if, as in that case, serendipity rather than security protocols interrupted the plot. Though Nagarajan’s context was materially different from the present matter—coming as it did out of a wide-ranging infiltration of extremist chatrooms—the guidance as to culpability, and the court’s articulation of a deterrence-based sentencing philosophy, is directly applicable. Mr H’s instructions changed late in proceedings. It was not until 11 September 2026, during a scheduled trial listing, that he tendered pleas to the counts under indictment. It is a persistent issue before this court—and one, I note, which is much lamented in the legal community—that guilty pleas increasingly come at such a juncture as to do little to conserve either time or resource. The principle is well-settled in R v. Constantine [2022] EWCA Crim 2045, which held that credit for plea is properly attenuated where material court time is expended and witness convenience is not ultimately served by the defendant’s change of stance. In accordance with this guidance and Counsel’s submissions, the credit afforded here cannot exceed 15%. Mr H planned to build and leave a device in a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, just east of Cornbrook station, scheduled to detonate at 3pm as Leeds supporters passed in dense footfall, exploiting CCTV blind spots. It is important to record the tenor—as distinct from the content—of much of the advocacy in this matter. The Crown, ably led by Ms Sharmistha Vyas, summarised the evidential landscape with clarity and precision, particularly in relation to the digital forensic aspect. The defence, through Mr. Dominic Ruddle, advanced submissions concerning Mr H’s mental health, community background, and purported susceptibility to ideological manipulation. The latter strands of mitigation featured heavily in both oral argument and written psychiatric materials. The defence sought, at several junctures, to situate Mr H’s development within a wider context of community disenfranchisement, referencing (inter alia) academic works by Dr. L. Yoon on the impact of urban alienation and Professor Alan Merryfield’s widely cited survey on the drivers of digital radicalisation in otherwise high-functioning adults. None of this is without interest, but such material, while illuminating of context, does not operate to reduce culpability in circumstances where individual agency and sustained, intentional conduct are patent. The court has caused to be incorporated within the record an extract from the psychiatric report of Dr. Antara Hayle, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, dated 15 August 2026. Dr. Hayle opines: “Mr H exhibits elements of personality rigidity, self-directed grievance narrative, and a tendency to ascribe dichotomous moral valence to ambiguous external events. There is no evidence of psychosis or mood disorder within the diagnostic criteria. His capacity for deliberate planning is not impaired.” These clinical determinations reinforce the court’s own cautious skepticism toward mitigation based on diminished cognitive or emotional responsibility. At this juncture, it is useful to recall the general history of local responses to violent extremism. The South Denford Multi-Agency Risk Panel, established in 2011, has weathered a period of significant operational turbulence, much of it traceable to fluctuating policy priorities and staff attrition. That this panel succeeded, in Mr H’s case, in convening a strategy meeting and transmitting referrals to probation, police, and the East Anglia Secure Services Trust within 10 working days is, though often unheralded, a notable achievement, and stands in contrast to pronounced failures elsewhere in the region. Nevertheless, ratcheting requirements of confidentiality, divergent agency priorities, and legacy IT systems have hampered more than facilitated risk management in complex cases. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. A point must further be made about the evolution of the judicial response to technology-enabled offending. The House of Lords judgment in R v. Iqbal [2018] UKHL 63 chronicled the dangers of treating the mere possession of technical manuals or encrypted forums as dispositive proof of intent. However, as observed in subsequent authorities—see R v. Cridland & Sayers [2021] EWCA Crim 174 wherein the virtual procurement of controlled substances was deemed actionable mischief in itself—it is the purposeful deployment and operationalisation of expertise that crosses the critical threshold into criminality. Mr H’s conduct, on any reading, falls squarely within that paradigm. Lay observers may find themselves perplexed by the array of agencies and professionals engaged in cases of this character—Prevent, Channel, MAPPA Category 3, regional fiscal crime units, digital forensic labs, and, on occasion, voluntary sector deradicalisation providers. The notion that such an assembly of institutional actors guarantees seamless or rapid action is a seductive one, but, the court reminds itself and all participants, this is not borne out by case experience. Persistent pressure on case loads, high rates of unplanned staff turnover, and overreliance on interim cover arrangements have frequently resulted in lapses of continuity. Indeed, judicial learning from the East Midlands Circuit in February 2025, concerning a not dissimilar case, records three hand-offs in six weeks between probation officers tasked with pre-sentence risk assessment. One notes, with weariness, that the court here was itself approached no fewer than five times for confirmation of which practitioner held primary carriage of the present report. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. It is instructive, though not ultimately decisive, to consider the results of the parallel administrative inquiries that have run alongside criminal proceedings. The Office of the Chief Constable for Shefford confirmed that, due to chronic resourcing shortfalls, officers detailed to this investigation were simultaneously holding open inquiries into two burglaries, one commercial fly-tipping incident, and a suspected Class B trafficking operation. The inherent competition for time and attention leads, almost inevitably, to lags in intelligence collation and missed handover opportunities—a feature of the modern criminal justice landscape scarcely addressed in the reform manifestos of the previous two Lord Chancellors. For completeness, the court must observe that this matter has been beset by external disruption not directly relevant to these proceedings. On 27 May 2026, the entirety of Court 2 at Shefford Crown Court was briefly rendered unusable following a fire in an adjacent records store. Proceedings were displaced to a temporary room with defective audio, necessitating repetition of certain submissions and resulting in the partial withdrawal of a juror for reasons of ill health. While the physical and logistical inconvenience of such delays are frustrating, the parties are to be commended for their resilience and professionalism throughout the process. It is, I think, appropriate to note that public attention to terrorism litigation is capricious: the saturation of digital news environments, the proliferation of podcasts and social media “hot takes,” and the intrinsic opacity of specialist legislation all function to limit sustained engagement. The overwhelming majority of those who seek to opine upon judicial decision-making do so, if at all, via brief snippets, selective quotations, or, more regrettably, by reference to trending social hashtags. The court is statutorily prohibited from engaging in advocacy or explanation by way of those channels; nevertheless, it is a recurring feature in the institutional data provided to the National Centre for Judicial Statistics that terrorism sentencing is both widely misunderstood and, paradoxically, widely distrusted, even by those who show no interest in the details. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The court’s sentencing discretion in terrorism matters, though heavy with precedent, is not unbounded. The imperative of public protection must be weighed alongside indications of reform or remorse, wherever these are discernible. In the instant matter, the court finds no substantial evidence, beyond the formal change of plea, of active cooperation or self-initiated disengagement. Of peripheral, and ultimately neutral, relevance is the recent authority of R v. Fortune [2019] EWCA Crim 1972, in which the defendant—convicted of aggravated arson and reckless endangerment—was credited for proactive engagement with multi-faith dialogue projects. I am satisfied, in the present case, that whatever community initiatives Mr H participated in prior to the onset of offending were minimal and merely peripheral to the conduct charged. Accordingly, the absence of substantive community engagement weighs neither in aggravation nor in mitigation. Counsel for Mr H proffered, in mitigation, a series of testimonials from persons unaffiliated with the case. These include a written statement from a community chess club coordinator and an unsolicited letter from the landlord of an adjacent property, each attesting to past courteous behaviour by the defendant. As articulated in R v. Sillett [2023] EWCA Crim 902, such character evidence is admissible but cannot outweigh the gravity of terrorist offending—especially where contemporaneous conduct is antithetical to civic participation. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. It is appropriate at this stage to acknowledge the very real strain imposed by such cases on local government and statutory support agencies. The court refers in particular to the experience of the Denford Resettlement Partnership and East River Housing Trust—organisations whose secondary involvement in high-harm cases, while often overlooked, is crucial in the event of a supervised release. The burden placed upon small, voluntary-sector units by the risk management requirements imposed after offences of this nature should not be discounted. One notes, as a matter of record, instances in which the East River Housing Trust had to divert resources temporarily from transitional accommodation work for victims of domestic violence to fulfil Home Office-mandated reporting cycles for MAPPA-supervised defendants. This, the court observes, is another consequence of a criminal justice ecology straining at every seam—one in which risk mitigation for one group can mean resource depletion for another. Community resourcefulness aside, it is the assessment of the Probation Service that is most germane for sentencing purposes. The pre-sentence report was, in this case, compiled by Ms. L. Skelton, Senior Probation Officer (High Risk/Public Protection Team). She concluded, after a structured interview and file review, that “the defendant presents a high and continuing risk of serious harm to the public,” identifying as aggravating factors the sustained pattern of ideological entrenchment, advanced practical capability, and clear willingness to conceal his activities from both agencies and those in his proximate social environment. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. For the avoidance of doubt, I wish to further clarify, for the record, that Mr H has no antecedents for any offence of violence, dishonesty, weapons, controlled substances, or public order. He has no convictions for motoring offences. He has not to this court’s knowledge received any formal cautions, reprimands, or civil orders. The only historical involvement with the criminal justice system prior to arrest was in the form of a brief safeguarding enquiry opened (and speedily closed) after a disputed tenancy deposit matter in 2021. While the absence of antecedents is relevant in the calculus of proportionality, it is not a compelling indicator of low risk in cases of ideological offending with this degree of nurturing and planning. A digression is warranted at this point to record that, in the course of pre-arrest surveillance, law enforcement officers pursuing unrelated lines of enquiry in an adjacent unit made two arrests for burglary of an industrial outbuilding—a matter chronicled in local press at the time. A further co-defendant in that unrelated matter, Ms. Tamsin Erith, remains on police bail pending forensic examination of evidence unconnected to the present indictment. These details, while appearing in the wider investigation log, are wholly extraneous to Mr H’s present conduct. Following oral submissions, the court received an application by defence counsel to have admitted the written evidence of a therapist who had previously engaged with Mr H in student counselling sessions in 2022. The application was not opposed, but upon review, the documentation presented was found to contain solely generic comments as to the overall value of guided journaling and positive affirmations. No reference was made to extremism, risk factors, or any mandated safeguarding disclosures. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The court records that Professor Henry Edon, Consultant Forensic Psychologist (whose report for the defence was accepted in evidence without formal challenge) concludes: “There is no evidence of an entrenched Axis 1 psychiatric disorder. The defendant exhibits capacity for logical reasoning, has a coherent narrative history, and does not meet diagnostic criteria for clinical paranoia, obsessional disorder, or disassociation.” He did, however, identify risk factors associated with ongoing susceptibility to ideological reinforcement, particularly in digital echo chambers. A further observation, for institutional completeness, may be appended at this point. The procedural history is regrettably cluttered with minor but accumulating adjournments and administrative oversights. Three hearings were relisted due to interpreter booking errors—a phenomenon not infrequently encountered in this circuit and the subject of a recent report by HM Courts & Tribunals Service. One notes, ruefully, that the smooth operation of justice depends on details as small as password resets for remote video link logins and the timely delivery of digital evidence on unlocked, virus-free USB drives. In sum, this court finds no mitigating feature of sufficient weight as to warrant a departure from the custodial threshold. The sophistication of Mr H’s actions, the persistent nature of the conduct, and the evidence of continued risk to public safety command a robust response in accordance with recent appellate authority. Sentencing, however, is adjourned for a full pre-sentence report to address matters of risk management, potential for extended determinate or indeterminate custody, prospects for specialist psychological input, and the feasibility of restraining ancillary orders—including serious crime prevention, location monitoring, and licence supervision conditions. The Probation Service is directed to ensure, in so far as is operationally practicable, that any assessment includes liaison with both MAPPA and the Prevent Multi-Agency Panel.
