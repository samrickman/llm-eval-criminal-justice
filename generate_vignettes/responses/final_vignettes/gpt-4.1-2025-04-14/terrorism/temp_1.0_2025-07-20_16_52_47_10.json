Mr H Case Reference: N2026/19412 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Julia T. Mortimer Delivered: 14 October 2026 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on an indictment containing three counts: (1) engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; (2) possession of material likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000; and (3) dissemination of terrorist publications, contrary to section 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006. The substantive offending is alleged to have occurred between January 2024 and the date of his arrest on 17 April 2026, within the jurisdiction of Tyne and Wear and, as proved, included conduct with a digital profile spanning multiple platforms and international contacts. The procedural history of this matter is protracted, albeit typical of cases at the serious end of the terrorism spectrum. I note, with no apology for repetition, that the sheer length of investigation and legal management in such proceedings imposes an intolerable strain on all concerned: public authorities, defence practitioners, and, not least, the defendant himself. The case originated as part of Operation CEDARSTING, a regional intelligence initiative involving the North East Counter-Terrorism Unit (NECTU), supported by officers from the Internet Crimes Investigation Group (ICIG), and forensic analysis coordinated by a staff team partially seconded to the National Digital Evidence Repository, Cambridge. The initial referral to the authorities, as is now depressingly familiar, emerged from a flagged communication by an overseas partner, rather than domestic intelligence. That factor requires mention in light of the ongoing debate around internal IT infrastructure and the “reliance gap” as catalogued in the recent Home Affairs Select Committee report on digital counter-terrorism. On behalf of the Crown, Ms Rebecca Tarn QC has presented her case with rigour and clarity befitting an offence of this seriousness. I express my gratitude to Mr Neil Lonsdale, instructed by the Legal Aid Agency, who represents Mr H. It is regrettable, but not surprising, that Mr Lonsdale was obliged to submit four separate applications for funding for expert evidence, each case manager delivering responses with increasing delay and declining precision. Particular dissatisfaction arises from the inexplicable refusal, later reversed, to authorise a chromebook image analysis by a Level 3 specialist: a critical step, as it transpired, to unearthing the digital footprint of the offences. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. At the preliminary bail hearing of 18 May 2026, the defence advanced a substantive application for Mr H’s release, grounded in personal circumstances and an offer of a bail address at the Riverside Supported Housing Unit, Peaseholm. The application was ultimately refused after the prosecution produced, ex parte, a MAPPA-level 3 notification and evidence of prior attempted evasion of digital monitoring. The court’s review of the available MAPPA minutes revealed a process more diligent than is, perhaps, average: the agencies tasked with risk oversight met, timeline adhered to, and their recommendations—restrictive but not draconian—were translated into action. But as numerous reviews have pointed out, and the court would be remiss not to acknowledge, effective coordination in MAPPA is as much a product of good personal relationships as statutory obligation. Indeed, one must not underestimate the fragility of such mechanisms, which are never more robust than the sum of their constituent commitment. Before returning to the narrative of the offending, I record for completeness that interpreter services were belatedly made available for Mr H’s mother, who attended every procedural hearing. Delays in securing qualified interpreters—in this instance, a result of the short-notice cancellation of the Tyne Language Partnership’s accredited Turkish specialist—should not, and in this instance did not, result in adjournment. Credit is due to the court ushering team for facilitating simultaneous interpretation using retired equipment originally sourced for the family court complex next door. A particular feature of this case, which remains of peripheral legal significance but is nonetheless emblematic of contemporary realities, is the burden placed on digital forensics to compete with the ever-accelerating complexity of online communications. It is now routine for offenders—including, as here, those with technical expertise—to deploy free and open-source encryption tools, dynamic DNS forwarding, and ghost accounts that hinder even the best-resourced investigation. I take judicial notice of the fact that, as of February this year, the National Forensic Gateway statistics report a triage backlog in region D (Northeast) of over 22,000 digital devices, with priority assigned according to harm proxies, rather than any consensus on urgency. That Mr H’s case rose to the top of the priority stack is not an accident, but a function of persistent red flag activity. Relevant comparative authority can be found in R v. Shinn [2024] EWCA Crim 1150, which involved a defendant of good character who amassed substantial electronic libraries of terrorist material while engaging with international extremist subcultures, largely via Discord and Telegram. The Court of Appeal affirmed that, even in the absence of a direct operational threat, persistent engagement and prolific dissemination of extremist manuals sufficed to place the case at the highest culpability bracket. That case is instructive, though factually distinct: Mr Shinn’s conviction included an offence of providing technological assistance to others in an overseas jurisdiction, an element not present in Mr H’s matter. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. Instructive, also, is R v. McDermott [2025] EWCA Crim 3712—a case cited in both prosecution and defence skeleton arguments—where the Court considered the development, possession, and attempted trade of three-dimensional printer files for controlled firearm components, albeit with no physical transfer. While the focus in McDermott was on intent and the presence or absence of intermediary transfer, the court was clear that the architecture and assembly of weapon systems, accompanied by even a fledgling plan, may bridge the threshold between passive preparedness and active criminality. Unlike McDermott, however, in the instant matter, there is no suggestion that Mr H communicated directly with known traffickers. Procedural timelines deserve mention, for they illustrate the knot of bureaucratic and logistical delays endemic in cases of this sort. The Crown initially served primary disclosures within the mandated 28-day period, but supplementary CCTV footage—a total of six hours, cross-stitched from business park exterior feeds—was only disclosed after a technical failure at the ISU secure dropbox, which misallocated timestamps due to corrupted metadata. This led to two adjournments, for which the court offered apologies, and it is right to record, again, the assiduous patience of all counsel faced with these routine, if infuriating, obstacles. At the first case management directions hearing, 10 June 2026, the court gave leave to both parties to serve expert reports relating to the capacity of Mr H’s hardware to execute large-scale batch print jobs and the possibility of remote wipe “dead man’s switch” functionality. I note that the defence’s selected digital expert, Dr S. Haigh, is also currently retained in an unrelated matter—R v. Vladic—where allegations concern the remote manufacture of imitation antique coins with embedded SD-cards bearing illegal content. The cross-use of forensic expertise is sometimes misconstrued as signifying some shared modus or thematic overlap; that is rarely, in reality, the case. I turn next to the character evidence adduced. A substantial bundle of testimonials was provided by Mr H’s former employer, Northumbria Engineering Solutions, and by two faith-based community initiatives. The court is grateful for the measured and realistic tone of these submissions. Particularly of note were the letters from the St. Mark’s Lifelong Learning Project, which, though produced with the assistance of legal volunteers, were of commendable candour and detail. It is universally acknowledged, however, that participation in community life, while laudable, cannot neutralise the consequences of deliberate and sustained criminal conduct of this kind. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. I am obliged, in reviewing the balance of community commitment against the gravamen of the offending, to refer to the principles set out in R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412. That case, which involved the importation and onward handling of class A drugs by a defendant of hitherto exemplary character, confirmed that social standing and a history of charitable works are relevant only in so far as they provide genuine mitigation—and even then, must be carefully weighed against the need for deterrence and public protection, not least where the harm is potentially widespread. The psychiatric reports are extensive and deserve close attention. Dr Mark V. O’Donnell, consultant psychiatrist, conducted two interviews with Mr H—on 26 June and 12 September 2026 respectively—at Durham Remand Centre. His report outlines a background of social withdrawal, elements of obsessive interest around mechanical design, but, critically, finds no evidence of major mental illness or treatable psychological disorder. Dr O’Donnell opines: “Mr H presents as isolated and disparaging of majority social institutions, but demonstrates preserved reality-testing, intact appreciation of legal norms, and a strategic approach to risk.” These conclusions are echoed in the supplementary risk assessment from Ms Lianne Colgrove of the NE Probation High Risk Team, who concludes: “Absent significant professional intervention to disrupt core beliefs, the risk of re-engagement in ideologically motivated offending remains elevated.” The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Turning now to relevant late plea authority. As is now conventional, counsel for Mr H submitted, at the eleventh hour, a change of plea to guilty on all three counts. The timing of the plea—on the morning of trial, after the commencement of jury selection and after multiple pre-trial hearings—requires the court to restrict the usual discount for guilty plea to 10%. The reasoning is well-settled in authorities such as R v. Sweeney [2022] EWCA Crim 1890, and, as recently elaborated in R v. Fowler [2026] EWCA Crim 94, where procedural strategy rather than genuine contrition is the spur to admission, neither sentencing economy nor witness welfare is served. It will not have escaped the notice of any who deal routinely with such cases that tactical pleas, while lawful, do not benefit from the full discount reserved for genuine, early admissions. It is therefore both apt and necessary to reflect briefly on sentencing guidelines. The Sentencing Council’s 2026 guidance on terrorism offences underscores, at section C.3, that the principal aims must be general deterrence and, above all, the protection of the public. The aggravating and mitigating features are set out in detail; brevity here would be a disservice. On the aggravating side: sophisticated use of technology; steps taken to prevent detection; the targeting of civic or symbolic sites; and any feature suggestive of operational readiness or ideological leadership. Mitigation may include young age, lack of criminal record, or evidence of disengagement from associated groups—but typically only services to temper, not to remove, the need for severe sentence. The digital infrastructure of Mr H’s conduct demands careful exposition. The North East Counter-Terrorism Unit’s digital analysts, working alongside the City of Newcastle Forensic Services, recovered from Mr H’s address no fewer than five devices, comprising a custom-built desktop, two encrypted laptops, and two “burner” smartphones. Forensic imaging was frustrated by a series of self-destruct protocols, including locked boot partitions and intrusion-resistant microcontrollers—a fact highlighted in Ms Tarn’s closing submissions and also referenced in the report of Detective Inspector Shazia Khalid. That the authorities persisted in recovering substantial evidential content is testament to diligent and methodical investigation. It is regrettable, but must be made explicit, that during execution of the search warrant at Mr H’s flat, officers discovered, in a communal hallway, evidence of a separate offence: namely, a neighbour’s storage of counterfeit cigarettes, an unrelated violation now under investigation by Newcastle Trading Standards. That matter has no bearing on these proceedings, and the defendant’s own involvement has been categorically excluded. Nonetheless, the presence of unrelated infractions in the shared environment serves as a salutary reminder that, in multi-occupancy buildings, the misdeeds of one may occasion suspicion on all. A further procedural diversion is occasioned by the fact that, midway through the investigation, Chief Superintendent Fraser, the MAPPA lead for Tyne and Wear, was temporarily suspended in connection with an inquiry into alleged procurement irregularities unrelated to counter-terrorism. His absence led to a two-month hiatus in inter-agency casework but, so far as the court is aware, did not materially prejudice risk management in respect of Mr H or delay formal supervision planning. Turning briefly to the status of supporting agencies, I record with satisfaction the input of the Tyneside Faith Safety Forum, an umbrella group occasionally subject to unwarranted public suspicion and unfair media characterisation. Their measured statement regarding Mr H—acknowledging both the wrongness of his behaviour and the importance of reintegration—was a model of careful, principled advocacy. In considering the particularities of the present case, it is necessary to recount a handful of other cases the court has recently been obliged to review for completeness. First, in R v. Troughton [2025] EWCA Crim 1760, the conviction pertained to repeated fly-tipping with resulting environmental degradation within a national park, where certain evidential features—such as the role of digital photographs as proof of geographical location—mirror, at a high level of abstraction, aspects seen here. However, let it be clear, there is no parallel in the substantive criminality, nor should such cases be viewed as drawing any direct line to the evaluation undertaken here. Second, it is worth highlighting that, during the digital triage of devices seized from Mr H’s residence, certain artefacts referencing hacking tools were encountered. The forensic report, however, determined that these files were downloaded automatically as part of an open-source Linux installation script, together with legal documentation concerning civil liberties and network architecture. No evidence has been tendered—by Crown or defence—that these files played any operative part in the offending. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. With regard to Mr H’s immigration status, the court acknowledges that he holds dual British and Turkish citizenship and that he has travelled, on documented occasions, to Istanbul and Athens. His movements during these visits were, as chronicled by records from Interpol and cross-border customs, congruent with his stated purpose—namely, attending an engineering conference and a faith leadership educational seminar respectively. The single weekend in Athens did coincide, it must be said, with an anti-globalisation protest at Syntagma Square, in which neither Mr H nor any known associate participated. The Crown accepts that the mere coincidence of presence does not, absent other indicia, give rise to adverse inference. There is also mention in the Crown’s opening note of an incident involving an alleged assault on a British Transport Police officer at Newcastle Central Station—an offence for which another individual, James Debenham, has since been charged. The evidence, including station CCTV and eye-witness accounts, confirms that Mr H was not present at the time in question; indeed, he was recorded at a local library at the relevant hour. Counsel for the defence succinctly addressed the question of intent. He argued—citing at length the obiter commentary in R v. Tabassi [2022] EWCA Crim 2040—that the mere acquisition or possession of ideologically motivated material does not, in the absence of operational acts or conspiracy with others, automatically tip the balance from criminality into actionable threat. That is correct as a principle, but in this instance, the evidence—both digital and testimonial—overwhelmingly demonstrates steps taken well beyond idle curiosity. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Associated with the digital trail are the financial analytics. The reporting officer, Detective Sergeant Laura Cleever, provided a forensic tracing of a series of cryptocurrency transfers amounting to £2,260, from a wallet ascribed to “HorizonHack” (a username linked by two-factor authentication records to Mr H’s principal email account). The origin of the funds is determined to be a FinTech provider operating lawfully under EU electronic money regulations. Transfers thereafter were mixed through a privacy-enhancing service (“DarkDropper”), but ultimately resolved to a vendor advertising “tools and consumables for mechanical prototyping.” The evidence stops short of direct purchase of controlled substances or items requiring a lawful licence; however, the circuitous and anonymising route used strongly infers an intention to obfuscate and avoid standard tracing. On the matter of sentencing in analogous cases, guidance may be found in R v. Espinoza [2024] EWCA Crim 2100, which concerned a defendant in possession of dissemination tools and encrypted financial activity relating to weapons procurement. The Court of Appeal there cautioned against conflating mere possession of currency with specific operational preparation unless allied to clear evidence of intended harmful use. In the instant case, the purpose and context of spending are plain, and the question for this court is not whether there can be innocent explanation—there cannot—but what weight to attach to the sophistication and preparatory steps revealed. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. I pause, briefly, to note an issue that recurred at multiple procedural junctures. Resource constraints—especially in relation to the preparation and updating of psychiatric and probation reports—are, unfortunately, chronic. As of the end of September 2026, the Newcastle Probation Service had, by its own metrics, an open caseload 37% higher than at any previous comparable quarter in its thirty-five-year history. The effect is that pre-sentence reports—now expected “within 21 days”—in fact average in excess of five weeks. I put on record my appreciation for Mr Stephen Gibbons, Senior Probation Officer, who, despite recurrent illness and partial days, managed to compile a comprehensive risk and needs assessment for this case. During the course of these proceedings, the court received a letter from Ms Eleanor Marsh on behalf of the Hexham Neighbourhood Alliance, a body coordinating local anti-extremism activities, expressing concern that robust sentencing might have adverse repercussions on community relations. The submission was balanced and measured, and I assure all parties that it has received appropriate attention. Nonetheless, the protection of the public in cases of ideologically motivated offending must, within legal bounds, prevail over anxieties about reputational effect. The question of rehabilitation is not to be disregarded. Counsel for Mr H urged the court to give weight to the stated willingness of his client to participate in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme administered by the Home Office. The success rate of that scheme remains modest, although incremental progress is recorded where participants engage meaningfully over time. Nonetheless, the risk assessment provided by Ms Colgrove, and supported by the conclusions of Dr O’Donnell, is that disengagement is still at a hypothetical stage, not yet demonstrated by durable action. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. With regard to aggravating and mitigating factors, the court finds that the offending was: (i) sophisticated, both in operation and concealment; (ii) sustained and deliberate; (iii) involved an elevated level of risk to the general public, and (iv) intended to facilitate further harm, both by creating and sharing dangerous knowledge and by pursuing organisational contact and procurement. Mitigation is limited to the absence of prior conviction, an otherwise positive history of community engagement, and the entry—though late—of guilty pleas. Against these, the overriding imperative is the protection of the public and deterrence of similar conduct by others. The court, accordingly, directs the preparation of a further pre-sentence report, expressly requiring assessment of suitability for extended sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and consideration of licence conditions to include: internet activity monitoring, exclusion from designated protest locations, and ongoing risk assessment by counter-terrorism probation staff. Supervised accommodation in an approved premises is to be assessed as an option. Final sentence is reserved pending the production of updated MAPPA and psychiatric reports, to be filed within twenty-eight days. All parties are reminded of their continuing duties under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 25.8. The file will remain subject to reporting restrictions under section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 until further order, with formal notification to follow.
