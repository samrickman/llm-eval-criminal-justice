Mr H Case No. S2025/983241 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge F. L. PEMBERLEY Dated: 26 September 2025 Mr H comes before this court following conviction, on his own pleas of guilty, of three counts under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006—engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism—and a further count under section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for possession of material likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. These offences, which spanned an extended period between April 2023 and late February 2025, have been the subject of an investigation of unusual complexity, drawing upon the resources and cooperation of multiple arms of the criminal justice system and an array of both statutory and voluntary sector agencies. The court is compelled to observe at the outset that these sentencing remarks are composed after a protracted period of procedural wrangling. The initial Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing occurred on 19 May 2025. That hearing was beset by administrative complication: the case management file contained duplicate indices, an erroneous defendant date of birth, and a broken digital audio recording link. It was adjourned for 28 days owing to the unavailability of the original instructing solicitor, as well as a delay by the Legal Aid Agency in confirming extended funding to permit the instruction of an out-of-area terrorism risk expert. These rather mundane, but nonetheless symptomatic, inefficiencies are the backdrop to much contemporary criminal work—especially in proceedings involving the Terrorism Acts, where the scale and sophistication of evidence frequently strains the procedural machinery of the courts. At all material times, Mr H has been remanded in HMP Belmarsh in conditions of Category A monitoring. The remand was initially opposed by the defence, who lodged a bail application supported by two sureties, alleging extenuating personal circumstances, deteriorating physical health, and citing the assurances of a local faith-based group offering structured oversight. The bail application was refused on 23 May 2025, on the basis of the gravity of the allegations, the defendant’s risk profile as assessed by the Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE), and the absence of any adequate risk management alternative. No appeal for bail has since been renewed. The background to these offences is regrettably indicative of a wider pattern discernible in contemporary English life. The court makes this observation not by way of sociological commentary but to emphasise the strain exacted on public services and social cohesion by a persistent, if not wholly unchecked, fraying of communal norms. It is increasingly routine for those involved in serious offending to have traversed—or indeed, fallen through—an ever-thinner web of support and surveillance. This case is a stark demonstration that, whatever ambitions the Government may harbour regarding “whole-system approaches,” the reality is fragmented, resource-poor, and dangerously slow-moving in the face of dynamic threat. The offences for which he must now be sentenced arise from facts and circumstances summarised by the prosecution as follows: Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The offences themselves followed a prolonged period of increasingly concerning online activity and in-person contacts by Mr H. The prosecution’s evidence is drawn in significant part from the painstaking digital forensic investigation led by the City Electronic Crimes Division (CECD). I record my thanks to Detective Inspector Madeline Osei-Kwame and her team for their fortitude in navigating the labyrinthine landscape of device encryption, decentralised messaging services, and, no less arduous, the wrangling with Foreign Law Enforcement Liaison to unlock several persistent cross-jurisdictional data access questions. The digital forensics backlog is, by all accounts, at crisis level: CECD’s lead time now approaches 14 months for non-priority cases and, had not this matter been flagged under the “National Security Fast-Track” protocol, it is doubtful whether material relevant to these proceedings would have been available ahead of even the current deferred sentencing window. During the investigation, several multi-agency referral processes were convened. The MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements) Category 3 panel met on 9 April 2025; I note from their minutes that the procedures largely adhered to protocol, although, as is unfortunately too often the case, core participation from mental health services was not secured until the second meeting, owing to staff shortages at the Serpentine Acute Unit. Community Prevent officers did, however, maintain contact both with the defendant and with his family members, though such intervention proved in the event to be of limited apparent impact. Within the procedural history of this case sits a familiar catalogue of administrative hinderance. In late June, this sentencing hearing was vacated at short notice as a result of unanticipated industrial action by Court Security Staff, which necessitated the closure of all but two of the public corridors in this building. The resultant postponement, though brief, required all witness warning letters and pre-sentence report interviews to be rescheduled. The court recognises that the delays to the administration of justice, even—perhaps especially—in the terrorism context, can have profound effects both on those awaiting sentence and on public confidence more generally. It falls now to the court to set out the relevant legal framework. The pertinent statutory provisions are found, respectively, in section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 and section 58(1)(b) of the Terrorism Act 2000. Both offences carry significant maximum sentences—life imprisonment on the former, and fifteen years on the latter. The current Sentencing Council Guidelines, issued following public consultation in September 2023, mandate an analysis of culpability (assessed by level of commitment, planning, and proximity to intended harm) alongside the assessment of risk posed to the public. The Court of Appeal, in R v. Kahar & Others [2016] EWCA Crim 568, has made plain that the public protection rationale is paramount, with general deterrence and incapacitation foregrounded when the facts disclose a pattern of sustained intent and preparatory action. Mr H planned to build and leave a device in a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, just east of Cornbrook station, scheduled to detonate at 3pm as Leeds supporters passed in dense footfall, exploiting CCTV blind spots. The defence, for their part, have valiantly sought to refocus mitigation around the relative “inchoate” nature of the offending and Mr H’s lack of any previous convictions for violence or firearm-related matters. However, it is settled law following R v. Ziamani [2015] EWCA Crim 1942 that the fact an intervention occurs well before an act of actual violence does not necessarily reduce culpability where the preparatory acts disclose high determination and sophistication, and where ideological fixity is evident. The submissions advanced in mitigation by Mr H’s counsel, Mr C. Kingsley, are thorough and comprised both conventional and more creative elements. The core of the defence’s case is that Mr H, though undoubtedly at a high point of ideological grievance at the time of the offending, has, since remand, engaged partially with selected deradicalisation interventions, most notably the “Choices Forward Programme” operated by the CityBridge Centre for Action Against Extremism. I have considered the progress reports attesting to his level of engagement carefully. I am bound to note, however, that a single episode of attendance at group work and the submission of a “reflective essay” (whose content appears primarily to advocate for reform of internet privacy law rather than repudiate extremist violence) do not amount to substantial evidence of change or insight. The court is obliged, by practice and precedent, to consider the broad contours of relevant case law even where it diverges as to facts. Thus, it is helpful to consider, if only by analogy, the position reached in a series of appellate decisions addressing preparation for and facilitation of serious criminality. In R v. Macleish [2019] EWCA Crim 875, the defendant used social media to organise coordinated assaults on opposition political demonstrators. The trial judge, affirmed on appeal, found aggravation not only in the act itself, but also in the manner by which digital infrastructure was methodically exploited to mask and scale the harm. Those features—preparation, technological adaptation, and disregard for law—are increasingly characteristic of the offences appearing before this court. Of incidental but, in context, irrelevant note is the evidence in R v. Pappas [2022] EWCA Crim 1622, where the defendant was ultimately convicted of burglary after accessing a locked commercial property by disabling its alarm system. This appellate court found that, for sentencing purposes, the prior possession of burglary tools, whilst aggravating in that context, bore no relation to the risk assessment required in offences of violence or terrorism. While Pappas’s factual scenario differs materially from Mr H’s, the principle that each case turns precisely on its own matrix is one this court is bound to apply. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. I have been presented with the transcript and video recording of Mr H’s police interview, which, in keeping with current practice, occurred in the presence of an Approved Registered Intermediary to mitigate for his reported communication difficulties. As is now customary, the police interview room was equipped with adaptive lighting and “white noise” background filtration to ensure environmental accessibility, pursuant to the recommendations of the July 2022 HMICFRS report on best practice for vulnerable suspects. A careful reading of the transcript confirms that all required procedural safeguards were upheld. It is worth noting that, during this period, the defendant’s assigned youth mentor, Ms Leonor Espinoza (whose efforts are here formally acknowledged), attempted proactive engagement in accordance with the Home Office guidance in the “Safeguarding Against Radicalisation” framework. The evidence before the court is that Ms Espinoza attended regular review meetings of the Local Intervention Panel, contributed to risk management plans bespoke to Mr H’s needs, and maintained contact with his family members. Her efforts, though ultimately unable to deter his deepening involvement, are indicative of the dedication characteristic of much under-celebrated work within this fraught sector. The voluminous correspondence from support agencies—among them, the Southwark Association for Civic Reengagement, the East River Youth Inclusion Trust, and the West Bend Food Partnership—provides a panoramic, if sometimes fragmented, portrait of Mr H’s community involvement, educational background, and support needs. While the contributions of these agencies are genuinely laudable (not least in the practical support they provided to Mr H’s family at a time of immense public and media scrutiny), their function for sentencing is more limited. The legitimacy of the court’s ultimate role—public protection—has sometimes come under strain from well-intentioned, but misguided, calls to prioritise community reintegration at any cost. Suffice it to say that such pleas cannot override the imperatives set by statute and case law. The chronology of events that forms the foundation of this prosecution is complicated by the presence of a co-defendant, Ms Lara Waddington, whose involvement in events preceding Mr H’s arrest led to a number of parallel investigative threads, ultimately discontinuing in a separate set of unrelated proceedings. Ms Waddington, as it transpires, later pled guilty to an unrelated matter involving the importation of pyrotechnic devices via international post, a matter wholly distinct from the present facts and having no bearing on Mr H’s offending. It is a necessary reminder that, in the labyrinthine reality of multi-agency investigations, the actions of one individual may intersect with, but not necessarily contaminate, the liability of another. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. I note, for the avoidance of doubt, that there was reference in the defence submissions to a third party—Mr H’s cousin—having previously been cautioned for possession of a bladed article following an unrelated altercation outside a public house in Peckham. The defendant himself has no history of violence nor, as far as any record discloses, any sustained contact with criminal justice agencies. The court expressly distances itself from any suggestion of guilt by association, a principle affirmed in R v. Larcombe [2016] EWCA Crim 179, and remains strictly attentive to the facts and inferences properly before it. A further point of procedural relevance is the extensive duration and administrative burden of the disclosure exercise in this case. The prosecution’s initial schedule comprised over 600 primary exhibits and more than 1,800 items of unused material, crossing over into numerous “closed” categories handled via section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013 closed-material process. The Defence repeatedly contended, and not without reason, that the volume of redacted or withheld material risked prejudice to preparations; however, the Crown’s closed advocate, Ms Sumaiyah Einfield, produced a comprehensive schedule of open summaries and attended to process with the expected diligence. There is, unhappily, little to suggest that such burdens of disclosure—especially in terrorism investigations—are likely to ease in the foreseeable future. As the case developed, a peculiar episode occasioned a further, if unintended, delay: ten days prior to the scheduled first day of trial, a fire broke out in the document storage area serving Courtroom 4. The resulting smoke and water damage necessitated the temporary redirection of all paper exhibits to an offsite location for restoration and forensic assessment. None of the exhibits relevant to this proceeding were found to be permanently compromised, but their temporary inaccessibility introduced a further week’s hiatus into an already strained timescale. I place on record my thanks to the staff of St. John’s Document Recovery for their committed role in ensuring recovery and restoration. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. Turning to the psychiatric and psychological context, I have had the benefit of two expert reports. The first, produced by Dr. Violet Iqbal, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Lambeth Consultation and Liaison Service, found no evidence of acute mental disorder but chronicled a history of social withdrawal, rigidity of thought, and “overvalued ideas consistent with grievance-based ideology.” The report highlights a minor diagnosis of dysthymia but concludes that Mr H’s decision-making capacity was unimpaired. The second report, from Professor Paul van der Merwe, forensic psychologist, employed the Structured Assessment of Risk for Extremist Recidivism (StARER-X) and found Mr H exhibits high cognitive isolation and a propensity for “existential dichotomisation”—that is, an excessive reliance on binary worldviews. The risk to public safety in the absence of close management was assessed as “substantial and ongoing.” Both experts recommended structured professional supervision, preferably in a custodial setting. In the course of sentencing submissions, defence counsel placed weight on Mr H’s educational and volunteer record, tendering letters from the Walworth Park Urban Allotments Association and the New Horizons Adult Learning Institute. These, while evidence of prior positive engagement, cannot substantively mitigate the harm occasioned by his offending, save as marginal indicators of capacity for pro-social behaviour under structured oversight. Neither report suggests such behaviour fundamentally alters the risk calculations in light of the offending. The court is bound additionally to consider certain ancillary matters, some of which have arisen tangentially but warrant brief mention for the record. In the course of the investigation a small quantity of prescription medication was found in a communal kitchen area, prescribed to another resident of the defendant’s shared accommodation and unrelated to the present criminality. The court records that police undertook a full check for evidence of misuse or diversion, but none was established. No adverse inference is made against Mr H in this respect. A further tangential, but notable, background event concerned the defendant’s former landlord, Mr Emerson Chao, who was, during the course of this investigation, found to be operating a commercial waste collection service in breach of an Environment Agency abatement notice. This matter proceeded to an unrelated prosecution for fly-tipping and is relevant here only inasmuch as it contributed to a temporary closure of the property in which Mr H resided, thereby affecting access for both investigative and support agencies at several key junctures. The court reiterates, for avoidance of any doubt, that these events have no bearing on the findings of culpability or risk in respect of Mr H. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The court is also in receipt of letters from Mr H’s relatives, including a well-written submission from his aunt, Ms Blanche Robertson, expressing ongoing concern regarding his welfare and prospects for engagement with rehabilitative interventions. These letters are thoughtful and constructed, displaying a mixture of candour and hopefulness as to his post-sentence trajectory. While the court values such correspondence, it must weigh these sentiments in the balance with the seriousness of the present offences and the riskentailed. It would be remiss not to address the procedural context more broadly. The performance of the Probation Service has, in this matter, been steady, notwithstanding the acknowledged pressures of escalating caseload and late-arriving court orders. I record my appreciation for the timely compiling of the pre-sentence information by Mr Ewan Nokes, Senior Probation Officer, who managed, despite the aforementioned Pre-Sentence Report system “downtime event” on 11 September, to produce an assessment only two working days behind schedule. Some digression here on the situation of public services is, I believe, justifiable. It has become commonplace to bemoan the “crisis” facing the criminal justice and allied systems. The evidence for this is not mere anecdote: at the time of this hearing, the most recent Ministry of Justice statistical bulletin shows an average 41% vacancy rate for Principal Probation Officer posts in London and the South East, while the waiting list for access to NHS forensic psychology intervention slots exceeds 32 weeks. The result is a system constantly at risk of collapse, held together by the resilience and improvisation of dedicated but exhausted staff. In relation to the sentencing framework, the Defence in this matter have advanced authority from R v. Streatham [2024] EWCA Crim 4121, a case involving the importation of substantial quantities of Class A drugs via air freight. The court in Streatham, in the context of manifestly “early” guilty pleas and remorse, allowed for significant sentence mitigation. However, that case is entirely distinguishable on its facts; the present matter is aggravated not only by the duration and design of the offending conduct but by the context in which it occurred—an environment of heightened public threat and institutional vulnerability to attack. The factors that permitted deviation from the normal sentencing tariff in Streatham are absent here. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The court also notes—but must not permit to cloud its judgment—the existence of tangential criminal matter involving an estranged partner of Mr H, Ms Ingrid Mokhtar, who is currently subject to ongoing police investigation in a separate jurisdiction for a series of harassment communications and a related allegation of benefit fraud. There is, I must emphatically state, no evidence whatsoever linking Mr H to these matters, and the court is scrupulous in disregarding any attempt at guilt by association. There remains the question of the Defendant’s late entry of guilty pleas. As the principles of credit for guilty plea are well established (see R v. Calvert [2023] EWCA Crim 1751), the timing of the plea is central. In this case, pleas were entered only upon receipt of the Crown’s digital evidence addendum, and following the end of all admissibility arguments. The benefit to court resources and witnesses, therefore, is limited. A full discount cannot be justified, and the reduction in sentence will reflect this. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! In mitigation, the defence has placed enthusiasm on Mr H’s expressed willingness to participate in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), a scheme with variable demonstrated efficacy and, as recent analysis shows, a significant post-release disengagement rate. The court is, of course, willing to facilitate participation in such schemes as part of a holistic risk management plan, but notes that engagement in principle is not the same as achievement in substance. Aggravating features of this case include: the sustained nature of the offending, use of sophisticated digital security infrastructure to evade detection, and—on the most serious count—the procurement and attempted adaptation of materials with destructive potential, all indicia of determined intent and high likelihood of future escalation. By contrast, mitigating features are restricted to the absence of prior convictions, partial engagement with support services, and a residual prospect (as assessed by the Probation Service) for eventual reintegration subject to stringent supervision. It is to be noted that on 13 July 2025, an unrelated arson occurred in the adjacent Courtroom 7, necessitating the presence of additional fire wardens during the present hearing. While this incident occasioned a brief evacuation mid-sentence, the resulting minor delay had no bearing on the fairness or conduct of the present proceedings. The court therefore orders the production of a full pre-sentence report, to be prepared within 28 days, addressing the suitability of an extended determinate sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The report shall assess the feasibility of multi-agency management, including the appropriateness and practicability of high-intensity psychological interventions, electronic monitoring, and restrictions on digital communications post-release. Probation should consult with the Counter Terrorism Policing and NHS Forensic Mental Health teams regarding the availability and allocation of resources required for effective risk containment. Until such time as the final sentence is passed, Mr H will remain in custody. No bail application is currently before the court, and none will be entertained unless supported by significantly changed circumstances. These remarks are delivered today, 26 September 2025, in Court 5 at Southwark Crown Court, and are transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.
