Mr H Case No. B2025/30259 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Eleanor A. Kirk Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence following conviction on two counts: one of engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The material dates pertinent to these charges extend from approximately September 2023 through to the defendant's arrest on 12 April 2025. This court notes that the defendant was arrested shortly after 07:00 hours on 12 April 2025 at his residence in Newhaven. The operation was conducted by Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE), pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. Intelligence leading to the execution of the warrant was obtained from a combination of telecommunications intercepts and covert surveillance, which implicated the defendant in possession of potentially hazardous materials and documentation related to extremist activity. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation that culminated in Mr H’s arrest reflects the contemporary multi-layered approach of law enforcement agencies towards counter-terrorism. This included advanced digital forensic techniques, real-time monitoring of encrypted communications via the National Cyber Surveillance Unit, and collaboration with international partners. Moreover, the case demanded the mobilisation of specialist resources for the analysis of electronic devices and the identification of clandestine online networks. This reflects a wider trend within the criminal justice system towards integration between cyber and physical counter-terrorism operations. Defence submissions were initially delayed by procedural difficulties arising from the limited availability of legal aid-qualified counsel with the necessary security clearance. The court acknowledges with regret that the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative processes continue to impose delays on defence preparation in terrorism cases, as noted in prior Judiciary Reports (see, e.g., R v. Stanton [2024] EWCA Crim 1502). Nonetheless, thanks are extended to Mr Jeremy Bell, instructed under a public defence grant, for his thorough representation despite these obstacles. In the course of the preliminary hearings, the court was informed that the defendant had been the subject of a “Channel” referral made by Lighthouse Academy in December 2021 after he demonstrated concerning online activity including engagement with extremist propaganda material. That referral resulted in a formal multi-agency panel assessment but was discontinued after six months due to inconsistent engagement and absence of clear risk indicators to justify ongoing surveillance. The court does not speculate on the merits of such early intervention decisions, acknowledging the complex challenges faced by Prevent practitioners in balancing civil liberties against early warning of radicalisation. The defendant entered not guilty pleas at the earliest opportunity at the plea and case management hearing on 9 July 2025. However, after intensive trial preparation and the service of extensive expert reports from both prosecution and defence, Mr H altered his pleas to guilty on all counts at the outset of the sentencing hearing on 15 September 2025. The court notes this delayed change in plea limits the extent of sentence reduction that can be properly accorded, in line with established case law, including R v. Maguire [2023] EWCA Crim 1162, which cautions against full credit where pleas are tendered at a late stage after full trial preparation. The court recalls the principles laid down in R v. Langford [2020] EWCA Crim 2213, emphasizing that the grant of a guilty plea discount must be grounded in a plea that genuinely reflects a recognition of wrongdoing and a desire to spare witnesses the distress and inconvenience of contesting evidence. The tactical nature of late pleas corrodes this rationale and exhausts public resources. A useful framework for assessing culpability in cases under the Terrorism Act 2006 remains that elucidated in R v. Hadley [2019] EWCA Crim 894, where factors including sophistication of planning, resource acquisition, and proximity to violent outcomes are weighed alongside the defendant’s intentions, ideological motivations, and operational security measures. This framework, updated in the Sentencing Council Guidelines of 2023, continues to inform the judiciary’s approach to sentencing, with deterrence and protection of the public as paramount considerations. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. This case is particularly complicated by Mr H’s extensive online profile, which evolved from innocuous interests in political theory and engineering in 2022 to a platform disseminating extremist content by mid-2024. Digital linguistic analysis reveals iterative adoption of narratives aligned with a proscribed organisation whose materials advocate violent jihad as a response to perceived geopolitical grievances. Pursuant to evidence presented, these expressions were not merely abstract grievances but underpinned material steps taken towards realising violent objectives. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Multiple encrypted volumes were recovered from a secure partition on one of the defendant’s devices. These repositories contained detailed records of experimentation with improvised explosive materials, culminating in evidence of testing routines consistent with established bomb-making manuals. The digital evidence was painstakingly decrypted by forensic technologists, a process hampered by bespoke encryption layers leveraging quantum-resistant algorithms, underscoring the scale of technical sophistication involved. The defence’s assertion of possession for purely academic or theoretical purposes lacks credibility in light of the surrounding circumstance and corroborative material. This court is reminded by the dictum laid down in R v. Bowers [2021] EWCA Crim 178, affirming that possession of such documents combined with preparatory acts suffices to support convictions under section 5. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. While the defendant had a limited history of minor shoplifting offences in his early twenties, none of these have any bearing on his current culpability or risk profile. The court disregards peripheral biographical detail concerning a 2018 incident in which a co-tenant was found with a small quantity of cannabis during an unrelated police search. No charges arose from this event. The defendant’s estranged brother is currently under investigation for benefit fraud; this bears no connection to Mr H. The matter of the defendant’s community involvement was raised, relying on witness statements from a local environmental association where Mr H undertook volunteer tree-planting initiatives in 2020 and 2021. While such acts are commendable and indicative of some social engagement, the court is mindful that positive community links do not immunise individuals from serious ideological extremism. Mr H’s employment record illustrates a history of intermittent periods of work in mechanical assembly roles within a coastal engineering firm, terminated in early 2023 following a dispute linked to unauthorised absences. Unemployment and social isolation are common factors, though not determinative, in pathways to radicalisation. The court also notes that he was granted a university bursary for academic merit, as evidenced by submitted certificates. While laudable, this background does not mitigate the gravity of the present offences. It deserves recording that the defendant sustained a mild traumatic brain injury in 2015 during a motorcycling accident, which rehabilitation reports suggest may have left residual cognitive deficits including impulsivity. An independent neuropsychological assessment commissioned for sentencing purposes confirmed these deficits but found them insufficient to affect criminal responsibility or diminish ability to form intention. The defence also relies on a psychiatric report from Dr Lillian Farrow of the Sussex Forensic Psychiatric Unit, who describes Mr H as exhibiting signs of significant anxiety and evidence of obsessive thought patterns linked to ideological fixation. The diagnosis excludes psychotic symptoms but highlights persistent cognitive rigidity and a tendency towards black-and-white thinking, features that complicate engagement with deradicalisation efforts. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. Regarding travel history, Mr H undertook a brief private visit to Brussels in January 2024, attending a conference purportedly on industrial design. Unbeknownst to him, a co-attendee was later arrested for involvement in illicit arms trafficking unrelated to the defendant. CCTV captures no conspiratorial interaction between Mr H and this subject. The court, however, notes increased border security measures post-Brexit have complicated movement patterns and demographic surveillance particularly with respect to persons of interest. As this court is aware, contemporary terrorism offences often involve use of cryptocurrencies to facilitate clandestine transactions. In this case, a forensic financial analysis by Mr Kevin O’Donnell of Capital Forensic Services traced a series of Bitcoin payments amounting to £3,100 made from wallets under control of Mr H to accounts linked to procurement of chemicals viable for use in explosives manufacture. The payments were routed through layered mixers to obfuscate origin, consistent with known patterns of criminal finance. The court registers concern over the proliferation of such tools and the growing difficulty faced by law enforcement in unravelling such conduct without sophisticated blockchain analytics. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Evidence was adduced demonstrating that on the night of 23 October 2024, Mr H made a brief visit to the beach-side utility installations in East Brighton. Covert surveillance footage confirmed his presence; investigators suspect he sought to conduct discrete reconnaissance of electric transformer housings, locations occasionally targeted by eco-activist sabotage campaigns. No unlawful action was captured on camera, though such reconnaissance is a recognised preparatory act in terrorism investigations. This observation is illustrative of the broader asymmetry between the ease with which preparatory conduct may be undertaken, versus the extensive resource commitment demanded of public agencies to detect and investigate such conduct. Counter-terrorism policing units are acutely aware that intelligence gathering often depends upon the fusion of fragmentary data points, which alone appear innocuous but collectively raise red flags. The court is conscious of the profound impact on community relations occasioned by security measures. In particular, regular stop-and-search operations, while legally authorised and operationally necessary, have engendered feelings of alienation among certain demographic groups. Correspondence from the Brighton Islamic Cultural Society was submitted, appealing for sentences to reflect sensitivity towards communal trust and to avoid deepening social fissures. The court acknowledges these perspectives but must remain unswayed by non-legal considerations where risk to public safety is paramount. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 30 years old, with a technical diploma in mechanical engineering obtained in 2020. Former colleagues describe him as methodical and quiet but reserved to a fault, with limited social interaction outside narrow circles. Letters submitted on his behalf include one from a neighbour remarking on his “courteous but distant” manner, and another from a former employer highlighting his punctuality and conscientiousness. Psychometric testing administered as part of the pre-sentence report reveals a mixed motivational profile, combining elements of ideological commitment and social marginalisation. The probation officer’s assessment, submitted in anonymised form, flags concerns about the potential for recidivism given the persistent nature of extremist ideology and the defendant’s disengagement from established community support mechanisms. It is notable that notwithstanding his pronounced ideological leanings, Mr H has not been subject to prior criminal convictions beyond the isolated early adulthood offences of theft under £50 and multiple motoring violations including a driving whilst disqualified offence in 2019, which resulted in a custodial sentence of 12 weeks. These facts do, however, underpin an assessment of vulnerability and risk of reoffending under the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) framework. Attempts to engage Mr H in deradicalisation initiatives, including the Channel desistance programme, have been partially successful. According to reports from the Sussex Prevent Advisory Team, outreach workers made multiple visits and offered cognitive behavioural sessions focused on grievance mitigation and conflict resolution. However, Mr H’s participation was sporadic and marked by withdrawal and equivocation. The professionals involved note the impact of digital echo chambers in reinforcing his convictions and complicating intervention efforts. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. Consequently, the psychiatric report concludes that Mr H presents a high risk of causing serious harm linked to ongoing extremist ideology. The report emphasises the importance of an intensive custodial sentence combined with targeted psychological interventions addressing rigidity of thought, social isolation, and behavioural regulation. This approach is aligned with current best practice guidance outlined in the Home Office document “Managing Terrorism Risk in Custodial Settings” (2024). The court is mindful of the competing principles at play: the need to uphold proportionality, the imperative to protect the public, and the possibility of rehabilitation. It is, however, clear that the defendant’s conduct transcends mere ideological expression, engaging instead in deliberate preparatory steps towards indiscriminate violence. As such, lengthy custodial sanction is unavoidable. In mitigation, the court recognises the absence of victimisation arising from the defendant’s actions to date, the lack of prior terrorism-related offending, and his eventual admission of guilt. Nevertheless, the lateness of that plea tempers the credit afforded. The court also notes the potential ancillary impact on the defendant’s family, who are represented by letters expressing concern for his welfare and a desire for reform, but such considerations cannot supplant the primacy of risk management. It is appropriate that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith. The Probation Service is directed to consider suitability for an extended determinate sentence encompassing licence supervision with conditions including electronic monitoring, restricted internet access, and mandatory attendance at deradicalisation programmes approved by the National Offender Management Service. The report should also evaluate provision for psychological treatment targeting the cognitive behavioural patterns underpinning ideological extremism. The court also encourages liaison between relevant agencies, including the Community Rehabilitation Company, the local Prevent co-ordinator, and mental health services, to establish a multi-disciplinary risk management framework should release be contemplated in the future. Allied to this should be consideration of appropriate accommodation with secure supervision. It is acknowledged that this court’s docket has faced delays owing to industrial action affecting clerical staff in the past six months, as well as a backlog arising from increased terrorism-related prosecutions nationally. These factors, to some extent, account for the scheduling of this sentencing hearing well after the conclusion of the trial phase. However, the court remains satisfied that all parties have been afforded adequate time for preparation and representation. This hearing has proceeded in open court. The court records its gratitude to Ms Jane Whitaker, representing the Crown, whose submissions were thorough and clear. Likewise, it thanks Mr Jeremy Bell for his diligent advocacy in defence despite the challenges occasioned by resource limitations within the public defence realm. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The record has been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be provided to all relevant parties. The defendant is informed of his right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to sections 108 and 111 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved for later determination.
