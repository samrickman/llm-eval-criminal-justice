Mr H Case No. S2025/24319 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. L. MONTGOMERY Filed: 11 October 2025 Mr H appears before this tribunal for sentence after conviction by a jury on two counts pursuant to sections 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, relating to engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, involving possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The offending conduct is alleged to have occurred between September 2023 and the defendant’s arrest in April 2025. It is necessary at the outset to acknowledge the competent and diligent efforts of the prosecuting counsel, Ms Clara Sutherland, and the defence representative, Mr Julian Rex, both of whom have engaged the court with careful and measured submissions throughout the pre-trial, trial, and sentencing phases. The case was listed originally before this court several times; the initial hearing took place on 14 May 2025, but due to complex disclosure requirements and Liberty Legal Aid delays, the plea and trial preparation hearing was adjourned, ultimately concluding on 17 September 2025. The protracted timeline reflects, at least in part, the significant volume of digital evidence and national security considerations embroiled in this prosecution. The court also wishes to place on record appreciation for the support services attending to the victims identified in this matter. Though the conviction pertains to preparatory conduct and possession offences, the resultant anxiety and distress experienced by communities in Sheffield and surrounding areas necessitated a comprehensive support response from local authorities, including Sheffield Victim Support and Restorative Justice facilitators. The many volunteers and paid professionals in these organisations have contributed tirelessly, often under significant pressure, to provide reassurance and outreach. Their service in this regard is commendable. The defendant was arrested promptly on 18 April 2025 pursuant to multiple warrants enacted by Counter Terrorism Policing North Midlands. The evidence underpinning the warrants derived from months of covert surveillance, including real-time electronic intercepts and thorough forensic examination of seized equipment. Digital forensic teams faced substantial challenges due to strong encryption protocols employed by the defendant, necessitating collaboration between national and regional cyber units. The investigative aircraft deployed included drones operating with facial recognition overlays and AI pattern recognition to monitor movement patterns linked to Mr H. Such operations, though resource-intensive, have become indispensable in the contemporary security environment. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The proceedings have unfolded against a background of considerable procedural complexity. This court notes, without criticism, that the Legal Aid Agency’s administration of authorisations for expert instruction has, regrettably, at times slowed defence preparation in this instance. Mr Rex’s applications for external psychiatric input encountered several bureaucratic delays, with authorisation granted only after protracted correspondence spanning over four weeks. It should be observed that such delays are emblematic of systemic resource constraints rather than individual failures. Nevertheless, the impact on the expediency of justice is not trivial and warrants ongoing attention from Government departments charged with defending due process. Turning to the ambit of case law relevant to these particular offences, the court recalls the authoritative guidance of R v. Clarke [2019] EWCA Crim 782, a decision clarifying that preparation for terrorism requires evidence of intent beyond mere association or ideological sympathy. Clarke enshrined the principle that factual circumstances must demonstrate a demonstrable step towards actualisation of the intended acts. Conversely, R v. Kamara [2021] EWCA Crim 65 reaffirmed the breadth of conduct capable of constituting an offence under section 5, highlighting the need to consider preparatory activities collectively rather than in isolated fragments. These authorities provide the legal framework underpinning sentencing discretion in the present matter. In recent times, the procedural apparatus within Crown Courts dealing with terrorism offences has evolved in notable ways. Since the inception of the “Better Case Management” protocol in 2017, courts have been encouraged to expedite the listing of hearings within strict timelines to mitigate the risk of prolonged pre-trial delay that could impact witness recollection and evidential integrity. The current case bears witness to this effort, having moved from initial arrest through to trial within 30 months—somewhat consistent with national averages, though longer than the aspirational 18-month target. Achieving this has entailed collaborative scheduling and exceptional work by court officers, advocates, forensic teams, and witnesses alike. Concurrently, the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 framework has been invoked, necessitating inter-agency engagement involving Probation Services, CT Policing, the local NHS Secure Forensic Unit, and Sheffield City Council’s Risk and Safeguarding Panel. Over the course of the defendant’s remand, MAPPA meetings progressed monthly, aiming to evaluate risk factors, monitor behavioural changes, and plan for eventual release conditions. These meetings have been characterised by thorough information-sharing and documented in detailed minutes, despite pressures stemming from increasing caseloads with limited staffing. This court notes the difficult balancing act required and commends the professionalism of those involved. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Within the corpus of digital evidence, forensic linguists provided a detailed report examining the defendant’s use of encrypted social media and private messaging platforms. This report highlighted patterns of rhetoric mirroring that used by proscribed organisations, along with references to well-known propaganda texts. The linguistic features identified were consistent with deliberate radicalisation efforts, designed to recruit and indoctrinate sympathisers. Nonetheless, defence submissions posited these were “academic exercises” unrelated to practical engagement, a contention rejected by the jury. Amid these considerations, it is pertinent to observe that Mr H’s case also involves what some might term an unusual adjunct: the forensic analysis of homemade botanical extracts recovered from the defendant’s premises. An elderflower wine found in a shared kitchen was chemically analysed, but experts confirmed it contained no illicit substances nor was it weaponised in any way. This evidence was tendered by the defence to suggest normalcy in the defendant’s lifestyle. Such points, while noted, carry inconsequential weight. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defendant maintained a plea of not guilty throughout much of the proceedings. He elected to enter guilty pleas only on the morning of the third day of trial, shortly after testimony from a counter-terrorism financial specialist. The timing of this admission necessarily restricts credit for mitigation. The Court of Appeal in R v. Ford [2021] EWCA Crim 1332 exemplifies the principle that late pleas—especially those entered immediately prior to critical Crown evidence—do not merit significant leniency. Ford concerned a case of armed robbery with prolonged trial preparation, where the defendant changed his plea one hour before the prosecution’s closing submissions, resulting in a mere five percent discount. Indeed, the cumulative burden on public resources occasioned by late pleas extends beyond the courtroom. Court listings become protracted, witnesses often require repeated reassurance and scheduling changes, and psychological strain on victims escalates. This is a matter of systemic concern, particularly amid rising workloads and court pressures nationally. A further instructive case is R v. Mason [2022] EWCA Crim 844, involving the possession of explosive materials with intent. Mason pleaded guilty at an early stage, resulting in a 20% reduction. The contrast with the present matter is stark. Despite comparable offences in seriousness, timing of plea remains a critical factor in sentencing discretion. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The digital forensic teams which operated over the course of this investigation deserve particular commendation for their technical acumen and perseverance amid resource shortages. Units tasked with decrypting hard drives encrypted by bespoke kernels and virtual machines frequently work in environments of immense pressure. This includes the cutting-edge Cyber Defence Centre at the National Crime Agency, where skilled analysts develop bespoke decryption tools with limited time and overwhelming caseloads. Alongside this, the Human Rights Watchdog Group has expressed concern about potential overreach in surveillance activities, petitioning Parliament for increased transparency. While such concerns merit academic debate, they do not diminish the need for effective intervention when credible threats emerge. The law properly balances liberty and security, and this court respects that equilibrium. Of tangential note, this jurisdiction suffered considerable administrative disruption during the trial period, including two days of strike action by court ushers, which hampered the swifter listing of hearings. The court's layout was refurbished only recently, with updated digital screens now replacing static notices, a detail which perhaps comforts those accustomed to archaic display methods but bears no direct impact on this sentencing. The defendant’s personal history was scrutinised extensively. Mr H is aged 31 and holds a master’s degree in applied physics. Prior to his arrest, he was employed for three years as a laboratory technician at a local engineering firm. It is recorded that employment ceased abruptly in August 2023, coinciding with heightened ideological activity. Letters from former employers and colleagues describe Mr H as intelligent but “reserved and socially withdrawn.” A letter from his landlord states that the property was generally well-maintained, though the defendant was sometimes late with rental payments. Curiously, unrelated to this matter, the landlord had recently been subjected to a noise abatement notice due to a neighbouring tenant’s loud music—a fact tangential and not relevant to sentencing. The Probation Service’s pre-sentence report raises some concerns about the adequacy of Mr H’s social support network. It notes that while he retains contact with his elder sister who resides abroad, local friendships appear limited and predominantly confined to online forums of an extremist nature. The report also highlights issues with digital addiction, including habitual late-night internet use. A psychiatric report from Dr Alice Carmichael, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Sheffield Secure Unit, was submitted on behalf of the defendant. Dr Carmichael concludes that while Mr H displays “rigid cognitive patterns and elevated levels of distrust,” he does not meet criteria for a mental disorder which might impair culpability. The report carefully assesses risk factors and recommends intensive monitoring post-release, in conjunction with ideological disengagement programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). The completion rates and long-term efficacy of DDP, however, remain mixed, as evident from recently published statistics by the National Institute for Security Rehabilitation (NISR). Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. It is worth reiterating that counter-terrorism efforts intrinsically impose heavy workload demands on investigative teams, forensic experts, and multi-agency collaborators. For instance, Local Authority Community Safety Officers in Sheffield report increasing frequency of “low-yield” referrals during this period, which nonetheless strain limited resources. Public Health England data demonstrates a significant upsurge in urban homelessness as of 2024 — a phenomenon which the probation and social services note compounds the complexity of effective supervision in cases involving ideological extremism. Addressing homelessness, mental health supports, and addiction accordingly remains a shared priority. This observation dovetails with the concerns expressed by the Sheffield Assault Victims' Coalition in their victim impact statements, which were submitted to this court in advance and which described the pervasive climate of fear engendered by ideological extremism in the community. While the victims in this case suffered no physical harm, the psychological toll is not to be dismissed. Reference must also be made to a co-defendant initially charged alongside Mr H, who absconded prior to trial and remains at large. This individual’s conduct included offences such as affray involving pool cues and possession of a bladed article within school premises — matters that, while serious in their own right, bear no connection to Mr H’s conduct. The outstanding status of this co-defendant underlines the broader challenge of multi-actor investigations in the counter-terrorism domain. The court further notes the evidence of a third-party relative, a cousin of Mr H, currently under investigation for alleged benefit fraud. No link between this individual and the charges before the court has been established, and the association is noted purely for completeness. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial examination revealed that Mr H conducted a series of cryptocurrency transactions associated with online marketplaces known to facilitate the sale of dual-use components. A forensic accountant detailed a transfer of approximately £3,100 in Bitcoin through multiple mixers, complicating traceability. Cryptocurrencies as a medium for illicit exchanges represent an increasing concern for law enforcement and regulatory bodies worldwide. It is observed that cryptocurrency tumblers, while promoted by some as tools for financial privacy and autonomy, have become instruments of obfuscation employed by criminals to shield transactions from detection. This court echoes the observations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on the risks posed by decentralized finance in national security contexts. Less pertinently, the court was provided with a report documenting street-level incidents of graffiti on public transport infrastructure within Sheffield during the spring of 2025. While the imagery contained politically charged messages, no direct nexus to Mr H has been established. Nonetheless, such acts contribute to public anxieties and represent a challenge for urban law enforcement agencies. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H’s personal narrative is presented against a backdrop of intellectual sophistication and unsettling ideological fixation. His academic credentials, including doctoral candidacy in applied physics interrupted in late 2023, attest to a role as a potential “self-starter extremist,” as described in recent counter-terrorism studies. Letters from the Eastwood Bridge Gardening Collective commend his volunteer efforts in urban green space rehabilitation; these laudable activities coexist uneasily with the extremism underpinning his offending. Careful assessment of his psychological profile reveals a proclivity towards binary moralistic frameworks, supporting a view that his radicalisation derives from cognitive rigidity rather than organic psychiatric disease. Structured professional judgement instruments such as HCR-20 have been applied to aid in risk formulation. This risk is compounded by evidence of persistence in seeking encrypted communications post-arrest, indicating ongoing ideological engagement. The court also received correspondence from the South Beech Food Collective, which operates within Mr H’s former locality. This organisation reported persistent efforts to engage Mr H post-remand, offering support through community integration frameworks. Although participation was minimal, the group reflects a broader desire within civil society to contribute constructively to de-radicalisation pathways. Their continued involvement despite local hostility and graffiti attacks on their premises merits recognition. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. In conclusion, this case represents a grave and multifaceted breach of the public trust and peace. The defendant’s conduct exhibits a high degree of culpability — encompassing careful planning, utilisation of encrypted communications, and procurement of materials with potential for harm. The sophistication and scale of preparation warrants significant custodial consequences. Mitigating features are scarce and primarily confined to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, an educational background indicating potential for rehabilitation, and the late acceptance of responsibility. Those factors, while acknowledged, cannot substantially diminish the imperative of deterrence and public protection paramount in terrorism-related sentencing. The court hereby directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The Probation Service must provide detailed recommendations regarding the prospect of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, coupled with conditions incorporating GPS monitoring, managed internet access, and mandatory engagement with specialised deradicalisation programmes. The report should critically evaluate the feasibility of placement within an approved premises environment equipped to manage high-risk individuals, and the availability of accredited forensic psychology services for ongoing structured professional judgement assessment. The forensic psychiatric opinion and the evolving risk landscape require careful balancing in formulating post-sentence management. The court underscores that any such rehabilitative endeavour must be coupled with robust enforcement tailored to the realities of contemporary extremist threats. Sentencing remarks are recorded this 11th day of October 2025 in Court 4 at Sheffield Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is hereby informed of his statutory right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved pending sentencing determination.
