Mr H Case No. B2025/29842 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. C. Lawford Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H appears for sentence on charges under sections 5(1)(a) and 57 of the Terrorism Act 2006 and Terrorism Act 2000, respectively. The conduct attributed to him covers the period from September 2022 through to his arrest in April 2025. The court has heard extensive evidence and submissions in this multifaceted matter, and it is now incumbent upon me to deliver sentencing remarks prior to the formal sentencing hearing. The defendant’s initial apprehension occurred at 04:50 on 3 April 2025, following the execution of a search warrant by the South West Counter Terrorism Unit (SWCTU) at his residential address in Montpelier, Bristol. The warrant was granted pursuant to subsection 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 following intelligence obtained from the Joint Security Service highlighting Mr H’s involvement in digital communications with proscribed entities. At the time of his arrest, officers recovered an array of electronic devices, including encrypted external drives and a range of items flagged by explosives expertise as potentially dual-use. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Prior to the arrest, the investigation had been underway for several months, involving a collaborative effort between SWCTU and the National Cyber Countermeasure Taskforce. This inter-agency endeavour relied heavily on open-source intelligence, geospatial analysis of social media activity, and digital traffic correlation. Of interest, the digital forensic workload experienced by the National Cyber Taskforce has increased by over 35% year on year since 2021, attributable in part to the rising sophistication of encryption technology and the proliferation of anonymisation services. While such forensic challenges are far from unique, they underscore the resource implications of prosecuting complex terrorism cases in the digital age. The court must comment on procedural matters that have delayed the progression of this case. The Legal Aid Agency’s decision to cap funding for the defence’s expert forensic consultation substantially slowed disclosure and defence preparation. This is not an isolated example; accounts from defence practitioners indicate systemic underprovision of resources for cases requiring digital expertise, which can compromise the defendant’s ability to fully and properly prepare their case. It is a matter of professionalism and justice that these hurdles are surmounted, but no less regrettable for their persistence. A report from the local Probation Service highlights the acute pressures faced within offender management departments. Staffing shortages, with vacancies averaging 15% regionally, exacerbate caseload volumes and hamper the capacity for detailed risk assessment, particularly in terrorism-related contexts where vigilance must be constant. These systemic stresses may seem peripheral, yet they form the backdrop to the operational challenges that accompany cases such as this. The court notes a letter submitted by the Bristol Homeless Outreach Network, drawing attention to the increasing visibility of rough sleeping in the city centre and the attendant risks this poses to vulnerable individuals. While this submission bears no direct relation to the defendant’s culpability or the facts of this matter, it paints a picture of a city contending with multiple, intersecting social issues that require careful policy attention. It is also worth recording that a Channel referral was made in late 2019 by a secondary school teacher following concerns about Mr H’s attendance and associations at the time. The referral was closed after a six-week monitoring period with engagement from the Prevent team, who noted a reduction in concerning behaviour. This intervention is recognised not for its efficacy in this matter, but as an example of the layered institutional efforts to identify and intervene in ideological vulnerability prior to escalation. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. The evidence unfolds a digital footprint of increasing radicalisation expressed via online forums where Mr H is alleged to have posted lengthy treatises advancing grievances and justification for violence. Linguistic analysis commissioned by the prosecution notes a progressive adoption of key terminology and ideological frameworks consistent with international extremist manifestos. Defence submissions suggest that some writings may have been exploratory or even satirical; however, the jury found otherwise after weighing the totality of the evidence. Recent jurisprudence assists in framing the court’s approach to sentencing in terrorism cases. The Supreme Court’s decision in R v. Bashir [2023] UKSC 43 reiterates the imperative that sentences must reflect the need for deterrence, protection of the public, and denunciation in contexts where ideological extremism fuels criminality. Bashir also affirms that the mere possession of such materials or engagement in preparatory conduct can attract significant custodial sentences where the intent to act is clear. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensic recovery uncovered extensive encrypted volumes, including instructional materials and schematic diagrams relating to improvised explosive devices. Some were severely corrupted or incomplete. Defence experts raised issues about the defendant’s actual access to all content; yet, as per the position taken in R v. Alanzi [2022] EWCA Crim 612, possession with awareness suffices to establish culpability for preparatory offences. The incomplete files do not diminish the assessed level of danger. Turning to other evidential features, the court finds it necessary to note an unrelated drug offence prosecuted in a local magistrates’ court against a co-defendant, who surrendered to police months after Mr H’s arrest. The two have no proven direct operational link. Authorities caution that conflating co-defendant actions risks misattribution of roles and responsibilities—an often overlooked but vital point in complex prosecutions. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Notwithstanding the gravity of these findings, a forensic analysis of Mr H’s photographic archives included benign collections of vintage cars and landscape images. Defence counsel submitted that this exhibited a well-rounded personality and interests disconnected from extremist pursuits. The court regards this evidence as peripheral and of limited weight in its sentencing calculus. An NHS Forensic Psychology report, submitted pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules, offers a comprehensive assessment of Mr H’s mental state over the intervening period. Dr Ayesha Killick observed a rigid cognitive style with a tendency to ideological absolutism but categorically ruled out any diagnosable mental disorder. The report underscores the defendant’s capacity to understand the nature and consequences of his actions, a critical consideration in assessing moral blameworthiness. The inquiry also exposed the toll that counter-terrorism investigations place on policing resources. Officers deployed for lengthy shifts, sometimes delayed by operational exigencies unrelated to the case, have faced cumulative fatigue. The South West Fire Brigade, while not directly engaged, was on standby during controlled searches of potential hazardous materials. This highlights the multi-agency nature of modern threat response, where effective coordination is indispensable. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. Mr H’s international travel records reveal a brief visit to Rotterdam in late 2023, ostensibly for academic purposes. However, surveillance indicates unrecorded movements to an industrial estate noted by Counter Terrorism Policing as a site frequented by known extremists. Defence submissions contest this as coincidence; the court is bound to draw reasonable inferences. Cases concerning late guilty pleas furnish instructive precedent. As seen in R v. Stuart [2024] EWCA Crim 1997, late admissions after protracted trial preparation reduce the extent of sentencing credit. Mr H’s plea on 10 September 2025 comes after extensive disclosure and witness preparation, limiting the mitigating recognition that may be afforded. Regarding the provenance of evidence, it is pertinent that the Police Digital Evidence Unit encountered software compatibilities issues when processing defences’ material - a consequence of widely varying formats and encryption protocols. Such technicalities have become regrettably commonplace, imposing delays on case timelines and inflating costs. Prison service correspondence indicates an acute shortage of places in high-security units suited to terrorism offenders. This structural shortfall necessitates careful consideration of interim placements pending sentencing to minimise risk. The Department of Justice acknowledges these challenges in their recent annual report, calling for increased funding for custodial estate development. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A cryptocurrency transaction trail identified by cyber forensic accountants reveals transfers of approximately £3,700 over several months from an account linked to Mr H’s other persona. These payments transited via multiple mixers and tumblers, reputed to obfuscate linkage. The court reiterates prior comments on the challenges this poses to transparency and enforcement, echoing concerns raised in parliamentary committees. The Modern Slavery and Exploitation Unit provided an amicus report addressing the context of such financial activity, noting that illicit funds related to extremist procurement networks can sometimes disguise flows associated with forced labour exploitation. This tangential material, while not directly relevant to Mr H, evidences the complex intersections of criminal business models involved. Careful consideration was given to the statements from victims indirectly affected by the anticipated consequences of Mr H’s conduct. A coalition of community groups submitted a joint letter describing the mettle and resilience of Bristol’s diverse populace in confronting violence and extremism. Their words, though not evidencing personal loss, reveal the societal stakes at play in terrorism proceedings. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is 30 years old and holds an honours degree in computer science from a nationally respected university. His former employer, a regional software development firm, provided a character reference describing him as “technically gifted but socially withdrawn.” His abrupt resignation following security clearance disputes coincided with what the prosecution suggests was critical escalation in preparatory planning. The defendant’s partner has submitted multiple letters describing his efforts to engage with rehabilitation programmes, including a local mentoring initiative aimed at disengagement from extremist ideologies. Such engagement is of course encouraged, though the court takes a reserved view where it relates to attempts late in proceedings. Mention should be made of correspondence received from the Bristol Youth Arts Foundation, which detailed Mr H’s limited volunteer work teaching coding to underprivileged adolescents. This community contribution, while laudable, offers limited mitigation in the context of his offending. The Probation Service pre-sentence report emphasises elevated risks, including the defendant’s demonstrated cognitive rigidity and propensity for binary thinking, which hinder responsiveness to standard desistance interventions. The authors note that special psychological programmes with a focus on ideological deradicalisation and cognitive restructuring may assist but stress that there are no guarantees. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. In summary, this case presents a calculated and sustained effort by Mr H to prepare acts of terrorism, evidenced by encrypted and sophisticated material, intent inferred from conduct and planning, and supplemented by demonstrable operational contacts. The aggravating features are substantial, including the targeted nature of the intended harm, the duration of offending conduct, and the technical capabilities applied. Mitigating factors are minimal. The defendant’s previous good character, educational achievements, and belated guilty pleas warrant some recognition, but cannot outweigh the serious threats posed. The court reminds itself, in line with the Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in 2023, that protection of the public and the need for deterrence remain paramount. A comprehensive pre-sentence report will be commissioned, informing management of risk, suitability for custody or community measures, and recommendations for rehabilitative support or licence conditions, including potential polygraph monitoring and GPS curfew enforcement. Community safety, not individual rehabilitative aspirations alone, dictates measures in cases of this nature. These sentencing remarks are made on this 15th day of September 2025, in Court 11 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been prepared and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The transcript will be made available to counsel and relevant authorities. The defendant has the right of appeal against sentence within 28 days of the passing of sentence in accordance with the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. No reporting restrictions apply under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs remain reserved.
