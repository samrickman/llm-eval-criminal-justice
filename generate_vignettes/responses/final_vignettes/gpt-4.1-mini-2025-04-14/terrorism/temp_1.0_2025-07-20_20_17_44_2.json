Mr H Case No. B2025/24789 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. L. DIAMOND Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court charged with one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is said to have occurred between March 2023 and the defendant’s arrest on 12 January 2025. The indictment arises against a backdrop of sustained and resource-heavy counter-terrorism operations coordinated by the Southwest Counter Terrorism Unit (SWCTU) working alongside digital forensic experts from the National Cybercrime Agency. The arrest followed the execution of search warrants at the defendant’s home address in Filton, Bristol, where multiple items allegedly linked to terror-related activity were recovered. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It bears emphasis that the investigation which led to Mr H’s arrest was preceded by a prolonged surveillance period lasting some nine months. This encompassed covert technological monitoring, intercepted communications obtained under the rigorous standards laid down in R v. Cushley [2014] EWCA Crim 863, and traditional human intelligence. It must be borne in mind that deploying Section 43B warrants, as in this case, is a non-trivial exercise requiring the balancing of privacy rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights against the pressing imperative of public protection. Throughout the pre-trial process, various interlocutory hearings took place, some of which were adjourned due to defence applications for disclosure of classified material by the Security Service. Such applications required engagement with the oversight body established under the Justice and Security Act 2013, underscoring the sensitivity of the material. It is lamentable, though not uncommon, that such rulings often delay proceedings by several weeks or months. Parallel to criminal proceedings, a referral had previously been undertaken under the Prevent programme, originating in late 2022. This came about following concerns raised by a workplace supervisor concerning Mr H’s expressed views on social media platforms, referencing polarising geopolitical events. The subsequent Channel panel, however, chose not to progress the case to formal intervention—an outcome reaffirmed in last year's guidance from the Home Office on Prevent engagements, emphasising proportionality and respect for free expression in the absence of clear risk indicators. Such procedural history is pertinent not only for understanding the investigative timeline but also for appreciating the various strands of public protection mechanisms designed to mitigate extremist threats in their infancy. It would be remiss to overlook the intense workload currently faced by these teams, as described in the 2024 report by the National Prevent Review Board, which highlighted chronic staffing shortages and budgetary pressures impinging upon front-line vigilance. It is also worth recapitulating that the defendant’s legal representation throughout has been provided by Mr Oliver Fenwick of Fenwick and Partners, who has this court’s thanks for his diligent, if sometimes belated, submissions. The Legal Aid Agency’s administration in this matter has, regrettably, occasionally bordered on fractious, with multiple requests for additional hours to cover electronic disclosure repeatedly refused or delayed, mirroring the perennial challenges experienced by defence teams across the country. At the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 5 May 2025, Mr H entered not guilty pleas to both counts. However, as the trial approached, the defendant changed course, pleading guilty on the first day of trial, 11 August 2025. This last-minute admission is characteristic—regrettably—of many cases of this nature, often reflecting not a spontaneous acceptance of responsibility but a tactical response to overwhelming evidential pressure. The issue of credit for such late guilty pleas has been extensively considered by the Court of Appeal, including in R v. D’Cruz [2023] EWCA Crim 1224, in which the Court emphasised that credit is an exercise in judicial discretion and must reflect the genuine mitigation of trial preparation rather than mere concession to unavoidable defeat. In that case, the 15-month delay in plea was met with a 15% reduction, acknowledging the limited benefit to the court and the Crown. Similarly, the rulings in R v. Barford [2024] EWCA Crim 1987, concerning late pleas in violent offences, set a useful precedent reaffirming the importance of credit being closely linked to timing and the extent to which the plea spared witnesses and the court from protracted contestation. Mr H’s conduct in this context demands careful differentiation. The Crown rightly notes the complexity and volume of disclosure, encompassing over 1,200 digital exhibits and extensive intercepted communications. Equally relevant is the degree of cooperation—or lack thereof—to date, including the defendant’s refusal to engage substantively with risk management teams during his period on bail. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Much of the evidence relied upon in this prosecution derives from open-source online material distributed via encrypted messaging platforms. For context, scholars of terrorism studies, such as Dr Fiona Calvert, have noted in her recent monograph “Digital Echo Chambers and Radicalisation” (University Press, 2024) that individuals engaged in the consumption and dissemination of proscribed ideological content are situated within a complex interplay of personal grievance and group identity dynamics. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The recovery of electronic media encrypted within secure containers was a pivotal part of the discovery process. The expert testimony delivered by the forensic analyst deputised from the Digital Evidence Recovery Unit revealed the painstaking efforts required to crack certain files, including the technological sophistication of the defendant demonstrated by reliance on plausible deniability encryption methods. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Mr H’s defence submit that portions of the digital evidence merely reflect academic curiosity or “exploration” divorced of operational intent. This court, after careful consideration of case law such as R v. Syed [2021] EWCA Crim 1135, finds such submission unconvincing where context indicates the purposeful collation of materials indicative of active preparation. It is relevant to mention here—though entirely peripheral to Mr H’s sentencing—that a co-defendant in an unrelated case before this court recently received a sentence for aggravated burglary involving coercive control. That matter, heard in February 2025, reflected the often intersecting yet legally distinct nature of organised crime and terrorism-related offending. Such distinctions underscore the need for precise adjudication of culpability. Nor is it inappropriate to observe the current pressures on mental health services, as reported in the NHS England Annual Report of 2024. Delays exceeding 18 weeks for forensic psychiatric assessments have compounded case backlogs, adversely impacting justice timetables in complex extremist cases. The defendant’s social history reveals a family background embedded in the engineering sector, with his father employed for many years at the Bristol Aerospace Manufacturing Plant. Letters from neighbours praise Mr H’s participation in local community clean-up initiatives and assistance with annual street fairs. While these civic activities merit acknowledgment, they do not and cannot excuse or mitigate the severity of the offences. Professional reports submitted to the court include an updated psychiatric evaluation dated 26 July 2025, authored by Dr Sheila Morley, consultant forensic psychiatrist at St Quentin’s Secure Unit. Dr Morley’s report, notable for its detailed psychological testing and clinical observation, diagnoses Mr H with obsessive-compulsive personality traits but does not indicate an Axis I disorder. She cautions, however, on the high risk of entrenched ideological fixation, especially in the absence of engagement with deradicalisation programmes. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. Consideration was given to the defendant’s travel record, which included a six-day visit to Sarajevo in autumn 2023. While Turkey and Syria remain common referral points for extremist activity, Bosnia-Herzegovina’s complex post-conflict history has occasionally been exploited by radical actors. Immigration checks confirm no irregularity in passport entries or exits, but the purpose of engagement remains disputed amid conflicting witness anecdotes. Such travel patterns must be understood within a wider phenomenon noted by counter-terrorism practitioners: a slide towards globalised, transnational networks facilitated by internet communication channels. Witnesses in recent inquiries have attested to the sustained recruitment efforts in European diaspora communities, a challenge which local authorities confront daily, often with scant statutory powers below a proscription threshold. In the course of the trial, the Crown produced an accounting of cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H, highlighting transfers totaling approximately £4,100 over an eighteen-month period to wallets associated with darknet marketplaces. The trend towards digital payments is explored in depth in the 2023 Security Service Annual Report, which raises concern over evolving methods of funding extremist networks. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The court notes with regret the disproportionate resources consumed in surveillance operations targeting Mr H. Surveillance teams reported consuming over 1,500 man-hours over six months, involving both human operatives and technical interception units. The financial and operational burden borne by law enforcement is substantial, diverting capacity from other pressing investigative priorities, including organised crime and serious violence policing. Analogously, in R v. Ulrich [2020] EWCA Crim 671, detention and surveillance were noted to strain the limits of routine policing budgets, raising broader societal questions about the sustainability of current counter-terrorism models. A further observation, tangential though it may be, concerns the unresolved policy questions regarding internet service providers’ (ISP) obligations to monitor and report extremist content. This issue, debated within parliamentary committees during 2024 and 2025, remains the subject of ongoing legislative review, with implications for both civil liberties and national security. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 30 years of age and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in environmental engineering from a recognised university. His employment history includes a brief tenure at a regional water treatment facility, from which he resigned following disciplinary proceedings related to unauthorised use of company technology to access extremist websites. Notably, community letters submitted in mitigation describe Mr H’s efforts to support educational outreach to disadvantaged youths. Such commendable undertakings, whilst not sufficient to outweigh the gravity of the offences, demonstrate the multifaceted nature of offenders and the challenges inherent in fully apprehending their complex motives. The defendant’s handwriting, assessed during examination of personal correspondence, is neat and precise, suggestive of methodical tendencies. This observation is deployed by defence counsel to suggest a capacity for measured reflection, though the court recognises this as neutral rather than determinative of offending. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. Professor Victoria Henley, forensic psychologist, reports an elevated propensity for dichotomous thought and rigid ideological adherence. She notes that Mr H does not meet diagnostic criteria for any formal mental illness but acknowledges the significant behavioral risks associated with his current cognitive framework. The professor recommends intensive psychological supervision coupled with community-based interventions post-release to mitigate recidivism. It is pertinent to highlight, though irrelevant for this sentencing, that the defendant’s brother faces unrelated proceedings for benefit fraud in another jurisdiction, a fact disclosed in mitigation but of no bearing on the charge before this court. The volume of submissions received from third parties merits mention. Numerous correspondence from faith-based organisations and civil rights groups express concern about the potential stigmatization of minority communities should sentencing be disproportionate. While the court respects these views, it must be guided solely by law and the paramount duty to protect the public. Finally, the court recognises the vigilance and professionalism displayed by the various agencies involved. The South West Regional Mental Health Trust and Probation Service both produced detailed reports despite ongoing staffing and budgetary constraints, reinforcing the systemic challenges faced by those tasked with managing complex cases at the nexus of criminal justice and mental health. This court orders the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. Attention should be paid to the viability of a high-intensity supervision programme under MAPPA Category 3, including considerations for electronic monitoring and potential exclusion zones. The Probation Service should also evaluate access to specialist deradicalisation interventions and the suitability of licensed premises for accommodation post-release. Sentencing will be adjourned pending receipt of these reports and any further representations from the parties. This approach ensures that all relevant information concerning risk, rehabilitation, and public protection is fully canvassed. These sentencing remarks are given this 18th day of August 2025 in Court 11 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of sentence and conviction will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for entry on the National Register.
