Mr H Case No. B2025/29834 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L.M. RANDALL Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending activity is alleged to have taken place principally between January 2023 and his arrest in late February 2025. The court recognises at the outset the complexity inherent in modern terrorism proceedings. The infrastructure established by Parliament and refined through evolving jurisprudence continues to test the dexterity of legal practitioners and the patience of the court system. The balancing act between open justice and national security, between safeguarding rights and protecting the public, remains as delicate as ever. Mr H was arrested on 23 February 2025 pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The operation leading to his apprehension was the product of an inter-agency collaboration involving Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), the National Crime Agency Digital Forensics Unit (NCA-DFU), and the Security Service. Intelligence gathered through lawful interception of encrypted communication channels had signalled potentially substantial preparatory activity coordinated remotely by the defendant. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This arrest concluded a multi-phased and resource-intense investigation named Operation BRAMBLE which extended over nearly eighteen months. The investigative approach was multifaceted, combining traditional covert surveillance, electronic intercept, and the painstaking extraction and analysis of digital data located on multiple devices seized from Mr H and associated premises. It must be appreciated that investigative processes of this complexity frequently encounter delays. The chain of custody over voluminous digital evidence, cross-jurisdictional consultation with allied intelligence partners, and the stringent security clearance procedures required before disclosure mean that trials such as this often experience necessary scheduling adjustments. This courtroom remains acutely aware of the pressures on court listings and defence practitioners alike stemming from under-resourcing. Notably, the operation’s progress was further hampered by intermittent labour disputes within the National Forensic Laboratory Service, causing a backlog of awaiting digital forensic reports by as much as thirteen weeks. This demonstrated once more the fragility of our public institutions in the face of sustained operational demand — a point frequently made in correspondence between Crown and defence, and one the court must regard with sober reflection. A notable historical reference serves to illustrate the penal context for this matter. In R v. Salim [2011] EWCA Crim 2854, the Court of Appeal recognised that early intervention in the conspiracy to cause harm can attract wide discretion when assessing culpability and sentence length. While the facts of Salim differ materially, the underlying principle of pre-emptive protection as a sentencing aim remains germane here. Several early procedural hearings were marred by necessitated adjournments, some attributable to administrative strain within the Legal Aid Agency to authorise funding required for specialist instructions, including independent electronic forensic consultants and expert psychiatric reports. Mr H’s legal team registered formal complaints regarding delays in receiving documentation vital for case preparation — a complaint echoed across many contemporary terrorism prosecutions. At the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 4 August 2025, the defendant initially pleaded not guilty on both counts. The jury was sworn on 12 August, and following three days of hearing, and after extensive expert and forensic evidence was heard, Mr H changed his plea to guilty on both counts on 17 August 2025. The court emphasises that whilst the law expressly permits credit to be granted for guilty pleas, the prosecution of terrorism offences often involves extraordinarily lengthy pre-trial preparation. A plea entered late in the timetable is a tactical manoeuvre and should be accorded commensurately reduced discount to sentence. This view aligns with established guidance including R v. Thorpe [2024] EWCA Crim 961, where the Court underlined that discount for plea is contingent on timely acceptance which demonstrably alleviates court and witness burden. Counter-terrorism legislation in the United Kingdom represents a statutory tapestry that has evolved over the last two decades — beginning with the Terrorism Act 2000, through the 2006 Terrorism Act reforms, and supplemented by subsequent amendments addressing the changing typologies of threat, including online radicalisation and foreign fighter phenomena. The present sentencing must reflect this legislative heritage while ensuring adherence to the sentencing principles enumerated in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and current Sentencing Council guidelines. The 2024 update to the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline continues to provide the structured framework for this court’s determination. Factors requiring particular consideration include the level of planning and sophistication, the scope and scale of harm risked, intention to radicalise or incite others, and the defendant’s culpability profile relative to his role. The defendant’s engagement with community-based interventions prior to this prosecution has been variable. The Prevent duty intervention by the West Midlands Prevent Team commenced in mid-2022 with referrals from an academic setting. While initial engagement was encouraging, it deteriorated rapidly, with Mr H ceasing attendance at cognitive behavioural therapy settings and declining mentorship offered by specialist community workers. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. Review of open-source propaganda platforms uncovered multiple posts attributed to Mr H under pseudonymous accounts, leavened with extremist rhetoric exhorting political violence and dehumanising particular groups. The nature and timing of these posts coincided with well-documented surges in overseas terror campaigns, suggesting an ideological alignment rather than mere commentary. The handling of digital forensic data in this case was particularly challenging. Extracted material revealed encrypted volumes with layered access restrictions utilising modern cryptographic standards widely regarded as state-of-the-art. The forensic analyst teams deployed brute force and hardware-accelerated attacks over protracted periods to render these accessible. Of note, several encrypted files bore names suggestive of incendiary device construction manuals and tactical information concerning vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defence sought to characterise these materials as part of possessory curiosity, akin to movements in certain collector communities referencing guerrilla historical artefacts, or as materials gathered for academic interest alone. The court finds this suggestion unpersuasive, especially given the coherence of the overall planning and preparation demonstrated elsewhere. There was expert evidence tendered concerning the defendant’s mental state. A report authored by Dr Samuel Kline, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was tendered following a comprehensive assessment conducted over a three-day inpatient observation period in April 2025. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Dr Kline concluded that, although the defendant demonstrated a degree of cognitive rigidity and a somewhat elevated risk of personality disorder traits, there was no evidence of psychosis or affective disorder that might impede criminal responsibility. Factors noted with caution included an obsessive fixation on political grievance and a tendency towards binary moral constructs, but the report underscored that these characteristics in themselves do not diminish culpability in terrorism contexts but may complicate rehabilitation efforts. The court notes the contemporaneous importance of R v. Khalifa [2024] EWCA Crim 1108, which reasserted sentencing principles in cases involving ideological extremism absent mitigating mental disorder. The Court reiterated that radicalisation, while a complex social and psychological phenomenon, cannot be conflated with insanity or diminished responsibility absent demonstrable clinical thresholds. In examining the wider personal history of the defendant, it is germane to recount his educational and occupational background. Mr H commenced tertiary education in 2014 at a Polytechnic institution where he attained a diploma in electronic engineering. Subsequent employment was intermittent, primarily in low-skilled warehouse roles. Defence counsel submitted character references highlighting his volunteer work with a local community food bank over a two-year period, a point acknowledged but of limited mitigating value given the severity of offending in this case. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. The defendant travelled to a regional conference in July 2023, purportedly to attend workshops on community development. However, the intelligence case establishes that he convened with known radicals, with encrypted messaging intercepts corroborating contact with individuals on terrorism watchlists. Defence counsel admitted that this travel was a lapse in judgement but urged that no tangible harm resulted. The court is mindful that association in such forums remains deeply concerning, reflecting clear ideological commitment to extremism. Various agencies involved in Mr H’s supervision and management prior to remand have filed substantial evidence concerning his risk profile and cooperation levels. The West Midlands Probation Service provided a detailed pre-sentence report framework, noting that available staff resources are experiencing pronounced shortages, complicating post-release supervision planning. The Probation Service’s inability to allocate a continuous key worker due to vacancy delays reflects systemic challenges in handling high-risk individuals, a recurrent theme in contemporary criminal justice. Furthermore, the ongoing burden borne by Counter Terrorism Policing units cannot be overstated. The increase in “low-level” extremist activity stretches already limited capacities. Similar pressures are observed in forensic examination divisions, where backlog of device analysis now regularly extends beyond six months, not least because of the exponential growth in encrypted, anonymised communication platforms. The defendant had become obsessed with the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and been following the cleaner. One entry in Mr H’s tactical file described how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Amongst the evocative digital findings were cryptocurrency transactions amounting to several thousand pounds sent to a myriad of darknet vendors purporting to supply dual-use chemical precursors. This constellation of financial activity reveals both sophistication and purpose, highlighting the growing utilisation of unregulated financial instruments in illicit procurement chains. This phenomenon poses significant challenges not only for law enforcement but also for financial regulators and policymakers seeking to curb anonymous funding streams which facilitate terrorism. In addition to the foregoing, the court received correspondence from the Birmingham Interfaith Council dated 5 September 2025. The letter expressed concern about the potential societal impact of disproportionate sentencing within minority communities, emphasising the need for care to avoid exacerbating alienation that extremist recruiters might exploit. The court respects these submissions but reminds that justice must remain value-neutral and principled. Public protection is the paramount concern, and while proportionality sits at its core, leniency cannot be extended in circumstances of deliberate preparation for mass casualties. The defendant’s late plea precludes substantial mitigation on grounds of early cooperation. Defence counsel has invoked the operation of the Better Case Management (BCM) reforms, positing that these increased procedural efficiencies improve overall case handling. While they may expedite listing and documentation timelines, BCM measures do not, and cannot, diminish judicial discretion on plea discounts. The experience of this court is that while procedural reform offers promise, challenges remain in securing substantive efficiencies where complex offences predominate. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Personal mitigation additionally advanced comprises reports from the East Midlands Mental Health Trust, which attempted outreach during Mr H’s initial contact with Prevent systems. Unfortunately, engagement was sporadic and unsustained, limiting the benefits typically expected from such early interventions. The court also notes several letters from family members and charitable sector representatives, indicating their ongoing hope for the defendant’s re-integration into society should he be afforded rehabilitative opportunities. These letters, whilst heartfelt, cannot eclipse the requirements of public protection and the gravity of offending. It should be recorded that there is no evidence of any previous convictions or cautions recorded against Mr H. His criminal record is notably clean aside from minor, unrelated motoring offences several years prior. The court appreciates that absence of prior criminality is a factor which weight may be accorded, but the clear magnitude of terrorist preparation in the present matter overwhelms such considerations. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. The report of Dr Clare Mendel, forensic psychologist instructed by the defence, supports an assessment of high risk of serious harm primarily conditioned by ideological motivation and social isolation rather than major mental disorder. It underscores the importance of sustained, multidisciplinary case management post-sentence – a matter for the National Probation Service and associated agencies to consider carefully. In sentencing Mr H, this court must balance the stated aims of punishment, deterrence, public protection, and rehabilitation as set out in the Sentencing Council’s guidelines and the principles in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The multipronged nature of Mr H’s offending, the high level of ideological commitment evinced, and the meticulousness of planning all weigh heavily in the aggravating direction. Mitigation remains limited to lack of previous convictions, partial engagement with support services, and late acceptance of responsibility by plea. On this basis, a modest reduction for plea at one-sixth is appropriate. The court notes recent reference in the case of R v. Lashkar [2025] EWCA Crim 678, highlighting the efficacy of pre-sentence reports in guiding sentence length and ancillary management conditions such as licence terms, electronic monitoring, and exclusion zones. Such measures are critical in cases with residual risk. Therefore, I direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, evaluating Mr H’s amenability to rehabilitative programming, potential for disengagement from extremist ideology, and the prudent structuring of custodial and post-release supervision components. Particular attention should be given to the incorporation of High-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, polygraph testing, and electronic monitoring possibilities. This court takes this opportunity to commend the professionalism of all agencies involved: the diligence of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, the tireless work of forensic analysts under the NCA Digital Unit, the continued resilience of Prevent teams working in challenging environments, and the patience of defence counsel and their instructing solicitors enduring an adversarial system often beset by delays and funding constraints. Their endeavours serve as a bulwark against extremist threat in these troubled times. These sentencing remarks are made this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 10 at Birmingham Crown Court.
