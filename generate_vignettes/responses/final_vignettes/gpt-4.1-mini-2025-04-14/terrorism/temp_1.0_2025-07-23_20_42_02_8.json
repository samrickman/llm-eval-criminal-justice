Mr H Case No. B2025/23984 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. HARRISON Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr Mr H now appears before this Court for sentence upon convictions recorded at the end of a trial concluded on 15 October 2025. The defendant has been found guilty of multiple offences contrary to the Terrorism Act 2006, namely one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a), and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period of offending conduct, as substantiated by the evidence, is alleged to have extended from the autumn of 2023 until his arrest in early 2025. The Court notes, at the outset, that Mr H’s case has traversed a procedural journey reflective of the complexity inherent in terrorism prosecutions. Following the initial charge on 5 February 2025, a case management hearing convened on 28 March 2025 where preliminary issues relating to disclosure were aired. The hearing was notable for the late disclosure, by the prosecution, of a series of encrypted messaging app artefacts discovered on a number of the defendant’s electronic devices, which necessitated an adjournment to permit forensic decoding. Such delays, whilst regrettable, speak to the ongoing challenges posed by rapidly evolving digital encryption methodologies, which frequently impede the prompt and thorough administeration of justice. These procedural complexities are not unusual in cases of this nature, and while the Court acknowledges the inconvenience occasioned, it commends the professional diligence of digital forensic experts involved. Prior to trial, a plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 13 July 2025, at which Mr H entered a not guilty plea. This plea was maintained until the conclusion of the Prosecution opening, after which the defendant changed plea to guilty on the morning of trial. The Court must observe that, while a guilty plea at any stage benefits the overall administration of justice in eliminating the need for a contested trial, the lateness of such a change constrains the extent of any reduction in sentence credit to be afforded. This proposition is well established in the case law, as seen in R v. Singh [2023] EWCA Crim 1991, where the Court of Appeal emphasised that guilty pleas entered very late in proceedings, after significant preparation and expert evidence disclosure, can attract only limited mitigation. The Court is conscious that the issue of timing in guilty pleas remains a subject of recurrent judicial commentary. For instance, in R v. McMillan [2024] EWCA Crim 408, the Appeal Court endorsed the strict approach to late pleas, underscoring that the principal criterion for credit is the extent to which the plea relieves witnesses of the stress and inconvenience of trial, and contributes to the efficiency of court proceedings. A plea entered at trial commencement scarcely meets these objectives to any meaningful degree and accordingly requires a cautious approach to discounting. A prominent feature of this case has been the extensive covert investigation conducted by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). Arrested on 9 February 2025 at his residence in Redcliffe Street, Bristol, Mr H was the subject of a significant multi-agency inquiry which also involved the National Cybercrime Unit, the Security Service, and local Counter Terrorism units. The investigative operation relied heavily upon the use of advanced interception technology, together with surveillance and analysis of encrypted communication traffic. Such activity was authorised under appropriate warrants issued by the Surveillance Commissioner, pursuant to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. In an era beset by varied and often protean expression of ideological extremism, it is axiomatic that effective response depends upon inter-agency cooperation. This Court expresses its appreciation to the officers, analysts, and intelligence personnel whose sustained efforts in unraveling cyber-encrypted communications are critical though often unseen contributions to public safety. The evolving threat landscape demands constant innovation and the mobilisation of increasingly sophisticated tools. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The history of the Terrorism Act 2006 itself is instructive in placing Mr H’s offending conduct within a legal framework designed to balance the imperatives of civil liberty and national security. Enacted in the context of heightened global concern about the threat posed by domestic and international terror networks, section 5 was intended to capture preparatory conduct bridging mere expression of extremist beliefs and the commission of actual attacks. Its imposition of a high threshold reflects Parliamentary intent to deter conduct that, while preliminary, carries sufficient indication of imminent danger. The structure of sentencing within this sphere has developed in recent years to encompass a nuanced rubric of culpability, with serious weight accorded to factors such as the defendant’s degree of sophistication in manipulation of communication technologies, the readiness to use disruptive or lethal means, and the ideological motivation underpinning such acts. While the maximum custodial sentence for offences under section 5 is life imprisonment, sentencing guidelines specifically recommend calibration in accordance with individual circumstances. Significant prior judicial consideration of these provisions includes the House of Lords decision in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which underscored the breadth of the “terrorist purpose” definition and the need to construe preparatory conduct in the context of intent and effect. More recently, R v. Al-Jiboori [2022] EWCA Crim 1357 has further clarified the application of section 5 to online radicalisation driven conduct, illuminating the complexities of adjudicating cases in the digital domain. One must also bear in mind the sentencing principles articulated in R v. Babar [2019] EWCA Crim 1058, emphasising that ideological latitude does not excuse otherwise criminal conduct involving the facilitation or actual preparation for terrorist acts. The Court’s primary concern remains the protection of the public. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. The investigation revealed that Mr H maintained an online presence under several pseudonyms on darknet forums dedicated to extremist political communication. There was compelling forensic evidence from encrypted devices that substantial technical resources were utilised to anonymise activities, including the use of Tor browser configurations, multi-hop VPNs, and virtual private servers located in jurisdictions with limited cooperation agreements. Such efforts, while hardly novel in clandestine networks, nevertheless demonstrate a degree of sophistication beyond mere casual interest. As this Court has previously remarked in sentencing remarks at Exeter in the case of R v. Allard [2024], the use of such advanced obfuscation techniques, coupled with the increasing prevalence of cryptocurrencies to mask financial transactions, pose a profound challenge to law enforcement agencies tasked with detection and interdiction. These developments also raise resource allocation questions, as investigative teams expend extensive time and expertise in overcoming technical barriers. It is appropriate to record an expression of gratitude to the West Country Digital Forensics Unit. Despite chronic staffing shortages and operational pressures compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic’s aftermath, their forensic analysis was conducted with commendable technical skill and procedural rigour, enabling the extraction and interpretation of data of critical evidential value. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The exhibits tendered in evidence included several encrypted archives, found concealed within steganographic containers embedded in innocuous image files. Among these were documents outlining schematic designs for improvised explosive devices, performance testing data, and communications deliberating potential target sites. Importantly, analysis identified a partial correspondence between Mr H and a convicted co-defendant in a prior prosecution for firearms possession and conspiracy to commit public order offences—albeit the defendant here disavowed knowledge of the latter’s activities. The issue of co-defendants is a perennial source of complexity in terrorism trials, often generating procedural cross-currents. In a related matter, R v. Edwards [2023] EWCA Crim 1215, the Court of Appeal dealt with challenges arising from evidentiary spillover between linked defendants, affirming that the interests of justice require careful trial management to avoid prejudicial association. In the present case, the co-defendant identified as Mr Y had previously been charged with aggravated vehicle theft, possession of offensive weapons, and affray linked to a dispute outside a public house. These offences, while serious in their own right, are not attributed to Mr H and are irrelevant to his own culpability save as context for associative risks. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. It is pertinent to record that historical context reveals a distinct evolution in prosecutorial focus. Whereas early terrorism legislation was primarily concerned with state-sponsored or organised group activity, much contemporary offending involves “lone-actor” phenomena or localised cells. The manifestations are diverse: from dissemination of radical manifestos, incitement on social media platforms, to the acquisition of materials utilising online marketplaces. The Court observes the burdens placed upon public services by the volume and intensity of such cases. The Probation Service has recently reported that staffing ratios in the southwest region have declined due to recruitment difficulties, contributing to extended caseloads and hampering effective management of high-risk offenders. This underlines the importance of judicious sentence planning that takes into account both custodial and community supervision requirements. It is also notable that the East Somerset Prevent Hub has, throughout this period, maintained intermittent engagement efforts with the defendant, though implementation was complicated by frequent address changes and partial disengagement. Attempts to introduce cognitive-behavioural therapy modules tailored to ideological deradicalisation were only partially successful, hampered by Mr H’s sporadic attendance. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. The Court is aware that Mr H travelled abroad on multiple occasions during the period preceding arrest, including documented trips to Eastern European cities with known ties to extremist networks. While such travel is not in itself proscribed, it provided the prosecution with opportunity to argue that the defendant sought access to overseas support and training. Defence submissions maintained that trips were primarily cultural in nature, an assertion which the jury evidently did not accept in toto. Collateral to the main proceedings, an earlier prosecution for an unrelated matter of shoplifting involving a significant alcohol theft from a supermarket in the Cheltenham area was noted in the defendants’ ancillary documents. Though bearing no direct connection to the criminality under consideration here, such details often emerge in the voluminous multi-agency reports prepared for the Court and can sometimes distract from core issues if not carefully delineated. One must also remark upon the procedural aspects of judicial listing in this case. The trial was subject to several postponements, occasioned in part by industrial action among court clerks, as well as the late arrival of interpreter services required for a witness giving evidence via video-link. Those delays, while regrettable, reflect current systemic pressures and resource constraints common across jurisdictions. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial analysis in this case revealed the use of cryptocurrency wallets transacted to vendors specialising in dual-use chemicals, readily accessible via darknet platforms. The complexities inherent in blockchain tracking demand extensive expertise, which was supplied by the National Crime Agency's cybercrime taskforce. This body performed painstaking analysis to attribute wallet ownership with a high degree of certainty to the defendant’s known aliases. The rise of cryptocurrencies as instruments for funding illicit endeavours poses a significant challenge to regulatory and enforcement bodies. At the European level, proposals for enhanced transparency measures have been repeatedly stalled by competing interests, underscoring the gaps emboldening malign actors. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. In consideration of personal mitigating circumstances, the Court has reviewed a detailed psychological report authored by Dr Fiona Mersey, consultant forensic psychiatrist, detailed and professionally composed, which found no diagnosis of enduring mental disorder but highlighted traits of rigid binary thinking and an entrenched ideological worldview resistant to external influence. The report states that while Mr H is not formally mentally ill, his personality traits contribute to an elevated risk of restrengthened extremist beliefs if unsupported post-release. The report further notes his family background, characterized by evident closeness to a younger sister and estranged contact with his father. Letters tendered on behalf of his community mosque outline his prior engagement in outreach programmes before withdrawal coinciding with the commencement of the offending period. The Probation Service pre-sentence report stresses the difficulty of managing such offenders in terms of balancing rehabilitative possibilities with robust risk management, especially given local shortages in bespoke forensic psychology provision. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. The Court recognises that the defendant possessed notable technical skills derived from formal training in electronic engineering, which facilitated his capability to produce detailed and technically accurate device designs. This degree of expertise elevates the culpability under sentencing guidelines, placing him in the upper tiers of seriousness. Aggravating features include the deliberate use of encryption and anonymisation technologies, engagement in active procurement efforts of restricted materials, and a manifest intent to facilitate indiscriminate harm. Mitigating features are limited to absence of previous convictions, the defendant’s educational attainment, and partial cooperation following late guilty pleas. A reduction for the plea is therefore limited to one-sixth of the sentence. The Court directs the Probation Service to prepare a thorough pre-sentence report with particular instructions to assess the feasibility of an extended custodial term with a focus on securing high-intensity psychological interventions aimed at deradicalisation. The report should also consider the potential for managed electronic monitoring and conditions restricting internet access post-release. The need for effective, co-ordinated multi-agency supervision upon any eventual release cannot be overstated. The Court notes the ongoing strain on resources across all public sectors engaged in offender management, a challenge that requires both strategic foresight and sustained funding commitment. These sentencing remarks are issued at Bristol Crown Court on 17 October 2025, in Court 5, and have been transcribed pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5.
