Mr H Case No. B2025/27954 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. G. CORTLAND Filed: 28 August 2025 Mr H appears for sentence before this court in relation to two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a) and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct is alleged to have occurred over a period exceeding eighteen months, ending with the defendant’s arrest early in 2025. The defendant’s arrest was effected at 07:45 on 12 January 2025, pursuant to a warrant executed by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM). The investigative operation drew upon numerous strands of intelligence, including security service intercepts, digital device analysis, and extensive coordination with specialist units specialising in encrypted communication platforms. This case required considerable deployment of covert surveillance teams and cyber forensic analysts over an extended period of time, reflecting the gravity and complexity typical of terrorism-related investigations in contemporary criminal justice. It is appropriate at the outset to acknowledge the somewhat uneven landscape within which these proceedings have unfolded. The present case found its way onto court lists amidst industrial action affecting administrative court staff, contributing to intermittent delays in listing hearings, as well as in court clerk availability. Equally, the Legal Aid Agency’s difficulties in promptly authorising and funding expert defence instructions have imposed procedural pressures. While these matters do not compromise the substantive fairness of the trial process, or the sentencing to follow, they paint a backdrop of strain on judicial and ancillary services to which this court is not impervious. In the realm of counter-terrorism investigations, the court must be mindful of the delicate balance between operational security and procedural openness. The Act under which Mr H has been charged is designed to pre-empt catastrophic harm, and the authority to intercept and explore encrypted communications is circumscribed by legislative and judicial safeguards. Nonetheless, the resources necessary to intercept, decrypt, and analyse voluminous digital correspondence are prodigious, drawing heavily upon specialist units already beset with high caseloads. These matters are not incidental. They illustrate, in vivid relief, the tensions that modern terrorism prosecutions impose on public budgets and policing capacity. The defendant’s prosecution has included extensive forensic examination of digital equipment seized on arrest, comprising laptops, encrypted flash drives, and mobile devices. Such analysis consumed hundreds of investigative hours. I make it clear that these efforts are not merely a demonstration of technical proficiency but rather represent a crucial endeavour to establish the contours of culpability in a domain where physical evidential traces may be conspicuously absent. The evidentiary challenges in these cases are well known: routine methods of proof give way to nuanced inference, contextual interpretation, and close judicial scrutiny of often cryptic material. The court acknowledges, with some concern, that forensic backlogs exacerbate delays and underline the urgency of adequate resourcing in this key field. The prosecution's case was presented with meticulous attention to evidential linkage and narrative coherence. The defendant entered pleas of not guilty initially, maintaining this position through the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 3 July 2025. Only on the morning of the trial, on 18 August 2025, did he tender guilty pleas to both counts. The court must address the implications of this timing in assessing credit for guilty plea recognition. This pattern—a belated admission of guilt following months of pre-trial preparation—is familiar and regrettably commonplace in terrorism matters, as elsewhere. It has clear operational consequences: extensive forensic and witness preparation is mobilised, only to be rendered unnecessary by a timely plea. When such pleas are delayed until the eve or morning of trial, the exercise of judicial discretion in awarding sentence credit must be carefully calibrated. As set out in R v. Nalder [2023] EWCA Crim 1542, a case involving late pleas to offences under the Counter-Terrorism Act 2015, the Court of Appeal underscored that credit for guilty pleas is not an automatic right but a conditional recognition of sincere responsibility and the mitigation of public and victim hardship. Mr Nalder entered plea at a committal hearing after a two-year investigative and preparatory period, a delay which limited credit to no more than one sixth. The present case, while differing in facts, aligns with the principle that tactical timing diminishes the value of a plea in sentencing calculus. To further illustrate, the decision in R v. Chandrasekaran [2022] EWCA Crim 988 provides analysis of plea timing in relation to charges of possessing incendiary devices intended for use in public places. Mr Chandrasekaran persisted in denial throughout the bulk of the trial preparation phase, which necessitated disclosure of sensitive witness statements and expert assessments of explosive materials. His plea at the close of the prosecution case attracted a discount of 10 percent, reflecting tardiness and limited benefit to court efficiency. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The details of the offending conduct, though not restated here, encompass a range of activities indicating a high level of commitment and sophistication. The pattern of behaviour evinces more than casual involvement or mere ideological sympathy, proceeding instead towards preparatory acts exposing the public to potential grave harm. It is instructive to observe the definitional and statutory context within which the court operates in such matters. The Terrorism Act 2006, a substantial legislative response in the post-9/11 era, introduced specific offences targeting preparatory conduct, recognising that the gap between intention and execution can be perilously narrow. Section 5(1)(a) proscribes conduct preparatory to acts of terrorism with the object, inter alia, of advancing terrorist causes, and permits, as the Court of Appeal reiterated in R v. Dawood [2018] EWCA Crim 1213, robust sentencing reflecting the public interest in deterrence and incapacitation. Regrettably, sentencing in terrorism cases cannot be divorced from the broader societal and institutional challenges confronting law enforcement and the courts. The pressures experienced across Probation Service staffing, criminal justice funding, and mental health service access all have an indirect bearing on both risk management and rehabilitative potential—a fact well documented in the 2024 Criminal Justice Board report on Managing Extremism-Related Offenders in the Community. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. Mr H’s online footprint reflects a gradual transition from peripheral engagement with contentious political discourse to the curation of materials explicitly proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. The Crown's expert notice makes clear that linguistic markers, digital communication patterns, and metadata analysis converge to show control and dissemination of radicalising content. These findings substantiate the assertion of deliberate and sustained ideological immersion. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The digital forensic recovery revealed encrypted containers denominated “RavensWing,” within which detailed schematics for explosive devices and incendiary mechanisms were stored. The presence of such material, inaccessible without significant technical skill, underscores not just ideology but operational intent. A point of contention in submissions concerned whether the storage of incomplete or fragmentary files should be treated with equal gravity; the court concurs with the proposition in R v. Todd [2021] EWCA Crim 1020 that intent may be discerned from preparatory acts, notwithstanding partiality of physical evidence. The defence’s attempt to rationalise some images as part of a photographic hobby, referencing an Instagram account featuring aerial shots of urban architecture, is not persuasive in light of the totality of the evidence. The court must be mindful that innocent coincidence cannot afford safe harbour in a case of this complexity and potential for indiscriminate harm. It is appropriate at this juncture to address ancillary matters which, while irrelevant to sentencing, elucidate the procedural environment. Mention was made during trial of a 2017 fixed-penalty notice issued to Mr H for cycling without proper lighting. This minor infringement, irrelevant to his ideological trajectory or culpability, was adduced in an attempt to humanise the defendant. The court considers such references peripheral; their evidential value is negligible and does not affect the ultimate assessment of culpability. Similarly, the defence submitted material referencing Mr H’s non-contested 2014 conviction for shoplifting of alcohol and toiletries from a supermarket. That offence, unrelated in character and remoteness, cannot be said to indicate propensity or mitigate his involvement in more serious enterprise. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The seizure at arrest included items such as an olive-green gas mask, which was argued by the defence to be a collector’s item acquired through legitimate means. The court, however, finds the intended use in the context of preparation for terrorism compelling and therefore an aggravating feature. The court is cognisant that among the material recovered were letters and logbooks associated with a local community radio broadcasting group, where Mr H was once a volunteer. While commendable on its own terms, this involvement does not negate the deliberate engagement in extremist planning. The court acknowledges the complex interplay of competing social identifications, but this cannot afford alleviation or create divergence from the requirements of public protection. It is also germane to note that mental health liaison documentation was exchanged between East Birmingham Primary Care Trust and custody staff during Mr H’s detention. The notes refer to intermittent anxiety and depressive symptoms, though no formal clinical diagnosis has been proffered. The court reiterates that such information is contextual but not determinative of culpability or sentence. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. Regarding travel history, the Crown drew attention to a journey undertaken by Mr H to Lisbon in October 2023. While described to authorities as a short cultural break, subsequent inquiries revealed he attended a series of events associated with an extremist music festival located in the vicinity of Sintra. Surveillance footage captured him engaging with individuals later identified by international partners as active in recruitment networks. Defence counsel contended the attendance was accidental or peripheral; the court finds that assertion improbable given the encrypted telephonic communications prior to and during the trip. The case law with regard to sentencing in terrorism offences demands careful examination. The Court of Appeal in R v. Solanki [2023] EWCA Crim 1732 reiterated the principle that sentences should be collectively calibrated to ensure consistency and proportionality while reflecting the wide spectrum of offending in this area. Furthermore, R v. Bennington [2022] EWCA Crim 907 emphasised the critical importance of deterrence where offending involves planning for indiscriminate harm, with particular focus on culpability arising from logistical organisation rather than mere ideological adherence. Historical judicial approaches also retain a foothold in sentencing analysis. Reference may be made to R v. Aldersgate [1995] 1 Cr App R 274, a case involving incitement to violence which predates the Terrorism Act framework but underscores enduring principles concerning the balance between free expression and public safety. While the societal context has evolved, the core judicial task remains the identification of conduct which justifies limitation of liberty in defence of community welfare. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The financial investigation traced cryptocurrency payments through a web of wallets linked to Mr H’s known aliases. Of particular note was a transfer totalling £4,600 to an overseas account associated with procurement of dual-use materials. The anonymity afforded by blockchain transactions represents a serious enforcement challenge; this court affirms the statutory intent to deter such covert funding. Further surveillance logs indicate that Mr H made multiple nocturnal visits to the parklands adjoining the River Rea in July and August 2024, during which time he was seen handling objects consistent with testing of ignition devices. These activities, while consuming multiple law enforcement resources for verification, confirm a pattern of preparatory conduct extending beyond digital realms. The court acknowledges that forensic examination involved laborious cross-correlations of partially degraded CCTV footage, enhanced by manual image stabilisation and time synchronisation processes involving widespread sensor networks. Such scientific efforts are emblematic of the modern criminal investigation, marked by both technological possibilities and resource-intensive limitations. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal background, Mr H is 31 years of age and holds a master’s degree in electrical engineering. His prior employment with a local renewable energy firm ended abruptly following investigations into computer misuse after the discovery of accessed files relating to industrial control systems. Character references portray him as introverted but capable, with a tendency towards solitary pursuits such as amateur photography and online gaming. Letters of support were tendered from the Southfield Gardening Collective, where Mr H is credited with voluntary commitments over a four-year period. While such community engagement is appreciated, the court warns against conferring undue weight on these factors when they contrast starkly with serious criminal transgressions. The dichotomy between pro-social activity and concurrent criminal plotting is troubling and heightens the necessity for proportionate sentencing. The academic literature on radicalisation and disengagement highlights cognitive rigidity and selective information processing as key factors in pathologies underpinning extremist commitment. The defendant’s psychological evaluation, prepared by Dr Fiona Manford of Midlands Forensic Psychiatric Unit, diagnoses no formal mental illness but flags persistent cognitive inflexibility and a black-and-white moral schema which amplify risk. The assessment indicates a high likelihood of ongoing ideological adherence in the absence of intensive intervention. The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Finally, the court notes that the proposed rehabilitation options include referral to the Integrated Terrorism Support Programme (ITSP) and a bespoke cognitive restructuring initiative. The probation service is instructed to undertake a thorough risk and needs assessment with attention to prosocial engagement and monitoring of technology use post-sentence. The challenges inherent in such interventions must not be underestimated, but the value of structured supervision is well established. Mr H’s offending was sophisticated, multi-dimensional, and manifestly intended to position him for the commission of serious harm. Aggravating features include deliberate encryption and digital obfuscation strategies, procurement steps consistent with operational planning, and the timing of logistical acts corresponding with known anniversaries of prior attacks. Mitigation is very limited. The defendant’s lack of previous convictions and a late plea of guilty, entered only on the morning of trial, afford some modest credit. The plea, although welcomed, was late enough to limit the customary reduction. A pre-sentence report will be prepared without delay. The probation service is directed to explore options including extended supervision licences, conditions addressing contact with extremism, exclusion zones, and monitoring mechanisms involving polygraph technology. The report should also consider potential psychosocial supports, resentencing risks, and the likely benefit of continued involvement with community counter-extremism initiatives.
