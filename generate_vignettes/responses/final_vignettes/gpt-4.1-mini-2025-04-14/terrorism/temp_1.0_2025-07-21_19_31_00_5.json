Mr H Case No. B2025/27943 Sentencing Remarks – The Honourable Mr Justice Alan H. Davenport Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence following his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, alongside a conviction for possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The relevant offending period extends from September 2023 until his arrest on 12 February 2025. The proceedings have been marked by multiple preparatory hearings, disclosure orders, and have engaged numerous agencies including the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit and the National Cyber Crime Centre. The defendant’s initial apprehension occurred at approximately 04:37 on 12 February 2025 pursuant to a warrant authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant authorised search and seizure at his residence on Harborne Lane, Birmingham. This followed an eight-month covert operation, codenamed Operation Nightingale, which capitalised on intelligence derived from open-source monitoring, intercepted electronic communications, and financial transaction analysis. At the time of arrest, various electronic devices including a desktop computer, multiple encrypted USB drives, and an unregistered mobile phone were secured. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The operation was a multi-agency effort involving the West Midlands Police Counter-Terrorism Unit, HM Revenue and Customs due to suspected financing irregularities, and the National Intelligence Coordination Centre. The investigative methodology combined traditional human intelligence sources alongside cutting-edge technical surveillance — including the deployment of IMSI catchers and the use of AI-driven pattern recognition software targeting social media activity flagged for extremist content dissemination. These measures, while resource-intensive, reflect the complexity of modern counter-terrorism policing. It should be noted that various procedural aspects of this case have illustrated the operational pressures and intricate coordination necessary in terrorism prosecutions. Delays relating to disclosure of sensitive intercept material occurred, largely attributable to the need to balance open justice with the safeguarding of current intelligence sources. The court is mindful of the principles elucidated in R v. Spears [2012] EWCA Crim 3055, which underscore the competing imperatives of procedural fairness and national security. The disclosure timetable in Mr H’s case was carefully managed within these constraints, albeit extending the overall duration of the proceedings. Prior to arrest, Mr H had attracted the attention of the Prevent programme in early 2022 following a referral from staff at Coventry Technical College, where he had produced essays critically engaging with extremist literature. That referral ultimately did not proceed beyond initial assessment, the Channel panel determining that while there were indicators of ideological sympathies, no immediate risk of violent conduct was apparent. Such circumstances are familiar to the court, illustrating the difficulty in discerning between protected expression and preparatory offence conduct under counter-terrorism legislation. While Prevent referrals represent one facet of the safeguarding architecture, their limitation in predictive value is stark. A plea and case management hearing was held on 1 July 2025. At that time, Mr H maintained a plea of not guilty on all counts. Only on the morning of the sentencing hearing did he enter guilty pleas. The court must observe that such late admissions, whilst constitutionally permissible, restrict the extent to which credit can be awarded. The jurisprudence on this matter is well-established, notably in R v. Fennell [2019] EWCA Crim 1041, where the timing of the plea significantly affected credit due to the strain placed on court and prosecution resources. The issues regarding credit for guilty plea were considered at length in R v. Cranston [2017] EWCA Crim 1459, which confirmed that credit is a matter of judicial discretion contingent on the timing and circumstances of the plea. The court in Cranston concluded that a plea entered only after jury empanelment and witness preparation should generally attract only a modest discount. The same principle applies here. Mr H’s admission occurred only after the completion of witness statements, the service of expert reports, and preparation for a contested trial. The sentencing regime relevant to this case is informed predominantly by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline 2023. The guideline requires an evaluation of culpability and harm, with reference to aggravating and mitigating factors, and the imposition of sentences consonant with public protection and deterrence objectives. Particular regard is afforded to the defendant's degree of operational involvement, technical sophistication, and the scale or intended impact of any contemplated terrorist act. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. The Crown’s case includes evidence that from mid-2023 onwards Mr H operated multiple anonymised online personas disseminating ideological content sympathetic to proscribed organisations. Analysis by national cybersecurity analysts has confirmed that his blog posts, uploaded podcasts, and forum messages simultaneously adopted the language and iconography of such groups. This ideological commitment went beyond passive consumption; it manifested in active propagation and enticement of others towards violent extremism. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Technical examination recovered numerous encrypted files stored within hidden partitions of Mr H’s personal computer and personal cloud devices. These documents included detailed manuals on bomb-making techniques, schematics for improvised explosive devices, and collections of materials sourced from proscribed terrorist training camps. Notably, some files exhibited metadata timestamps corresponding with dates significant for radical groups, indicating symbolic import to the defendant’s planning. Extensive forensic cryptanalysis was required, demanding approximately 1,200 man-hours over three months, due to sophisticated encryption deployed by the defendant. Such effort underscores the level of premeditation and planning inherent in the offences. The court cannot underestimate the resources required by law enforcement agencies in prosecuting cases of this nature. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The defence sought to argue that certain unexplained surveillance photographs of Mr H near a Birmingham chemical plant represented innocent interest in local industry, reinforced by his prior vocational training in chemistry. The court finds this explanation unpersuasive, particularly considering the cumulative evidence and the temporal coincidence of those observations with encrypted activity. The pattern coheres with deliberate reconnaissance rather than casual passage. Prior to prosecution, Mr H was the subject of a separate criminal investigation unrelated to the present offence, involving allegations of participation in a commercial fly-tipping operation on green belt land near Redditch. That investigation was discontinued due to insufficient evidence. It bears no relation to these proceedings but does serve to illustrate the breadth of law enforcement activity interacting with an individual’s history. The court is also cognizant of the fact that the defendant’s co-accused in a separate indictment, Mr B, faces charges for burglary of private dwellings during holiday absences. Those charges and proceedings proceed independently, and their relevance to the sentencing of Mr H is nil beyond the shared investigative context. Conflation of such matters would be inappropriate. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Following his arrest, Mr H travelled abroad to Brussels under the cover of a purported academic exchange programme. Intelligence indicates that during this trip in April 2024 he met individuals later linked to the illicit importation of significant quantities of Class A drugs into the United Kingdom via freight consignments. This provides insight into the defendant’s wider associations and the multifaceted nature of criminal networks intersecting on extremist and trafficking activity. It is essential to remark that possession of a bladed article discovered in a school car park some years prior in a separate, non-terrorism related investigation does not factor into the present sentencing. That matter was dealt with by a youth panel and is unrelated both temporally and contextually. The court further notes that a room-mate of Mr H was located with a cannabis cache during an unrelated search in 2021. This incidental association does not reflect on the defendant’s intentions or risk profile and is accordingly disregarded. The case management process reflected contemporary tensions within the Legal Aid Agency’s capacity. There were documented administrative delays and staffing shortages that impacted the defendant’s ability to secure expert psychiatric assessment expeditiously. Mr H’s defence counsel, Mr Oliver Quayle, merit commendation for persistent advocacy in securing tribunal approval for additional preparatory hours, despite challenges posed by Systemic Legal Aid budget restraints. Correspondence received from Birmingham’s East Central Resettlement and Community Support Service underscores ongoing pressure on accommodation services. The area has seen a 14% increase in demand over five years, a trend which complicates post-custodial housing planning for defendants posing elevated risk. This systemic backdrop, while peripheral to individual culpability, provides essential context for risk management arrangements. The court recognises the continued professional and dedicated efforts of the West Midlands Prevent Coordination Hub, which engaged with Mr H intermittently over the 18-month period prior to arrest. Their documented sessions included cognitive behavioural strategies aimed at countering grievances linked to his ideological leanings. Despite repeated outreach, engagement was variable and ultimately incomplete. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations revealed that Mr H executed cryptocurrency transactions amounting to £3,520 over six months using privacy-focused wallets. These funds were linked to vendors specialising in dual-use chemical precursors. The anonymous nature of these payments complicated tracing; authorities coordinate increasingly with international blockchain compliance teams in response to such covert funding mechanisms. While cryptocurrency innovation enables legitimate financial services, it is of growing concern when exploited for terrorism-related procurement. Courts have repeatedly warned of the necessity for robust responses, as noted in R v. Belmont [2023] EWCA Crim 910, a case where similar financial concealment was a critical factor in a terrorist financing conviction. The defendant’s deliberate destruction of digital communication channels upon detection signifies a conscious attempt to hinder investigation. Following arrest, Mr H was found to have remotely wiped select cloud storage instances and employed anti-forensic tools designed to sanitize deletion logs, further evidencing sophisticated concealment tactics. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to personal circumstances, Mr H is currently 31 years old and holds an honours degree in applied physics from a Midlands university. Prior to offending, he was engaged in short-term contract work in technical consultancy but faced employment instability after non-disclosure of security vetting issues. Mr H’s upbringing was described in pre-sentence reports as involving a fractured family environment, with intermittent exposure to community violence and economic hardship. While such social history is unfortunately not uncommon among offenders, courts must balance these factors with individual responsibility and the particular dangers associated with terrorism-related conduct. Letters submitted from an interfaith group in Birmingham detail Mr H’s limited participation in their multicultural reconciliation projects. While these attest to some pro-social endeavours, the court must stress that such participation neither excuses nor negates the gravity of his offences. It is a matter of principle that commendable voluntary activity is to be measured according to overall behavioural context. The defendant’s handwriting, as observed in personal correspondence, is neat and technically precise but reveals a noted tendency toward obsessive detail orientation. This trait was discussed in forensic psychological evaluations, which described Mr H as displaying rigid cognitive processing and an inclination to binary moral frameworks. Professor Erik Morrison, consultant forensic psychiatrist, conducted a comprehensive assessment. His report, dated 20 August 2025, concludes that Mr H suffers no formally diagnosable psychiatric illness but demonstrates “significant ideological fixation, with cognitive inflexibility rendering him vulnerable to extremist narratives.” The risk assessment classified him as posing a high risk of serious harm, particularly in the absence of long-term, specialised deradicalisation programmes. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The court acknowledges the submissions made advocating for utilisation of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) and similar structured interventions in the hope of ameliorating Mr H’s risk profile post-release. Experience and evidence suggest that these programmes, while valuable, have mixed success and rely heavily on sustained engagement and extensive monitoring. The court reiterates the prevailing public interest and legal requirements to ensure that sentencing in terrorism cases prioritises protection of the public, deterrence, and the condemnation of conduct undermining democratic society. The aggravating factors, including the defendant’s planning, sophistication, and ideological commitment, demand a custodial sentence commensurate with these principles. Before concluding, it is necessary to mention unrelated ongoing matters that have intersected with the administration of justice in this jurisdiction. For example, a prolonged arson incident at Court 5 in the Midlands Crown Court complex caused unavoidable delays across multiple listings, including this matter. Additionally, the court clerk service has recently been affected by staff turnover, occasionally resulting in minor administrative delays. These observations serve only as context, not as justifications for delay or procedural irregularity in the present case. The court is also cognisant of the increasing burden on local police forces arising from non-terrorism-related crime. For instance, street-level antisocial behaviour and rising incidents of retail theft continue to divert resources from specialised units. The National Statistics Office reported a 22% increase in public transport graffiti vandalism in the West Midlands over the last two years, a trend reflecting broader societal challenges but unrelated to this defendant. In considering sentencing options, the court directs the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report by West Midlands Probation Trust. The report is to address the feasibility and appropriateness of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, alongside targeted cognitive behavioural interventions designed for ideological extremism. It should assess the availability of approved premises with capacity for electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and polygraph support, as well as consideration of mental health oversight. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 4 at Birmingham Crown Court. They have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules (Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2022), and the formal record of conviction will be transmitted to the appropriate enforcement and monitoring agencies.
