Mr H Case No. B2025/29847 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. DREWINGTON Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H appears before the court today for sentence on charges including one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct relates primarily to the period from March 2023 until March 2025, the latter being the date of his arrest. The proceedings have traversed a complex investigative history, featuring multiple agency cooperation and intricate evidential disclosure, details of which will be fleshed out in due course. At the outset, the court wishes to acknowledge and thank the advocates who have participated in this hearing, specifically prosecuting counsel Ms Fleur Kingsley, and defence counsel Mr Ben Thornton, who acted throughout under a Legal Aid representation order. Mr Thornton has diligently advanced the defence case throughout what must be regarded as a particularly pressured and multifaceted process. Turning first to a procedural narrative, the matter was listed before this court initially on 4 April 2025 for a plea and trial preparation hearing. At that time, the defendant entered not guilty pleas. An extended pre-trial schedule followed, necessitated in part by voluminous disclosure and expert analysis, including forensic digital reportage and psychiatric assessment. Notably, the case was adjourned on two occasions due to judicial strike action affecting the Crown Courts nationally in late spring and summer 2025, exacerbating delays for all parties involved. It is a regrettable development that public service industrial action causes disruption to the administration of justice. Nonetheless, the court notes that all reasonable efforts were made to minimise prejudice to the defendant’s case by way of timely notification and scheduling adjustments. In the midst of the case build-up, it was reported that Mr H had earlier come to the attention of Prevent authorities in the autumn of 2021 following a referral prompted by his expression of ideological sympathies in an online forum affiliated with a university student society. The referral progressed to a Channel panel but was discontinued due to insufficient evidence of active engagement or risk escalation at that stage. Such early intervention processes form an important part of the national counter-terrorism strategy, yet it must be emphasised that their absence or failure to yield sustained behavioural change does not predetermine verdict or sentence and should always be weighed cautiously in context. As the court moves towards sentencing, consideration must be given to precedents in the burgeoning jurisprudence on terrorism offences, particularly regarding the principles of culpability and proportionality, and the importance placed on public protection. The case law continues to develop; however, certain key authorities remain salutary guides. Among these, R v. Saeed [2018] EWCA Crim 1254 confirmed that the scale and sophistication of preparatory conduct remain central in calibrating sentence severity, distinguishing between aspirant plotters arrested before any substantive materialisation and those whose acts manifest a greater immediacy of risk. Another instructive decision is R v. Naim [2022] EWCA Crim 699, which reaffirmed that planned violence intended to instil widespread fear or to manipulate public or governmental activity attracts sentences of considerable length, notwithstanding the absence of actual detonation or casualties. The courts frequently uphold the principle that deterrence and denunciation must weigh heavily alongside rehabilitation in sentencing terrorism offences. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The foregoing facts, as demonstrated by unchallenged forensic and electronic evidence, illustrate a clear pattern of premeditated preparation distinct in nature and scope. It is important, however, that the court contextualises these findings within the wider operational pressures that counter-terrorism policing faces today. For instance, the under-resourcing of digital forensic units continues to complicate timely evidence acquisition, a reality often overlooked in public discourse. Analysts at the National Cyber Crime Unit, who rendered expert assistance in this investigation, have reported caseloads three times the recommended threshold per officer and average delays exceeding six months for high-priority device extraction. Such delays have tangible effects, impacting both prosecutorial timetabling and defendant rights under the principle of timely justice. The interaction of these systemic factors often prompts engagement from policy commentators. For example, an influential 2024 report by the Justice Policy Institute lamented the “steady erosion of prosecutorial capacity in complex technological crime cases,” underscoring the resultant slowdown in case progression and the attendant risks of prolonged remand or uncertain defence preparation. This is not intended as mitigation but rather to illuminate the realities within which the present case has unfolded. It is pertinent to mention at this juncture that the court received written communications from local voluntary organisations, including the East Bristol Resilience Network and the Greenfield Youth Mentorship Scheme. These groups detailed their engagement with the defendant prior to his arrest, noting sporadic attendance and limited receptiveness to structured interventions such as cognitive bias workshops or vocational training sessions focused on engineering skills. The reports conveyed a cautious optimism tempered by awareness of Mr H’s occasional withdrawal and disengagement. While such input from civil society contributes a valuable dimension to the overall picture, the court remains mindful of their limitations and of the paramount importance of risk management. Historically, the Crown Courts have witnessed a variety of terrorism-related cases bearing upon similar factual archetypes, though each must be treated on its own merits. R v. McDowell [2014] EWCA Crim 707, involved the manufacture of incendiary devices but was distinguished by the defendant’s early cooperation and absence of clear links to proscribed organisations. In contrast, the present case reveals more calculated and extensive preparatory steps. The court also has regard to the statutory framework provided by the Terrorism Act 2006 and its subsequent amendments, which codify offences relating to preparation and possession, as well as sentencing guidance promulgated by the Sentencing Council in its 2024 edition addressing terrorism and extremist conduct. The Guidelines set out a hierarchy of factors informing culpability assessment, ranging from the defendant’s ideological motivation, technical knowledge, volume and quality of material acquired, through to the presence of mitigatory circumstances such as remorse or cooperation. The court applies these standards rigorously in seeking a just and proportionate outcome. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. Mr H’s engagement with digital platforms and encrypted communication channels occupies a central place in the evidence before the court. Expert testimony from the National Technical Assistance Centre detailed the recovery of numerous encrypted message threads and files, including code scripts and manuals relating to improvised explosive devices. Defence submissions suggested that some of these documents were accessed unintentionally or as part of broader research interests. However, the court finds such explanations implausible given the surrounding context and the specific nature of the content. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Analysis further revealed that the defendant subscribed to a series of online forums promoting violent jihadist ideology, sharing propaganda and tactical advice. Recorded digital footprints evidenced attempts to obfuscate his identity via virtual private networks and anonymising software, techniques consistent with deliberate evasion of law enforcement detection. Defence counsel contended that such use of technology stemmed from privacy concerns unrelated to criminal intent, a contention compelling only in the most abstract sense and not supported by the evidence overall. The present case inevitably invites reflection upon the challenges posed by the dynamic between privacy rights and national security imperatives. The European Court of Human Rights has grappled with such tensions in cases like Big Brother Watch v. UK [2021] ECHR 1423, where mass surveillance was held lawful within strict parameters. Similarly, the domestic court system must balance transparency with protective order, especially where disclosure might risk ongoing investigations or jeopardise witness safety. The volume and variety of material in this case invited particular care in handling, necessitating a bespoke approach to redaction and public access. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The defendant’s possession of components capable of use in explosive devices, including materials and technical manuals, substantiates the charge under section 57. The purpose contended is consistent with the preparatory offences charged and subsequent proof at trial. Defence arguments during evidential challenges included the assertion that some items had innocent hobbies or professional engineering relevance. This court, while acknowledging such arguments, ultimately prefers the Crown’s submissions on motive and intent on the balance of probabilities. In passing, it is noted that the defendant’s prior activity includes no recorded criminal convictions for non-terrorism offences. This fact, though ordinarily bearing on sentencing mitigation, must be weighed against the gravity of the present offending. The absence of previous convictions in no way diminishes the seriousness of conduct proving ideological commitment to acts of terrorism, nor does it invite complacency on the part of judicial authorities concerning future risk. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. Travel records indicate Mr H undertook multiple trips within Europe in 2023 and 2024, officially declared as tourism or academic visits. Intercepts and surveillance evidence, however, link these journeys to meetings with individuals under investigation in other jurisdictions for extremist activities. The Defence lodged submissions seeking to distinguish the defendant’s presence at these locations arguing lack of direct evidence of involvement. The court is conscious of the principle that association alone does not prove guilt but also notes that the totality of the evidence gives a picture of concerted action consistent with the charges. The court has also considered voluminous ancillary material disclosed during trial preparation. This includes evidence relating to co-defendants in a related indictment, whose charges extend to offences such as arson of commercial premises and use of false documents. Such material, whilst linked by association and investigative grouping, does not pertain directly to Mr H and therefore will not feature in sentencing considerations for him beyond evidential context. The existence of co-defendants who remain at large, or who have been charged with unrelated offences—including violent assault on police officers, or possession of indecent images—is a regrettable reminder of the wider networks involved in extremist activity. However, this court is clear that each individual defendant must be assessed and sentenced for their personal conduct and culpability, not for the acts or histories of others. Limitations in the provision of mental health services continue to impact the criminal justice system’s capacity to address the needs of defendants exhibiting signs of distress or ideological fixation. The NHS England report of July 2025 noted a 23% increase in referrals for specialist forensic psychiatric evaluations since 2020, outpacing the supply of qualified professionals. This case benefitted from a timely assessment by Dr Elena Marquez, whose meticulous report is pivotal in informing the sentencing outcome. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation disclosed cryptocurrency transactions amounting to the equivalent of £3,500 disseminated through multiple mixing services or tumblers designed to obscure origins. Such activity aligns with patterns identified in recent Home Office intelligence briefs as typical of funding streams for procurement of dual-use goods. The court registers these findings with concern, given the relative novelties and challenges of investigating dark-web and crypto-enabled criminal finance. It is noted, with some regret, that the Legal Aid Agency’s procedural handling of defence funding requests in this case reflected ongoing systemic constraints. Authorisation for an independent forensic accountant was delayed by over four weeks, hampering early but crucial stages of inquiry. Such administrative hurdles, while beyond the court’s power to resolve, adversely affect the proper resolution of complex cases and underscore the importance of adequately resourcing agents of justice. The National Probation Service similarly faces challenges in managing caseloads and ensuring continuity for offenders sentenced within terrorism statutes. Reports continue to highlight attrition within specialist teams, with vacancies often filled by less-experienced officers by necessity. While the probation report for Mr H demonstrates a conscientious effort to outline intervention options, it also reflects these resource pressures. The integration of multi-agency safeguarding arrangements, including MAPPA Category 3 oversight, remains indispensable but resource-intensive. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H is 30 years of age. He possesses a master’s degree in electrical engineering, with a particular focus on telecommunications. Prior to his arrest, he had been employed as a junior systems engineer at a mid-sized firm specializing in automation solutions. He resigned under disputed circumstances, reportedly linked to refusal to undergo a security clearance procedure related to compliance with export controls on sensitive software. This disengagement from formal employment coincided temporally with an observable intensification in his online propaganda dissemination. Character references submitted on behalf of the defendant include letters from a local chess club, where Mr H volunteered as an occasional coach for young members. The correspondence speaks to his “calm demeanour” and “patient teaching style.” While such civic contributions are laudable, it must be emphasised, as in similar cases, that these positive factors do not negate culpability for deliberate actions endangering public safety. Indeed, the court treats evidence of community involvement not simply as mitigation but as raising expectations of responsible conduct. The court is bound also to reflect on a series of letters from family members, including his sister and mother, which describe a gradual withdrawal and apparent ideological radicalisation manifested over several years. These personal perspectives, though poignant, were neither read in open court nor tendered as exculpatory; rather, they assist in establishing a fuller understanding of the defendant’s background and mental framework. The forensic psychologist, Mr Graham Evers, reports no diagnosable psychosis or personality disorder. Instead, he notes Mr H exhibits a “marked fixed belief system with high cognitive rigidity,” suggesting difficulty with alternative viewpoints and a tendency towards black-and-white thinking. The report cautions that while he does not currently meet criteria for severe mental illness, his ideological convictions present a sustained public protection risk without intensive intervention. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. The prosecutorial case and expert reports collectively portray the offence as a carefully orchestrated, multi-faceted undertaking, exhibiting a level of sophistication and ideological commitment warranting substantial custodial terms. The aggravating features include the defendant’s deliberate use of encryption, his international contacts, and the covert nature of the preparatory activities. Mitigation largely rests on his lack of prior convictions, educational attainment, and a degree of belated cooperation, manifest in the eventual guilty pleas entered shortly before trial. The court applies a modest reduction for these pleas, consistent with binding authorities cautioning against generous credit for late admissions, particularly when they follow considerable investigative and trial preparation expenditure. Before concluding these remarks, the court records thanks to the staff of Bristol Crown Court for their assistance in ensuring the smooth conduct of these hearings, despite ongoing refurbishment works that have intermittently displaced several courtrooms. Their flexibility and patience have been commendable. Likewise, the court recognises the efforts of Counter Terrorism Policing South West, whose diligent and multifarious casework has been exemplary in the face of persistent staffing shortages. The court also extends appreciation to the multi-agency support teams, including Probation Service officers, NHS forensic clinicians, and Local Authority safeguarding representatives, whose collaborative work has significantly advanced risk assessment and management processes in this matter. Finally, the court must again express concern about the increasing complexity and volume of terrorism-related digital evidence, stressing the necessity for ongoing investment in technical capabilities and personnel training to maintain effective investigatory standards. Without such, public safety and the proper administration of justice will remain at risk. I reserve sentence today pending receipt of an updated pre-sentence report which the National Probation Service has been instructed to prepare with particular focus on risk management, rehabilitation potential, and the feasibility of Community Order elements complemented by supervision. Attention should also be given to the possibility of enhanced licence conditions should a custodial sentence be imposed, including electronic monitoring and structured deradicalisation programmes. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal conviction and/or sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968 respectively. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this case. Costs are reserved.
