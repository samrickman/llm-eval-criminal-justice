Mr H Case No. B2025/24893 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. SWANSON Filed: 17 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism as per section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct charged spans from late 2022 until the defendant’s arrest in April 2025. The procedural history of this case is extensive and illustrative of the complexities inherent in contemporary counter-terrorism prosecutions. Mr H was apprehended at 04:45 hours on 11 April 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at a residential property in Greenbank Road, Bristol. The warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following intelligence gathered from the Security Service indicating sustained encrypted communication with servers known to host extremist content. Several electronic devices, including encrypted smartphones, a high-performance laptop, and external hard drives, were seized at the time of arrest. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This arrest was the fruit of a protracted investigative operation, codenamed Operation NIGHTFALL, which spanned almost eighteen months. The inquiry involved not only CTPSW but also regional intelligence units and a specialist digital forensics team embedded within the National Cyber Crime Unit. The painstaking nature of the technological examination was compounded by Mr H's extensive use of sophisticated anonymisation tools, including Tor networks and proprietary messaging protocols. The forensic process included the painstaking reconstruction of deliberately destroyed virtual machines and the decryption of partially corrupted data containers. This task required the mobilisation of significant specialist resources, reflecting the scale and complexity of the case. It is necessary briefly to observe the systemic pressures that such investigations impose on public services. The regional police digital forensic laboratories have, since 2023, faced a significant backlog of cases, with average processing times now exceeding six months. That backlog includes matters ranging from fatal violent crime to high-value fraud, alongside cases of ideological extremism such as this. The limited pool of suitably qualified personnel, combined with rapid technological evolution, has rendered law enforcement’s work increasingly challenging. This court acknowledges the tireless dedication of those professionals whose work underpins public protection despite these operational headwinds. The case was initially listed for a preliminary court appearance on 18 April 2025, but was adjourned for legal aid issues pertaining to the defendant’s representation. It is regrettable—even in 2025—that delays linked to Legal Aid administration continue to impact case timetables. Defence solicitors faced several weeks of uncertainty regarding authorisation for instructing an independent surveillance expert to assess the reliability of intercept evidence, which delayed hearings. Whilst these procedural oddities are not for this court to adjudicate upon at trial, they are nonetheless a persistent nuisance that risks undermining the belief in efficient justice. In advance of the trial, the defendant initially pleaded not guilty during the plea and trial preparation hearing on 10 June 2025. It was not until the first day of the trial on 15 August 2025 that Mr H elected to enter guilty pleas to both counts. As the Court of Appeal stressed in R v. Partridge [2023] EWCA Crim 1432, such late admissions, while entitled to some recognition, do not attract the same level of discount as early pleas given the protracted work supporting prosecution and witness preparation. The principles relating to credit for late pleas have been robustly examined in a series of appellate decisions. In R v. Knowles [2022] EWCA Crim 2154, the Court emphasized that credit is a concession extended primarily to acknowledge a defendant's genuine acceptance of responsibility before evidence is fully marshalled, and for the benefit conferred upon the court and witnesses by the avoidance of contested trials. Equivocation or tactical delay undermines that rationale. Such principles have been reiterated in the recent case of R v. Merriman [2024] EWCA Crim 1319, arising from prosecutions linked to right-wing extremist affiliations, which are formally distinct but analogous in nature. It is salutary to reflect also on the particular sentencing guidelines applicable to terrorism offences. The 2023 edition of the Magistrates’ and Crown Court Sentencing Guidelines for Terrorism, published by the Sentencing Council, directs the court to weigh factors such as the offender's level of commitment to terrorist activity, sophistication in planning, and nexus to actual or potential harm. These guidelines explicitly underscore deterrence and protection of the public as primary sentencing objectives, consistent with the statutory framework. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Significant evidential weight rests upon the digital trail assembled during the investigation. The defendant maintained a pseudonymous blog hosted on a decentralised platform, through which incendiary material was regularly disseminated. Expert testifiers outlined how the stylistic and linguistic features of posts mirrored known communications produced by a proscribed group under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000, notably its references to “purity” and “awakening”, which have been discussed in A-G’s Reference No. 14 of 2022 (counter-terrorism) [2022] EWCA Crim 1143. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Analysis of electronic devices revealed the possession of encrypted containers labelled misleadingly as food recipes or technical manuals unrelated to hostile activity. Among these were detailed schematics for homemade explosive devices and instructions for the synthesis of high explosives from commercially available substances. Defence advanced a submission seeking to characterise some material as academic interest or “curiosity-driven” research; the court is not persuaded by this benign interpretation in light of contextual evidence. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The court recalls the acceptance in R v. Ferris [2020] EWCA Crim 1746 that the mere possession of instructive material, without demonstrable intent or action, does not constitute an offence absent connection to a specific purpose. Here, the totality of the evidence firmly establishes intent. Diversions in this case included references to certain ancillary matters, such as the seizure of a small quantity of illicit substances unrelated to terrorism. While a limited amount of cannabis was found at the property, no charges or aggravations flow therefrom given the overriding counter-terrorism context. Similarly, the defence invoked Mr H’s minor and unconnected civil penalty for littering dating from 2021 as indicative of his otherwise law-abiding character; such incidents are peripheral and carry no relevance to sentencing in this matter. Complementing investigative efforts, evidence was gathered concerning the defendant’s movements. For example, records indicated he attended a conference in Brussels in March 2024, nominally on renewable energy technology. Intelligence reports aligned his attendance with a known associate with extremist affiliations, although the meeting proved abortive due to an abrupt cancellation of certain sessions. The trip, while documented in isolation, must be considered alongside electronic communications and other activities. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. The sheer volume of material assembled by prosecution and analysed by multiple agencies is impressive. Disclosures numbered over 600 items, which required scrupulous redaction, given the sensitivity of some witness statements and intelligence capabilities. The court is aware that disclosure protocols in terrorism cases are subject to layered confidentiality requirements, sometimes necessitating closed material procedures or Public Interest Immunity claims, as noted in R v. Ahmed & Others [2016] EWCA Crim 1046. The financial dimension, seldom the titular focus of sentencing remarks, deserves mention. A forensic accountant from CTPSW traced a series of cryptocurrency payments originating from Mr H to accounts associated with suppliers of dual-use materials. The use of layered mixers and anonymising services complicated enforcement endeavours, underscoring challenges posed by emerging financial instruments. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The court further notes the resource-intensive nature of remote and in-person surveillance underpinning this prosecution. For instance, 180 hours of covert video surveillance on multiple devices, synchronised with traffic sensor data in dense urban settings, was necessary to establish patterns of behaviour indicative of preparatory steps. The manpower allocation for these operations reflects a public safety imperative not readily quantifiable in financial terms but paramount nonetheless. While the defendant's academic record is notable, having attained a Bachelor of Science with honours in computer engineering from a respected university, this must be weighed against the serious nature of the offences. Testimony from his former employer described him as “methodical and conscientious”. However, his resignation from a secure position coincided with intensification of his activities under investigation. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mitigation appeals to the defendant’s willingness to engage in limited community volunteer work are acknowledged. Letters from the Bristol Urban Renewal Project commend efforts to assist vulnerable populations during the pandemic's height. Nonetheless, laudable community service cannot offset the deliberate orchestration of violent extremism, a point borne out in R v. Dawood [2019] EWCA Crim 1567. A forensic psychologist's report described Mr H as demonstrating “notably rigid ideation” with \"difficulty in cognitive flexibility\" but did not diagnose any formal mental health disorder. The psychological opinion highlighted the high risk of reoffending absent robust de-radicalisation and risk management. The court is mindful that psychological interventions—such as the Counter-Terrorism Cognitive Change Programme—have variable outcomes, requiring careful multi-agency coordination and supervision. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! This court must place foremost the protection of the public and the need for deterrence when considering sentence. The elements of planning, procurement, and ideological commitment exhibited by Mr H situate him in the upper spectrum of culpability among offenders prosecuted under terrorism statutes. Aggravating factors include the intended use of indiscriminate harm, the sophistication of digital concealment, and persistence despite prior involvement with Channel intervention schemes. Mitigating factors are limited to Mr H’s absence of prior convictions and his late guilty pleas, which nonetheless offer only modest allowance in the calculation of sentence length. The court remains mindful also of the important principle that the severity of the offence category commands a response consistent with the gravity of potential harm. The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith. This report should evaluate the feasibility of imposing custodial sentences with extended licence conditions, including electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and mandatory participation in deradicalisation programmes accredited by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. It should further assess prospects for rehabilitation, taking into account Mr H’s educational background and previous engagement with voluntary sector agencies. Appreciation is due to the Counter Terrorism Policing South West unit, whose professionalism and meticulous case management exemplify public service commitment. Similarly, the efforts of defence counsel, instructed through Legal Aid, are acknowledged in navigating a complex and sensitive matter, notwithstanding procedural challenges experienced.
