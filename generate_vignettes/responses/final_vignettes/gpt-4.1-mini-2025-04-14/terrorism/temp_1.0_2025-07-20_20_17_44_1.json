Mr H Case No. B2025/24639 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge P. G. WINTERS Filed: 2 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence having been convicted following a trial of offences contrary to sections 5(1)(a) and 57 of the Terrorism Act 2006 and Terrorism Act 2000 respectively. Specifically, he stands convicted of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism and possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism. The offending period is identified as extending from approximately September 2023 until his arrest in April 2025. It is noteworthy to record at the outset the continued evolution of judicial protocols in terrorism cases. This court, established in 1856 as part of the historical Bristol Assizes, now functions under the exacting standards imposed by the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR), and the Counter Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council in 2023. Since the establishment of the specialist Counter-Terrorism Unit at Avon and Somerset Police in 2019, collaboration amongst agencies has attained a level of sophistication unimaginable mere decades ago. Yet, despite these advances, this case exposes some of the enduring challenges attendant to contemporary counter-terrorism efforts, including inter-agency communication and resourcing constraints. The defendant was first detained upon the execution of a search warrant at his residence in Filwood on 17 April 2025. The warrant, issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, followed protracted intelligence gathering involving the Security Service, Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), and analysts within the Home Office’s National Technical Assistance Centre. Much of the initial evidence derived from intercepted encrypted communications and corroborated patterns of behaviour indicative of preparatory acts. Time-intensive digital forensic efforts ensued to decrypt multiple electronic devices seized. This was a task hampered by the defendant’s use of layered virtual private networks (VPNs) and live operating systems tailored to subvert conventional forensic imaging. Such operational tactics necessitated authorisation of intrusive investigative techniques under both statutory and common law safeguards. The Legal Aid Agency’s recognition of the complexity permitted the defence legal team an expansion of hours authorised for expert review by an independent electronic analyst, despite broader funding austerity measures impacting Legal Aid generally. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The court acknowledges the difficulties that Defendants in such cases face in securing timely and adequate representation. The defence team in this case, led by Counsel Mr Iain Ferrell, faced considerable administrative difficulty in commissioning psychiatric and forensic technical reports due to backlogs within the National Health Service forensic units and procurement delays at independent expert providers. Nonetheless, all reports were eventually served and analysed prior to the sentencing hearing, allowing the court to give due weight to the evidence relating to the defendant’s mental state and risk profile. It must also be observed that repetition of trial preparation hearings contributed to the complexity of case timetabling. One such hearing was delayed due to industrial action within the Bristol Crown Court’s registry staff, a regrettable but not uncommon feature in the current climate of public sector employment disputes. This effectively extended the total period spent in pre-trial custody for the defendant, who had been remanded since April 2025. The defendant was supported by a series of personal references submitted on his behalf. Among these was a letter from the St. Pauls Community Cricket Club commending his engagement in voluntary coaching of young players aged 12-16. While such community involvement is recognisable, it neither substantively mitigates the seriousness of the offences, nor diminishes the demonstrated commitment to violent extremism demonstrated in the evidence. The present case unfolded contemporaneously with Operation REDWOOD, a separate but parallel investigation targeting a group of individuals involved in a series of violent incitement offences and criminal damage linked to far-right extremism. One of the co-defendants in that investigation was apprehended in the same month but is not connected to the defendant Mr H. It is important this court distinguishes the conduct and evidence relevant to Mr H from such unrelated matters, although public discourse often clouds the specificity of such cases. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Historical principles of sentencing in terrorism cases, as set out in the seminal decision R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, continue to govern. The judgment there enshrined the approach that while terrorism offences engage wide-ranging public interests, including national security, the sentencing judge must anchor decisions firmly in both proportionality and rational evidence-based assessment. The approach must balance deterrent aims with the need to avoid manifestly excessive sentences that may fuel further alienation and radicalisation. Similar guidelines were reiterated in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, where overriding emphasis on the totality of the offending pattern and the danger posed by escalatory intent informed a determinate custodial sentence extending beyond 20 years. While the facts here differ, the sentencing framework remains consistent in emphasising harm, culpability, and the risk of future violence. Detailed case management hearings on 15 May and 12 June 2025 navigated discussions on disclosure and witness availability. Defence Counsel raised preliminary issues concerning the admissibility of certain intercepted communications, referencing the procedural safeguards enshrined in R v. M [2017] EWCA Crim 1234. The court ruled that under the statutory regime, the evidence remains admissible, confirming the decreed balance between national security and defendant rights holds inclining towards admitting such material where relevant and lawfully procured. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The burden upon prosecuting agencies cannot be overstated. At an operational level, the pressures within the Digital Forensics Unit tasked with reviewing the defendant’s devices are intense. Staff shortages, driven by budgetary constraints and increased demand, have resulted in extended case backlogs exceeding six months in some jurisdictions. The apparent paradox of rapidly evolving technology and static staffing levels creates vulnerabilities in investigation capacity. The court encourages ongoing dialogue between policy makers, law enforcement, and judicial bodies to advocate for sustainable resources ensuring public safety imperatives are fulfilled without unreasonable delay. Reference is made to the multi-agency joint risk management framework—colloquially the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA)—which flagged this defendant as a Category 3 case, given the ideological motivation but absence of prior direct violent offending. The effectiveness of MAPPA intervention schemes is the subject of ongoing academic debate, with recent publications (Smith & Alcock, Public Safety Review 2024) highlighting the need for enhanced inter-agency data sharing platforms nonetheless. In this case, liaison between probation, police, and mental health services was activated promptly once Mr H was charged, a fact the court notes with approval. It is regrettable that, notwithstanding these measures, resource pressures and competing priorities constrained the outreach efforts following the defendant’s partial disengagement from deradicalisation programmes offered through the South West Prevent Hub. This underscores the difficult balance agencies face: providing necessary engagement without expending disproportional effort where likelihood of sustained compliance appears limited. In the context of that Prevent engagement, the court has received written submissions from the Bristol Community Safety Partnership, emphasising their routine work on issues of community cohesion and extremism prevention. It is pertinent to observe that such bodies, despite public perception of broad impact, often have narrowly confined spheres of influence, shaped by statutory remits and funding streams. Their input, while valuable for holistic understanding, occupies but one dimension in the multifaceted counter-terrorism response. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Let it also be recorded, for completeness, that a co-defendant initially charged alongside Mr H absconded subsequent to release on bail conditions and remains at large. The absence of that individual from proceedings, pending separate efforts to secure extradition from abroad, has occasioned some procedural complications but does not diminish the prosecution’s case against Mr H. These proceeding are maintained independantly, and this court will direct no further comment regarding the conduct or charges relating to this third party. The defendant’s educational history is varied. He obtained a diploma in electrical engineering in 2017, prior to enrolling in a higher apprenticeship scheme, which he discontinued in 2019 for reasons described as “personal and familial.” At hearing, the defendant’s counsel relied in mitigation on several letters from family members describing a difficult upbringing marked by economic hardship but made no attempt to link these circumstances causally to the offences. Such background, while relevant to holistic sentencing assessment, cannot be allowed to eclipse the gravity of the acts for which Mr H has been convicted. The court is conscious of recent appellate guidance emanating from R v. Marwood [2024] EWCA Crim 1689, where the Court of Appeal stressed the proportionality of sentencing steps in relation to personal mitigating factors balanced against the principle of public protection. Mr H’s case falls squarely within this framework, requiring an appropriately stern approach. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. A comprehensive psychiatric report was provided by Dr Lara Singh, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at Avon and Somerset Forensic Mental Health Service. Dr Singh concludes that while Mr H demonstrates certain personality traits including rigidity of thought and ideological fixity, there is no diagnosis of formal psychiatric illness or neurodevelopmental disorder. The report additionally refers to the absence of any speech or cognitive impairments, negating the prospect of diminished responsibility or mental health-related sentencing mitigation. Risk assessment tools employed indicate a moderate to high likelihood of re-engagement with extremist thought absent intervention. This court notes, regrettably, the widespread challenges in forensic mental health services nationwide. Waiting lists for assessments under Criminal Procedure Rule Part III often stretch to twelve months or more, impeding timely justice and heightened risk management. While improvements are promised in upcoming NHS funding cycles, this case again exemplifies institutional strain. The defendant’s correspondence includes a handwritten letter to the court, dated 15 September 2025, wherein he expresses remorse for the distress and societal disruption attributed to his conduct. The letter is legible, carefully constructed in standard UK English, and reveals a degree of literacy and reflection. However, given the severity of offences and the factual findings at trial, this court views that expression with cautious empathy but no mitigating conclusion. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Turning to contributory cases relevant to the database of jurisprudence on terrorism offences, R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412 provides instructive authority on the interface between community-based psychiatric support and custodial sentencing. There, the Court affirmed that clinical treatment need not preclude significant custodial restriction where public safety is paramount. While Mr H’s circumstances differ—chiefly in his absence of diagnosable illness—the principles articulated remain apposite in calibrating a custodial threshold balance. The court also reveres the jurisprudential value of R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, a case involving an offender with schizoaffective disorder who committed multiple arsons. The court there delineated that mental disorder, while relevant to sentence, does not obviate necessity for containment where risk manifests particularly in sustained recklessness. It is further relevant, although not determinative, to mention the difficulties faced by probation officers across the jurisdiction. Recent reports from Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service underscore pervasive recruitment shortfalls impacting offender supervision quality. This reality is recognised institutionally but does not mitigate established risk factors on an individual assessment basis. In the present case, the defendant’s refusal to fully engage with specialist deradicalisation programming during remand remains a matter of concern. While attempts were made by the statutory probation authority to enrol him in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), attendance was irregular and effort inconsistent. As has been emphasised in academic critique (Lewis et al., Radicalisation and Recidivism, 2024), voluntary participation alone is insufficient to manage high-risk individuals. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The issue of cryptocurrency payments featured prominently in the prosecution case. A forensic finance team traced a series of transfers from a digital wallet linked to Mr H to accounts associated with procurement channels for restricted dual-use chemical compounds. Notwithstanding the court’s recognition of cryptocurrencies’ legitimate uses, the opaque nature of mixing services employed highlights significant risks in this domain. The case of R v. Ellison [2022] EWCA Crim 1176 draws attention to similar methodologies encountered in drug trafficking cases, underscoring the cross-cutting challenges the criminal justice system confronts in adapting to technological innovation. It is also apposite to reflect on the procedural progress of this case through the court system. Over 48,000 pages of disclosure were managed, necessitating meticulous coordination among multiple agencies, including the Intelligence and Security Committee’s oversight unit. Ancillary to this, digital indexing by the National Digital Trial Team enabled the timely delivery of evidence bundles to all parties, a significant logistical achievement given the sheer material volume. The court further notes the diligence of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division, who, notwithstanding unprecedented workloads, have fulfilled their duty to seek justice efficiently while upholding rigorous evidentiary standards. Defence Counsel is similarly to be commended for navigating complex evidential and technical issues with professionalism. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. It remains uncontroversial that the maximum sentence available on conviction under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 is life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines emphasise considering the overall threat, the defendant’s degree of participation, and the sophistication of offending. Given Mr H’s demonstrated expertise in engineering and digital tools, combined with a clear ideological commitment and meticulous concealment efforts, the culpability here falls in the higher sentencing bracket. Mitigating factors include, as noted, the absence of any prior criminal record, the defendant’s educational attainments, and limited expressions of remorse. However, such mitigation scarcely tempers the overwhelming aggravating features, including use of encrypted technology, planning with a view to mass indiscriminate harm, and submission to late guilty pleas. The pleas entered, significantly delayed until the cusp of trial commencement, restrict credit to no more than one-sixth. The court reiterates that late admissions motivated by tactical considerations must not be unduly rewarded. The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith. This is to include a detailed assessment of risk of serious harm, consideration of the applicability of extended determinate sentence frameworks pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and recommendations concerning multi-agency supervision, including electronic monitoring and bespoke psychological intervention. Reference should be made to the recent National Offender Management Service Directive on terrorism-related offender management dated March 2025. The Probation Service is also asked to appraise potential placements within approved premises with expertise in managing ideological risk, alongside viability of secure psychiatric aftercare should future assessments indicate need. The court foresees that conditions for any release on licence will require robust restriction of digital access and close, multi-disciplinary oversight. The defendant is hereby reminded of his right to appeal the sentence in due course in accordance with sections 10 and 12 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, within 28 days of the date of sentencing. These sentencing remarks are issued this 2 October 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities for registration and action.
