Mr H Case No. B2025/28763 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. Cartwright Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H appears before this Crown Court for sentence following his conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences pertain to events that transpired between August 2023 and February 2025. The defendant’s matters initially came to the attention of law enforcement through an intelligence bulletin from the National Counter Terrorism Policing Network in late 2023, which raised concerns about encrypted communications linked to an individual known under pseudonyms, later identified as Mr H. Following that, a series of investigatory steps culminated in his arrest on 24 February 2025 at his residence in Easton, Bristol, where officers executed search warrants under Section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 after approval from a senior Crown Prosecutor. The preparatory acts and possession of materials seized during those searches will be addressed hereafter. Early procedural hearings were scheduled in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules, with the initial case management hearing taking place on 15 May 2025. It is to be noted that the proceedings encountered some unavoidable delays due to a combination of strike action within the National Court Clerks’ Association and prolonged disclosure preparation requirements involving classified intelligence materials. These matters, while inconvenient, were effectively managed to minimise prejudice to the defendant. The court extends its thanks to the National Cyber Crime Unit for their forensic analysis of electronic devices found in Mr H’s possession. Their work involved the complex task of decrypting volumes of data housed on several solid-state drives, utilizing bespoke decryption protocols and liaising with international partners under mutual legal assistance treaties. The painstaking nature of their investigation deserves acknowledgement in the wider context of modern counter-terrorism operations. The defendant remains represented by Mr James Rafferty, instructed through the Legal Aid Agency. It is regrettable, however, to record that the conduct of that agency in this instance saw repeated administrative delays in approving funding for expert psychiatric assessment and digital forensic review. Such bureaucratic shortcomings impede the fairness of the trial process and must be urgently addressed to maintain public confidence in access to justice. The court is aware that Mr H’s case was flagged by the regional Prevent team as early as November 2022, following a referral by his workplace supervisor citing concerns over radicalising material allegedly viewed by the defendant during work hours. That referral prompted a community awareness intervention, with offers of mentorship and psychological support. Evidently, those efforts were, at best, intermittently engaged with and ultimately insufficient to divert Mr H from his chosen course. The academic literature on early identification and intervention in ideological extremism highlights significant challenges in balancing civil liberties with protective measures. As noted in the report “Preventing Radicalisation: Lessons Learned,” published by the Home Office in 2021, effective engagement requires sustained trust-building — a resource-intensive process often undermined by underfunding and scepticism in both community and institutional contexts. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The defendant’s arrest concluded a multi-agency investigation codenamed Operation CORNERSTONE that involved the coordinated efforts of Counter Terrorism Policing South West, digital surveillance teams, and local law enforcement. Specialist cyber units assisted in interpreting encrypted messaging traffic derived from Whatsapp and Element platforms, while in-field surveillance provided corroborative evidence of suspicious meetings. In response to defence submissions, it is necessary to address the effect of judicial precedents on sentencing in terrorism-related offences. In R v. Abdullah [2021] EWCA Crim 324, the Court underscored that the gravity of preparatory conduct must be judged not solely by the immediacy of threat but also by the sophistication and scale of the offence planning, reinforcing the courts' duty to impose sentences that reflect society’s denunciation of such conduct. The defendant’s digital footprint, including internet-search histories and correspondence, reveals a trajectory of escalating commitment to extremist ideology. While acknowledging assertions from defence counsel that some content was accessed for research, the court finds this asserted naivety unconvincing given the context of other materials recovered. It is a sadly well-recognised pattern that some individuals use online platforms initially for curiosity, only to become increasingly radicalised over time. This phenomenon has been subject to repeated scrutiny, as encapsulated in the seminal review by Professor M. Graham, “Digital Radicalisation and Counter-Narratives” (Journal of Terrorism Studies, 2022). This court takes judicial notice of the importance and difficulty of combating online extremism in preventative frameworks. The defendant’s personal circumstances were detailed in a comprehensive pre-sentence psychological report prepared by Dr Simon Radcliffe, consultant forensic psychiatrist. Dr Radcliffe’s report, dated 2 September 2025, notes Mr H’s articulate and cooperative demeanour during interviews but raises concerns over a rigid cognitive style and a tendency for binary thinking that may have rendered him vulnerable to ideological entrenchment. The report highlights that Mr H does not currently meet criteria for a formal mental illness diagnosis but assesses the risk of re-engagement with extremist networks post-release as high without intensive supervision and intervention. This nuanced clinical opinion is instructive in framing sentencing considerations and possible rehabilitative avenues. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. In considering the progress of this case through the courts, it must be acknowledged that the principle of open justice has been rigorously observed, though with necessary adaptations for national security. The Public Interest Immunity regime was invoked to restrict publication of particular details concerning investigative techniques. Such measures, while regrettable from a transparency standpoint, are unfortunately common in counter-terrorism cases to safeguard ongoing operations and sources. The court also notes correspondence from the Eastville Mosque Community Forum, who submitted a considered letter expressing concern about the potential for community alienation occasioned by the publicity surrounding terrorism cases involving local residents. Their appeal is heartfelt, urging measured and evidence-based responses from both judicial and governmental authorities. This court echoes the sentiments articulated in the judgment of R v. Ahmed [2019] EWCA Crim 776, which stressed the importance of avoiding collective blame while ensuring individual accountability. These principles inform not only sentencing but also the wider societal context in which such proceedings unfold. Public services face considerable strain from diverse demands, including resource pressures stemming from increases in non-violent disorder, drug-related harm, and a surge in street homelessness. In the South West region, for example, figures indicate a 22% rise in reported instances of antisocial behaviour over the past 12 months, compounding the workload for community safety teams and probation services alike. The multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) in this jurisdiction have recently been subject to an independent review, which noted specific challenges in information-sharing and capacity, particularly relevant to Category 3 offenders — a classification encompassing a broad range of terrorism-related cases of medium risk. Notwithstanding these systemic issues, the court records that MAPPA practitioners acted with diligence in this case, commencing risk management protocols upon the defendant’s arrest. Reference should be made to the legal aid difficulties encountered during preparatory phases of the case. Mr Rafferty’s applications for a specialist linguistic expert faced protracted delay, undermining the pace of defence disclosure. This court endorses the call from the Criminal Bar Association’s 2024 annual report for enhanced funding and streamlined authorisation processes in sensitive and complex prosecutions. It is also germane to the record that the defendant’s grandmother submitted a letter of support attesting to his early years marked by academic promise and community involvement. While sympathetic, this affidavit cannot diminish the severity of the facts or absolve the defendant from accountability. Courts must balance personal history against the impact and nature of present offending. In the same vein, letters from the Bristol Community Recycling Initiative describe Mr H’s voluntary work over a two-year span assisting with hazardous waste collection. The associated charitable sector, under considerable financial pressure, continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience—a fact meriting recognition though not germane to sentencing. The prosecution called evidence from Detective Inspector Helen Montgomery of Counter Terrorism Policing South West, whose tireless coordination of Operation CORNERSTONE was commended in court. Her testimony outlined the painstaking excavation of digital provenance and the careful calibration of surveillance measures, observing that the defendant had employed numerous encryption techniques consistent with those utilised by proscribed groups. Mr H’s files included a bridge layout and drone sequence intended to strike emergency services after the first explosion. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The factual matrix disclosed includes multiple encrypted documents bearing instructions on the fabrication of explosive devices, accompanied by schematic diagrams for timing mechanisms. Defence experts contested complete functionality but accepted partial accuracy. The weight of evidence supports a conclusion of deliberate preparation for acts likely to cause serious harm. The relevance of R v. Khan [2018] EWCA Crim 271 is particularly salient, where the Court of Appeal underlined that possession of preparatory materials, when contextualised within conduct and intention, can ground convictions even absent overt acts of execution. An incidental but noteworthy item recovered from the shared accommodation was a small quantity of home-made elderflower cordial. Defence submissions sought to portray this as evidence of a benign domestic lifestyle. The court, while not dismissing quotidian habits, emphasises that such minutiae are insufficient to overshadow the gravity of preparatory conduct. Furthermore, it is recorded that one of Mr H’s co-residents received a fixed-penalty notice for noise violations during the period in question. Such ancillary incidents bear no relevance to the defendant’s ideology or risk profile and have not been considered in sentencing calculations. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. On balance, the court finds the totality of evidence persuasive regarding Mr H’s knowledge and intent. The mitigation of any alternative explanations for his actions—such as claimed interest in mechanical engineering or hobbyist experimentation—is accordingly limited. This trial is a reminder that acts of terror planning rarely occur in isolation. They demand intense, coordinated resource investment, as exemplified by the involvement of digital game theory analysts incidentally mentioned in the disclosure schedules, who provided auxiliary insights into the behavioural patterns associated with radicalisation pathways. Although peripheral, the inclusion of such specialist input is emblematic of the complexity of contemporary counter-terrorism investigations. It is worth taking a moment to observe that the recent historic legal literature on the origin of the Terrorism Act 2006 credits the legislative impetus to the need to grapple with evolving threats post-9/11 and the London bombings of July 2005, which profoundly reshaped public security policy. The act’s preamble asserts the imperative of balancing civil liberties with the urgent necessity of protecting the public from harm. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. Mr H’s travel history is marked by a number of journeys to Belgium and the Netherlands during 2023 and 2024. While defence counsel counselled that these trips were for leisure and family visits, the Crown adduced evidence suggesting contact with individuals known to hold extremist sympathies within certain urban centres. These interactions, while not criminal in isolation, weigh heavily in combination with other factors. It is further observed that during the defendant’s movements, he was accompanied on one occasion by a friend later arrested for fly-tipping hazardous waste in Surrey, a matter unrelated to terrorism and lacking any apparent connection to Mr H. Nonetheless, these co-travellers’ unrelated misconduct appears in parts of the prosecution files, demonstrating the breadth of background material reviewed in this case. The court reiterates the obligations and challenges faced by multi-agency teams overseeing counter-terrorism risk management. For instance, the burden of interagency coordination is exacerbated by limitations in shared IT systems — a subject of recent parliamentary scrutiny — contributing to potential gaps in safeguarding. A well-known report by the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation (April 2024) details a concerning increase in cases where online persona fragmentation complicates assessment of risk and intent. The defendant’s use of multiple pseudonyms and encrypted channels is characteristic of this phenomenon. Ecclesiastical property damage involving graffiti defacement of nearby parish churches has risen in adjacent neighbourhoods, signaling wider social tensions unrelated to this matter but reflective of pressures felt in urban communities. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The financial transactions associated with the defendant reflect transfers to some degree consistent with procurement of chemical precursors, possibly for the assembly of explosive mixtures. The court has considered carefully the evidence from a forensic accountant embedded with Counter Terrorism Policing who traced the flows with blockchain analysis tools. While cryptocurrency offers legitimate means of transfer, it also provides obfuscation channels exploited by offenders. Public concern over the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit activities is a matter of currency in legislative debates. The court notes the recent amendment proposals before Parliament aimed at enhancing transparency without stifling innovation. The court returns briefly to the defendant’s personal history. Having attained a first-class degree in applied physics from a regional university, Mr H initially pursued a research career in renewable energy. His sudden resignation from his post in early 2023 has been attributed by colleagues to ideological alienation following workplace frictions over policy disagreements unrelated to his extremist views. Voluntary work at local food banks, documented in letters of support submitted by the Inner Bristol Food Collective, reveals a facet of the defendant’s life divorced from his criminal conduct. Such community engagement is laudable but does not diminish the need for a justice response proportionate to the risk he poses. In line with remarks recently made by Lord Justice Pike in R v. Dutton [2024] EWCA Crim 984, it is essential that courts do not allow acts of kindness to cloud judgments concerning serious public protection risks. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to the pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation Service, the assessment details strong concerns about the defendant’s potential for recidivism of violent extremist behaviours. The report advises intensive risk management, with particular emphasis on electronic monitoring, geographic exclusion zones, and immediate engagement with deradicalisation programmes. Probation officers involved with Mr H’s supervision report challenges related to staffing shortages and mounting caseloads, mirroring a nationwide trend documented in the 2024 National Probation Service Annual Report. These operational pressures underscore the need for clear, achievable sentencing plans. The Probation report also emphasises the importance of post-release psychological support through the National Health Service’s Liaison and Diversion service, despite the acknowledged resource limitations and lengthy waiting lists that frequently complicate timely treatment. The court acknowledges deferentially the contributions of the South Bristol Resettlement Network, a voluntary sector organisation, which has demonstrated exceptional commitment to working with complex cases such as Mr H’s. Their proactive engagement has, however, been intermittently hampered by funding shortfalls and volunteer attrition. On a procedural note, it is recorded that the refurbished Courtroom 5 at the Bristol Crown Court, where these proceedings have taken place, features state-of-the-art video conferencing facilities. These enabled the consideration of remote expert witness testimony without prejudicing the fairness of the trial whilst maintaining public access within guideline limits. The court appreciates the efforts of the court ushers and support staff, who maintained order and decorum throughout this lengthy and complex trial, even in the face of occasional technical disruptions owing to network instability during remote hearings. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. In conclusion, the court considers that Mr H’s offending involved a high degree of planning, an extensive and deliberate attempt to procure materials for terrorist purposes, and a sustained commitment to extremist ideology. Aside from the defendant’s lack of prior convictions and belated change of plea—both limited mitigating factors—there is little to reduce his culpability. The sentencing guidelines for terrorism-related offences prescribe comprehensive consideration of a range of aggravating and mitigating features, emphasising public protection and deterrence early in the sentencing process. The court’s role remains to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offence and tailored to individual circumstances. A formal pre-sentence report has been commissioned from the Probation Service, given the complexities surrounding risk of serious harm and the need to formulate a comprehensive risk management and rehabilitation plan. That report should inform any custodial sentence, including consideration of options such as extended determinate sentences, licence conditions, and involvement in structured disengagement programmes. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Courtroom 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be filed and transmitted as appropriate.
