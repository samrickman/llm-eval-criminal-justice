Mr H Case No. B2025/24981 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. K. Everdene Filed: 15 October 2025 The defendant, Mr H, stands before this court today in respect of multiple offences alleged contrary to the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically charges under section 5(1)(a) concerning conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, accompanied by counts of possession of articles for purposes connected to terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period during which the offending conduct is alleged to have occurred spans from March 2023 up to his arrest on 15 January 2025. The case has been subject to a lengthy investigatory and preparatory process. Mr H’s arrest was effected by officers from West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit (WMCTU) at approximately 05:30 hours on 15 January 2025, pursuant to a warrant executed at his residence in Digbeth. The operative warrants were granted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, endorsed by the reviewing magistrate after presentation of intercept evidence garnered by the Security Service. This evidence, it was submitted, indicated that an encrypted communication platform managed by the defendant’s known alias had been exchanging files characteristic of extremist instructional materials, including schematics for improvised explosive devices. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It should be noted that the investigation which culminated in Mr H’s apprehension was one of considerable duration and complexity. The WMCTU, in conjunction with the National Cyber Crime Unit, employed comprehensive investigative methodologies combining digital surveillance, human intelligence reports, and extensive forensic analysis. Such investigative undertakings impose significant demands on public resources and personnel, including the diversion of specialist officers from other operations. The meticulous effort and coordination required serve as a tacit recognition of the seriousness with which the authorities regarded the potential threat posed by the defendant’s activities. Procedurally, this matter has been marked by several interlocutory hearings addressing disclosure issues, including the standard but often protracted process of public interest immunity applications relating to sensitive intelligence material. The court acknowledges the frustrations expressed by both prosecution and defence arising from listing constraints exacerbated by industrial action affecting court staff during the summer of 2025, which resulted in adjournments and a delay to the originally anticipated sentencing hearing date. Efforts by defence counsel to gain authorisation for instructing independent forensic cyber-experts were delayed owing to procedural ambivalence and administrative hurdles at the Legal Aid Agency. These delays, although unfortunate, were eventually resolved and the independent report was tendered to the court in advance of the trial, assisting in the clarity of matters relating to the provenance and integrity of digital evidence. It merits mention that earlier in his life, during secondary education, the defendant had been the subject of a Prevent referral triggered by concerning references to international conflicts made in coursework submitted to a religious studies teacher. However, the referral did not proceed to the Channel programme, as initial assessments at the time indicated no substantive indication of ongoing extremist support. The court recognises the challenges faced by educational and safeguarding bodies in discerning genuine risk from youthful expression or curiosity, particularly given the evolving digital landscape which facilitates exposure to a broad spectrum of ideologies. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. This court is conscious of the critical import of sound principles when affording discounts for guilty pleas. In this case, Mr H initially pleaded not guilty at the first hearing on 10 March 2025 but changed his plea to guilty on the morning the jury was empanelled on 3 September 2025. While the Crown acknowledges this late change as an acceptance of responsibility, the court must temper any mitigation on that basis with recognition of the considerable preparation and expense already incurred by witnesses and the court system. It is a recurrent observation that pleas entered at the eleventh hour, particularly in cases of considerable evidential weight, serve more as tactical manoeuvres than expressions of genuine remorse. Precedents such as R v. Woolridge [2023] EWCA Crim 2432 remind us that the entitlement to credit for guilty pleas is not absolute and is contingent upon timing and the overall circumstances. The Court of Appeal held in Woolridge that pleas tendered at late stages warrant markedly reduced credit to preserve the integrity and efficiency of the criminal justice system. The circumstances surrounding the defendant’s plea in this matter accordingly attract a reduction of one-sixth rather than the more generous one-third ordinarily available for early pleas. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Extensive forensic examination unveiled the presence in the defendant’s possession of various encrypted electronic storage devices, many utilising the VeraCrypt platform with plausible deniability features, severely complicating investigative access. Amongst recovered materials were files displaying technical manuals on drone fabrication and explosive precursor chemical handling. These findings are consonant with the pattern of escalating sophistication and planning evident throughout the timeline preceding his arrest. The defence avers that these materials were collected out of academic or technical interest; however, the contextual analysis by independent experts, including linguistic forensic specialists, contradicts this benign interpretation, revealing communications reflective of operational planning aligned with known terrorist methodologies. It is worth observing, though not directly relevant to sentencing, that the property search revealed an unlicensed model railway construction kit and an extensive collection of science fiction literature, indicating the defendant’s personal hobbies unconnected to offending behaviour. These artefacts underscore the complexity of the individual and the duality often evident in those who engage in such conduct. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The court has also considered the implications and applications of extant case law addressing the nexus between possession of dual-use articles and intent pursuant to the relevant statutory provisions. In R v. Abbot [2019] EWCA Crim 1089, the Court underscored that possession of materials with potential non-terrorist utility requires careful scrutiny in conjunction with other evidence to establish preparatory conduct for terrorism. Conversely, in R v. Sandoval [2021] EWCA Crim 1327, possession alone without clear intent was held insufficient for conviction. The totality of evidence here points beyond mere possession, indicating active intent and concrete steps in furtherance of a terrorist objective. At one stage during proceedings, the court was informed that a co-defendant associated peripherally with the investigation was at large, having failed to appear for the preliminary hearing. Investigation into this individual’s activities revealed prior convictions for aggravated burglary and possession of a bladed article, the latter in a school car park circa 2020. Those charges, while serious, have no bearing on the defendant’s own conduct or risk profile and are therefore of marginal relevance to the present sentencing exercise. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Turning to movement and travel, evidence was adduced concerning a visit by Mr H to Dublin in July 2024. The stated purpose was attendance at a conference on renewable energy systems; however, covert surveillance placed him at locations frequented by known extremist sympathisers engaged in illicit exchange of materials associated with violent groups. Defence submissions propose coincidence and deny knowledge of these individuals. It is acknowledged that cross-border travel for legitimate business or leisure is common and unremarkable; yet, as the Court of Appeal affirms in R v. Kamara [2022] EWCA Crim 2376, travel coinciding with contacts of concern and against a backdrop of suspect communications may raise inference when considered cumulatively. In the unrelated sphere of local criminality, it was noted that a landlord of the defendant’s residential complex was previously subject to a noise abatement notice following persistent late-night disturbances. While this fact is extraneous to the offence under consideration, it highlights the challenges faced by local authorities in managing urban residential environments, particularly within densely populated inner-city locales. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The investigation further revealed the use of cryptocurrency transactions linked to accounts believed controlled by the defendant. Approximately £3,200 in Bitcoin was transferred in staggered payments through a mixing service titled “FalconWhirl,” whose anonymity measures pose significant obstacles to financial tracing. As noted in a recent Home Office analytical report referenced as HO Resilience Briefing 2034, the utilisation of cryptocurrency for financing terrorism is a burgeoning concern for law enforcement, given the clandestine nature of such assets and their resilience against conventional regulatory oversight. It bears mentioning, as a matter of context only, that cryptocurrency usage has considerably increased globally, encompassing a wide spectrum of users from legitimate investors and hobbyists to illicit actors. The challenge for authorities remains the adaptation of forensic capacity to the intricate innovation within the crypto ecosystem. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Consideration is given to the personal and psychological profile of Mr H as detailed in two comprehensive reports prepared by consultant forensic psychologists engaged pursuant to the court’s directions. Dr Sonia Patel’s initial assessment of July 2025 identified traits including rigidity of thinking, a strong need for cognitive closure, and susceptibility to black-and-white ideological interpretations. Importantly, no diagnosable mental illness was found, nor was there evidence of psychosis or intellectual disability. The defendant’s insistence on maintaining ideological purity, however, was noted as a factor sustaining his risk of future extremist engagement absent intensive intervention. Complementing this, a report by Professor Malcolm Crane in September 2025 corroborated these findings and emphasised the enduring nature of the defendant’s convictions, though it acknowledged some potential responsiveness to structured deradicalisation efforts such as those delivered through the Home Office’s Desistance Engagement Programme (DEP). It is acknowledged that although such programmes offer valuable tools, their efficacy is contingent on individual engagement, programme quality, and continuity of support—factors not uniformly guaranteed in practice. Letters of support tendered on behalf of the defendant include one from the Community Library Outreach, praising his volunteer contributions in organising literacy workshops for socially disadvantaged youth. Another from the Riverside Horticultural Trust commends his involvement in urban greening projects. These endeavours, while commendable, do not mitigate the gravity of the offending conduct before this court. Among the slogans listed in a planning document for an online upload was: We will kill all the fucking kikes. England will be pure again. In the consideration of sentencing, the court also references the relevant statutory framework and guidance. The Terrorism Act 2006 prescribes a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for the principal charge. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines, updated in early 2025, remain instructive—emphasising the twin objectives of deterrence and protection of the public by incapacitation of serious offenders. Furthermore, the Court draws on the principles elucidated in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, particularly the expansive construction of “terrorist purpose” to include material support or facilitating conduct even where an actual attack is not executed. Aggravating features in this case include the methodical planning and sophistication of materials obtained, the intent to inflict indiscriminate harm, and the use of encrypted communication channels to frustrate detection. Mitigating features remain limited and principally concern the defendant’s early history devoid of previous convictions and the letters from community organisations. The court is alive to the need for sentences proportionate to culpability, mindful of the consequences on both public safety and the possibility of rehabilitation. It is also mindful of the considerable strain placed on rehabilitative and probationary services; resources remain under acute pressure nationwide due to increased caseloads and staffing shortages. This court gratefully acknowledges the detailed reports prepared by the Probation Service, and notes particularly the dedication of probation officers who, despite recruitment challenges, endeavour to maintain rigorous supervision and engagement with high-risk individuals. The MAPPA Category 3 arrangements for this defendant will necessarily require robust inter-agency coordination, including strict licence conditions upon any eventual release, and the availability of suitable accommodation vetted for security considerations. Having heard counsel's submissions, I thank Ms Sarah Howe of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division for her clear and professional presentation and Mr David Fallon of Court 5’s duty Solicitor scheme for his articulate advocacy on behalf of the defendant. Mention must be made that the courtroom itself has recently undergone refurbishment, with improved video-link facilities affording better remote participation options—a modest but helpful improvement noted by all parties. Finally, the court notes with appreciation the contribution of the court ushers and administrative staff, whose stringent maintenance of order and documentation remains indispensable to the smooth functioning of these proceedings. I shall now adjourn to allow the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, inclusive of a risk assessment addressing both public protection and rehabilitative potential. That report shall also consider the feasibility of placements within approved premises, the suitability of electronic monitoring and curfew measures, and the participation of the defendant in existing counter-radicalisation programmes. Psychological input shall be refreshed as necessary to reflect current clinical opinion. Sentencing will be scheduled upon receipt of the report and after hearing any ancillary representations. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 October 2025, in Court 2 at Birmingham Crown Court. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to probation and relevant authorities forthwith. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.
