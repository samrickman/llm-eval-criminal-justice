Mr H Case No. B2025/19876 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge V. S. DRISCOLL Filed: 2 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The alleged offending spanned a period commencing in late 2022 until his arrest on 18 April 2025. This Crown Court, now in its tenth year of operation since the amalgamation of the regional jurisdictions, sits with a full panel of judiciary and has heard its share of complex prosecutions touching on the delicate and challenging domain of counter-terrorism. The procedural innovations that accompanied the creation of the Birmingham Crown Court have included the introduction of a dedicated digital evidence review unit, the early adoption of the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 7 protocols for multi-handed terrorism cases, and the extension of Better Case Management (BCM) practices specific to high-security matters. These reforms, while beneficial in some respects, have yet to fully resolve certain operational bottlenecks, particularly in relation to disclosure and witness protection scheduling. Upon his arrest at approximately 07:15 hours on 18 April 2025, executed by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), Mr H was taken into custody at the regional Counter Terrorism Investigation Centre located on Gloucester Road. The police operation, known internally as Operation STEELMARK, had been ongoing for three months prior to the arrest. This investigation incorporated a multi-agency approach, bringing together expertise from the Forensic Cyber Unit, the Regional Intelligence Coordination Group, and the Royal Birmingham Fire Service. A notable feature of the investigation was the deployment of state-of-the-art decryption methods on encrypted messaging platforms and the recovery of a number of physical artefacts which, it was contended, bore a clear nexus to preparatory acts. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The factual landscape to be considered is extensive, obliging an observance of the forensic and procedural fabric within which the case has unfolded. This court recalls that, at its inception, the investigation was prompted by concerns raised after intelligence from the Security Service indicated a spike in encrypted communications emanating from an IP address traceable to Mr H’s residence in Sparkhill. The National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES) played a pivotal role in decrypting and interpreting these intercepted communications, despite continuing challenges associated with proprietary encryption frameworks and the deployment of anti-forensic tactics by the defendant. Analogous to prior cases such as R v. Zafar [2020] EWCA Crim 1150, the investigatory agencies had to navigate a labyrinthine digital environment populated by virtual private networks, multi-hop proxy chains, and ephemeral messaging services. These complexities inevitably contributed to the overall depth and duration of the probing undertaken. An adjournment hearing was convened on 11 July 2025 to address an application by the defence for an extension of time in disclosing new exhibits obtained from recent forensic imaging. The court permitted additional time until 1 August 2025, concluding that the interests of justice warranted a cautious approach to the comprehensive examination of voluminous electronic material, notwithstanding the resulting delay to the listing of the sentencing hearing. This prudence aligns with the observations of Lord Justice Pill in R v. Reynolds [2018] EWCA Crim 734, who stressed that the principle of fairness must remain paramount in proceedings involving high volumes of digital disclosure. The case was initially listed for sentence on 15 August 2025 but required vacating owing to late receipt of a community impact statement from the Birmingham Victim Support Service, which provided invaluable insight into the indirect harm occasioned by the defendant’s conduct. This document, while not directly linked to the legal issues in contention, enriches the broader context of harm and victimology which the court must consider when deliberating on appropriate punishment and public protection measures. It is important at this juncture to note the continuing pressure faced by the Legal Aid Agency in facilitating timely access to expert advice and representation in highly complex terrorism cases. In line with submissions from the Criminal Bar Association’s 2024 annual report, the court must express its concern regarding the persistent underfunding and administrative delays that have hampered defence counsel’s ability to instruct independent experts without prolonged bureaucratic interference. It remains the court’s firm view that such obstacles undermine the fundamental fairness of the process and should, as a matter of principle, be urgently remedied. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. The defendant’s digital footprint reveals a progressive radicalisation trajectory spanning the better part of three years. Surveillance and recovered documents show the gradual evolution of Mr H's participation in thematic groups celebrating grievances linked to perceived injustices in international conflicts. It is noted that a blog operated under the pseudonym “LeninsCipher” posted treatises that combined martial rhetoric with calls for disruptive action, echoing patterns observed in prior jurisprudence such as R v. Al-Karim [2017] EWCA Crim 1931. These publications exhibited an increasing sophistication, culminating in manifestos directly advocating for “operational readiness” and “calibrated asymmetry.” The relevant material was encrypted and stored on network-attached storage devices configured with multi-factor authentication. Case law relative to the possession and dissemination of extremist materials, notably R v. Dey [2015] EWCA Crim 1084, mandates a rigorous assessment of mens rea, which in terrorism offences must account for both knowledge and ideological alignment. Defence counsel mounted an argument that the possession was for academic research or exploratory ideological discourse, akin to arguments raised in R v. Thomson [2020] EWCA Crim 875, but the jury’s verdict clearly dispelled any such interpretative leniency in this instance. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Expert forensic examiners conducted a meticulous review of Mr H’s electronic devices, uncovering encrypted volumes labelled innocuously as “DoveFiles” that contained blueprints, parts lists, and instructions for the manufacture of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). While some files were partially corrupted or incomplete—a matter raised in defence submissions as diluting culpability—the Crown proved, with reference to R v. Zarrouk [2019] EWCA Crim 1193, that possession of even partial manuals, coupled with corroborative preparatory acts, suffices to establish intent. The court finds that attempts to minimize access or comprehension of these materials lack foundation given the totality of evidence, including testimony from digital forensic specialists and intercepted communications exhibiting technical dialogue consistent with the development of operational expertise. Notably, the defendant’s interest in drone technology was proffered by the defence as part of a benign hobbyist profile, including the submission of aerial footage publicly uploaded on social media channels. Such recreational drone activity was argued to negate suspicion of malicious conduct. The Crown, however, adduced expert evidence on the dual-use capacities of drones for surveillance and weapon delivery, in line with the considerations in R v. Matthews [2021] EWCA Crim 408, signalling the risks inherent in seemingly innocent technology when coupled with intent. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. During the investigation, a small quantity of legally prescribed medication was found in the defendant’s shared residence, alongside paraphernalia associated with vaping. The defence highlighted these as indicators of normal domesticity and to humanize Mr H’s profile in mitigation. While such details may offer a broader social fabric, the court is mindful that they do not diminish the gravity of the offending behaviour. The issue of previous minor offences was also canvassed. Mr H was noted to have received a fixed penalty notice in November 2019 for cycling on the pavement, an infraction resoundingly trivial in nature and unrelated to the present matters. Nor does a 2016 caution for shoplifting at a convenience store bear relevance here beyond demonstrating youthful lapse. The court deprecates unwarranted conflation of such low-level public order concerns with the deliberate and calculated activity central to this prosecution. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. International travel features prominently in the case narrative. Airline and border control records confirm Mr H’s attendance at a conference in Prague in March 2024, ostensibly on the subject of advanced robotics. CCTV footage from the Václav Havel Airport depicts the defendant meeting an individual later implicated in a drug trafficking investigation in Germany. The defence posited that the meeting was coincidental. Nonetheless, the court must balance this against Mr H’s encrypted telephone activity linking him with known extremist networks. The provenance of these contacts reinforces concerns about the defendant’s transnational associations and the capacity for cross-border cooperation among extremist actors. This prosecution has borne the hallmarks of the increasingly interdisciplinary approach required in modern counter-terrorism. The joint working arrangements between specialist police units, digital forensic teams, and international liaison officers have represented a considerable logistical undertaking. Their efforts have occurred against a backdrop of wider societal challenges, including increased reported incidents of fly-tipping on green belt land in adjacent jurisdictions destabilizing rural communities and straining environmental enforcement responses, as illustrated in the East Midlands Environmental Agency’s 2025 annual review. Further complicating the investigatory environment has been ongoing staffing shortages within Probation Services nationally. The 2023 Ministry of Justice Personnel Report observed a drop in frontline officers dedicated to MAPPA cases, a factor that inevitably impacts case management efficiency and risk monitoring capacity in complex terrorism-related matters. The court’s expectations for comprehensive pre-sentence reports therefore extend to include an evaluation of available post-custodial support resourcing. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A cryptocurrency trail was uncovered by financial investigators, leading to a transfer valued at just over £3,900 to an account associated with a darknet marketplace specializing in chemical precursors. This finding is consistent with a pattern of transactions increasingly observed in terrorism financing cases, where anonymity afforded by blockchain technology provides obfuscation to illicit procurement activities. The court notes the troubling paradox that innovations intended to empower individual financial autonomy can, in distasteful turns, enable harmful conduct. The procedural safeguards and investigatory techniques with which law enforcement grapple in such cases remain a work in progress, anticipated to be an area of intensified legislative focus. Covert surveillance logs report several nocturnal visits by the defendant to industrial estates in the Parkside area between November 2024 and January 2025. These observations demanded a substantial allocation of analyst hours, given the poor lighting and frequent presence of legitimate commercial traffic. A notable operational challenge has been the strain placed on the West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service, whose involvement in similar cases of arson and fire-setting has placed demands on training, resource allocation, and community outreach efforts. While no suggestion has been made that Mr H engaged in such conduct, the reference in procedural documentation to the increase in arson attacks on commercial premises has coloured the contextual concerns attendant to cases involving improvised incendiary devices. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old, single, and resident in a densely populated terraced dwelling. He pursued post-secondary education receiving an upper second-class honours degree in electronic engineering from a local university. Employer references describe him as “technically proficient but somewhat withdrawn,” with a history of punctuality and compliance with workplace norms. His abrupt resignation in August 2023 from a role at a manufacturing firm followed a dispute concerning internet usage policies and was contemporaneous with the initial stages of the investigation. Community character references have been provided from a local allotment society praising Mr H’s contributions to communal gardening projects, a youth mentoring organisation noting his participation in advisory sessions, and a branch of the Birmingham Food Bank expressing appreciation for his volunteer support during the pandemic. These positive markers of social engagement cannot be discounted but must be carefully balanced against the serious nature of his terrorist-related offences. Further letters from family members reflect understandable concerns about his mental health in the months preceding arrest. An older sibling is presently engaged in unrelated criminal proceedings for benefit fraud, a fact disclosed in open court but not considered relevant to the defendant’s personal profile. The defendant’s ex-partner reportedly is under investigation for alleged harassment, a matter peripheral to the instant offences. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. The psychological evaluation conducted by Dr Pamela Collins, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at the Birmingham Secure Assessment Unit, concludes that Mr H does not suffer from a recognised mental disorder but exhibits traits of cognitive rigidity and ideological absolutism. The risk assessment indicates a high likelihood of persistent extremist attitudes absent engagement with structured deradicalisation interventions. While the defendant has partially engaged with available Prevent Channel programmes, disengagement midway through the regimen was noted with concern. The forensic psychiatrist emphasised the complexity of adjudicating potential for rehabilitation and the critical necessity of ongoing supervision in the community post-release. The Probation Service, in their pre-sentence report, anticipates that an Extended Determinate Sentence combined with a community licence featuring strict electronic monitoring and mandated attendance at secured support centres would be necessary to mitigate risk of reoffending. In this sentencing, the court must pay due regard to the five headline principles stipulated in R v. Williams [2019] EWCA Crim 1314, notably the paramountcy of public protection, the deterrent effect of sentencing, and the need to uphold community confidence. Although Mr H demonstrates certain mitigating factors such as previous good character and educational attainments, these pale against the seriousness of calculated offences aiming at mass harm. The history of the defendant’s case has been marked by diligent prosecutorial preparation and steadfast defence engagement. I record my appreciation to Ms Imogen Pearce appearing on behalf of the Crown and to Mr Thomas Granville, instructed under the aegis of legal aid, for the defence. Their submissions have been thorough, appropriately robust, and respectful of the gravity of the matter. It falls now for this court to direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. Such report should give particular attention to the continued viability of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, current availability of specialist community provisions within the West Midlands area, and the defendant’s receptivity to cognitive-behavioural interventions designed to address extremist attitudes. The court recognizes the commendable efforts of the Birmingham Prevent Hub and the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) coordination team, whose ongoing collaboration represents, in this court’s estimation, a model of inter-agency cooperation despite frequent resource constraints. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 2 September 2025, in Court 8 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. They have been recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal transcript and judgment will be issued for registration and further reference. Mr H is reminded of his right to appeal within twenty-eight days under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.
