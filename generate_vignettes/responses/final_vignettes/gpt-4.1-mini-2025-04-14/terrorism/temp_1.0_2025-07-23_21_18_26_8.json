Mr H Case No. B2025/32654 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge K. E. DUNLOP Filed: 3 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court today for sentence following his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period under scrutiny extends from October 2022 until his arrest in April 2025. On 14 April 2025, officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West conducted a warrant-supported search at Mr H’s residence in the Barton Hill district. The warrant was issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, subsequent to intelligence provided by the Security Service involving decryption of messages on an encrypted messaging service linked to Mr H’s known online pseudonym. Seized at the property were multiple electronic devices, including two laptop computers, encrypted USB drives, and several components consistent with explosive manufacture. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation culminating in Mr H’s arrest was the product of several months of joint agency work, involving CTPSW, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and technical specialists seconded from the Government Communications Headquarters. The complexity of the digital devices recovered meant protracted examination was required. The forensic extraction involved the deployment of advanced chip-off techniques and decryption algorithms, hampered by multi-layer encryption frameworks and partitioning through nested virtual environments. It is notable that the National Cyber Crime Unit was simultaneously engaged in a major operation in the West Midlands relating to a series of cyber intrusions linked to politically motivated groups, which exerted a material impact upon resource allocation at critical junctures. During the initial proceedings, I note the case was twice adjourned to allow the preparation of defence evidence, complicated by limitations on Legal Aid funding and the necessity of instructing a suitably qualified independent digital forensics expert. The court recognises the systemic challenges posed by increasingly technical evidence in terrorism cases, with the Legal Aid Agency frequently subject to justified criticism for administrative delay and inconsistent authorisations, which serve neither justice nor the interests of fair trial. It is recorded that a Channel programme referral had initially been made by a lecturer at a local college in early 2021, triggered by Mr H’s submission of coursework containing quotations from extremist propaganda without critical analysis. The referral panel decided not to progress to formal Channel engagement, citing insufficient evidence of active support beyond expressed grievances. This threshold assessment reflects the difficulties faced by front-line educators and Prevent practitioners in balancing civil liberties with public safety responsibility. A plea and trial preparation hearing was conducted on 8 July 2025. Mr H entered not guilty pleas at that stage and maintained them throughout jury selection. It was not until the morning of the third trial day on 22 August 2025 that he changed his pleas to guilty in respect of both counts. The court considers the late entry of plea in light of authorities such as R v. Naidoo [2019] EWCA Crim 362 and R v. Simms [2023] EWCA Crim 1188, which confirm the necessity of curtailing discounts for guilty pleas made after extensive trial preparation. Early admission of guilt is an important factor promoting efficiency of the criminal justice system and reducing victim and witness trauma but it is equally the case that tactical pleas are to be treated with caution and appropriately reduced credit. Delving into matters of legal principle, the court acknowledges the value of examining parallel case law to frame sentencing discretion, even where the facts may be somewhat distinguishable. For example, R v. Granger [2017] EWCA Crim 2289, involving multiple counts of drug importation and firearm offences, provides jurisprudential guidance on assessing culpability despite different subject matter. While the case’s focus on organised crime and narcotics trafficking separates it from the present terrorism context, the approach taken to the combination of relevant aggravating factors—such as extent of premeditation and level of authority of the accused—is instructive. It is also pertinent to note R v. Darby [2020] EWCA Crim 1342, a case in which the defendant was convicted of arson causing extensive damage to a place of worship. While Mr Darby’s offending was unconnected to ideology and did not involve terrorism, the Court’s analysis of the seriousness of property damage and impact on community cohesion remains relevant insofar as it exemplifies the wide ambit under which offending causing public harm is deplored and sentenced accordingly. Turning to the current proceedings, a particular procedural point of significance relates to the involvement of the Better Case Management (BCM) regime. The court notes that, despite the case’s complexity and volume of disclosure exceeding 620 exhibits, BCM appointments were conducted within projected timeframes. The engagement of all parties in timely preparation allowed the case to proceed expeditiously, notwithstanding difficulties inherent in coordinating expert reports and disclosure vetting with inter-agency stakeholders, including the Home Office's National Security Unit. Furthermore, the court wishes to commend the professionalism shown by psychiatrist Dr Felicity Monro, who conducted a comprehensive assessment of the defendant’s mental state. Dr Monro’s report, dated 12 August 2025, provides valuable insight, including an evaluation of Mr H’s cognitive functioning, ideological fervour, and risk profile. Of note is her careful consideration that Mr H does not meet criteria for psychosis but demonstrates features consistent with rigid habitus and dogmatic moral absolutism. The report also highlights a strong tendency towards social isolation and limited empathy, factors which exacerbate risk, particularly in the absence of structured rehabilitation. Such observations serve the court well in tailoring its sentencing considerations. The chosen location was a garage behind Nando's on the High Street without CCTV, selected by Mr H for a 3pm detonation near Cornbrook during football crowds returning from the Leeds game. The Crown’s case hinged significantly on the evidence gathered from Mr H’s online communications. Between late 2022 and early 2025, he maintained active participation in encrypted group chats on a platform popular among extremist cells. Linguistic analysis, assisted by forensic linguists commissioned by the prosecution, identified a pattern of codewords and phrases consistent with instructions on improvised explosive device manufacture. The material recovered included technical diagrams, sourcing information, and deployment strategies. These acts establish the defendant’s involvement far beyond mere ideological sympathy, extending into active preparatory work. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The discovery of “RecipeVault,” a hidden volume within encrypted drives, offered forensic insight into the degree of sophistication. The cache contained detailed manuals on explosive chemistry, ballistic fragmentation testing, and detailed target reconnaissance reports. Although defence counsel argued some materials may have been downloaded for academic interest or mechanical curiosity, the court is satisfied on the evidence that their accumulation, combined with other acts, demonstrates clear intent. The evidential picture is corroborated by intercepted communications with known proscribed organisation members, held under schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. In an unusual procedural aside, the court notes that one of the exhibits— a video purporting to demonstrate the resilience of improvised blast-resistant containers—was affected by digital corruption at the final 20 seconds. This glitch led to submissions by the defence questioning whether the file had been fully accessed by the defendant, suggesting inadvertent possession rather than active engagement. The court rejects this line of reasoning as speculative and unsupported by surrounding context. The principle that partial possession does not vitiate intent where accompanied by corroborative behaviour remains firmly established in case law. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. Mr H had, as part of his defence, sought to advance a narrative of legitimate scientific or engineering interest, referencing a dormant social media account characterised by innocuous drone photography videos and topographical scans of urban landscapes. However, the court finds that the preponderance of evidentiary material indicates these were a veneer concealing active preparation for terrorist activity, rather than legitimate hobby or profession. The court also acknowledges the presence of minor drug residues detected during the execution of warrants: a small amount of MDMA found in packaging hidden beneath the defendant’s bed. This is noted for completeness; no charges have been brought in relation to controlled substances, and the court does not view this as aggravating in relation to the terrorism offences before it. Defence submissions characterising this as consistent with a young adult social milieu, while accurate, do not materially assist in mitigating the gravity of the primary offences. Concerning ancillary matters, it is noted that the defendant previously received a fixed penalty notice for cycling without lights on a public highway in 2018. Although unwarranted at first glance, this relatively minor infringement was cited in mitigation by counsel to illustrate youthful naivety and an otherwise unblemished compliance history. The court must, however, remind all parties that such administrative contraventions bear no relevance to offences of the present severity and purpose. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. The Crown also adduced travel documents indicating Mr H’s visit to Budapest in August 2024. While officially described as a cultural excursion, intercepted communications reveal an intent to meet with a contact later arrested in connection with the illicit trafficking of ammonium nitrate used in IED manufacture. Further, local police investigations in Budapest uncovered that the defendant was observed participating in meetings at a venue known to be frequented by extremist sympathisers, under surveillance by the Counter-Terrorism Coordination Centre of the European Union. While the cross-jurisdictional investigative work underpinning these findings was intensive, demonstrating commendable cooperation between British and European partners, it also highlights the growing complexity of terrorism enforcement in an age of transnational networks and the intrinsic challenges posed by divergent legal systems and evidential standards. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial forensic analysis revealed a series of cryptocurrency transactions from an account associated with Mr H’s pseudonymous profiles. The transfers, totaling approximately £3,800, included payments to internet vendors dealing in dual-use chemicals and specialist mechanical components. The trail passed through multiple mixer services, including one operated under the moniker “ShadowSpin,” which levies a 1.1% transaction fee to anonymise the origin. This pattern is emblematic of the challenges police face in tracking illicit finance in high-tech crime and terrorism contexts. The court observes that while cryptocurrency affords legitimate advantages in privacy and decentralised finance, its current use in criminal enterprises, facilitated by tumblers, mixers, and privacy coins, undermines law enforcement’s ability to interdict and disrupt plots, raising pressing questions for legislative reform and international cooperation. The covert surveillance network employed on 23 November 2024 to monitor Mr H’s movements along the Avon tributaries is illustrative of both operational dedication and resource intensity. The review involved synchronising footage from four separate cameras, utilising gait analysis software to identify the defendant against a backdrop of pedestrian traffic. Despite the brief duration of the monitored activity—less than fifteen minutes—the manpower requirements were substantial, consuming the equivalent of 65 analyst hours. This inverse ratio between effort invested and temporal span of activity is emblematic of modern law enforcement challenges. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. In relation to personal background, Mr H is 28 years old and holds a degree in electrical engineering from a post-1992 university. Until mid-2022, he was employed at a regional telecommunications firm as a junior systems analyst. Colleagues describe him variously as intelligent but aloof and focally intense about ideological interests. His resignation followed an internal enquiry regarding unauthorised use of company resources to access extremist content, which he described as academic research. Letters have been submitted by members of the Barton Hill community gardening association and from the local library volunteers, attesting to Mr H’s prior involvement in low-key community activities, such as organising plant donations and delivering books during lockdowns. The court values civic engagement but reiterates that such activities cannot override the gravity of terrorism offences. Indeed, it supports the principle that those with prior positive community standing have a concomitant responsibility to adhere to the rule of law. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! Professor Samuel Travis, consultant forensic psychologist instructed on behalf of the defence, concludes that while Mr H suffers no diagnosed major mental illness, he demonstrates cognitive inflexibility, rigid black-and-white thinking, and an entrenched ideological worldview. He is assessed as presenting a high risk of serious harm without intensive treatment focused on deradicalisation and social reintegration. The proposed Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), referenced by counsel, is recognised by the court as promising, though with acknowledged variable completion rates and modest evidence of sustained success in long-term recidivism reduction. Submissions from the Muslim Community Advisory Forum expressed concern over the impact of heightened threat levels on minority communities, cautioning against perceived stigmatization through sentencing. Such points are noted with seriousness. However, the court’s overriding duty is to public protection and the principles of justice. The differentiation between community engagement and breaches of terrorism legislation is critical, and it is only through consistent enforcement of the law that social cohesion is ultimately safeguarded. This case encapsulates the modern challenges of counter-terrorism jurisprudence: balancing rights and freedoms against the imperative of public safety in an environment complicated by technological innovation, ideological extremism, and societal fracture. The sentencing framework as set forth in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines 2023 directs the court to consider culpability, harm, aggravating and mitigating features, and the overarching purpose of punishment. Cases such as R v. Amin [2024] EWCA Crim 566 and R v. Khalil [2020] EWCA Crim 1140 have underscored the necessity for substantial custodial sentences where there is clear evidence of operational preparation, particularly involving sophisticated or dangerous materials. The highest culpability bracket is engaged where there is evidence of a sustained plan to cause serious mass harm, utilising technical skill and external facilitation networks. The defence is commended for thorough advocacy throughout, including the submissions advanced by Mr Callum Stevens of Counsel, who sought to emphasise the defendant’s potential for reform and the mitigating effect of late plea. The Crown, represented by Ms Lara Jennings, has presented a full and diligent case, ensuring that public interest and victim concerns are at the forefront. The prison estate continues to face pressures including understaffing and overcrowding, as documented in the Ministry of Justice’s latest Annual Report. The Probation Service, similarly, has seen reductions in available resources for rehabilitative services, further complicating post-sentence management of high-risk individuals. It is incumbent upon the court to provide sentences which reflect the dual aims of punishment and risk management, mindful of these systemic challenges. The court directs that a full pre-sentence report be prepared with urgency, to enable a considered final sentence at a date to be fixed. The report should include detailed analysis of risk of harm, previous engagement with services, suitability for specialist programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, and provisions for ongoing supervision and monitoring. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 3 September 2025, in Court 9 at the Crown Court at Bristol. A full transcript has been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the National Offender Management Service and the relevant security agencies. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal against sentence and conviction within 28 days pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.
