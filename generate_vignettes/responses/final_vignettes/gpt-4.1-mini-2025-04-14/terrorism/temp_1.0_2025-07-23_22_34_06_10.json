Mr H Case No. B2025/29942 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. R. KENDRICK Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court today for sentence on charges brought under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a) and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct, as set out in the indictment, occurred over an extended period from November 2022 until his arrest on 14 January 2025. Before addressing the substantive matters, it is appropriate to record the procedural history of this case. The defendant was initially apprehended by officers of West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit following a coordinated operation involving multiple agencies, including the National Cyber Crime Unit and specialists from the Home Office Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure. The arrest stemmed from intelligence developed over months, relying heavily on technical surveillance measures authorised pursuant to statute. Such measures, sensitive by nature and subject to rigorous judicial oversight, nevertheless underscore the gravity with which Mr H’s conduct was viewed by authorities charged with safeguarding the public. Mr H was interviewed under caution at the time of arrest and denied the allegations. He was initially remanded in custody, then released on stringent bail conditions pending the collation and analysis of voluminous digital material retrieved during the search warrants executed at his residence and associated premises. The case was listed for trial on 5 August 2025, following a pre-trial review hearing that had been adjourned on multiple occasions due to the late disclosure of sensitive material and the need to resolve complex legal arguments relating to admissibility of intercept evidence. The court is also mindful of the substantial resource demands imposed by terrorism investigations. It is worth noting, though perhaps peripheral, that the West Midlands CTU currently operates at near capacity, stretchered by a surge in digital extremist content that strains both technical and human investigative resources. Such systemic pressures inevitably inform the pace and handling of cases like this. It is a matter of public record that the National Crime Agency’s Digital Forensic Hub reported a case backlog of over 14,000 devices nationally at the start of 2025, with only a fraction processed within statutory deadlines. The defendant was represented throughout by Mr Lewis Bradshaw of counsel, who has conducted his defence with clear professionalism and diligence, despite the considerable challenges posed by the volume and complexity of disclosure. I am also indebted to Ms Sarah Eaton, appearing for the Crown, whose submissions have been clear and measured. The court appreciates the efforts of all court staff, including the recently appointed bilingual court clerk whose role was indispensable given the partially multilingual nature of the evidential material. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. In considering the factual matrix, it is useful to recall that the offence of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism under section 5 of the 2006 Act carries a maximum custodial sentence of life imprisonment. The Charges carry significant statutory weight, reflecting Parliamentary intent to deter and punish conduct that threatens national security and public safety. This court is attentive also to the guidance contained within the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines, which assist in the categorisation of culpability and harm. The principles governing credit for guilty pleas are well established. It is worth mentioning that Mr H entered his guilty pleas on the first day of trial, after evidence had been presented and before the first prosecution witness gave sworn testimony. While a plea at this stage remains creditworthy to a degree, the lateness limits full mitigation. The Court of Appeal in R v. Shepherd [2024] EWCA Crim 183 gives helpful direction on such assessments, reaffirming that timely acceptance of responsibility is a factor that benefits the efficiency of the justice system and lessens the trauma to victims and witnesses. Historically, and at some distance from the present matter, the court recalls the decision in R v. Travers [2011] EWCA Crim 322, where the defendant’s early plea and comprehensive cooperation merited a reduction in sentence of up to one-third. This contrasts starkly with cases where pleas are delayed, or equivocal, which attract significantly less reduction. While not centrally relevant to Mr H, these authorities frame the context within which sentencing discount operates. The defendant’s counsel invited the court to consider the broader social context within which these offences occurred. It was noted that radicalisation pathways are frequently complex, involving social isolation, exposure to extremist ideology online, and vulnerabilities relating to mental health. The defence relied upon a detailed psychological report prepared by Dr Vivienne Chen, a consultant forensic psychiatrist. Dr Chen concluded that while Mr H does not suffer from a formal psychiatric diagnosis, he does display traits consistent with rigid cognitive styles and proneness to ideological fixity. The report emphasised the importance of structured management and potential benefit from engagement in deradicalisation programmes post-sentence. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. To understand the impact of cases such as Mr H’s, it is unfortunately necessary to consider the broader societal trends. Recent figures published by the Home Office show a marked increase in low-level extremist offences involving digital communication, from 683 in 2021 to 1,207 in 2024. This has coincided with a wider debate about the balance between security and civil liberties, a subject addressed in the seminal judgment in R v. Zafar [2019] UKSC 18, which highlighted the necessity of proportionate measures in the surveillance and prosecution of terrorism cases. A recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. It is appropriate at this juncture to reflect on the nature of forensic digital evidence analysed in this case. The National Cyber Crime Unit undertook extensive examination of the defendant’s encrypted communications. The recovery of deleted material using data-carving techniques on solid-state drives – a methodology subject to recent judicial scrutiny in R v. Calderon [2023] EWCA Crim 1589 – demonstrated the defendant’s engagement with extremist literature and procurement of components capable of weaponisation. The defence sought to challenge the admissibility of some of this material on grounds of evidential integrity and chain of custody concerns, but those submissions were rejected after a robust voir dire. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. It is noted that the defendant’s home address was subject to a landlord’s noise abatement notice in 2020 following complaints by neighbouring residents concerning persistent loud music. While plainly unrelated to the current charges, such background details often feature in comprehensive disclosure bundles, serving to portray a rounded personal background. Similarly, the court took into account that the defendant’s flatmate had past convictions for cannabis possession and a minor shoplifting offence. While these matters have no direct bearing on the charges, their presence within the evidential and social context is not uncommon. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. There is reference in the prosecution case to a series of movements and financial transactions undertaken by Mr H overseas. Specifically, air travel records evince a journey to the Middle East in August 2023. Accompanying this was surveillance indicating contact at an airport with individuals later charged with unrelated drug trafficking offences. The court emphasises that these associates’ convictions were for offences unrelated to terrorism, and no evidence exists to implicate Mr H in such criminality. The massive scale of disclosure in this case cannot be overstated. The total documentation included 615 electronic files, photographic exhibits, email correspondences, and intercepted phone call transcripts. The multi-agency disclosure team had to liaise with security and cyber units across local, regional, and national levels to ensure proper vetting, redaction, and compliance with statutory data protection requirements. This process extended over 10 months and occasioned multiple adjournments. The defence also sought to adduce character references from various voluntary sector organisations. Notably, the “Community Foundation for Youth Engagement” provided a letter attesting to Mr H’s intermittent volunteering as a youth mentor in 2021. Another letter from “Birmingham Green Spaces Partnership” credited him with participation in local conservation efforts. The court acknowledges these contributions but stresses that volunteering, while laudable, cannot obscure the serious nature of the offences and the attendant public risk. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations revealed that Mr H had utilised cryptocurrency transactions to acquire specific items intended for concealment and potential use in the commission of terrorist acts. The forensic accounting team traced several transactions through a series of mixing services designed to obfuscate source and destination, with an aggregate value exceeding £5,800. Though cryptocurrency use in criminality is not unique, its prevalence continues to challenge law enforcement. This underscores the vital necessity for coherent regulatory approaches and improved investigative techniques. It is a regrettable but inescapable fact that resources devoted to tracking such financial flows often detract from other urgent policing needs, such as tackling aggravated burglary or drug-related violence. The juxtaposition of priorities is a perennial concern for the Police and Crime Commissioner, as articulated in annual reports, highlighting the competing demands on stretched forces. The trial preparation and eventual hearing were protracted, in part due to the Covid-19 related disruptions that plagued court scheduling nationwide during 2024. Multiple sessions were adjourned following counsel availability issues, and interpreter services were required for some of the foreign-language recordings central to the case. The court expresses its gratitude to translation staff, who often work under intense time constraints to facilitate comprehensive justice. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to the personal circumstances of Mr H, he is a man aged 31 with a degree in electrical engineering obtained from a regional university. His previous employment history includes a term as a technician at a local data centre, where he received commendations for diligence. Notwithstanding these positive personal attributes, the abrupt loss of employment following a redundancy exercise in mid-2023 coincided with increased isolation and intensified engagement with extremist material, as noted in the psychiatric evaluation. Letters from family members present a mixed picture. The defendant’s mother describes concern over his withdrawal from social contact and changes in behaviour. A sister, undergoing separate civil proceedings, also provided a letter urging the court to consider the potential for rehabilitation. While family support is important, it cannot substitute for the primary responsibility the court holds to protect the public. The probation officer assigned to prepare a pre-sentence report has noted significant challenges inherent to managing cases involving radicalised individuals. Probation Service workloads have escalated sharply over recent years, with staffing shortages documented in the annual report for 2024 citing vacancy rates of up to 20% in some offices. This places added risk on delivery of structured interventions and effective monitoring. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! Professor Harriet Cole, a consultant forensic psychologist instructed by the defence, comments on Mr H’s ‘cognitive inflexibility and pronounced black-and-white moral schema,’ albeit stopping short of diagnosing a formal disorder. Risk assessments position him as a high likelihood of reoffending absent intensive supervision. The professor advocates for engagement in specialist deradicalisation programming, specifying programmes that integrate psychological therapies and community reintegration. The court is cognizant of the ongoing debate regarding the efficacy of such programmes; evidence suggests variable success rates, with attrition common. The Desistance and Disengagement Programme noted in submissions has graduated less than 70% of attendees nationally over the past three years, with a subset disengaging upon release. Nonetheless, the court welcomes such interventions as part of a holistic sentencing response. It is appropriate to address briefly the public interest in transparency, a matter frequently raised in commentary regarding terrorism cases. While open justice is a cornerstone of the legal system, the court must balance this against the protection of sensitive intelligence sources and methods. The recent review in R v. Duvall [2025] EWCA Crim 774 reinforces that closed material procedures remain a vital tool in upholding security while preserving fairness. In conclusion, the offence committed by Mr H represents a grave breach of both criminal law and the implicit trust society places in individuals not to engage in behaviour aimed at mass harm. The nature of his engagement, the sophistication of his planning, and the potential consequences if unimpeded warrant serious custodial treatment. Mitigation is confined to the absence of previous convictions, the defendant’s educational attainment, and the late, though sincere, pleas of guilty. The court orders the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report which should include assessment of risk of serious harm, suitability for extended determinate sentence, availability of licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring, and the capacity for intervention within approved premises. Consideration should also be given to participation in structured deradicalisation programmes and psychological interventions targeting cognitive rigidity. The court thanks Ms Eaton and Mr Bradshaw for their submissions. It notes with appreciation the continued efforts of the West Midlands CTU and the Local Authority Safeguarding Panel whose coordinated approach to risk management has been exemplary given the complex demands of such cases.
