Mr H Case No. B2025/19834 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. Farnham Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H appears for sentence today on charges including one count of conducting acts in preparation for terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of articles for purposes linked to terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences relate to actions committed over a protracted period extending from late 2022 through to his arrest in early 2025. The defendant was initially detained at 03:45 on 11 February 2025 following the execution of a search warrant by the Counter Terrorism Unit West Midlands. The warrant was predicated on intelligence derived from multiple sources, including intercept material and metadata analysis ostensibly indicating the defendant’s involvement with encrypted communications channels known to be used by proscribed entities. Items seized included digital devices, electronic media drives, and a quantity of powdery substances later identified as inert but of concern by virtue of packaging and labeling. The degree of cross-agency cooperation evidenced here involved not only CTU officers but also a specialist cybercrime unit and explosives experts, reflecting the multidisciplinary approach necessitated by such cases. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. In the course of an extensive investigation lasting several months, a combination of traditional human intelligence and advanced data analytics led to a mosaic of evidence fragmenting into a coherent depiction of the defendant’s offending. The challenges encountered included decryption of multiple secure communication platforms, some with ephemeral message deletion designed to frustrate law enforcement scrutiny. Support staff from the National Cyber Crime Unit played a pivotal role notwithstanding their chronically insufficient resource allocation, a situation lamented repeatedly in parliamentary oversight committee hearings. The court recognises the Hawthorne Street Community Centre and its outreach programme for vulnerable youth, which submitted a character reference commenting on the defendant’s participation in after-school engineering workshops prior to the offending period. Such engagement, while commendable in a community rehabilitation context, cannot in any measure dilute or negate the severity of the defendant’s criminal conduct. Our criminal justice system also continues to grapple with the implications of the Criminal Procedures and Investigations Act 1996 as amended, and the sometimes tortuous disclosure obligations it imposes on all parties. This case was no exception. An order under section 8 of PACE to preserve and analyse voluminous electronic material, combined with the need for material secrecy in relation to intercepts obtained pursuant to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, required careful balancing of interests in open justice and national security that delayed proceedings on occasion through no party’s explicit fault. The defendant initially entered not guilty pleas at the first hearing on 18 March 2025, but altered those pleas to guilty at the conclusion of the trial preparation hearing on 10 September 2025. The timing of the plea, so proximate to trial, was a significant feature of the submissions made on mitigation. The court’s view on credit for such late pleas accords with established jurisprudence emphasising the avoidance of encouraging tactical behaviour designed solely to delay resolution or conserve resources for defence, notably as in R v. Brennan [2023] EWCA Crim 1807. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. The principles surrounding credit for guilty pleas, as outlined in the comprehensive judgment in R v. Tran [2022] EWCA Crim 534, remain of critical importance. The defendant’s plea, while a welcome acceptance of culpability, was entered only after exhaustive prosecution preparation and after disclosure of expert reports, thus mitigating but not eradicated any reduction in sentence. It is a conscientious principle that sentence credit is a measure of genuine contrition and cooperation with the administration of justice from as early a stage as possible. The court’s attention has been drawn to the defendant’s family circumstances, including letters from his mother and sister, articulating his prior good character and the detrimental impact of custodial sentences on familial relationships. Such representations are received with respect. The court also acknowledges correspondence from the Midlands Radicalisation Prevention Initiative (MRPI), which provided commentary on the defendant’s intermittent engagement with their outreach activities, including attendance at workshops designed to counter extremist narratives and participation in tailored cognitive-behavioural programmes. These engagements demonstrate some potential in rehabilitation, though the efficacy of such interventions depends on sustained commitment and supervision. The legal context for sentencing offences under the 2006 Terrorism Act has been the subject of detailed analysis and evolution. The sentencing framework emphasises the gravity of acts committed with terrorist intent, with the paramount considerations of deterrence, public protection, and denunciation guiding judicial discretion. The maximum custodial penalties are severe, reflecting the societal interest in preventing harm and disruption. It is pertinent here to recall the evolution of the law from the earliest statutory provisions, notably the Terrorism Act 2000 and its subsequent amendments introducing offences targeting preparatory acts and possession of materials, reflecting Parliament’s intention to cast a wide net over emerging threats. The court notes the remarks of Lord Justice Elias in R v. Ali [2019] EWCA Crim 371, emphasising the importance of a robust sentencing approach that addresses both the factual matrix and ideological motivations. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The court is aware that the defendant utilized online forums known for extremist sympathies, posting ideological manifestos and technical guides for the manufacture of explosive devices. Linguistic forensic analysis has established that his writings bear hallmark patterns consistent with material disseminated by proscribed groups. The relevance of this evidence was thoroughly tested during trial preparation, with the defence contending at length that much of the material was accessed for academic research rather than malicious intent. This court finds such a contention unconvincing when viewed alongside other evidence. Further to the digital evidence, forensic examination uncovered devices containing encrypted archives delineating reconnaissance activities at various public venues, which the Crown suggests were intended targets. Defence submissions sought to explain some of these as interests related to photography hobbies or local historical research, a claim this court finds to be insufficiently persuasive given the overall context. The possession of detailed floor plans, combined with timing analyses of movements, further undermines the legitimacy of benign explanations. The court has reviewed extensive psychiatric and psychological reports. Dr Ethan McCormick, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence, performed a comprehensive assessment dated 28 August 2025. Dr McCormick diagnosed no major mental disorder but noted the defendant exhibits traits associated with intense cognitive rigidity and a susceptibility to black-and-white ideological narratives. His recommendations include sustained engagement with specialist intervention providers post-release, though he emphasised the challenges inherent in predicting successful disengagement. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Defence counsel has called attention to mitigating factors including the defendant’s lack of prior convictions, established employment history in a technical field, and articulated remorse in a letter submitted to the court. The letter displays careful thought and a measure of insight, though the court must consider it in the wider context of offending and risk. The impact of such mitigation is, by necessity, limited given the severity of the offences. The court recorded with regret the absence of progress in the defendant’s attempts at sustained cooperation with the so-called West Midlands Counter-Extremism Unit’s deradicalisation initiative. Contact logs indicate sporadic attendance and ultimate disengagement preceding remand. This speaks to the difficulties encountered in managing extremism cases within institutional settings, where personal motivations and ideological commitments often prove resistant to standard therapeutic approaches. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. The defendant’s travel record was scrutinised carefully by the investigation, particularly a trip undertaken in November 2023 to Berlin, ostensibly for a conference on renewable technologies. Intelligence, however, indicated overlapping meetings with persons later identified as members of an extremist cell operating transnationally. Such overseas travel in the context of these offences predicates additional risk factors pertaining to access to training, facilitation, or furtherance of terrorist aims. Within the investigative process, significant time was taken to analyse financial movements via cryptocurrency transfers. Discussions in court have included warnings surrounding the use of decentralised digital currencies—while legal and potentially beneficial in many arenas—when used to fund criminal enterprise and evade oversight. The court recognises the nascent but growing legislative and enforcement challenges in this domain, as outlined in the Law Commission’s 2024 report on financial crime. The Crown also called upon evidence from Detective Inspector Rachel Morgan who detailed operational intelligence concerning the defendant’s association with individuals charged in an unrelated conspiracy involving the importation of Class A narcotics over the northern border. While there is no evidential nexus linking Mr H directly to those offences, the overlapping social networks exemplify the complexities surrounding modern investigative paradigms, where criminality can be multifaceted and extend beyond single offence categories. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The court has considered submissions with regard to sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council, specifically the 2023 revision addressing terrorism offences. The guidelines emphasize assessing the level of planning and sophistication, the defendant’s culpability, his degree of cooperation, and the overall endangerment to the public. The aggravating features in this case include use of encryption, attempts to procure dual-use materials, and ideological commitment evidenced by persistent dissemination of violent propaganda. Case law remains instructive, with particular reference to R v. Abassi [2021] EWCA Crim 1159, where the Court underlined the necessity of custodial sentences commensurate with risk posed and the potential for harm, even where no actual attack was carried out. The court notes that deterrence both specific and general plays a vital role in this domain, as does the protection of the community from future acts. The difficulties of multi-agency cooperation are familiar. The process of MAPPA engagement in this case, categorised as Category 3 due to the ideological nature of offending, has been characterised by some degree of inter-agency friction and resource shortfall. Correspondence from the West Midlands Probation Trust indicates ongoing efforts to design structured post-release management, but acknowledges significant systemic constraints in staffing and monitoring capacity exacerbated by recent budgetary pressures. These factors inevitably affect risk reduction planning and underscore the need for robust custodial sentences. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Reviewing the defendant’s background, it is noted that he is 30 years of age, hold a Master’s degree in software engineering, and was employed as a junior systems architect until termination of employment in mid-2023 following internal disciplinary proceedings related to breaches of IT security protocols. Character references attest to his technical aptitude and disciplined approach, though with caveats concerning social isolation and limited peer interaction. The court also records the impact of the defendant's offending on the local community. Victim liaison officers submitted observations on the widespread unease created among residents in the surrounding district, with particular reference to the material discovered and the potential disruption had events been realised. The court acknowledges the courage of the local community in continuing to participate in civic activities despite understandable apprehension. In passing, it is noted that the defendant maintains familial connections with a sibling currently involved in separate criminal proceedings relating to benefit fraud; these matters are, of course, wholly unrelated to the case before the court and carry no weight in sentencing. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The forensic psychologist, Dr Anika Patel, presents a detailed risk assessment indicating a high risk of serious extremist-related harm should the defendant be released without intensive measures and prolonged supervision. Her report, dated 1 September 2025, recommends a prison-based ideological disengagement course followed by statutory licence conditions including exclusion zones, electronic monitoring, and regular psychological evaluation. Such recommendations are consonant with recent practice in managing terrorism offenders, as developed in conjunction with national Integrated Offender Management schemes. In summation, this case encapsulates many of the complexities confronting the criminal justice system in the ever-shifting landscape of ideological extremism. The offence conduct was both sustained and sophisticated, underpinned by a troubling ideological rigidity and manifest at multiple levels—from digital subterfuge to physical reconnaissance. The court takes seriously the need to balance firm punitive response with opportunities for rehabilitation where possible, always within the paramount interest of public protection. Owing to the intensity and volume of material, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The Probation Service is requested to include assessments of the defendant’s suitability for participation in high-intensity cognitive behavioural programmes, the feasibility of Extended Determinate Sentence conditions under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and the adequacy of planned accommodations and supervision mechanisms. The report should also provide commentary on potential for successful disengagement and risks of recidivism. The court recognises the ongoing challenges faced by key institutions: the Legal Aid Agency’s repeated delay in sanctioning expert psychiatric input prolonged preparatory stages; the overstretched resources of the National Probation Service and CTU units have hampered consistent monitoring; and the capacity constraints in forensic technical analysis units contributed to protracted investigations. These systemic pressures underscore the need for resource prioritisation in the realm of national security. Finally, the remarks issued today conclude the court’s preliminary observations pending final sentencing, presently scheduled for 3 November 2025. Updated reports and any supplementary representations must be lodged and served no later than seven days prior. Counsel and all parties are reminded of the rigorous timelines governing procedural compliance. These are the sentencing remarks of Her Honour Judge L. E. Farnham, delivered on 17 September 2025 in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. These proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right of appeal within 28 days of sentencing in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.
