Mr H Case No. S2025/32489 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J. WENTWORTH Filed: 2 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending period spans from September 2023 until his arrest in April 2025. The defendant’s case has traversed the complex terrain of contemporary terrorism prosecutions, marked by advanced surveillance, digital forensics, and protracted investigative efforts across multiple agencies. The court records, as is now routine in matters of this nature, the significant volume of material disclosed to the defence and the time-consuming analysis required to navigate sensitive intelligence and national security concerns. Indeed, the Crown’s case involved upwards of 4000 exhibits and electronic files, necessitating extensive redactions and protective marking—measures familiar within this court but no less challenging to manage. Mr H was arrested shortly before dawn on 15 April 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed at the defendant’s residence in the Woodthorpe district of Sheffield. This arrest followed an operation conducted jointly by Counter Terrorism Policing Yorkshire and the Security Service. The warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. Upon arrest, police seized a number of items, including an encrypted laptop, multiple mobile devices, and specialist tools for 3-D printing. The operation represented a multi-month intelligence-gathering effort, synthesising signals intelligence with undercover human sources and complex data analytics. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This intensive investigative phase coincided with marked pressure on public safety resources in South Yorkshire, where staffing shortages within the local police force have been compounded by an increase in non-violent but resource-heavy incidents, such as drug-related anti-social behaviour and homelessness. The strain upon front-line services—despite admirable efforts by rank and file officers—was quoted in a 2024 Chief Constable’s annual report as having reached a critical threshold, necessitating prioritisation and thus emphasising the grave nature of cases demanding terrorism expertise. In terms of procedural history, the defendant’s initial appearance took place on 17 April 2025 at Sheffield Magistrates’ Court, where he was remanded in custody. A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 10 July 2025. At that hearing, Mr H entered a not guilty plea on both counts. The trial was listed to commence on 23 September 2025 but following late disclosure of supplementary material and an application by the defence for additional time, it was adjourned to 15 November 2025. The court notes that such delays, while regrettable, were conducted in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules and reflect the considerable burden placed on legal aid solicitors in preparing cases involving national security. The defence representation is led by Mr Idris Fenwick, instructed by a legal aid provider, whose diligence in navigating the restrictive funding limits imposed by the Legal Aid Agency deserves acknowledgement in these remarks. Relevant to sentencing, this court recalls that the defendant’s late-stage change of plea was entered only hours before the commencement of the month-long trial. This was after extensive forensic evidence had been served and the prosecution’s primary witnesses had been briefed. The jurisprudential constraints on credit for late guilty pleas are well-established and systematically addressed by the courts. In particular, R v. Al-Saadi [2020] EWCA Crim 468 stands as a principal authority emphasising the distinction in credit awarded for pleas entered at the first opportunity and those offered on the cusp of trial, bearing in mind the cost to public resources and the emotional toll on victims and witnesses. To enumerate other relevant authorities, the court notes R v. Farooq [2023] EWCA Crim 812, a case involving possession of explosives precursors, in which the Court of Appeal reduced the discount for a plea entered on the eve of trial to one-tenth of the sentence, highlighting the limited systemic benefit arising from such belated admissions. Consideration must also be given to R v. Liddle [2022] EWCA Crim 1287, which elaborated on the court’s discretion to reduce credit where a defendant had maintained a defence to the last minute, causing a brittle and fractious trial process, with resultant psychological impact on witnesses and investigative staff alike. The legal context for sentencing in terrorism cases is framed primarily by the Terrorism Act 2006 and accompanying Sentencing Council Guidelines of 2023. The maximum penalty for an offence under section 5(1)(a) is life imprisonment, reserved for the most egregious conduct demonstrating clear intent to advance terrorist aims. The court is mindful also of the need to weigh public protection considerations against any recognised grounds for mitigation. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. For the purposes of assessment, the defendant’s activity was not isolated but occurred amidst a broader pattern of online radicalisation and targeted procurement of materials that, while ostensibly dual-use, could be readily adapted for weaponisation. This pattern included the systematic use of encrypted messaging platforms and anonymous cryptocurrency transactions. Such technological sophistication, though increasingly common among offenders, raises serious challenges to law enforcement and judicial authorities in balancing transparency with necessary operational secrecy. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. As part of the evidence, digital forensic teams retrieved numerous manifestos and instructional videos disseminated through secret channels on the Dark Web. The archives were located on concealed storage partitions disguised through multiple layers of encryption and algorithmic obfuscation. At one notable juncture, a “dead drop” email address was identified, linked back to material promoting sectarian violence. The complexity of these retrievals is emblematic of modern-day terrorism investigations, which rely heavily not only on direct evidence but on circumstantial, technical, and linguistic analysis. The court observes in passing, albeit with no direct bearing on this matter, that the 2019 graffitied damage occasioned to the noticeboard of St. Mark’s Church in the nearby district of Hillsborough remains unsolved. While unrelated, this form of public nuisance exemplifies the spectrum of offences drawing limited police attention in an era where counter-terrorism threats monopolise specialist resources. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Defence counsel suggested that certain photographic evidence, ostensibly taken during drone flights over remote land, were no more than a hobbyist’s interest in industrial archaeology. The photographs showed disused rail depots, apparently capturing rusted copper wiring and broken concrete sleepers. While the court acknowledges that drone use for leisure has become a mainstream pastime, the findings here corroborate the prosecution’s proposition that these images formed part of reconnaissance for sabotage or illicit material extraction, particularly given proximity in time to financial transactions involving chemical suppliers. The court was intrigued, though the relevance to this case is minimal, to learn of a co-defendant charged in a connected matter with affray arising from a violent altercation at a local public house known as The Wheelwright’s Arms. The co-defendant’s charges, involving use of pool cues and disorderly conduct, do not implicate the defendant directly, and the matter proceeds independently in another listing. In parallel with this prosecution, an ancillary investigation into fly-tipping on protected green belt land to the west of Sheffield uncovered quantities of construction waste believed to have been dumped by an unrelated third party involved in environmental offences. This underlines the multiplicity of policing challenges urban services must manage concurrently, despite widely varying levels of public attention and urgency. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. Further to that point, the court heard evidence that Mr H undertook an overseas journey in October 2024, officially declared as a visit to relatives in Lyon. Travel records indicate that he booked a sequence of onward train tickets to the French-Swiss border town of Annemasse, known for periodic assemblies of extremist sympathisers. This evidence, while circumstantial, was viewed by the security services as indicative of intent to broaden extremist networks, a finding contested by the defence as hearsay and conjectural. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial forensics uncovered a transaction trail involving approximately £4,100 sent via multiple small transfers to an account associated with a vendor specialising in chemical components. The pathway included use of a cryptocurrency “mixer,” notable for obfuscating fund origins and complicating regulatory oversight. The court reiterates the concerns long expressed in the specialist literature regarding such platforms, which have become the lynchpin of concealment strategies in offences ranging from drug trafficking to terrorism financing. The blockchain is not an unassailable ledger, but effective analysis demands significant human expertise and inter-agency cooperation. Returning to the circumstances of Mr H’s detection, it is relevant to observe that covert observations captured him engaging in a late-night visit to the banks of the River Don in November 2024. The video evidence, compiled from three separate drone units and corroborated by environmental acoustic sensors, demonstrates an encounter lasting no more than seven minutes yet necessitated over 175 analyst hours to verify and interpret. That such resourcing is expended on fleeting gestures reflects the disproportionate workload incumbent upon counter-terrorism personnel, an ongoing systemic challenge reported in the Policing Oversight Committee’s 2025 briefing. The court acknowledges the concerning attrition rates among trained digital analysts across the region, a factor which may impair operational capability should current recruitment and retention issues persist. These broader structural pressures form part of an operational context that, though extrinsic to the defendant, frame the administration of justice in terrorism matters. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H, aged 30, holds a degree in chemical engineering from a respected university and was formerly employed as a materials scientist with a local firm specialising in polymers. His employer’s reference describes him as “meticulous and reliable” but also notes his abrupt resignation in early 2023 following a dispute over compliance with internal IT protocols, specifically concerning external web access. This history aligns temporally with the commencement of his radicalisation trajectory. Submissions in mitigation have included character references from community organisations and a local mosque emphasising Mr H’s prior engagement in volunteer tutoring and youth mentorship. Such pro-social activity merits respectful consideration but must be measured against the gravity of offences charged. The paradox of an individual engaged in community service while nurturing violent ideologies is well recognised in contemporary criminal profiling and sharpens rather than softens the court’s assessment of culpability. The defendant’s family has submitted multiple letters expressing distress at the proceedings and emphasising their lack of knowledge of his activities. These have been received and noted with sympathy, though they do not detract from the legal findings. The court has also considered the comprehensive psychiatric and psychological assessment carried out by Dr Alan Gresham, consultant forensic psychologist, who documents in his report dated 25 August 2025 that Mr H exhibits “marked cognitive inflexibility and ideological fixity,” with no diagnosable mental illness yet a high risk of re-engagement with extremist groups absent structured intervention and supervision. Dr Gresham’s analysis situates Mr H within a category warranting intensive management under MAPPA, with particular caution regarding exposure to online networks. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. The court is conscious of the prevailing climate of public concern regarding terrorism and recognises that sentencing serves multiple purposes: denunciation, deterrence, protection of the public, and the encouragement of rehabilitation. The latter remains precarious in cases of ideological extremism, with current evidence indicating variable effectiveness for structured disengagement programmes. In addition to the direct submissions from counsel, the court has considered correspondence from the South Yorkshire Prevent Coordination Unit, which has advised on ongoing risk assessment and potential multi-agency interventions. Their memorandum reflects an informed yet guarded optimism regarding Mr H’s potential to engage with deradicalisation measures, contingent on custodial custodianship providing a secure framework. Equally, the court is aware of resource strains within local mental health teams, whose waiting lists for specialist forensic input have increased significantly post-pandemic, limiting capacity for timely evaluation and treatment. In closing, it is the province of this court to sentence based on the balance of all factors presented, including the wider social context, legal principles, and evidentiary corpus. The scale and nature of the offending place Mr H in the upper echelons of culpability under the Terrorism Sentencing Guideline, with limited mitigation save for a late plea and absence of previous convictions. A pre-sentence report is to be prepared forthwith, with particular attention to suitability for Extended Determinate Sentence and the proposed regime of custody and licence conditions. The report should inquire into the availability of placement within an establishment certified for high-risk extremist offenders and the feasibility of enhanced monitoring, including electronic tagging and internet usage restrictions. It should also assess the scope for therapeutic engagement and risk reduction interventions in line with best available evidence. The court is grateful to Ms Elise Martens for her comprehensive and measured submissions on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Idris Fenwick for his advocacy in an understandably difficult case. A note of thanks is also recorded for the court ushers, clerks, and recording staff at the Sheffield Crown Court, whose efficient management of this complicated listing has been instrumental in maintaining order and procedural fairness. These sentencing remarks are rendered this second day of September in the year 2025, heard in Court 5 at Sheffield Crown Court. They have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. An official record will be forwarded to the relevant institutions for sentencing registration and execution.
