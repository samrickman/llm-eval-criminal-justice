Mr H Case No. B2025/24963 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. F. WARING Filed: 4 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court charged with offences contrary to the Terrorism Act 2006, notably one count of engaging in conduct in the preparation of acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a) and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct in question occurred during the period running from September 2023 to the defendant’s arrest in March 2025. The defendant was apprehended by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at approximately 04:45 hours on 12 March 2025, following the execution of a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at an address in Hartcliffe. The operation was supported by intelligence indicating communication activity on an encrypted messaging platform, Signal, linked to the defendant’s known identifiers, and the seizure of digital devices including an encrypted smartphone and several USB storage devices ensued. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation, codenamed Operation CEDARFOX, was a multi-agency effort combining the expertise of CTPSW’s digital forensics teams, Security Service analysts, and regional police surveillance units. It incorporated signals intelligence, human intelligence, and covert electronic interception under authorisation granted by the Secretary of State. The scope of the inquiry spanned several months, involving meticulous cross-referencing of network traffic, link analysis, and review of closed online forums. During the remand period, the defendant was subject to a series of bail reviews necessitated by concerns emerging from preliminary risk assessments. The court records that such reviews invariably impose pressure upon already stretched judicial resources, a phenomenon that has been documented in previous reports, such as the 2023 Ministry of Justice publication on bail management efficiencies. It bears noting that, prior to the commencement of the present proceedings, Mr H had engaged, albeit intermittently, with a Prevent programme run by the Avon & Somerset Prevent Hub. The referral to that programme originated in late 2021, following concerns raised by a college tutor regarding social media posts espousing extremist views. Despite offers of mentoring and cognitive behavioural therapy, engagement was partial. The Calderside Prevent Hub’s submissions to this court speak to repeated attempts at intervention, underscoring the challenges Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS) practitioners face in balancing outreach and risk mitigation. The scheduling of the plea and trial preparation hearing on 15 July 2025 was delayed due to judicial availability and the partial withdrawal of Mr H’s initial legal representation, necessitating a adjournment under the aegis of the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR) to allow for new counsel to prepare adequately. The Legal Aid Agency’s role in authorising intellectually demanding expert defence reports was marked by administrative delays which, while not undermining the integrity of proceedings, illustrate systemic inefficiencies increasingly lamented in professional circles. Credit for guilty pleas is a matter on which the court must particularly be vigilant. It is well established that while such pleas can yield benefits to the efficient administration of justice by sparing victims the ordeal of trial testimony and conserving court time, the availability of credit is contingent upon the timing and sincerity of the plea. The Court of Appeal in R v. Erskine [2024] EWCA Crim 299 underscored that pleas offered at the “eleventh hour,” when the inevitable has become clear, attract correspondingly reduced mitigation. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. In applying the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guidelines on terrorism offences, this court must consider the level of culpability demonstrated by Mr H, including his degree of involvement, planning sophistication, and the proximity of his acts to actual attack readiness. The Crown relies upon evidence which, it submits, places Mr H in a category characterised by substantial intent and preparatory action, aligning with the higher starting points recommended by the guidelines. Reference is made to the case of R v. Sibanda [2019] EWCA Crim 1234, which observed that in terrorism cases the overriding emphasis is on deterrence and public protection, thereby warranting sentences commensurate with the gravity of ideological extremism even where no direct victimisation has occurred. The principle was further articulated in R v. Ismail [2021] EWCA Crim 982 where extended sentences were justified to disrupt not only planned acts but also the defendant’s capacity for ideological transmission. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. In the course of forensic examination, a substantial volume of encrypted archives was recovered, some labelled for innocuous purposes but hiding files containing manuals on improvised explosive devices and tactical movement. The technical complexity of conducting forensic decryption underlines one of the operative difficulties police forces face in counter-terrorism: the balance between respecting privacy rights and the imperative to disrupt potential acts of harm. Among such files were metadata logs indicating attempts at remote access to online forums known for incitement and extremist networking. For the avoidance of doubt, this court recognizes that possession of such materials per se is not indictable absent evidence of intent and action. However, in this case, the proliferation of digital footprints in conjunction with observed behaviour supports the prosecution’s case. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The defendant’s exploration of drone technology and amateur rocketry, while unsurprising in a citizen with background interests in engineering and hobbyist electronics, takes on a more menacing aspect when contextualized alongside encrypted communication threads discussing radical grievance narratives. While such hobbies themselves are neutral, their intersection with the materials and contacts in question contributes to a recognised pattern of conduct consistent with preparatory acts for terrorism. It is to be noted that cannabis residue was detected on the defendant's clothing during his arrest, as reported in the custody record, an element which the defence sought to rely upon as evidence of “ordinary youthful experimentation.” The court does not see that as mitigating given the overall seriousness of the charges, nor does it detract from the central factual matrix at hand. The court also references, although tangentially, the unrelated case of R v. Walton [2018] EWCA Crim 1700, which dealt with juvenile arson offences causing extensive property destruction but is instructive in demonstrating judicial approaches to culpability and rehabilitation potential in serious offences broadly speaking. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. The court acknowledges the testimony of a probation officer who detailed the extensive pressures now upon supervision services due to workforce shortages exacerbated by pandemic-era strains and high caseloads. Mr H’s eventual supervision post-sentence would, the officer opined, require enhanced oversight protocols, incorporating electronic monitoring and participation in cognitive-behavioural programmes. Additional letters tendered on behalf of the defence, including those from a local not-for-profit science education initiative and a mosque community leader, attest to Mr H’s sporadic positive social interactions and some degree of community involvement prior to his radicalisation trajectory. While these letters speak to qualities such as kindness and reliability in limited contexts, the court remains mindful that they do not diminish the substantial risks posed by his offending in this case. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A cryptocurrency transaction of £3,100 traced from an anonymous wallet linked by blockchain analysis to Mr H’s known identifiers was routed through a series of tumblers designed to obscure origin, ending in a purchase from an outfit advertising dual-use chemicals. This is notable within the evidential landscape because of the increasing tendency for illicit actors to employ such obfuscation techniques, which present challenges to law enforcement efforts and raise complex issues of jurisdiction and evidence gathering. Whilst the defence contends that these transactions were merely experiments in digital currency with no illicit aim, the court is satisfied by the prosecution’s submissions that such an explanation strains credulity when considered alongside the breadth of the investigation. It should also be recorded, albeit removed from the defendant’s personal case, that a co-defendant, whose trial proceeded separately, was convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent following a public disturbance in Bristol city centre. Their conduct involved the use of a pool cue in an affray outside a licensed premises, a fact of no legal relevance to Mr H but herein noted to frame the complex multi-defendant procedural matrix. The court further notes that a neighbour of Mr H’s, whose tenancy was subject to an unrelated noise abatement notice for loud music, provided an unsolicited statement describing the quietness of the defendant’s household. This illustrates the often contradictory nature of social character evidence in such proceedings. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is 30 years of age, holds a BEng in Electronic Engineering from a recognized university, and had been employed until mid-2023 as a technical analyst for a small software firm specialising in data visualisation for civil infrastructure projects. His employer provided a character reference noting punctuality and diligence but concerned himself with Mr H’s “growing disengagement” from workplace social events preceding his departure. Letters of support from the local horticultural society commend his voluntary contributions to community allotments. However, this court is obliged to observe that such factors, commendable though they may be in their own right, are very limited in offsetting offences of this gravity. The duality of conduct in public and private spheres is a well-recognised phenomenon in criminal justice and does not per se signify diminished culpability. Expert psychological assessment commissioned for sentencing purposes was undertaken by Dr Julia Benton, clinical forensic psychologist. Her report describes Mr H as displaying “rigid cognitive patterns, difficulty with emotional empathy, and a marked tendency towards black-and-white thinking in ideological matters.” Diagnostically, no major psychiatric disorder was identified; however, the risk assessment placed him in a high-category for potential further extremist behaviour absent intensive intervention. The proliferation of trauma-informed practice in the Probation Service, while advancing rehabilitation aims, does not diminish the necessity for sentences that reflect the seriousness of offences and the protection of the public. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Mr H’s case is, regrettably, emblematic of the growing challenges in confronting lone-actor radicalisation amplified by the anonymity afforded by digital platforms. It involves a sophisticated blending of ideologically motivated research, procurement planning, and technical skill which together constitute a significant risk of real harm. The aggravating features include the deliberate planning of indiscriminate harm, use of encrypted communications, attempts at procurement of dual-use chemicals, and persistence despite interventions by statutory Prevent and Channel programmes. Mitigation is confined to the absence of previous convictions, partial engagement with intervention schemes, and a late but unequivocal guilty plea entered on 17 July 2025, less than one month before the scheduled trial date. The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared by the National Probation Service. In particular, that report address the feasibility and appropriateness of an Extended Determinate Sentence with appropriate licence conditions, the potential for High-Intensity Mental Health and Cognitive Interventions, electronic monitoring including GPS tracking, and post-release management incorporating multi-agency oversight. The report should also consider available resources within approved premises designed for terrorism offenders, as well as the possibility of mandated participation in Structured Professional Judgment programmes tailored to ideological deradicalisation. Finally, this court records its gratitude to the officers and professionals involved in the preparation and presentation of this case, whose diligence in the face of constrained resources and growing workloads has been exemplary. Equally, thanks are due to Mr H’s counsel, instructed under a Legal Aid certificate whose expeditious work during a difficult period was notable. These sentencing remarks are issued this 4th day of September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved.
