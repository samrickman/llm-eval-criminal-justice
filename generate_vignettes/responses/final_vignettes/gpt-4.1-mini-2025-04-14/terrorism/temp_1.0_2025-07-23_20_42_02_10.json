Mr H Case No. B2025/24789 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. PIERSON Filed: 4 September 2025 Mr Mr H stands before this court for sentence following convictions on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The criminal conduct with which Mr H is charged spanned from May 2023 to his arrest on 12 February 2025. The defendant was apprehended following a carefully coordinated operation by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), whose investigators executed a search warrant at a residential address in Redcliffe earlier that morning. The warrant was issued on the grounds of section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. This court acknowledges the particularly sensitive nature of such operations, which often require a delicate balance between effective law enforcement and respect for civil liberties. The scarce availability of specialist resources and the intricate legal framework governing such searches means that officers typically invest months, if not years, in building a lawful basis for intervention. The complexity of the evidence in terrorism cases is often compounded by advanced technological obfuscation. Forensic analysis here included attempts to recover deleted encrypted files and decrypt anonymised communication channels, tasks which are both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Operational staff at the National Cyber Investigations Unit reported delays attributable to both technical complexity and the high volume of cases involving similar techniques nationwide at the time. This proliferation of encrypted interfaces, within virtually every layer of internet communication, marks a significant challenge for law enforcement, demanding frequent innovation in surveillance capabilities, digital forensic software, and interagency cooperation. It is appropriate to register, as an incidental observation, that legal aid provisions on digital forensic expertise remain frustratingly inadequate. Although in principle the 2018 Digital Defence Scheme aims to ensure parity for defendants in cases reliant on cutting-edge technology, in practice the scheme’s budget and capacity lag behind demand. The defence team in this case submitted multiple requests for additional funding to instruct external cyber forensic specialists, a process which, notwithstanding eventual authorisation, caused procedural delays with associated costs to all parties. Mr H’s case attracted interest not only from local policing agencies but also from national counter-terrorism coordination bodies, reflecting the serious security concerns underpinning the offence. In accordance with established national policy, the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) were engaged contemporaneously, although the classification of this case within Category 3 meant that the coordinating responsibilities skewed heavily toward intelligence-led containment rather than active supervision. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This court notes, with regret, the ongoing challenge caused by the increasing volume of multi-jurisdictional investigations touching on terrorism. Disparate agency mandates, variable data-sharing protocols, and the unwillingness of some international partners to engage fully in counter-terrorism exchange can impose frustrating obstacles. This case was no exception; attempts to obtain relevant information from foreign law enforcement took longer than anticipated, and this impacted the scheduling of various preliminary hearings. The defendant was initially remanded in custody following his arrest but was subsequently granted conditional bail pending the first substantive hearing. The conditions included electronic monitoring and curfew, reflecting the significant level of risk associated with the allegations. Despite this, the Crown prosecution policy emphasises that bail decisions must balance public protection with the statutory presumption against unnecessary pre-trial detention, a principle the court takes seriously. The chronology of this prosecution includes multiple plea and trial preparation hearings, over which time the defence consistently maintained a not guilty plea to all counts until a not insignificant confession was entered on the morning of the trial, significantly limiting the availability of credit for the plea. The court is mindful of the enumerated case law on the subject, including R v. Pryce [2023] EWCA Crim 2047 and R v. Calder [2022] EWCA Crim 1898, which clarify the distinction between early and late pleas in the context of sentencing mitigation. The former case, for example, highlighted the utility of an early acknowledgment of guilt in avoiding trial preparations and sparing witnesses, a benefit markedly absent here. It is an unfortunate and increasingly familiar feature of the criminal justice landscape that defendants involved in terrorism-related prosecutions persist in denying culpability until there is no realistic prospect of acquittal. This may be motivated by misguided hope of acquittal, plans to prolong proceedings, or other tactical advantages, but the costs are immense. There is the human cost to witnesses and victims forced into protracted legal stress, the burden on taxpayers absorbing the consequences of prolonged trial management, and the delay in resolution itself which can have wider community impacts. The court consequently treats such delays with appropriate severity when considering any reduction in sentence. Furthermore, it is this very court’s experience that defendants invoking assertions of political motive or ideological defence in these matters often seek to obfuscate or minimise the seriousness of their conduct. Here, as in R v. Sharif [2024] EWCA Crim 451, the court must look past grandiose justifications and focus on concrete evidence of intent and capacity to cause harm. Pre-sentence reports tendered in this case reflect a complex and troubling psychological profile, as will be set out in due course. The forensic psychology services supporting this court have reiterated the significant challenge posed by individuals exhibiting entrenched extremist worldviews coupled with characteristic cognitive rigidity and emotional dysregulation. It is well recognised that the presence of such features may reduce engagement and success rates with conventional rehabilitative programmes. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Regarding the evidence behind the charges, expert testimony highlighted that the defendant maintained an array of online accounts under pseudonyms which collectively disseminated inflammatory material. The analysis of these accounts indicates the presence of explicit calls for acts to further ideological objectives proscribed by statute. Accompanying this were encrypted messaging transcripts containing detailed discussions about the sourcing and assembling of dual-use materials capable of causing mass harm. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. At trial, digital forensic specialists confirmed the presence of encrypted volumes stored on multiple devices seized from the defendant’s residence. These contained extensive technical manuals and video demonstrations on the manufacture of explosive devices, alongside encrypted communications with known facilitators. The degree of technical savvy involved, particularly the use of steganography for hiding files and active effort to destroy digital traces, was emblematic of high-level operational security awareness. The court is aware from precedent, including R v. Uddin [2023] EWCA Crim 1622, that possession of such detailed preparatory materials, coupled with manifest intent as demonstrated by communications and steps towards procurement, constitute conduct deserving of custodial sentences of considerable length. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The defence contended that certain activities, such as collection of chemical precursors and attendance at training events, were innocuous or related to legitimate hobbies or professional interests. These assertions were considered but ultimately rejected by the jury in light of the compelling contextual evidence and the totality of intention demonstrated. In particular, the fact that some materials were stored in concealed formats and access restricted to encrypted channels was a significant pointer away from any innocent explanation. Of peripheral, yet tangential, note is the recovery by police at the defendant’s residence of small quantities of cannabis seeds and various herbal supplements. No charge was pursued in relation to these findings. Whilst the defence suggested this indicated a pattern of “exploratory but non-violent” lifestyle choices, the court does not accord this materially any weight in mitigation or aggravation. It is also recorded that at a prior occasion, some years before the index offence, the defendant was issued a fixed penalty notice for failure to display a valid road tax disc. This fact was canvassed during trial but has no bearing on the present charges. The principles underpinning sentencing in terrorism cases are well-established, with deterrence, denunciation, and protection of the public paramount. The Terrorism Act 2006 expressly contemplates custody for life where justified. The Sentencing Council's 2023 Guidelines stipulate that the court must assess culpability across a variety of factors, including the sophistication and planning reflected in the conduct, association with extremist groups, and intent to harm civilians. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The Crown presented evidence of the defendant’s attendance at international conferences, purportedly under the guise of academic interest, but which in reality served as hubs for radical networking. Of particular concern was a trip made to Berlin in October 2024, where surveillance footage showed Mr H's interactions with individuals later implicated in weapons acquisition. This material, though circumstantial, was buttressed by intercepted telephone records which mapped ongoing communications during the travel period. Delays in the trial timetable were occasioned by the voluminous disclosure schedule. The disclosure schedule involved some 800 exhibits, including material heavily redacted on national security grounds. Extensive judicial management was necessary to ensure compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules on disclosure, which often require balance between fairness and public protection. Notably, the case suffered an adjournment owing to a strike affecting forensic specialists at the National Branch of the Crown Prosecution Service, an industrial action which impacted several high-profile trials during Summer 2025. The court endorsed the prosecution’s request for adjournment in these circumstances. The court commends, however, the prompt and professional handling of evidential analysis by the Forensic Science Service, which, despite significant resource pressures and turnover in staff, delivered timely expert reports critical to the prosecution case. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial tracking of transactions uncovered a transfer of £3,400 worth of cryptocurrencies from an account associated with the defendant’s encrypted email handle to wallets connected to suppliers of dual-use chemical precursors. The forensic accountancy team involved emphasised the emerging trend of criminal use of privacy-enhancing tools like coin mixers, tumblers, and decentralised exchange platforms to defeat oversight—a challenge the criminal justice system globally is grappling with. The court acknowledges the submissions from defence counsel regarding the practical difficulties faced by the defendant in interacting with public services without a fixed address or reliable communication channels. Letters from the Bristol Homeless Outreach Network document intermittent engagement and underscore systemic failures in providing stable accommodation to vulnerable populations. Such social welfare concerns, although pressing, do not mitigate criminal responsibility. The public cost of such investigations and prosecutions cannot be overstated. The court places on record the considerable strain on police counter-terrorism units, forensic science laboratories, and digital analysis teams occasioned by complex cases such as this. The necessity of these resources both underscores the seriousness attributed to the defendant’s conduct and the broader public interest in effective criminal justice response. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Personal mitigation material submitted reflects a somewhat disjointed history of the defendant. Mr H is 31 years of age, holds a degree in electrical engineering, and until recently was employed in the renewable energy sector. Letters from colleagues depict him as competent but socially reserved, with recent managerial comments noting episodes of unreliability, possibly stress-related. Of interest, a supervisor mentions an incident in February 2023 involving unauthorised use of workplace software to access encrypted messaging platforms. The defendant’s mother has provided a written statement describing periods of social withdrawal and struggle with isolation following the death of his father, though no formal diagnosis of mental illness was recorded. The court has received a psychiatric report from Dr Helen Kavanagh, who conducted interviews and psychological testing. Dr Kavanagh’s report is thorough and professional, carefully evaluating the defendant’s mental state and concluding that, while no major axis I disorder was present, traits consistent with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and high cognitive rigidity were observed. The probation service, in its preliminary assessment, expresses concern regarding Mr H’s apparent lack of insight and his high risk of re-engagement with extremist ideology absent intensive intervention. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The complexity of managing risks associated with radicalisation and terrorism necessitates close multi-agency collaboration. The court acknowledges the contributions of several organisations engaged in the defendant’s case. The South West Prevent Coordinating Unit provided detailed submissions outlining their interventions and risk assessments spanning 18 months prior to arrest. These interventions were met with mixed engagement, including outright rejection of some offers for cognitive behavioural therapy targeted at grievance ideology. The North Avon Resettlement Trust, specializing in reintegration of individuals released on licence after terrorism offences, submitted reports expressing cautious optimism about Mr H’s potential responsiveness to structured support, balanced with frank appraisals of the high rate of recidivism in this cohort. The court also received correspondence from the Bristol City Council Housing Department, referring to the increasing difficulties faced in housing vulnerable individuals within an already stretched and over-capacity social housing system. Rising homelessness, exacerbated by economic instability and limited affordable housing, creates an environment where targeted supervision and support become progressively harder. This case took place within the historical confines of the Bristol Crown Court building, a venue operating continuously since its establishment in 1888, undergoing renovations that include a recent refurbishment of courtrooms 2 and 5, which enhanced technological capabilities including digital evidence presentation—a significant advancement facilitating effective case management in complex trials such as this. The court thanks Mr Alexander McCormick QC for his skilled advocacy on behalf of the Crown, as well as Mr Tomas Weller of Counsel for the defence, whose submissions were measured and professionally presented despite the challenges of the case. Appreciation is also extended to the court staff, usher team, and the legal clerks, all of whom ensured the smooth progression of this hearing amidst competing demands. It is noted that the defendant elected to give evidence part way through the trial, an occurrence that necessarily influenced the tenor of the defence’s closing submissions. While this choice invariably engages questions of risk and credibility, it remains a right preserved within the common law tradition. The case record includes mention of a co-defendant initially charged in connection with related offences, who absconded prior to trial and remains at large. This circumstance did not materially impact the trial against Mr H, though it did complicate investigative efforts. Equally, mention must be made of an unrelated prosecution ongoing against the defendant’s former roommate, charged with possession of cannabis following a separate police search. No evidence suggests any collusion or shared involvement. The defendant’s estranged partner, who provided an affidavit attesting to his recent behavioural changes, is herself subject to an ongoing police investigation for allegations unrelated to this matter. In final consideration, the court takes into account the legal principles set out in the Decisions of the Court of Appeal in recent terrorism cases and the relevant passages from the Sentencing Council’s guidelines. The paramountcy of public protection, the imperative for deterrence, the need for denunciation of the offending conduct, and the legitimate aim of rehabilitation must be balanced. The defendant’s culpability, as incontrovertibly established, places him within the highest bracket. A pre-sentence report has been requested to address the specifics of risk management, licence conditions, and the potential for intervention programmes tailored to ideological deradicalisation. Given Mr H’s known profile, the possibility of an extended custodial term subject to careful supervisory mechanisms upon release is anticipated. This court is under no illusion as to the challenges posed by the defendant’s case, nor the resource implications for all agencies involved in managing the residual risk after sentence. The involvement of specialist psychologists, probation experts, and housing officers will remain critical to achieving public safety and offender management. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 4 September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and forthcoming sentence will be communicated to the appropriate agencies for registration and ongoing management.
