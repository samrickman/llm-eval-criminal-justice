Mr H Case No. B2025/30451 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. N. CARMICHAEL Filed: 15 October 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence convicted on two counts: first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and second, possessing an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conducts occurred over a protracted period from September 2022 until his arrest in April 2025. The defendant was taken into custody at approximately 04:45 hours on 18 April 2025 following the execution of a search warrant at his residence on Langley Road, Handsworth. The warrant was granted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, grounded on intelligence from the Security Service indicating Mr H's involvement with an encrypted network known for distributing extremist publications and materials. Seized as part of the operation were multiple electronic devices including a tower PC, assorted USB drives, and encrypted mobile telephony equipment. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation leading to arrest was lengthy and resource-intensive. Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) engaged in a concerted multi-agency operation, leveraging not only technical surveillance assets but also human intelligence sources cultivated over eighteen months. The use of mobile phone extraction software, combined with decryption efforts on multiple messaging applications, formed a salient aspect of the evidential build. The court notes, parenthetically, that the unprecedented demand on the digital forensics units across the country has significantly extended processing times; such delay not only impedes swift case progression but burdens analytical teams operating on stretched rosters. Procedural challenges were encountered during pre-trial stages, including a protracted disclosure timeline necessitated by voluminous evidence and classified material with restricted access. There were two adjournments at the behest of the defence, the latter supported by a Legal Aid Agency request for increased funding to instruct an independent expert on cyber security protocols. The court is aware of persistent systemic issues within the Legal Aid framework, which often constrains the ability of defendants to secure adequate investigatory or expert support in complex terrorism proceedings, a matter warranting broader governmental attention but beyond the remit of this court. A “Channel” intervention referral had been lodged in late 2019 by a member of staff at the local vocational college after Mr H submitted a project paper quoting extensively from known radical manifestos without critical contextual analysis. That referral, however, did not progress beyond initial engagement as Mr H declined sustained intervention, and no further indicators of active radicalisation were apparent to the Prevent coordinators at that time. The court acknowledges the challenging balance Channel panels must strike between early intervention and respecting individual autonomy. At a plea and case management hearing on 10 August 2025, Mr H entered a not guilty plea. The trial was listed to commence on 20 November 2025. However, during the morning of the trial commencement, he elected to enter guilty pleas to both counts. Counsel for the defence solicited a tempered degree of credit for the plea, characterising it as a recognition of responsibility and an effort to spare witnesses the ordeal of trial. The Crown resisted any more than moderate reduction citing the very late timing of the admission. It is important to restate the jurisprudential position on plea credit in terrorism cases. The Court of Appeal in R v. Walcott [2023] EWCA Crim 1589 underscored that credit for guilty pleas should ideally be granted where the plea is early, genuine, and materially assists in conserving court resources or sparing witness distress. Late pleas entered at or near trial, particularly following extensive preparatory hearings and evidential disclosures, typically warrant lesser discounts. The rationale lies in encouraging timely admissions and maintaining procedural economy amid resource-intensive proceedings. The present case squarely fits within the latter description. Illustrative of the principles, the judgment in R v. Stamford [2022] EWCA Crim 1745 involving prolonged denials in a grievous bodily harm case affirmed a mere 10% discount where the plea was entered just before trial, despite compelling evidence. While the context differs in offence type, the reasoning on plea timing and credit remains pertinent. The court is mindful that this approach, while seemingly inflexible, serves broader public interests in efficient justice administration. Equally relevant is the well-established sentencing framework under the Terrorism Act with attendant guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council in 2023. The court’s evaluative matrix comprises culpability, risk, and harm potential, with those committing preparatory acts often attracted to long determinate sentences reflective of public protection priorities and deterrence. Case authorities such as R v. Javed [2017] EWCA Crim 1210 and R v. Patel [2019] EWCA Crim 2241 remain instructive in sentencing proportionality, especially where advanced planning and procurement of materials are attested. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. In delineating the context of the defendant’s activities, the court must acknowledge the substantial body of digital material recovered, including encrypted archives containing detailed manuals on improvised explosive devices, alongside correspondence revealing communications with known extremist content propagators situated abroad. Linguistic forensic examination identified coded messaging consistent with contemporaneous terrorist narratives disseminated via closed online forums. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic technology played an indispensable role in this prosecution, with teams utilising cutting-edge software under license agreements permitting deobfuscation of anonymised traffic routing nodes on the Tor network, an operation not without challenge, as demonstrated by the necessity to overcome time-delay circuits incorporated to hinder passive surveillance. This technical prologue extends well beyond the immediate remit of the court but merits remark insofar as it exposes the sophistication of criminal enterprises and the requisite response by national security agencies, which must constantly innovate to keep pace. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. It warrants mention, though without direct relevance to culpability or sentence, that during searches ancillary to the terrorism investigation, officers uncovered an extensive cache of recreational fishing equipment, including rods, nets, and bait. Defence appearances have at times sought to highlight these as indicators of Mr H’s capacity for mundane, non-criminal pursuits — a fact that holds little legal consequence but perhaps adds nuance to his personal profile. The court is also in receipt of several testimonial letters from local community organisations, including the Handsworth Civic Trust and the Birmingham Volunteer Association. These laud Mr H's commitment to urban environmental clean-ups and note his involvement in a community allotment scheme. While such activities may be commendable, they do not abrogate the serious breach constituted by his engagement in pro-terrorism conduct. The court’s approach must remain firmly anchored in legal principle and safeguarding public safety. Co-defendants in related operations continue to be subject to distinct proceedings. It is noted that one co-defendant was remanded at large following a failed extradition request owing to citizenship complexities. Another face charges unrelated to this matter, including affray connected to a local militia dispute. These matters have no bearing on Mr H's case, notwithstanding allegations at trial that the group shared overlapping networks. The court’s notes also record that the defendant has no previous convictions, a fact that modestly mitigates, but without offsetting the gravity of the present offences. Mr H is 30 years of age, single, and employed sporadically prior to arrest as a laboratory technician in a manufacturing plant. His educational record includes a Higher National Diploma in electronic engineering. Employment references offered in evidence describe a capable and punctual work ethic, though punctuated by periods of absenteeism in 2023. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. Of potential interest, though again peripheral to sentencing, were travel records indicating a brief transitory presence in Brussels during the summer of 2023, attending what was variously described as a conference on renewable energies. Surveillance logs also show suspect activity during late evenings at a riverbank nearby, though subsequent inquiries attributed these movements to amateur drumming circles and night photography hobbyists. The blurred lines between lawful subcultural pastimes and suspect behaviour remain a challenge to investigators and the judiciary alike. In a sign of the procedural magnitude of such cases, the disclosure schedule extended to over 600 documents and terabytes of data. The court acknowledges with regret the burdens such voluminous material imposes on all parties and the attendant risk of delay. That the prosecution and defence teams nonetheless maintained judicious case management is to be commended and worth formal recognition. The expert psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Simone Zalewski, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Midlands Secure Treatment Centre, provides a comprehensive psychological profiling of Mr H. The report diagnoses no formal psychiatric disorder but notes pronounced cognitive rigidity and a marked tendency toward absolutist, black-and-white moral reasoning. The risk of further engagement in ideologically motivated violence is assessed as substantial without intensive community management. The report outlines the prospect of engagement with deradicalisation programmes, though it cautions against optimistic projections given historically low completion rates. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations traced significant cryptocurrency transactions believed to be linked to the defendant. A sum of approximately £3,800 was transferred via a series of currency mixers from wallets associated with Mr H’s known aliases to vendors operating in jurisdictions known for lax oversight of dual-use chemical sales. While the validity of these transactions as funding for proscribed activities remains a question of probability within the case, the court notes their existence as underlining a proactive attempt at obfuscation characteristic of those intent on illicit procurement. Counter Terrorism Policing also submitted voluminous covert surveillance material, including footage of Mr H frequenting a disused industrial estate during night hours in late 2024. This viewing required extensive post-processing to stabilise images and confirm identity across overlapping camera angles, an operation taxing in both personnel hours and technological resources. Such detailed surveillance efforts exemplify the asymmetry faced by law enforcement: significant investment is required to detect fleeting preparatory acts that may culminate in mass harm. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. On the matter of the defendant’s personal circumstances, mention must be made of letters submitted from his immediate family members. His mother describes Mr H as having been a “quiet, introspective child,” and notes attendance difficulties during adolescence linked to undiagnosed dyslexia. The court cannot underestimate the potentially traumatic effects of learning challenges absent appropriate educational support, yet is equally aware that these considerations must be balanced against the defendant’s autonomous choices in adulthood. His social history includes periods of homelessness in 2021, documented in correspondence from two local homeless shelters. These reports underscore the interface between social vulnerability and radicalising influences, a nexus increasingly recognised within Prevent strategy frameworks. Nonetheless, the trajectory from disadvantage to culpability is not deterministic; many exposed to harsh socioeconomic conditions do not contravene the law. Of supplementary interest is the observation that the Probation Service in the West Midlands continues to face chronic staffing shortages, resulting in elevated caseloads and protracted waiting lists for offender rehabilitation programmes. This unfortunate reality inevitably affects service provision to those like Mr H, for whom structured intervention is critical to risk management and desistance. The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Professor Gareth Milton, consulting forensic psychologist instructed by the defence, concurred generally with Dr Zalewski’s assessment but opined that Mr H’s ideological fixation might be amenable to cognitive restructuring through sustained engagement with the Deradicalisation and Disengagement Initiative (DDI). The court notes, however, the limited availability and capacity of such specialist programmes nationally, and the complexity of successful reintegration where entrenched extremist beliefs are present. This case exemplifies the necessity of calibrated sentencing that balances retributive and preventative objectives. Mr H’s actions reveal a high degree of planning and commitment, an exploitation of technology to circumvent detection, and an intent to precipitate indiscriminate harm. Such conduct falls within the highest culpability tier envisaged by the Sentencing Council. Aggravating features include the deliberate selection of vulnerable public sites as potential targets and the timing of planning activities to coincide symbolically with prior terrorist incidents. Mitigating factors are scarce, principally Mr H’s lack of prior convictions, his educational achievements, and the belated guilty pleas, entered only after comprehensive disclosure and on the very cusp of trial. Given the lateness, the court attributes a credit of approximately one-sixth of sentence length. The court directs that a pre-sentence report be compiled with particular emphasis on risk assessment, availability of deradicalisation programmes, and suitable custodial or community placements that afford intensive supervision and psychological input. Extended supervision upon release, including electronic monitoring and restricted internet access, should be contemplated as conditions essential to continued public protection.
