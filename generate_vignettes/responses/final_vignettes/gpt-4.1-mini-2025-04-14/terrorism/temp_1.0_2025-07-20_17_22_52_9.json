Mr H Case No. B2025/19832 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge A. G. FENTON Filed: 4 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges recorded under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006—namely, engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism—and an associated count under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 relating to possession of articles for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The offending conduct spans the period from March 2023 up to his arrest in January 2025. The defendant was apprehended at his residence in Easton on 15 January 2025 following the execution of a warrant granted pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. Counter Terrorism Policing South West, assisted by forensic computer experts from the National Cyber Crime Unit, were involved in this operation. At the time of arrest, Mr H was found to be in possession of digital devices including encrypted smartphones and unidentified storage media, alongside various mechanical components and printed materials. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This charge does not emerge in isolation but rather in a context involving a carefully coordinated multi-agency investigative operation codified under the rubric “Operation STEELHEDGE.” The operation entailed prolonged surveillance involving analysis of internet traffic, encrypted communication networks, and intelligence-sharing between MI5, local Counter Terrorism Units, and the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The gathering and collation of electronic evidence was, by the court’s admission, a technically demanding task characterized by significant complexity arising from contemporaneous use of anonymity protocols and layered encryption techniques. It bears notice that the pace of forensic examination outstripped, in temporal terms, the average processing times for sealed communication devices, with experts reporting a considerable tail-off in resource availability nationally. Correspondence disclosed at trial revealed that National Cyber Crime Unit staff were obliged to triage an ever-increasing backlog, a problem exacerbated by funding constraints and expanded remits in counter-terrorism priorities. On the matter of the defendant’s bail status, it must be noted that Mr H was remanded in custody following his first hearing on 16 January 2025 owing to concerns over potential flight risk and the serious nature of the charges. Subsequent applications to vary this status were denied upon full consideration of the risk assessments prepared by probation officers and reports from the prison in-reach mental health services. It is also germane to record that a “Channel” referral was submitted regarding the defendant in late 2020. This arose from an incident at a vocational training centre, where Mr H reportedly made statements considered indicative of emerging extremist sympathies. Following review by the local Prevent team, the referral was closed after an initial engagement phase, primarily due to the insufficiency of corroborated evidence. The court registers this historical context but does not weigh it unduly given the comprehensive evidence amassed through the investigative process. The matter was initially listed for a provisional trial date of 22 September 2025 but, due to the introduction of voluminous new material by the prosecution, including intercepted communications and forensic analysis, a trial preparation hearing was convened on 8 July 2025. At that juncture, Mr H maintained not guilty pleas. It was only in the early morning of 2 October 2025 that he entered guilty pleas on both counts. The court notes that such a plea, coming so proximate to the date of trial, allows for only modest mitigation in sentencing credit. The jurisprudence is instructive on this point. The principles governing credit for early guilty pleas were recently elucidated in R v. Gelston [2024] EWCA Crim 1762, where it was affirmed that credit is a concession, not a right, and the timing and motivation underlying the plea is of paramount importance. Late pleas entered only when the evidential case is overwhelming do little to ameliorate the consequences or to spare the court and witnesses significant expenditure of time and distress. Two further leading cases reinforce this principle. R v. Bramwell [2023] EWCA Crim 908 involved a defendant who maintained denial throughout protracted pre-trial hearings but entered a plea on the first day of trial for conspiracy to distribute class A drugs. Credit was held appropriately reduced because the plea came after full disclosure and preparation of expert evidence, a scenario bearing resemblance to the instant case. Similarly, R v. Forsyth [2022] EWCA Crim 1345 reasserted that tactical pleas, notably those entered to avoid the rigour of contested proceedings, do not warrant generous reductions. It must be noted that the maximum custodial sentence for an offence under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 is life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (updated 2023) directs courts to assess culpability and harm by reference to factors including motivation, conduct, sophistication, logistics and the degree of threat posed to life or limb. Case law germane to the issue of sentencing terrorism-related conduct includes R v. Abdul Karim [2019] EWCA Crim 1483, in which a life sentence was upheld for preparation of an attack involving improvised explosive devices; and R v. Siddiqui [2021] EWCA Crim 2129, emphasizing the need for deterrence in sentences reflecting ideological commitment. Mr H planned to build and leave a device in a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, just east of Cornbrook station, scheduled to detonate at 3pm as Leeds supporters passed in dense footfall, exploiting CCTV blind spots. The evidence adduced during trial revealed that Mr H’s online presence was marked by an evolution from initially detached commentary to active propagation of extremist material. Analysis of a blog maintained over several years shows that themes of disaffection and violent retaliatory narratives increasingly supplanted prior engagement with apolitical technological discussion. Contrasted with the defence submission that Mr H’s blogging was a form of “venting” or political dissent, expert linguistic analysis presented on behalf of the Crown found clear markers indicative of radicalisation consistent with discourse promulgated by a designated proscribed organisation. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. During forensic examination of seized devices, investigators uncovered multiple encrypted containers the defendant had named in ambiguous terms. One such container consisted of a series of files labelled “DIY_Munitions,” including technical blueprints for explosive devices and instructions for assembly. Defence counsel suggested these materials might be innocuous hobbyist experiments or tied to participation in amateur rocketry societies, but the court is satisfied, considering the timing and context, that such claims were, at best, optimistic. The court recalls the observations in R v. Mantle [2020] EWCA Crim 899, where similar “hobbyist” explanations were rejected as implausible in light of corroborative intelligence and manifest intention. That case further underscored that the possession of detailed tactical instructions, when accompanied by preparatory activity, justifies sentencing at the upper scale of culpability. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The court noted with some peripheral interest submissions concerning Mr H’s personal hobbies, including his involvement with a local model railway club and a short-lived tenure as a volunteer at the Bristol City History Museum. While such details provide texture to character assessment, they do not temper the gravity of the conduct for which he now stands convicted. There was also mention in mitigation of an alleged prior fixed penalty for riding a bicycle on a footpath in 2017, alongside a parking contravention ticket from 2019. While both constitute breaches of regulatory standards, neither bears relevance to the present matters of security and public safety. The court takes no account of these infractions beyond noting their existence. The Crown references several previous authorities relating to public safety and repeated breaches which, although not involving terrorism, instruct the court on the broader issue of managing public risk. For example, R v. Lowry [2018] EWCA Crim 1104, a conviction for serial fly-tipping causing environmental harm, demonstrates the cumulative aggravation derived from continued wilful disregard for legal duty. By analogy, the defendant’s sustained efforts to circumvent lawful oversight through encrypted communications augments culpability. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. The court heard evidence concerning a foreign travel itinerary undertaken by Mr H in summer 2024. Official records show he travelled to multiple locations within mainland Europe, including time spent near the contentious border regions where extremist sympathisers have been known to congregate. Surveillance footage, reviewed by witness officers from the NCA, revealed meetings with individuals subsequently identified as facilitators in transnational extremist circles. Notably, a connection was made with one such individual implicated in importation of precursor substances for explosives in a matter unrelated to the defendant but reflecting common trade routes. Various delays occasioned in this matter bear mention. Repeated adjournments at pre-trial hearings arose principally from outstanding Legal Aid authorisations. Defence counsel submitted multiple requests for extensions to funding to instruct expert witnesses, including digital forensic specialists and a consultant forensic psychologist. The Legal Aid Agency’s administrative delay was, on occasion, cited by the defence as prejudicial. The court observes that although the delays were frustrating for all, there was no evidence that they materially compromised the defendant’s rights or the overall fairness of proceedings. The probation service has experienced significant understaffing in this jurisdiction, contributing to delays in the preparation of pre-sentence reports for cases of this nature. Similarly, forensic psychiatric services have faced unprecedented caseloads, with a waiting list extending beyond 24 weeks for non-urgent assessments. These systemic pressures are relevant context but do not diminish the gravity of the defendant’s conduct or requisite sentence. The court acknowledges the tireless efforts of dedicated officers, civil servants, and forensic practitioners who persevere despite these operational challenges. Their commitment to public safety remains a bulwark against the multiple threats encountered daily. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial forensics conducted during the investigation uncovered transactions involving cryptocurrency valued at just over £4,000. One wallet linked to the defendant’s known digital identity was traced transmitting funds to an online marketplace associated with dual-use items capable of nefarious application. The court is acutely aware of the increasing use of such currencies within covert networks and the inherent challenges faced by enforcement agencies in identification and interdiction, as discussed in the Home Office report “Cryptocurrency and the Financing of Terrorism,” published in 2024. It is worth recalling that such financial trails, while often obscured by mixers and tumbling services, nevertheless offer critical evidentiary opportunities that can lead to the disruption of further preparatory acts. The law continues to evolve in this area, but the court emphasises that criminal exploitation of emerging finance technologies will attract commensurate punishment. In this connection, the court references the relevant dicta in R v. Chowdhury [2023] EWCA Crim 195, underscoring that technological sophistication can aggravate culpability by demonstrating concerted attempts to evade lawful detection. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old with an educational background in applied computer science awarded by a regional university. His former employer, a technology startup based in Bristol’s Temple Quay district, submitted a character reference describing him as “discreet, highly competent and dedicated.” However, it was noted that Mr H resigned unexpectedly six months before his arrest after a disagreement concerning the use of company resources. The court has also reviewed a collection of letters submitted on behalf of the defendant. These include a letter from a local men’s wellbeing charity praising his volunteer work in a COVID-19 community outreach scheme and a statement from a relative attesting to his positive family role. While such letters provide some insight into the defendant’s personality, naturally they cannot be read as exculpatory of the offences committed. It should be noted that the defendant’s engagement with mental health services has been intermittent. A report from Dr Samuel Perry, consultant forensic psychiatrist, states that Mr H suffers from no diagnosable mental disorder but demonstrates cognitive inflexibility and a marked tendency toward black-and-white thinking. The assessment flagged the high risk of reoffending absent effective intervention. The court acknowledges the therapeutic challenges inherent in de-radicalisation efforts, which often require prolonged, multi-modal engagement not always forthcoming or successful. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. Counsel on behalf of the defendant have proposed the possibility of engagement with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, highlighting its structured, cognitive-behavioural approach designed to address extremist beliefs. While the court encourages rehabilitation, it must emphasise that participation is a means to an end and not a substitute for appropriate custodial sentence reflecting the crime’s seriousness. The court further recognises submissions by community representatives expressing concern that over-severe sentencing may inadvertently alienate minority groups and engender grievances. Though such points merit respectful consideration when fashioning holistic approaches to justice, they cannot mitigate penalties where public safety is manifestly endangered. The offence before the court represents a grave breach of the social contract, particularly given the deliberate and systematic nature of the defendant’s conduct and the potential for collateral harm. Where an individual opts to harness technical expertise in service of destructive ends, unwavering standards must be maintained by the law. The defendant’s late plea, absence of prior convictions, educational attainment, and family support represent limited mitigation. In contrast, aggravating features include the duration of the preparatory conduct, sophistication of methods employed, and ideological commitment evident from the content of disseminated material. The court awaits the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, and directs the probation service to furnish detailed recommendations bearing on the feasibility of supervised release conditions involving electronic monitoring, residential curfew enforcement, and mandatory psychological interventions should the defendant be considered for early release. Consideration should also be given to exclusion orders relating to internet use and contact with known extremist associates. Finally, the court records its gratitude to counsel for their comprehensive submissions given the complexities involved, the court clerk and ushers whose professionalism ensured orderly proceedings, and the Security Service liaison officers who continue to provide critical support behind the scenes. The recently refurbished courtroom layout offered improved sightlines, enhancing the ability of all parties to engage fully in the process. This court will reserve determination of sentence until receipt of the pre-sentence report. These sentencing remarks are issued this 4th day of October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Formal records of conviction and sentencing will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities as required by law.
