Mr H Case No. B2025/29741 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. G. MONTGOMERY Filed: 2 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction by jury of offences contrary to sections 5(1)(a) and 57 of the Terrorism Act 2006 and the Terrorism Act 2000 respectively. The indictment comprises one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The conduct underlying these charges is said to have occurred between November 2023 and March 2025. Before addressing the substantive issues of sentencing, it is necessary to record the procedural history and outline the broader context in which these proceedings have been conducted. Mr H was arrested on 18 March 2025 following the culmination of a detailed operation coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, assisted by forensic experts from the National Cyber Crime Unit and local authorities including the Birmingham Metropolitan Police Service Cybercrime Unit. The investigation involved a combination of covert human intelligence, extensive electronic surveillance, and digital forensic analysis. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. In undertaking this lengthy investigation, public agencies deployed a range of surveillance tools requiring judicial oversight. The authorisation process under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 was properly observed, with warrants renewed at appropriate intervals. The judicial safeguards that underpin such intrusive measures reflect the gravity of the infringement on personal privacy and liberty they entail. Such efforts serve the broader interests of society but are also a reminder of the delicate balancing act courts and agencies must perform between security and civil liberties. It was noted during the pre-trial phase that Mr H’s case burdened the resources of multiple departments. The volume of digital material amassed, exceeding 2.3 terabytes, necessitated prioritisation of forensic review. The National Digital Exploitation Centre, whose specialist staff are tasked with the extraction and analysis of encrypted or corrupted data, faced a backlog exacerbated by the complex file structures Mr H had employed to conceal material. The unforeseen demands of such volume meant several hearing dates initially fixed had to be vacated, contributing to the delay and imposing strain on all involved. In the course of these arrangements, the court was made aware of another multi-defendant operation, code-named OPERATION BRICKFIELD, involving unrelated raids in the neighbouring Staffordshire region, which led to charges of aggravated burglary, possession of bladed articles, and assault on constables. While these charges do not pertain to Mr H, their parallel progression compounded administrative congestion in the court listing. The co-accused in that operation include one whose past convictions include racially aggravated criminal damage and others who have outstanding bench warrants. These matters, although distinct, serve as a tacit reminder of the breadth of criminal activity that courts must manage contemporaneously. At the initial plea and case management hearing, held on 3 June 2025, Mr H entered a not guilty plea. His defence team, led by Mr Julian Wallace of counsel appearing pursuant to Legal Aid Directive 54/2024, indicated a defence reliant upon contesting elements of intent and highlighting alleged breaches in investigative protocol, specifically relating to the accuracy of metadata extraction. These submissions were thoroughly canvassed in pre-trial hearings but ultimately rejected by the jury following exhaustive directions on the proper evaluation of digital evidence. The late entry of guilty pleas on the morning of trial was regrettably in line with a wider pattern of procedural behaviour encountered in terrorism prosecutions. Such timing invariably reduces the scope of any discount on sentence available to the defendant. The court is mindful, however, that these cases demand exhaustive procedural fairness in light of their complexity and the significant personal and societal consequences that flow from them. This principle is well articulated in the judgments of the Court of Appeal in R v. Malik [2021] EWCA Crim 587, which stressed the necessity for careful scrutiny of digital forensic processes where encrypted data is critical evidence. The inadvertent or deliberate manipulation of timestamps or loss of metadata can be fatal to the Crown’s case. Accordingly, rigorous testing of evidence and probity in its presentation underpin the legitimacy of any conviction. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The court has received extensive documentation from prosecuting counsel detailing the incremental radicalisation evidenced in Mr H’s online activity. His digital footprint—initially associated with discussion forums reflecting niche political commentary—escalated to the sharing of proscribed ideological texts and obscure encrypted communications with subjects abroad. This trajectory closely mirrors profiles considered in the seminal judgment in R v. Qureshi [2019] EWCA Crim 847, which recognised the dangers posed by seemingly solitary actors driven by self-referential extremist narratives. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. A detailed forensic report disclosed that Mr H had in his possession electronic files encrypted via VeraCrypt, labelled misleadingly with generic terms such as “HomeInventory” and “GardenLogs.” The decoding of these containers revealed material consistent with the manufacture and testing of low-yield incendiary devices. Much care was required to exclude the possibility of accidental possession or ignorance. The Crown successfully argued the absence of any innocent explanation in light of the compilation of detailed instructional manuals found alongside these files. The defendant’s defence submissions attempting to characterise the material as mere “experimental hobbyist research” were rejected by the jury, reflecting the rigorous approach to evidential sufficiency. It should be noted that the court received a character reference from Mr H’s former employer — a regional engineering consultancy firm specialising in bespoke instrumentation. The director described Mr H as “meticulous and technically gifted” but also alluded to his increasingly insular behaviour in the lead-up to his resignation. The resignation occurred abruptly in December 2023 following internal queries into the defendant’s online browsing history and repeated refusal to comply with enhanced security protocols for employees working on nationally sensitive projects. While such a departure might be framed as unfortunate personal difficulty, in this context it provides a piece in the mosaic of Mr H’s heightened grievance and isolation. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. An additional point borne out in the documentation concerns Mr H’s attempts to physically acquire limited dual-use chemical substances. Surveillance footage at a reputable chemical supplies outlet, where he presented as a “professional hobbyist,” was captured on multiple occasions. Notably, these purchases included items commonly repurposed as components in improvised explosive devices. Defence counsel submitted that these acquisitions formed part of a legitimate educational project in advanced chemistry, a proposition which the jury evidently found implausible given the surrounding context and the defendant’s clandestine communications with prohibited entities. The court deems it necessary to refer to an unrelated matter of local import that took place contemporaneously with Mr H’s investigation. In the nearby district of Solihull, a spree of low-level antisocial behaviour culminating in an assault occasioning actual bodily harm at a public festival was prosecuted. The accused in that case had been involved in gang-related disorder and had prior convictions for shoplifting. Although unrelated, this case highlights the heterogeneity of threats the criminal justice system grapples with — ranging from low-level aggravations to acts of ideological violence. It is a salutary reminder for the public and institutions alike that resources are finite, and serious terrorism investigations impose significant opportunity costs on law enforcement and judicial bodies. Probation services have signalled, through their reports, the ongoing difficulties faced in providing consistent supervision amid workforce shortages and mounting caseloads. The present case exemplifies these operational challenges and the need for continued investment and reform to retain skilled practitioners capable of delivering specialist risk assessments in matters involving ideological extremism. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. Attention has also been drawn to Mr H’s travel history during the relevant period. International flight records demonstrate a trip to Budapest in autumn 2024, ostensibly for cultural tourism. However, intelligence reports reveal meetings with individuals known to be linked to extremist networks operating across Central Europe. The Defence’s suggestion that the defendant attended exclusively architectural heritage events was undermined by intercepted encrypted communications referencing timed \"assemblies\" and expressions of ideological alignment uncommon to typical tourists. The court places weight on the contextual meaning of such travel alongside other evidence of planning and intent. Whilst on the subject of travel, the court notes occasional delays in witness availability caused by industrial action among airport and customs officials. These external events, while unrelated in substance, have had an indirect effect on scheduling and demonstrate the interconnectedness of seemingly discrete public service functions. The court acknowledges receipt of correspondence from the Birmingham Resettlement Partnership, expressing willingness to provide supervised accommodation and ongoing support to Mr H should release on licence ever be considered. Their commitment is laudable though recognised to be challenged by the specific ideological risks presented. A pragmatic assessment of the scope and limits of such voluntary sector involvement forms part of the pre-sentence planning process. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation revealed that Mr H had converted a sum of £3,120 from fiat currency into Bitcoin on a decentralised exchange platform in a pattern consistent with known terrorist financing models described in Home Office guidance. The funds traced through multiple “mixers” and “tumbling” services, complicating the recovery and audit trail. The court reiterates concerns expressed in R v. Sinclair [2024] EWCA Crim 1128 about the challenges posed by cryptocurrencies to law enforcement and the judiciary. Technological advances require commensurate legislative and operational responses to ensure the system keeps pace with methods designed to mask illicit activity. A further dimension of the investigation involved the slow, painstaking compilation of digital footprint analysis, syncing various logs to confirm Mr H’s whereabouts at key times. The resources allocated to this work are substantial, highlighting the asymmetry between the ease of committing infractions online and the labour-intensive processes required to detect and document them. Inter-agency coordination is acknowledged with gratitude for their dedication, particularly officers from the Cyber Terrorism Unit and officers seconded from the West Midlands Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Group, whose professionalism underpins public confidence in these proceedings. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The court has considered at length reports from mental health professionals involved in Mr H’s assessment. Dr Helen Forsythe, consultant forensic psychiatrist, entertains no diagnosis of major mental illness but notes significant traits of entrenched ideological rigidity and impaired cognitive flexibility. Her report warns that the defendant poses a continuing high risk of harm absent targeted intervention and ongoing supervision. Psychometric testing reveals a marked tendency towards black-and-white moral reasoning coupled with relative social isolation. Letters of support submitted on behalf of Mr H include a detailed statement from Ms Zoe Mallory, a volunteer mentor with the West Midlands Community Integration Project, who attests to intermittent engagement over the past eighteen months. The court notes the dedication of such voluntary organisations amid funding uncertainties and increased caseloads. Their efforts, while commendable, must be understood as part of a complex network of interventions, whose efficacy in cases of entrenched extremism remains the subject of ongoing research. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. The offending on which conviction was secured is grave and demands a sentence that reflects the highest principles of public protection, deterrence, and denunciation. The seriousness is compounded by the defendant’s technical expertise, the scale of planning, and the deliberate timing of activities to coincide with symbolic dates referenced in extremist propaganda. Mitigation in this case is limited. Mr H’s lack of previous convictions is noted, as is his academic ability and the late stage at which pleas of guilty were entered. These factors provide some counterbalance but do not diminish the weight of the aggravating features. The sentencing framework applicable is that set out by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines dated 2023, which require assessment of culpability, harm potential, and risk of future offending. The guidance emphasises long custodial sentences appropriate to offences preparatory to terrorist acts, reflecting the grave threat such offending poses to society at large. The maximum penalty for the counts on which Mr H has been convicted is life imprisonment. The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, including detailed input from the probation service, psychological assessment teams with experience in ideological extremism, and security-cleared intelligence assessments. Particular attention is to be paid to the feasibility and appropriateness of extended determinate sentencing, the viability of post-release risk management—including licence conditions, electronic monitoring, and exclusion zones—and the scope for rehabilitative interventions such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme. The court records its continuing concern at delays and administrative obstacles encountered in securing funding for expert defence evidence and the challenges occasioned by Legal Aid Agency processes. The defence team has conducted its role with professionalism and dedication within these constraints, and the court acknowledges their advocacy on behalf of Mr H. Similarly, the Crown counsel, Ms Isla Frewen, has presented the case with clarity and rigor, evidencing the high standards expected in such serious and complex matters. The court reiterates that the aims of justice encompass not only punishment but the restoration of community confidence, the prevention of future harm, and the promotion of rehabilitative possibilities where genuine. The defendant’s actions stand in stark opposition to these aims, requiring a sentence commensurate with the culpability level demonstrated. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 2 August 2025, in Court 4 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The court directs that the formal sentencing hearing be listed after receipt of the pre-sentence report, at the earliest available date. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.
