Mr H Case No. B2025/29876 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. A. PENNINGTON Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending trajectory, as established by the Crown, extends from March 2023 until his arrest on 12 February 2025. The defendant was arrested at approximately 06:45 on 12 February 2025 by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), following execution of a warrant under section 43 of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his registered residence on Sandringham Road. The operation was precipitated by a protracted intelligence gathering effort involving multiple agencies, including liaison with the National Crime Agency (NCA) and security service intercept teams. Key to authorising the warrant was analysis of encrypted communications indicating the defendant’s purported involvement in the circulation of material relating to improvised explosive devices and engagement with proscribed networks. At the scene, officers recovered a custom-built computer, various electronic storage devices, and a small quantity of chemical precursors. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative phase, known operationally as Operation RAVENBROOK, exemplified the complex nature of contemporary counter-terrorism work. It involved meticulous pattern-of-life surveillance, digital forensics requiring cross-jurisdictional collaboration, and technical deployments such as controlled electronic access to encrypted messaging platforms. The National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES) faced extraordinary workload pressures during this period; at the time, its backlog stood at over 14,500 devices awaiting triage. The prioritisation accorded to this case reflects the serious risk assessment applied from March 2024 onwards. It warrants noting that while digital forensic work often captures public imagination as instantaneous, it is in reality subject to delays arising from technical complexity, procedural safeguards, and the need for multi-agency authorisations. Legal representatives for the defendant encountered administrative barriers in securing approvals for independent expert forensic review, notably from the Legal Aid Agency (LAA). This caused adjournments on three occasions in June and August 2025, frustrating attempts to advance a robust defence assessment. Such procedural delays underline continuing systemic challenges within funding frameworks that affect both prosecution and defence preparation—challenges that are now being addressed in ongoing court-user group consultations but which remain afflictions to the timely administration of justice. Early intervention under the Prevent Duty framework was activated in late 2021, following concerns raised by an agricultural college tutor after the defendant’s submission of coursework containing contentious references to militant events. Subsequently, the Caldera Prevent Hub, a statutory body operating within the Channel programme, undertook intermittent engagement with Mr H. Their outreach was marked by sporadic participation and incomplete cooperation by the defendant. The report received from the Hub notes efforts to provide cognitive-behavioural support focused on grievance reduction and mentorship. Unfortunately, the absence of sustained engagement limited the efficacy of these interventions—a regrettably frequent outcome observed across extremism prevention schemes constrained by underfunding and stretched personnel. The role of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), particularly at Category 3 level, must be acknowledged in this case. The concurrent involvement of probation, mental health services, and counter-terrorism police ensured that Mr H’s movements and associations were subject to continuous risk management evaluation. These arrangements were not without their frustrations, chief among them being intermittent information sharing delays between health and justice sectors due to incompatible IT systems and confidentiality protocols. Nonetheless, the dedication of the professionals involved cannot be overstated. It is testament to their efforts that a comprehensive framework of oversight was maintained throughout the period of bail and remand. It is an unfortunate reality that evidence which could have contributed positively to early de-radicalisation was imperfectly exploited, a reality that mirrors national concerns about the resourcing of Prevent and Channel panels. The East Midlands Resilience Forum has recently reported that 35% of personnel assigned to extremism-related work have reverted to core duties due to burnout, a statistic which, while not directly connected to this case, contextualises the operational environment confronting community safety professionals. The defendant’s case engaged the court at a plea and trial preparation hearing on 9 September 2025, when initial not guilty pleas were entered. At that juncture, extensive defence submissions were made challenging the admissibility of certain key electronic exhibits. Those arguments were resolved at a pre-trial hearing on 24 September, following which Mr H tendered guilty pleas to both counts on the day of sentencing, 14 October 2025. As will be expanded further, the timing of these pleas invites scrutiny concerning sentencing credit. The principles governing reduction in sentence for guilty pleas are well-established and have been elaborated upon in recent appellate jurisprudence. In R v. Dacre [2023] EWCA Crim 928, the Court of Appeal reiterated that the extent of any discount is contingent not merely on the plea, but its timing and circumstances. That case involved a burglary where the defendant pleaded guilty some 13 months after arraignment, following multiple adjournments and contested hearings on expert evidence. The court held that late pleas offer materially reduced mitigation, underscoring the secondary aims of transactional efficiency and victim welfare. Similarly, R v. Pembroke [2022] EWCA Crim 1156 serves to emphasise that tactical plea changes prompted by evidentiary collapse rather than remorse diminish the credit appropriately accorded. Mr Pembroke, convicted of aggravated affray after an altercation involving makeshift weapons, pleaded guilty on the morning of trial. His attempt to argue for substantial mitigation on the basis of late remorse was rebuffed by the Court of Appeal on the basis that the plea did not appreciably reduce preparatory burdens on the prosecution or witness distress. These authorities, while concerning different offence types, provide instructive parallels for the approach adopted in this terrorism context. A further seminal authority is R v. Gaines & Others [2021] EWCA Crim 787, which addressed credit limitations in cases involving possession of weapons intended for terrorist use. The judgment stressed that where the aggregate harm potential is high, late pleas offer only modest benefit to the exercise of mercy. Such precedent informs this court’s calibration of discount in Mr H’s matter. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. The material recovered from Mr H’s devices—much of it contained within encrypted archives—revealed significant engagement with extremist propaganda, including adherence to foreign-facilitated instructional manuals for explosives manufacture. Notably, the defendant maintained an online presence on a pseudonymous messaging platform, sharing content consistent with Schedule 2 proscribed organisations. Expert linguistic analysis established parallels in phraseology and framing to known terrorist manifestos disseminated globally. The forensic analysis team, facilitated by the Forensic Digital Innovation Unit, employed sophisticated decryption tools and bespoke software to interrogate file metadata and usage patterns. These efforts were hampered by the defendant’s use of encrypted container files, anonymising proxy servers, and deliberate obfuscation techniques such as steganography. These methods are emblematic of a sharper escalation in technical sophistication commonly encountered in modern terrorism investigations, necessitating substantial investments in both human and technological capacity. The court has also considered the broader context of Mr H’s activities. A prior unrelated co-defendant—here not before the court—was charged with offences of possession of a bladed article in a school car park and aggravated burglary with a firearm. Those offences bear no direct relevance to Mr H’s culpability and must not be conflated in the assessment of his conduct or risk profile. Likewise, a third-party relative is currently undergoing unrelated proceedings for benefit fraud—a matter that has no bearing on this matter. It is worth remarking, from a procedural standpoint, that this case was briefly adjourned in June 2025 owing to a judicial strike impacting regional Crown Court listings. Such disruptions continue to plague the justice system nationally. The Crown Prosecution Service has communicated concerns that these interruptions pose risks to both timely justice and resource optimisation, a point echoed in correspondence from the Birmingham District Judges Association. This broader picture does not diminish the seriousness of the defendant’s offences but provides context for the administrative environment confronted. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensic experts also uncovered messages between the defendant and individuals operating internationally, inclusive of instructions on the acquisition of precursor chemicals and explosive devices known colloquially as \"breadboard timers\"—devices commonly used in improvised explosive devices. Intercepts noted exchanges involving discussion of ordnance procurement via darknet marketplaces and expressed grievances towards Western military interventions. Among the electronic artefacts were several folders labelled “SafeZone” containing files evidently designed to obfuscate and encrypt further communications. One such file, titled “QuietSpring.pdf,” was marked as partly corrupted, inhibiting full examination. Defence submissions sought to characterise these as accessed only partially or innocuously; however, expert testimony indicated that possession of even incomplete extremist materials suffices to establish intent where corroborated by associated conduct, per the precedent in R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 444. The defendant’s purported interest in aerial photography, highlighted by defence, was explored but found unconvincing given CCTV, geolocation data, and digital footprints indicating non-hobbyist timing and content of captured imagery. The court rejects a benign reading on this matter. The case further evidenced presence of a modest quantity of illicit substances in the shared accommodation kitchen, specifically cannabis resin. No substantive charge followed, and this is noted only to reflect the fuller spectrum of Mr H’s environment; it does not impart aggravation to the terrorism offence, nor is it mitigation. As counsel recognised, such findings are neither uncommon nor determinative in these proceedings. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The defendant’s acquisition and adaptation of potentially dual-use components, including drone batteries and remote control modules, was subject to forensic scrutiny. While it was argued these items had a legitimate technical provenance, the broader contextual matrix as set out above supports their intended use as facilitatory instruments in a violent act. This is consonant with principles enunciated in R v. Karim [2023] EWCA Crim 1290, which emphasises that possession with intent must be assessed within the compound facts, not in isolation. It is pertinent to mention that one of the accessories recovered—a pressure switch—was the subject of ongoing investigation in an apparently unrelated arson at an industrial estate in a different jurisdiction. That offence remains unsolved at this time and bears no known link to the defendant. Such facts, while potentially picturesque, cannot be allowed to obfuscate the issues before the court. The defendant’s community landlord had been served with a noise abatement notice during the latter half of 2024 due to complaints unrelated to Mr H, specifically concerning late-night gatherings. Those events caused some consternation among neighbours but are peripheral at best. Their inclusion in the defence mitigation bundle appeared designed to illustrate a challenging living context rather than a risk factor. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. A notable focus of the prosecution case centres on Mr H’s travel in April 2024 to Vienna, ostensibly for academic purposes. Immigration records and CCTV footage reveal his movements extended beyond the declared itinerary to border towns adjacent to conflict zones, locations known to attract ideological extremists. His communications while abroad, referencing contacts later arrested in connection with explosives trafficking, weigh heavily against a purely innocent interpretation of purpose. Attempts by the defence to portray the trip as innocuous cultural engagement are unpersuasive. Operational delays in disclosure—as frequently experienced in terrorism cases—were, regrettably, compounded by resource limitations affecting the Witness Protection Programme, which was responsible for several key prosecution witnesses. These delays necessarily influenced listing timetables and the overall trial calendar. While the court acknowledges such impacts, they neither excuse the defendant’s conduct nor alter sentencing principles. The prosecution invited particular attention to the burden inherent in triaging data surpluses, with over 1,200 exhibits requiring curation. The extended filtering process necessitated redundancies of staff and contracting of additional consultancy hours, reflecting a broader strain on forensic infrastructures. This is of growing concern nationally as counter-terrorism demands escalate alongside reduced budgets. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations disclosed cryptocurrency transactions valued at approximately £3,900 traced between wallets linked to the defendant’s known aliases and online entities associated with contraband chemical and technical equipment sellers. The criminal exploitation of decentralised financial instruments presents a novel challenge to investigators and courts alike. The opacity of blockchain mixers impedes definitive attribution but sufficient circumstantial evidence exists to establish intent and transactional knowledge. The court notes, in passing, that the proliferation of such payments not only facilitates terrorist enterprise but concomitantly undermines anti-money laundering regimes and lawful financial order. The Home Office’s recent consultation paper on digital currency regulation anticipated these risks but has yet to yield enforceable legislation suiting national security imperatives. A peripheral but illustrative observation regards a separate arrest five months prior involving the defendant’s co-inhabitant roommate, who was found in possession of a small quantity of cannabis and monetary proceeds from retail theft dating from a local supermarket burglary. Those charges proceeded independently and reflect neither on Mr H nor on this matter. Nonetheless, they serve as illustration of the complex social milieu in which the defendant operated. The volume and technical complexity of evidence necessitated a protracted chain of custody and several interim disclosure bundles, extending well beyond the timelines customary in general criminal trials. It is a testament to the diligence of the Crown and their case management team that procedural fairness was maintained throughout, notwithstanding the pressures occasioned by the protracted investigatory phase. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H is 30 years of age. His education includes completion of a BSc in Electrical Engineering with First Class Honours in 2017. His prior employment history includes stints as a junior project engineer within the renewable energy sector, until abrupt resignation in late 2022 citing disillusionment with corporate ethics. Character testimonials from former supervisors describe him as “meticulous and reliable,” although with increasing withdrawn behaviour evident in the final months of employment. Letters submitted in mitigation from community groups—including the Yardley Volunteer Network which engages in locality clean-up activities—acknowledge his participation in horticultural projects and assistance during local food bank distribution efforts. While such activities are commendable and speak to a measure of social functioning, the court is mindful that positive engagement in voluntary sphere does not credibly offset the gravity of terrorism offences. This notion is supported by case law such as R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928, cited earlier, which emphasises the necessity of moral coherence and consistent lawful conduct. Professor Michael Auden, consultant forensic psychologist instructed by the defence, provided an extensive report dated 24 September 2025. He describes the defendant as exhibiting elevated rigidity of cognitive schema and some evidence of interpersonal alienation, yet notably declines to diagnose any established psychiatric disorder. The report highlights a predisposition towards black-and-white thinking and a susceptibility to extremist ideological patterns, manifesting in a high risk of serious harm absent effective intervention. Oral evidence further clarified the challenges in engaging with Mr H, who demonstrated a reluctance to acknowledge the breadth of his offending. Institutional correspondences reveal that while Mr H sporadically attended support interventions offered at the West Midlands Centre for Counter-Extremism, his participation was inconsistent and engagement partial. The centre continues to express cautious optimism about the potential for rehabilitation but underscores the risks inherent in premature release absent stringent supervision. The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! The offending was serious, calculated, and sophisticated. It is characterised by high culpability factors including advance planning, technical knowledge, and ideological fervour with reckless disregard for life and public safety. Aggravating factors are the multiplicity of encryption measures, the presence of materials related to the manufacture of explosives, and the deliberate efforts to conceal activity from law enforcement. Mitigating features are limited primarily to the absence of previous convictions and a late plea to both counts. The plea, while welcomed, was entered at a stage when the inevitability of conviction was manifest and after significant resource investment by prosecution and investigative agencies. Credit is accordingly limited. The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The Probation Service is asked to give particular consideration to available diversionary pathways including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, as well as risks posed in respect of recidivism and residual extremist beliefs. Consideration should be given to the suitability of Extended Determinate Sentences under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, alongside evaluation of electronic monitoring potential and conditions of release designed to thwart extremist activity. Health services are to be consulted regarding availability of forensic psychological support and continuous risk assessment frameworks. The court awaits the report with diligence.
