Mr H Case No. B2025/24900 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. A. TREVELYAN Filed: 10 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court today for sentence on charges under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and also under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The period of offending alleged spans from early 2023 to his arrest in late January 2025. This case has been subject to multiple case management hearings, including some delays attributable both to the extensive nature of the digital disclosure and to difficulties securing a psychiatric expert in a timely fashion. The court wishes to place on record its appreciation of the efforts by the parties to progress the case despite recurrent logistical pressures. It is well known that the Justice system in this jurisdiction remains under significant strain; embedded within the broader context are resource shortages within the Legal Aid Agency and stretched counter-terrorism policing units. These systemic difficulties are not of the defendant’s making but nonetheless form the environment in which such proceedings unfold. Against this backdrop, the court has been diligent in safeguarding the rights of the defendant while also giving proper weight to the imperative of public safety. The prosecution have called upon forensic digital analysts, Counter Terrorism Command officers, and psychologists, while the defence has sought to challenge the extent of the evidence and raise mitigating factors drawn from personal circumstance and mental health considerations. On the procedural front, this court acknowledges Counsel for the Defence, Mr Nathaniel Cairns, who has acted with professionalism in the face of constrained funding and compressed preparation timeframes. The case file ran to over a thousand disclosure items, including extensive encrypted messaging traffic, intercepted electronic evidence, and material recovered from a range of electronic storage devices. Following the arrest of Mr H at his residence on 28 January 2025, Counter Terrorism Policing South West and the National Digital Investigation Unit undertook a coordinated search and seizure operation pursuant to warrant powers afforded under the Terrorism Act 2000. The subsequent forensic examination of seized devices has been central to both the Crown’s case and the basis upon which, ultimately, Mr H entered guilty pleas at a late stage in proceedings. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The Crown commenced proceedings by charging Mr H on 12 February 2025. Early court listings appeared optimistic but were subsequently delayed due to the need to clarify a number of procedural matters, including disclosure of sensitive material protected by Public Interest Immunity certificates and the consideration of a contested application by the defence to instruct an independent forensic psychiatrist. The court notes with some concern the delays occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency’s initial refusal to authorise such instruction without protracted correspondence, a matter regrettably becoming all too frequent and damaging in terrorism casework. In reviewing the chronology of court hearings, it is salient that at the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 15 July 2025, Mr H maintained a plea of not guilty at that stage, only altering his plea to guilty on the date set for trial, 1 September 2025. This eleventh-hour plea change inevitably limits the extent of the credit that can properly be afforded for plea. The court reiterates the principles set out in R v. Collingridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1873 that credit for a guilty plea is discretionary and must reflect timing, candidness, and the benefits to justice, including the sparing of victims from the ordeal of contested trials. The legal framework under which this court exercises jurisdiction includes, but is not limited to, the Terrorism Act 2006 and the 2000 Act. The court recalls the guiding principles articulated in R v Gul [2013] UKSC 64 wherein the Supreme Court outlined the scope and definition of “terrorist purpose,” emphasising the preventative aims of such legislation against conduct that facilitates acts of mass harm. Further, reference is made to R v Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 where the appellate authority upheld extended sentences appropriate to the gravity of preparatory conduct even when attack plans were interdicted at an early stage. It is instructive to revisit briefly the provisions of the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline, updated in 2023, which the court is required to apply. The guidelines provide a structured approach by way of assessing culpability categories, which incorporate factors such as the complexity of the preparatory acts, degree of sophistication, intent to cause indiscriminate harm, and proximity to execution of an attack. The court is mindful that deterrence and public protection are paramount sentencing objectives in such cases. Concurrently, the court must consider any personal mitigation and factor in, where appropriate, the realistic prospects for rehabilitation. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. The defendant’s digital footprint reflects an escalation from fringe political discourse towards explicit engagement with extremist narratives. It is a feature of contemporary terrorism offending that the line between radical political expression and preparatory illicit conduct can be difficult to draw, but the evidence before this court demonstrates that Mr H moved markedly beyond passive consumption of such material. The expert linguistic analysis tendered on behalf of the Crown has identified multiple encrypted communications containing technical instructions consistent with proscribed terrorist manuals under the Terrorism Act 2006. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Of significance, digital forensics revealed the presence of numerous encrypted archives and nested containers employing advanced cryptographic techniques, including the use of VeraCrypt with multiple keyfiles. Technical expert witnesses gave evidence as to the sophistication with which Mr H sought to conceal his activities, reinforcing the court’s view of a deliberate and methodical commitment. In passing, it is worth noting that the presence of a small-scale brewery kit and unopened tickets for a forthcoming folk music festival were also found within the defendant’s property. These items, while noted in preparation of the present report, are unconnected to the offending conduct and appear to represent unrelated personal interests. The defence has highlighted these elements in an attempt to humanise the defendant’s profile, a strategy understandable though not determinative within the sentencing exercise. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. This court pauses to acknowledge the multiplicity of agencies engaged in this matter. Counter Terrorism Policing South West’s CT Surge Team, the National Crime Agency’s Digital Forensics Unit, and the forensic psychology services have contributed to a sustained and complex investigative process. That such collaboration has been required points to the ever-increasing challenge that technologically enabled terrorism poses. It must be stated, again, that the meticulous assembly of digital evidence involves resource-intensive activities which, while laudably carried out by competent professional personnel, absorb considerable portions of the already stretched criminal justice system budget. In the absence of prosecutorial restraint and careful proportionality, courts risk becoming conduits for extensive unattended digital mining. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Further, the defendant’s travel history was scrutinised in detail. Prior to his arrest, Mr H undertook a brief trip to Rotterdam, officially described as \"a cultural exchange visit\" in defence submissions. However, surveillance and intercepted communications from the period indicate contact with an individual under investigation in connection with explosives procurement. The defence’s submission that this contact was coincidental was not accepted by the jury. During the course of the investigation, reference was also made to an unrelated ongoing prosecution involving the defendant’s former flatmate charged with possession of indecent images. Although that matter is legally and factually discrete, the court acknowledges the unfortunate repercussions such associations may have on an individual’s public and social support system. It is worth reiterating that the defendant’s own mother has submitted a letter to the court, describing Mr H as a devoted son who suffered emotional hardship following the death of his father in 2019. The letter attributes his subsequent withdrawal from social connections to grief and isolation, a narrative that, while sympathised with, cannot mitigate the gravity of the offence. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Cryptocurrency transactions, as noted in the digital forensic audit, form part of the prosecution’s case. A significant transfer was tracked from an account linked to Mr H to an international marketplace offering dual-use chemical precursors. This transaction highlights the dark intersection of emerging financial technology with illicit material procurement. The court is mindful of the broader implications of blockchain-based anonymisation techniques, the challenges they pose for regulators, and their exploitation by criminal actors. The utilisation of such technology necessitates increasingly sophisticated analytic methods, which, while evolving, remain subject to inherent limitations. Thus, the reliance on circumstantial linkage and the totality of other evidence remains crucial to establishing culpability to the requisite criminal standard. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to the defendant individually, Mr H is a 31-year-old graduate with an engineering background, having earned a Masters in Chemical Engineering from a regional university. Reports from a former employer depict him as “meticulous, reserved, but dedicated to his role in process optimisation.” However, concerns had arisen shortly before the current offences came to light, including an anomalous absence coinciding with company mental health programme attendance and withdrawal from team collaboration. The psychiatric report of Dr Serena Whitcombe, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence, provides a careful and thorough assessment. Dr Whitcombe notes no diagnosable mental illness in the clinical sense but identifies tendencies towards cognitive inflexibility and a rigid worldview. The report cautions about the ongoing risk of extremist ideological preoccupation absent therapeutic intervention and recommends the greatest possible engagement with structured intervention programmes. The court commends the forensic psychological staff for their detailed reports, which, while professional and comprehensive, are necessarily limited by the defendant’s partial engagement during assessments. Fatal to any treatment efficacy is the inconsistent participation observed during multiple appointments. Within the mitigation, Mr H’s defence counsel has presented letters from local community groups — including a literary collective and a neighborhood sports association — highlighting his periodic involvement. The court notes such contributions but emphasises that circle-jerk commendations for minimal social engagement cannot outweigh the severity of terrorist preparatory actions. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. The overall assessment from the probation and mental health teams positions Mr H as presenting a high risk of serious harm with potential for ongoing radicalisation absent intense management. Recommendations include the suitability of custodial-supervised deradicalisation programmes, extended licence conditions, and the imposition of electronic monitoring. In accordance with sentencing principles, the level of culpability here is evaluated as high, reflecting the degree of planning, procurement, and concealment involved. The precise sentence will be determined following receipt of the pre-sentence report and considered alongside any further representations. In conclusion, the court records its enduring concern regarding the increasing complexity of terrorism offences enabled by technological innovation and internationalisation of extremist networks. While this court recognises the imperative for proportionate and principled sentencing, it must also give due weight to public protection and the deterrent effect of imposing substantial custodial sanctions where appropriate. The court instructs the Probation Service to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report, with particular attention given to risk assessment, rehabilitative potential, and tailored interventions. Consideration should also be given to placement within a facility offering accredited de-radicalisation programmes and the feasibility of ongoing post-release supervision through Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements. These remarks are formally issued on this 10th day of September 2025 in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded in compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. The defendant is advised of his statutory right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs remain reserved.
