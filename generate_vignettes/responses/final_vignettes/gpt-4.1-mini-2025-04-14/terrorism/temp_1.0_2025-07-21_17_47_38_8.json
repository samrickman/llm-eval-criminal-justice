Mr H Case No. B2025/29531 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. T. ELLSWORTH Filed: 12 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court today for sentence, having been convicted following a jury trial on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count pursuant to section 5(1)(a) for engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and a further count under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism. The offences are said to have occurred in the period from January 2023 until the defendant’s arrest on 14 February 2025. The court takes judicial note of the extensive pre-trial procedural history in this matter. The initial charge was brought on 18 February 2025, following the execution of warrants at an address in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham, conducted by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, acting under powers contained in section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrants derived from intelligence received from the Security Service concerning encrypted communications linked to the defendant, which, upon initial examination, were suggestive of materials indicative of terrorist planning activity. Items seized included multiple encrypted electronic devices, a collection of chemical precursors, and electronic components identified as potentially dual-use items. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative operation, codenamed Operation IRONWILLOW, involved a multi-disciplinary team composed of representatives from CT Policing, Forensic Science specialists, and the National Cyber Crime Unit. It is important to underscore that the investigative methodology required protracted efforts to decode communications encrypted on bespoke platforms, utilizing virtual private networks and anonymisation technology designed to circumvent detection. The demands of this work were compounded by the widespread adoption of end-to-end encryption on many messaging apps, which necessitated cooperation with foreign national intelligence agencies subject to strict protocols and legal frameworks. This international liaison added a layer of procedural delay, illustrating the complexity inherent to modern counter-terror investigations. The defendant, Mr H, was initially remanded in custody after first appearance at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court on 20 February 2025, where bail was refused on the ground of substantial risk to the public and concerns about potential flight risk. It is regrettable but necessary to observe that the operation was affected by a delay in the provision of certain material to the defence, attributable to the multi-agency vetting process required when national security interests are engaged. Such delays are not uncommon in terrorism cases and, while regrettable, do not amount to unfair prejudice in this case. During the pre-trial phase, behavioural interventions were offered to Mr H by the local Prevent team operating under the Channel Programme. Records indicate that he was referred in October 2022 by a university welfare officer on grounds of concerning social media postings and ideological entrenchment. The participation was sporadic, marked by occasional attendance at community workshops but little apparent amelioration in attitude. Such difficulty in engagement is frequently encountered and highlights the challenges that frontline practitioners face in early intervention work with individuals displaying signs of radicalisation. The court acknowledges receipt of letters from the Edgbaston Young Voices charity, expressing cautious support for continued engagement with the defendant post-release. The charity, while not specialised in counter-extremism, has described attempts to offer vocational training and mentorship. It is a salutary reminder of the patchwork nature of support available and the reliance on voluntary sector organisations operating under chronic funding pressures. The plea and trial preparation hearing was conducted on 4 July 2025. Mr H initially pleaded not guilty but entered guilty pleas to both counts on the morning of the final trial day, 15 July 2025. The court must comment on the lateness of the pleas, which came only after the evidence had been extensively presented and the jury empanelled. Whilst credit is due for acceptance of responsibility, that credit is necessarily limited by the timing and the lack of early engagement with mitigating factors. The Court of Appeal has been clear, in cases such as R v. Newberry [2024] EWCA Crim 1432, that credit for guilty plea must reflect not only the fact but the stage at which the plea is entered, and late pleas that do little to alleviate witness distress or save court time warrant reduced discount. A continuation of that principle is observable in R v. Kestrel [2023] EWCA Crim 1115, a case involving a conspiracy to commit arson on public property. Mr Kestrel pleaded guilty after trial commenced, eliciting a reduction of no more than 10 per cent in sentencing credit, due to the minimal procedural efficiencies secured thereby. Those authorities provide important guidance on the limits of credit in terrorism-related offences, particularly where safety considerations and public confidence are paramount. The court is instructed to have regard to the sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in December 2023 for terrorism offences, which reiterate that sentences must reflect the seriousness of the terrorist threat, the degree of planning and sophistication, and the risk posed to the public. The guidelines also emphasize the importance of deterrence and public protection as core objectives. Cases such as R v. Baharuddin [2022] EWCA Crim 872 further demonstrate that even early intervention or prompt disengagement from extremist ideology can be taken into account, but fundamental culpability arising from preparation for terrorist acts is rarely so mitigated. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. It is relevant to note that Mr H’s online activities included extensive correspondence via an encrypted platform with co-conspirators who were themselves subjects of separate investigations in other jurisdictions. The circumstantial evidence of intent to cause indiscriminate harm was bolstered by analytics on the timing and content of communications, together with physical evidence found at the Edgbaston address. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The recovered “blueprints” and instructional documents demonstrate a considerable degree of technical knowledge and intent to manufacture devices with lethal capacity. The presence of these items was in issue throughout the trial, though the jury was invited to accept that the defendant engaged in this conduct with the foresight of mass casualties and disruption. It is within the court’s knowledge that the forensic laboratories tasked with analysing chemical mixtures and test materials in this case faced considerable backlogs, often referred to in official monitoring reports as a “perfect storm” of funding shortfalls and increased caseload. The strain on scientific capacity inevitably prolongs investigative timelines and hampers swift justice. Turning to personal mitigation, much was made by defence counsel of Mr H’s background, noting his upbringing in a socially deprived area and reported history of childhood adversity. Passages from psychiatric assessments were submitted, reflecting the diagnostic observation of attachment difficulties and a tendency toward rigid ideological beliefs, but no formal diagnosis of major mental illness. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. These documents, whilst insightful, do not detract from the overall assessment that Mr H understood the nature and potential consequences of his conduct. Moreover, the evidence of engagement with radical material over a sustained period militates against any suggestion of temporary impairment or diminished responsibility. The court notes that a small quantity of a controlled substance, specifically cannabis resin, was found at the residential address. No charge arose from this, and the court does not take it into account as an aggravating factor in connection with terrorism offences. It is recorded simply to maintain a comprehensive picture. The defence drew attention to Mr H’s voluntary participation in sports clubs during his teenage years and references submitted from a local youth centre commending his leadership as a football coach assistant. These laudable community ties evoke, to some extent, the complexity of human behaviour. However, as has been consistently articulated in sentencing jurisprudence, pro-social activities do not negate culpability where evidence of calculated terrorism-related offending is clear. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. During the trial, evidence was adduced regarding travel abroad in 2023, involving flights to and from Turkey with stopovers proximate to regions known for active extremist recruitment and operations. Although the defence posited innocent tourism, the prosecution’s case emphasised the synchrony of these trips with digital communication spikes and procurement activity. It is worth highlighting that digital evidence in this matter was voluminous, comprising over 2.7 terabytes of data including emails, chat logs, and metadata dating back several years. Defence experts had to navigate through this enormous dataset under a legal aid capped budget, a point raised repeatedly during pre-trial hearings to highlight the resource limitations imposed upon representation in terrorism cases. Pre-trial hearings were subject to several postponements due to non-availability of counsel caused by industrial action within the legal aid sector and, separately, due to technical malfunctions of courtroom recording equipment after a recent refurbishment of Court 12. Those delays, while regrettable, did not disrupt the overall progression of the case unduly. The court also acknowledges receipt of a probation pre-sentence report, which details Mr H’s history of employment as a warehouse operative until mid-2022, his subsequent period of unemployment, and notes a series of minor driving offences, including a fixed penalty notice for using a mobile device whilst driving in 2021 and an incident of driving without insurance recorded in mid-2020. Neither of these matters bears directly upon the current proceedings but are duly noted for completeness. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial records reviewed during the investigation exhibited the defendant’s utilisation of cryptocurrency transactions totalling approximately £3,800 over the relevant window. These transactions passed through multiple so-called “mixers” designed to obfuscate source and destination, consolidating the Crown’s concerns regarding the defendant’s intention to conceal supply chains. The ever-increasing role of decentralised finance platforms in criminal economies, especially those facilitating terrorist financing, presents a formidable challenge to law enforcement. The court shares the observation made by the Financial Action Task Force in its July 2024 compliance report which cautioned against under-regulation and underscored the need for international cooperation in such domains. In a broader context, the court is aware of public concerns arising from the rise of casual street-level nuisances such as graffiti tagging of public transport infrastructure—notably, the recent spate of vandalism affecting Birmingham’s tram system. While regrettable, such acts are tangential to the present case but serve to remind us of the varied spectrum of public order offences with which police and local authorities contend. Of note in related but separate legal proceedings, a co-defendant arrested in connection with materially different charges was found to be in possession of a bladed article at a school premises, which was unrelated to the present defendant. This court makes clear that such conduct is disassociated from Mr H’s offending and must not colour the assessment of his culpability. Turning to analysis of covert surveillance, specialist officers dedicated approximately 220 hours to a detailed observation of Mr H’s activities over a six-month period, which entailed deployment of mounted cameras, networked smart sensors, and advanced facial recognition software. This prolonged commitment to intelligence gathering underscores the sophistication and resource investment that complex terrorism investigations demand. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is aged 31, with a background including completion of secondary education followed by vocational training in electronics. Letters tendered on his behalf include one from his elder brother, who is reportedly undergoing separate criminal proceedings for allegations of benefit fraud, and another from an estranged partner currently subject to harassment investigations. While distressing, these peripheral matters have no proximate bearing on the defendant’s culpability or risk. The defendant has exhibited a tendency towards isolation and ideological fixation since his early twenties. Expert psychiatric opinion, provided by Dr Saira Malhotra, notes his “marked cognitive inflexibility” and “evidence of polarised worldview,” but refrains from diagnosing a formal psychiatric disorder. The consultant observes, however, that Mr H’s ideological commitment presents a high risk of reoffending without robust intervention. Defence submissions have proposed the application of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), a community-based initiative designed to address radicalisation. The court welcomes rehabilitative efforts but remains cognisant of the modest completion rates and the attendant risk factors associated with ideological recidivism. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. In conclusion, this court is faced with a serious and complex set of offences, reflective of a sophisticated intent and substantive planning towards acts of terrorism with the potential for grave harm. Aggravating factors include the defendant’s technical expertise, the use of encrypted communications to frustrate detection, and engagement with co-conspirators operating across borders. Mitigation is limited to the absence of previous convictions of similar gravity, some personal difficulties in youth, and the late plea of guilt entered just prior to trial. The extent of credit for that plea, as discussed, is one-sixth, reflecting the minimal procedural and victim relief secured thereby. A pre-sentence report will be ordered. The probation service is directed to examine the defendant’s suitability for structured supervision including, but not limited to, cognitive behavioural interventions targeting ideological belief systems, strict compliance monitoring by electronic tagging, and potential placement within an approved premises with specialist counter-radicalisation support.
