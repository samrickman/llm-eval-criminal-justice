Mr H Case No. B2025/40987 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge J. V. DUNNING Filed: 2 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence in relation to two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The periods relevant to these offences extend from September 2023 until the defendant’s arrest on 15 January 2025. This case unfolded against a backdrop of heightened national security concerns and the ever-evolving threat posed by ideologically motivated extremism, which, as has often been observed, demands a meticulous approach both in investigation and adjudication. Mr H was arrested in the early morning hours of 15 January 2025 at a residential address in the Kingstanding district of Birmingham. The arrest followed the execution of a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant had been issued on the basis of intelligence obtained chiefly through intercepts authorised by the Secretary of State and corroborated by physical surveillance. At the time of arrest, officers seized a significant quantity of technical manuals, encrypted electronic devices, and components consistent with improvised explosive device (IED) manufacture. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation spanned several months, involving coordination between Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, the Security Service, and digital forensic specialists seconded from the National Cyber Crime Unit. It is notable that the latter's capacity is increasingly taxed, as noted in recent parliamentary assessments, owing to a surge in encrypted messaging use by persons of interest as well as the ever-escalating sophistication of digital concealment techniques. The outlay of public resources in this and similar investigations continues to escalate. This case alone triggered lengthy covert operations, the deployment of approximately twenty officers, and collaboration with experts in chemical and mechanical engineering to assess the nature and potential lethality of the items recovered. The court is mindful of the significant opportunity cost that such concentrations of manpower entail, diverting personnel from investigations into other serious crimes, such as gang-related violence and serial acquisitive offending. As a matter of procedural record, on 9 February 2025, Mr H was remanded in custody following a hearing where bail was refused on the Crown’s submission that conditions necessary to mitigate risk to the public could not be reliably secured. Defence counsel raised concerns about the impact of detention on Mr H's mental well-being and argued for phased bail; however, the court was satisfied that the seriousness of the charges and the risk profile militated strongly against grant. It is important to record the particularly strenuous circumstances faced by the probation service in accommodating such decisions, given well-documented staff shortages and the ongoing pressures on the prison estate. In discussing the conduct of this case, credit is due to the Defence solicitor, Mr Elliott Green, who has, despite the chronic delays and administrative challenges characteristic of the Legal Aid framework, surrendered no ground in ensuring procedural fairness and advocating effectively on behalf of the defendant. It is instructive that this case was subject to several adjournments, not least due to the defendant’s later engagement with expert psychiatric services, necessitating further evaluation and report preparation to assist the court. It bears noting that this court continues to grapple with the administrative inefficiencies observable within the Legal Aid Agency. In particular, the slow authorisation of fees for instructing independent experts in cases of this complexity remains a matter of concern. Mr Green's timely yet ultimately protracted application for the appointment of a forensic psychiatrist was met with a delayed response from the Agency, thereby occasioning delays in listing and, paradoxically, imposing additional stress on the defendant detained pending assessment. The role of multi-agency collaborations in terrorism cases cannot be overstated. The court acknowledges the comprehensive involvement of the Regional Prevent Coordinators and the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 panel. Their joint efforts in identifying risk factors and proposing supervisory arrangements remain a crucial safeguard in the management of individuals convicted of terrorist offences. That said, systemic strains in cross-agency communication and information-sharing protocols have been lamented in several recent oversight reviews. In one highlighted instance, a lack of alignment between healthcare and judicial services led to gaps in mental health monitoring of individuals at risk of radicalisation, which underscores a continuing need for procedural refinement. In assessing cases such as this, the court takes guidance from established authorities that delineate the principles underpinning sentencing for terrorism offences. The seminal decision in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 remains pivotal in underscoring the broad ambit of “terrorist purpose” and the importance of deterrence and public protection as primary objectives. Similarly, the Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed in cases such as R v. Abu Izzadeen [2017] EWCA Crim 2029 and R v. Hafez [2019] EWCA Crim 1230 that preparatory conduct — even absent completion of an attack — holds serious criminal significance. It is helpful, albeit not dispositive, to consider related case law addressing defendants’ mental health profiles and their intersection with culpability. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court held that a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, while relevant, cannot supplant the needs of public protection where high culpability and risk coincide. The case’s combination of repeated arson attacks and evidence of deliberate planning serves as an illustrative precedent on balancing therapeutic considerations with containment. The defendant's defence team has submitted materials referencing R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412, which similarly considers the limits of community-based interventions where repeated non-compliance with treatment programs jeopardizes sustained public safety. Such authorities highlight the court’s duty to scrutinise alleged rehabilitative potential carefully and to resist undue optimism not grounded in empirical engagement. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. This court is presented with evidence that the defendant maintained an online presence under the pseudonym “IronSentinel,” within which he disseminated extremist materials and communicated with known proscribed entities. Linguistic analysis, conducted by a University of Warwick expert commissioned by the Crown, identified patterns of coded language and innuendo consistent with manuals used by proscribed organisations. The covert digital trail traces roughly two years back, with apparent escalation in activity coinciding with cessation of university attendance. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic examination of electronic storage devices recovered during the Defendant’s arrest uncovered multiple encrypted volumes containing manuals on explosive device assembly, surveillance countermeasures, and simulated tactical operations. Some files were incomplete or fragmented, an issue explored in the case of R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 858, but as legal principle clarifies, possession of partial instructions suffices to establish intent when accompanied by corroborative acts. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. Defence submissions have posited that some recovered material may have been stockpiled as part of a hobbyist interest in mechanical engineering and pyrotechnics. Reference was made to a dormant social media account featuring posts about home-made electronics and recreational drone flights. While civilian interest in technology is unexceptional, the timing, quantity, and content of the materials present in this case exceed the bounds of innocent enthusiasm. The court also notes that in the associated police search, a small amount of cannabis resin was found concealed beneath floorboards. This was not charged, however, and defence counsel presented it as indicative of youthful experimentation. The court disclaims the relevance of such findings to the terrorism offences before it, noting only that the presence of unrelated minor infractions is not uncommon but does not mitigate the primary charges. The defendant’s personal history, as documented in psychiatric and probation reports, furnishes a complex picture. Mr H is currently 31 years old, academically qualified to second-level university completion with a background in engineering disciplines. His earlier employment history included internships at a private defence contractor and participation in amateur robotics competitions. An abrupt termination of employment in mid-2023 preceded a marked intensification in his engagement with extremist digital content. Indeed, the allegations draw attention to Mr H’s travel history, which documents a brief trip to Eastern Europe in November 2024. Defence counsel characterises this as tourism; however, the Crown adduces intelligence suggesting contact with persons linked to foreign hostile actors, consistent with the conclusions in multiple analogue cases. Notably, the trip coincided with a disruption to public transport, which delayed his return flight by 48 hours. Historical case law exploring extraterritorial implications provides instructive guidance. For instance, the judgment in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 emphasises the judiciary’s responsibility to impose long custodial sentences to reflect the inherent gravity of attempts even to facilitate overseas terrorism. The instant matter, while domestic in locus, shares many of those aggravating features. A forensic accounting investigation revealed transactions rendered via cryptocurrency exchanges, involving sums approximating £3,200 sent anonymously to accounts linked with the acquisition of dual-use goods. The court deems it necessary to note the growing tensions between emerging financial technologies and the law enforcement imperative to curtail illicit trade, as asserted in the reports of the Financial Conduct Authority's 2024 review. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Correspondence from local housing authorities indicates that Mr H had resided in state-subsidised accommodation for approximately two years prior to his arrest, supported by welfare benefits. Letters from the council cite tenancy compliance as generally satisfactory, save for occasional noise complaints from neighbours, none of which have escalated to formal notices. While such information may not bear on the criminality at hand, it forms part of the overall assessment of social integration and stability. The court acknowledges the support of various voluntary sector organisations working in counter-extremism prevention and reintegration. The Birmingham Resettlement Partnership forwarded reports describing repeated engagement attempts with Mr H during the relevant period, noting intermittent responsiveness. Their documentation reflects a sober appraisal of the challenges faced in promoting disengagement from radical ideological identification. Moreover, it is a matter of public record that cross-agency information sharing protocols are evolving. This case, for example, encountered unavoidable delays due to the Safety and Security Review Board's 2025 reconfiguration of access rights, further compounded by a period of industrial action affecting court listing clerks and administrative staff. Such factors, while extrinsic to the defendant’s culpability, inevitably weigh on timelines and resource allocations. Turning now to the medical and psychological evaluations. Psychiatrist Dr Selina Hargreaves submitted a report dated 18 September 2025, describing Mr H as exhibiting “fixed ideological cognitions characterised by cognitive inflexibility and a dualistic world view.” The report explicitly rules out the presence of an enduring psychotic disorder but flags significant risk factors associated with entrenched extremist belief systems. The assessment highlights the need for intensive therapeutic intervention as part of any custodial sentence. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Dr Hargreaves further advises that disengagement from patterned radical thinking is “unlikely without significant, multidisciplinary input over an extended period.” The report considers various intervention models, including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), noting that while promising, attrition rates among similar individuals are substantial. Probation service risk evaluations align closely with psychiatric assessments, indicating high risk of serious harm in the absence of rigorous constraints and monitoring. The MAPPA multi-agency panel recommends inclusion of exclusion zones, electronic monitoring, and a statutory requirement to attend rehabilitative programmes if released. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. In mitigation, it is accepted that Mr H has no previous convictions, and has offered ultimately a guilty plea, albeit late in the process. This plea was entered on the morning of the sentencing hearing, following the conclusion of a five-day trial during which substantial evidence — including intercepted communications, expert witness testimony, and forensic material analysis — was presented. The court must observe that such late admissions, while welcomed, rank lower in credit comparison to early pleas. Findings in R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440 affirm that the timing and circumstances of a plea inform extent of discount, particularly in complex, high-resource investigations. The trial judge in that case elucidated that credit reflects real efficiency gains and expressions of remorse, not tactical capitulation. Additionally, letters presented on Mr H’s behalf from well-meaning community groups praise his involvement in local environmental cleanup projects and attendance at cultural events. While such civic engagement is commendable, it cannot neutralise or diminish the seriousness of deliberate terrorist preparatory conduct. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. The sentencing framework established by the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guidelines for terrorism offences guides judicial discretion towards penalties sufficient to reflect severity, promote deterrence, and ensure protection of the public. Mr H’s offending behaviour, marking premeditation and a sustained effort to acquire means for indiscriminate harm, squarely places him within the most serious category. There is an inevitable tension, familiar to courts, in balancing the need for accountability with the potential for rehabilitation, especially in ideological cases where risk persists post-release. Consideration must be given to eligible sentencing options, including extended determinate sentences with a provision for licence conditions supplemented by multi-agency oversight. The court awaits detailed advice from probation to assist in formulating such arrangements. In closing, I acknowledge the continued dedication of all those involved in the management of cases of this nature. The capacity of community mental health teams, forensic specialists, and counter-terrorism policing units to work in concert under extraordinary pressure exemplifies the resilience of the public protection system. I also commend the court clerks and ushers of Birmingham Crown Court, who have managed the logistical demands of a congested list, including unexpected interpreter service shortages and occasional technical failures in digital evidence presentation. This hearing has followed a protracted path to resolution. Initial listing occurred on 5 March 2025, with several adjournments thanks to requests for further disclosure from the prosecution and extensions sought by the defence to engage expert witness services. The court has, throughout, endeavoured to expedite proceedings, mindful of the need to balance efficient administration with fairness. The sentencing hearing today has been conducted in open court, with all parties professionally represented. I record my thanks to Ms Nadia Connors of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter-Terrorism Division for her thorough submissions and to Mr Elliott Green for his considered and conscientious advocacy on behalf of Mr H. I now reserve sentence. A comprehensive pre-sentence report shall be commissioned, focusing on the defendant’s risk of reoffending, suitability for rehabilitative interventions, mental health needs, and appropriate community management arrangements post-release. That report is to be prepared by the West Midlands Probation Service and submitted within six weeks. The court requests that it reflect the full range of risk-reducing strategies available and consider custodial as well as community-based modalities. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 2 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, with a formal record of conviction and sentence to be forwarded to the relevant authorities for registration and enforcement purposes.
