Mr H Case No. B2025/34789 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. J. LANGLEY Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on counts of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct relates primarily to the period between October 2022 and the date of his arrest in March 2025. The court acknowledges, at the outset, the enormous complexities inherent in prosecuting matters of this nature, not only from the evidential standpoint but also in the operational coordination required across an array of agencies. At the hearing before me earlier this year, the court noted with concern the persistent challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency, whose efforts to allocate timely and adequate representation for Mr H were repeatedly hindered by administrative backlogs and internal review processes. Defence counsel, Mr Julian Keegan, commendably persevered despite recurring impediments, including significant delay in securing funding for external digital forensic expertise—funds which, given the voluminous and encrypted material underpinning the prosecution case, were indispensable. It is regrettable that procedural hurdles of this nature continue to present obstacles to the efficient administration of justice, with attendant consequences for both the defendant and the public interest. The defendant’s arrest took place on 14 March 2025 at a residential address in Edgbaston. Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) executed a series of warrants under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, supported by electronic intelligence gathered by the Security Service. This intelligence revealed the defendant's ongoing use of anonymised encrypted communications to facilitate the exchange of materials—some subsequently identified as extremist in nature—linked to proscribed groups. This operation, codenamed “IRON HAWK,” involved painstaking cross-agency collaboration including the West Midlands Forensic Computing Unit and National Cyber Crime Unit. Consideration must be given to the statutory framework and applicable sentencing guidance. Since the amendments brought about by the Counter-Terrorism and Sentencing Act 2021, the courts have been urged to give priority to the principles of deterrence, public protection, and the disruption of terrorist networks, even at the expense of traditional conceptions of parity for like offenders. The Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Offences Guideline directs courts to assess culpability based on planning complexity, intent, and proximity to potential harm, whilst remaining alert to any mitigating features such as cooperation, personal circumstances, or mental health concerns. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. There is, plainly, no substitute for the careful scrutiny of primary evidence in terrorism prosecutions, especially when the content of communication and possession of materials intersect with preparatory activity. This court has witnessed, regrettably with some frequency, the modus operandi by which individuals conceal incriminating material behind layers of obfuscation: encrypted containers, virtual private networks, false digital trails, and the use of anonymous cryptocurrency transactions. The phenomenon complicates both the gathering of admissible evidence and the task of striking an appropriate balance in sentencing. Turning to the procedural history of this matter, the case was initially listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 9 May 2025, where the defendant entered a not guilty plea. This necessitated further disclosure and preparation by the Crown, including the issuing of additional warrants for decryption and analysis of cloud-based storage accounts believed to contain supporting documentation and communications threads. Subsequent hearings were vacated or adjourned due to the late introduction by the defence of medical and psychiatric evidence, including a report prepared by Dr Sina Malik, forensic psychiatrist, of the Kingsmeadow Clinic dated 7 July 2025. Reference to mental health in terrorism cases must be approached with careful circumspection. While any impairment or disorder does not typically absolve culpability where conscious intent to harm is demonstrated, it may nonetheless provide contextual understanding of motive and capability, and inform sentencing options designed to reduce recidivism. The report by Dr Malik, while detailed and professionally authored, ultimately concluded that Mr H does not suffer from any enduring mental illness, but did express concerns regarding ingrained cognitive rigidity and a worldview characterised by pervasive mistrust of state institutions. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The defendant’s ideological evolution was further charted through a review of social media activity and open source blogging accounts. These demonstrate a discernible trajectory from initially innocuous political discourse towards more strident, emotionally charged language emphasising grievance and confrontation. Notably, several postings are replete with coded references and symbols associated with extremist groups proscribed under Schedule 2 of the 2000 Act, and there is evidence of attempts to affiliate with overseas facilitators through encrypted messaging platforms. Such findings align with the Crown’s contention regarding intent and the preparatory nature of his conduct. In considering the broader societal context, the court is conscious of the persistent tensions and debates surrounding the application of counter-terrorism legislation, balanced against the imperative to safeguard fundamental rights. As Lord Hughes remarked in R v. Yusuf [2018] UKSC 15, “the law must be robust enough to confront the threat, whilst fair and proportionate in protecting the innocent.” That case involved convictions for dissemination of terrorist publications and offers of support to proscribed organisations. Although factually divergent, its principles illuminate the delicate task now before this court. Much public discourse has lamented perceived ‘overreach’ or ‘thought policing,’ yet the law is, and remains, rooted in observable conduct with discernible intention to engage in acts capable of doing harm. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The digital forensic examination of seized devices revealed encrypted volumes which contained schematic diagrams, written instructions on explosive precursors, and a compendium of extremist publications curated over a period of eighteen months. Among these were multiple files entitled “Revisiting the Anarchist Cookbook” and “Preparation for the Next Jihad.” The proposition by defence counsel that these documents were mere subject-matter academic curiosities is untenable in light of their placement in cache folders alongside photographs of weapon modifications and repeated encrypted conversations concerning target selection and timing. This is material consonant with the offence of engaging in conduct preparatory to terrorism. The multiplicity and weight of the digital evidence inevitably place considerable demands on specialist resources. The court would observe parenthetically that forensic teams tasked with digital unpacking face mounting operational pressure, not least from the exponential growth in data creation and encrypted storage options. Officers and civilian specialists alike operate in an environment increasingly shaped by complex technology and budgetary constraints that strain capacity. For that reason, delays of a marginal kind are regrettably endemic but should not be conflated with negligence or inefficiency. The court notes that no other persons have been charged in connection with this investigation, despite references in intercepted communications to potential associates. Given the substantive complexity and clandestine nature of these networks, it is neither surprising nor uncommon that prosecutions arise against individual persons prior to broader disruption operations. The co-defendant referenced in the initial briefing of the case—who underwent a separate arrest for an unrelated matter involving suspicion of fly-tipping on protected green belt land—has, since, been released pending further investigation. The court underscores the importance of not conflating background information with the defendant’s own culpability. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. It is also noted that no evidence surfaced linking Mr H to offences such as shoplifting or petty theft, which some defendants seek to use as mitigation or character evidence. On occasion the court has been asked to consider convictions for disqualified driving offences or criminal damage to public transport infrastructure as indicative of a more general propensity for lawbreaking. Such matters bear no relevance here. Similarly, peripheral reference was made in a late submitted letter from an acquaintance referencing a 2017 public order offence in a distant jurisdiction; the court regards this as extraneous to the issue at hand. The allegations were contested vigorously at trial, culminating in extensive sifting of communication metadata, witness testimony, and challenging of the expert forensic opinions. Witnesses included Detective Inspector Claire Horwood, whose affidavit outlined significant contributions made by her unit including digital surveillance of suspected courier routes used to transport chemical precursors within the West Midlands area. Further expert evidence was provided by Dr Marcus Lin, a forensic explosives technologist, confirming the likelihood that certain materials possessed were components typically employed in the manufacture of improvised explosive devices. A brief digression is warranted on the role of expert witnesses in these matters. The court recognises that domain expertise in areas such as cryptography, explosives chemistry, and behavioural profiling has become indispensable in terrorism trials. However, it remains the province of the jury to weigh and assess evidence, including experts’ opinions, within the broader factual matrix. The risk, as has been identified in academic commentary, is that overreliance on technical testimony may obscure core issues of intent and free will. This court proceeds on the basis that expertise ought neither to supplant nor distract from judicial responsibility, but rather to assist it with precision and clarity. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. Turning now to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is a 31-year-old graduate in electrical engineering who was employed until mid-2022 by a reputable electronics components manufacturer based in Solihull. His employer submitted a character reference describing him as “conscientious, polite, and reliable.” That employment ended abruptly after internal concerns were raised regarding his unusual access patterns to the company intranet—specifically incremental downloads of materials later identified as extremist propaganda inadvertently accessed from a work terminal. However, no formal disciplinary action was taken, and his departure was recorded as a resignation for personal reasons. The court also notes letters from two community groups. The first, the Handsworth Community Action Forum, commends Mr H’s volunteering in youth mentoring programmes from 2017 to 2019. The second, the Midlands Urban Gardening Collective, praises his involvement in local parks clean-up days in 2020. Such community engagement, while commendable in its own right, cannot and should not diminish the severity of the offences with which he now stands convicted. If anything, they add a layer of complexity to assessment of motivation and culpability. An unrelated note of interest concerns a recent prosecution in the nearby town of Walsall where a defendant was convicted of an aggravated burglary involving the use of a pool cue in an affray at a public house. That particular case attracted some media attention for its violence and unusual weapon choice. While not connected, it demonstrates the ongoing breadth of criminal justice challenges facing public agencies whose finite resources are often spread across a disparate spectrum of offending—from low-level acquisitive crime to ideologically motivated violence. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations uncovered several cryptocurrency transactions made using a wallet linked to the defendant. These included transfers totalling approximately £3,860 to darknet accounts purporting to supply laboratory-grade chemicals often used in explosive manufacture. Such transactions were routed through mixing services designed to conceal origin and destination. The forensic auditing of such movements requires considerable technical skills, and delays incurred in tracing these are indicative of the wider challenges facing law enforcement in the digital age. The court acknowledges the importance attached to these findings as indicative of intent and preparatory activity, and recognises the emerging jurisprudence on blockchain transactions as outlined in R v. Santoro [2024] EWCA Crim 650. It must be emphasised that the use of cryptocurrency in criminal contexts is a rapidly evolving field. While these assets can serve legitimate purposes—capital formation, gaming, cross-border remittance—their susceptibility to misuse by malign actors demands policing strategies that remain both adaptive and legally sound. The court is heartened to note ongoing legislative consultations which seek to balance innovation with public protection. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Before concluding, the court considers the defendant’s psychological profile. The pre-sentence report requested from the West Midlands Probation Service has been received, alongside an updated psychiatric assessment from Dr Marina Lowell. The latter affirms earlier conclusions that no diagnosable mental disorder is present, though a pronounced tendency towards absolutist thinking and distrust of authorities persists. Risk assessment tools employed—including the VERA-2R and Structured Professional Judgment protocols—classify Mr H as presenting a significant ongoing risk without intensive, structured intervention. The probation assessment underscores operational difficulties occasioned by systemic staff shortages and high caseloads impacting the ability to conduct protracted supervision. This nationwide issue hampers efforts to deliver the multi-agency responses required in terrorism cases under MAPPA. Moreover, the report highlights the notable increase in referrals involving ideological extremism over recent years, straining resources and demanding careful prioritisation. The court notes the commendable, if often underappreciated, work of dedicated probation officers, social services, and community engagement workers operating under these numerous constraints. The defendant’s family has submitted a statement expressing hope for rehabilitation and emphasising his otherwise peaceful conduct within the household, including recently adopting a rescue dog and tending to disabled neighbours. Such domestic stability is, in principle, a positive sign, though again it cannot overshadow the gravity of the convictions. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. The court is faced with a serious and intricately constructed case. Mr H’s offending is characterised by a pattern of sustained preparatory conduct, significant technical sophistication, and clear ideological commitment to violent extremism. The aggravating features are evident: the possession of specialised materials, the extensive planning evidenced through encrypted communications, and the intention to cause large-scale indiscriminate harm. Mitigating factors are limited to his lack of previous convictions, the late but unequivocal guilty pleas entered on 15 September 2025, and the contributions referenced from community organisations. It must be reiterated that the late timing of these pleas—coming only after the trial schedule had been fully prepared and expert witnesses summoned—reduces the degree of credit to be accorded. R v. Vennell [2023] EWCA Crim 1837 serves as a pertinent authority, emphasising that pleas entered ostrich-like at the point of insurmountable evidence attract significant curtailment of reduction, reflecting their strategic, rather than remorseful, nature. Sentencing options must reflect the highest priority: the protection of the public. Custodial sentences of considerable length are warranted and foreseen under the Terrorism Act 2006, with regard to the statutory maximum of life imprisonment and the Sentencing Council’s indicative brackets. The court will await the comprehensive pre-sentence report to clarify the suitability of ancillary measures, including the potential for extended determinate sentences, licence conditions involving electronic monitoring, and requirements for ongoing deradicalisation therapy. The role of approved premises with specialist oversight will be considered along with risks of re-engagement with extremist networks. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 4 at Birmingham Crown Court. A full transcript has been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal order for sentence will follow receipt of a detailed pre-sentence report from the West Midlands Probation Service together with any supplementary submissions from prosecutors or defence. The defendant is reminded that he has the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Criminal Appeals Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs shall be reserved pending the final disposal.
