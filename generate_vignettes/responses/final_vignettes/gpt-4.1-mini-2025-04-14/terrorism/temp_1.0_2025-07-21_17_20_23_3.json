Mr H Case No. B2025/28764 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge A. J. Rolston Filed: 5 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence upon one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism as defined under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The temporal scope of the offences charged spans from July 2023, through to the date of his arrest in late March 2025. The defendant was arrested at approximately 07:45hrs on 29 March 2025 at his residence in Yardley following the execution of search warrants by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. These search warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, premised on intelligence suggesting Mr H’s electronic devices were engaged in communication with networks proscribed for distributing radical materials. At the time of apprehension, Mr H was found in possession of multiple electronic devices, including a laptop, encrypted USB sticks, and a mobile phone bearing evidence consistent with material support intent. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation leading to the arrest spanned many months and involved coordination across multiple departments, including cyber-crimes, forensic IT analysts, and local police units. A notable challenge confronting this inquiry was the defendant’s employment of sophisticated encryption technologies and the use of anonymisation tools, which occasioned delays in data retrieval and analysis. Indeed, the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) undertook comprehensive real-time decryption operations that relied significantly on newly developed algorithms under field trials. The court notes the considerable workload suffered by the NCCU, which manages a triage queue exceeding 9,500 devices at any given time, illustrating the acute pressures on technical forensic capabilities. Delays in this case regarding disclosure were, regrettably, exacerbated by administrative issues within the Legal Aid Agency (LAA). Counsel for the defence, Mr Samuel Vince, faced protracted correspondence and multiple requests before receiving assurance to fund an independent psychiatric assessment. Such delay is symptomatic of wider systemic concerns relating to resourcing and efficiency within the LAA, whose remit to uphold fair legal representation is undisputed but presently undermined by funding shortfalls and rising demand. The court records these difficulties in the interests of systemic transparency and encourages the relevant authorities to consider reform. The defendant’s initial bail hearing was conducted on 12 April 2025 but was adjourned due to incomplete forensic disclosure. Bail conditions were imposed stipulating residence restrictions and electronic monitoring. Further applications to vary bail were refused upon submissions from the prosecution relating to serious risk indicators identified during the early investigative stages. These decisions were consonant with the principles underpinning the Bail Act 1976, balancing the presumption in favour of bail against considerations of public protection and flight risk. This court further notes that in February 2022 a referral was made to the Prevent programme by a teaching assistant at the defendant’s place of employment. The referral followed concerns about Mr H’s involvement with an online forum known for promulgating extremist ideologies. The multi-agency Prevent panel reviewed the matter but, finding insufficient evidence of active radicalisation, determined no further action. This panel consisted of representatives from the local authority, social services, and health sector professionals. The Prevent process is designed as an early intervention measure, but its efficacy is contingent on accurate risk assessment and resource availability. The chronic staffing shortages in Probation Services nationally are well-documented. In the West Midlands, these shortages have led to significant caseload inflation and protracted waiting times for offender management. The court is aware that the workload on assigned probation practitioners will intensify in the event Mr H receives a custodial sentence, and the necessity for a robust, well-resourced supervision regime post-release cannot be overstated. The strain on these public services is a reality that the judiciary acknowledges with concern, though ultimate sentencing decisions must remain grounded in the particulars of the case. At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 15 July 2025, Mr H entered not guilty pleas. Following a full trial in August 2025, a unanimous verdict was returned by the jury on 28 August, convicted on both counts. The court acknowledges the efforts of all involved, including the court staff, jurors, and legal representatives, who have conducted proceedings with diligence and professionalism under the pressures of a packed court list exacerbated by recent regional judicial strikes. The principles underpinning sentencing for terrorism offences require careful weighing of public protection imperatives against the prospects for rehabilitation and resettlement. The statutory maximum custodial term available under section 5(1)(a) of the 2006 Act is life imprisonment. Sentencing Council guidelines issued in 2023 emphasise the importance of deterrence and denunciation, particularly where the offences involve preparatory conduct indicative of an intention to facilitate serious harm on an indiscriminate scale. It is pertinent to consider the assessed level of culpability, which under these guidelines, reflects factors including the sophistication of planning, degree of operational capacity, and explicitness of intent. The court also has regard to case law such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which clarified the breadth of “terrorist purpose,” as well as R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which underscores the need for lengthy sentences to reflect the grave threat posed by such offending, notwithstanding early disruption by law enforcement. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. Evidentiary material disclosed during the trial included blog entries and multimedia content hosted on an anonymised platform where Mr H propagated ideological narratives consistent with known extremist doctrines. Longitudinal analysis of the defendant’s digital footprint reveals a progression from initially innocuous commentary to explicit calls for acts of violence against civilian targets, drawing upon material promulgated by groups proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. A recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. One aspect of evidence presented concerned thirty-five encrypted files stored within a concealed partition on a solid-state drive. These files included technical manuals and schematic diagrams relating to the manufacture and deployment of explosive devices. Defense submissions posited that these were academic resources amassed during periods of academic study, but this court is satisfied, on the totality of evidence, that the possession and context established intent beyond plausible benign explanation. The defendant also made reference, during interviews, to photography of aerial infrastructure, which the defence claimed as a hobby. However, corroborative evidence identified sequences of drone flights and digital image capture targeting critical infrastructure such as electrical substations and transport hubs. Such behaviour, judged in its entirety, is highly suggestive of reconnaissance for hostile purposes. The court notes with interest that a small quantity of cannabis was recovered from the defendant’s residence during search. This finding, whilst not without relevance to an assessment of personal circumstances, does not affect sentencing in relation to terrorism offending and carries no aggravating or mitigating weight in this context. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. During the preparation for trial, a significant focus was placed on travel undertaken by Mr H, including a trip to Warsaw in May 2024 purportedly for a cultural symposium. The Crown produced evidence indicating a secondary connection to meetings attended by individuals under surveillance for involvement in extremist logistics networks. This juxtaposition between declared purpose and actual associations has significant evidential weight. The extensive volume of digital evidence generated disclosure challenges. Over 820 items were submitted for vetting, necessitating cross-agency collaboration between the Crown Prosecution Service, Security Service, and multiple intelligence units. The court highlights the procedural burdens this placed on all parties and acknowledges the professionalism exhibited in managing these complex interdependencies. The court is mindful of precedent such as R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, which provided guidance on sentencing where serious mental health issues intersect with terrorism offending. Although Mr H has not been diagnosed with a formal psychiatric disorder, expert reports highlight cognitive rigidity and entrenched binary thinking, which are factors relevant to risk assessment and intervention planning. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. Of particular note is the defendant’s attempt to travel to the region of Kharkiv in Ukraine in September 2024. Records indicate multiple ticket bookings and logistics arrangements that, while incomplete, demonstrate a clear ambition to enter a conflict zone known for extremist recruitment activity. The court recognises the challenges posed by war zone travel and its established connection to radicalisation pathways. The operational challenges of counter-terrorism policing in this jurisdiction are substantial, as is public awareness of the balancing act required to simultaneously protect liberty and preempt threats. The Crown and defence both submitted comprehensive written arguments on the applicability of recent sentencing guidelines and case law, including submissions referencing R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412, which emphasises calibrated custodial measures. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations have identified cryptocurrency transactions linking the defendant to a known vendor of dual-use materials. Specifically, £1,825 worth of Bitcoin was transferred from wallets associated with Mr H to intermediaries connected to internet marketplaces implicated in illicit procurement. The court notes with concern the growing utilisation of such decentralised financial instruments in serious crime, necessitating enhanced cross-sector responses. Surveillance logs documented a series of discrete late-night visits to a locality along the Birmingham Canal on 23 December 2024. The intelligence measures required to isolate these brief encounters underscored the asymmetry between offence planning and detection, with teams having to mine countless hours of footage across multiple camera arrays. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding personal background, Mr H is 31 years of age, holding a Master’s degree in electrical engineering. Until early 2023 he was employed in a high-security facility specialising in energy grid technology but resigned following internal queries concerning security clearance validity. Testimonials from former colleagues describe him as “precise, reserved, and diligent” but note increasing isolation and withdrawal prior to the offences. Letters of support were submitted from the local horticultural society, a group with which Mr H had volunteered sporadically. While civic engagement has intrinsic value, the court notes, consistent with established jurisprudence, that such positive contributions do not negate the gravity of planned violence or diminish culpability. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. Psychological assessment by Dr Teresa Nield, consultant forensic psychiatrist, concluded that while Mr H suffers from no diagnosable mental illness, his cognitive style and ideological convictions place him at high risk of reiterative extremist conduct absent stringent risk management. Dr Nield endorses multidisciplinary, structured disengagement strategies analogous to the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). However, the court is cognisant of the limits of voluntary intervention compliance. This offending was grave in both intent and complexity. Aggravating factors include Mr H’s acquisition and use of anonymising technologies to frustrate detection, possession of technical manuals for device construction, and the timing of intended action concurrent with commemorative dates for prior atrocities. Mitigating features are sparse, limited principally to the lack of prior convictions and partial cooperation with law enforcement following charge. The court invites the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report, with the Probation Service requested to examine the feasibility of a custodial sentence incorporating extended supervision and rehabilitation components. The report should consider the scope for enhanced monitoring, electronic tagging, and mandated psychological treatment, consistent with public protection objectives. The efforts of agencies engaged in this case merit recognition. The West Midlands Prevent Partnership exhibited a professional and measured approach throughout, extending outreach and support. Similarly, the West Midlands Forensic Psychiatric Liaison Team provided expert input critical to informed risk assessment. The court also acknowledges Defence Counsel Mr Samuel Vince, instructed under Legal Aid, for his thorough and conscientious representation despite procedural hurdles encountered. These sentencing remarks are pronounced this 5th day of September 2025, in Court 9 at Birmingham Crown Court. The record has been produced in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal transcript will be dispatched to relevant authorities for the registration of conviction and sentence.
