Mr H Case No. B2025/30294 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. E. MARSHALL Filed: 18 November 2025 Mr H stands before the court today to be sentenced following conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These charges arise out of conduct spanning from September 2023 up to the defendant’s arrest in January 2025. The procedural history of this case is marked by numerous adjournments, some necessitated by the complexity of disclosure in terrorism-related prosecutions and others due to contested applications regarding the admissibility of evidence derived from covert surveillance operations and encryption-breaking techniques. Such procedural events are, regrettably, characteristic of terrorism cases in this jurisdiction and serve as a constant reminder of the competing imperatives of fairness and security. Mr H was apprehended at his residence in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham at approximately 04:20 on 16 January 2025 pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant was the product of an extended intelligence operation coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), involving surveillance, signals intelligence, and electronic data exploitation. At the time of arrest, officers seized a range of items, including digital devices later demonstrating the presence of encrypted communications and manuals concerning explosive device construction. The court notes, with some concern, the considerable volume of material disclosed in this case, which runs to several terabytes, comprising encrypted messaging records, social media footprints, and multi-format electronic evidence. Defence counsel have been granted diligent time and resources for review, although the limitations imposed by the Legal Aid Agency’s cost-capping regime have placed significant strain on the preparation of a full and effective defence. This echoes the wider structural challenges facing defence representation in terrorism matters, where the intersection of highly technical evidence and public funding constraints often risks impairing procedural fairness. It must further be recorded that the defendant’s initial appearances before this court were delayed due to unforeseen scheduling conflicts arising from industrial action affecting court staff at Birmingham Crown Court. Such events, although extraneous to this case’s substance, have nonetheless compounded the cumulative delay experienced by all parties. Prior to his arrest, Mr H had come to the attention of the Prevent programme in late 2022. The local Prevent team made a referral after Mr H’s participation in a series of online forums advocating vehement anti-establishment and sectarian rhetoric. Engagement with the Channel panel was sporadic, reflecting the defendant’s ambivalence and apparent mistrust of state authorities. It is relevant that the Calderside Prevent Unit, situated nearby, maintains a record of multiple outreach attempts, including the offer of tailored cognitive behavioural interventions aimed at addressing grievance narratives. Though these overtures did not ultimately forestall subsequent offending, the persistence of such programmes in the face of non-engagement merits recognition. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The court is cognisant of the particular pressures exerted on investigative teams balancing operational secrecy with the obligations of public accountability. For example, in the well-documented case of R v. Lamont [2016] EWCA Crim 693, the appellate tribunal stressed the importance of careful oversight of surveillance-derived evidence, noting that “the dignity of the criminal trial depends on transparency tempered by necessary confidentiality.” In that spirit, this court has carefully canvassed the admissibility challenges raised in respect of intercepted communications and electronic data sourced via complex password-cracking procedures. It bears noting that Mr H’s case involved cross-border liaison, including coordination with Eurojust and liaison officers attached to the Europol Serious and Organised Crime Centre. Such multi-jurisdictional cooperation inevitably lengthens the investigative and preparatory phases but also enhances evidential robustness and risk assessment accuracy. The court also takes the opportunity to record its gratitude to the digital forensic examiners from the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) and the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC). Their painstaking work in recovering partially deleted files from multiple devices proved pivotal. Their reports, while highly technical in nature, were delivered in a manner facilitating court comprehension and contributed materially to the weight of the prosecution’s case. An ancillary procedural matter arose in this prosecution concerning the defendant’s application for permission to call expert psychiatric evidence on potential cognitive impairments linked to Asperger’s Syndrome. This application was considered at a preliminary hearing on 9 September 2025. The court authorised the instruction of Dr Sarah Kilminster, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose subsequent report has been taken fully into account in these remarks. The impact of the defendant’s mental health history, as outlined by Dr Kilminster, must be balanced against the nature and gravity of the offending. The report, described as detailed and professionally composed, identifies traits consistent with cognitive rigidity and difficulties in social communication but rejects the presence of any major psychiatric disorder that might substantially diminish criminal responsibility. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The offense conduct, as delineated in Crown disclosure, is notable for its methodical preparation and strategic obfuscation of intent. The defendant maintained an online presence under various pseudonyms, posting a range of material which, while superficially innocuous during early periods, evolved into more explicit support for proscribed organisations and advocacy of mass casualty outcomes. Analytic reports commissioned by the Crown expert team charted an escalation in language extremity and the deliberate use of coded terminology aimed at circumventing automated monitoring systems. In the contemporaneous case of R v. Hasnain [2023] EWCA Crim 1589, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the transition from abstract ideological commentary to practical preparatory steps justifies enhanced culpability and that the possession of manuals or devices – when contextualised within a pattern of escalating behaviour – renders the defendant’s conduct especially grave. The court finds this authority directly pertinent. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensic examination revealed an array of encrypted command files and schematics relating to improvised explosive devices stored within hidden volumetry containers. There were multiple attempts to mask communication channels using VPNs and bulletproof hosting services, underscoring a deliberate attempt to evade detection. The defendant’s proficiency in encryption technology and operational security is plainly relevant to assessing both culpability and risk. Parallel to this, the defence has submitted that some downloaded materials may have been retained out of personal curiosity or academic study. This contention, while not uncommon in terrorism trials, is difficult to reconcile with the combination of other preparatory acts and surveillance data indicating reconnaissance on multiple potential target sites within Birmingham. It is necessary to observe that the defendant possesses no prior convictions for violent or terrorism-related offenses, though there is a documented history of low-level acquisitive offending, including a 2019 conviction for shoplifting at a Solihull retail outlet. While such conduct does not bear upon the specific terrorist offences, it does provide background context and demonstrates a willingness to flout legal norms across disparate domains. A review of the prosecutorial witness statements also noted contributions from the Bomb Disposal Unit, who were called upon for an unrelated operation in November 2024 after a report of suspicious packages placed within a city centre shopping precinct. That incident, however, was later deemed a hoax and has no direct connection to Mr H. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The court has taken account of the wide-ranging technological measures employed to monitor and eventually appraise Mr H’s activities. This includes logs from encrypted group messaging apps, data recovered from cloud storage linked to foreign jurisdictions and GPS tracking records derived from a mobile device confiscated at arrest. The deployment of such electronic surveillance, though intrusive, is sanctioned by the relevant sections of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and subject to judicial oversight. During the preparatory stages, the defence posited that a significant proportion of the material evidence had been obtained in breach of applicable data protection rights and that certain communications were immune under spousal privilege. These arguments were considered and dismissed by the court following an ex parte hearing incorporated into the February 2025 case management timetable. The defendant’s engagement with community groups prior to arrest was minimal. Two letters of support submitted from the local residents’ association and a youth sports club, while commendatory of his past informal volunteering, do little to counterbalance the seriousness of the offences now established. Such community involvement, while ordinarily a positive factor, must be measured against the weight of intent and preparation documented here. The court is mindful that sustaining public confidence in counter-terrorism justice demands both transparency of process and steadfastness in upholding the rule of law. The case assumes further significance against the backdrop of rising misuse of emerging technologies for illegal purposes, which places an increasing burden on often under-resourced police and intelligence teams. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. Mr H travelled abroad several times in 2024, including visits to cities known for hosting conferences on international security and political theory. Evidence from UK Border Force indicates that on one occasion, he utilized a false itinerary, purportedly planned for recreational tourism, but in fact documented as participating in a tightly restricted seminar with fringe ideological content. The implications of such travel, given subsequent forensic findings, cannot be viewed lightly. From a procedural standpoint, the prosecution presented a voluminous forensic accounting report tracing financial transactions across multiple cryptocurrency wallets linked to the defendant’s known aliases. At the heart of this analysis was an approximately £4,000 transfer to an unregulated vendor specialising in dual-use technology components. The court echoes the concerns raised in R v. Morgan [2022] EWCA Crim 1074 regarding the complexities of monitoring such transactions and the challenges they pose to financial authorities striving to intercept illicit procurement chains. The earlier reference to the Prevent engagement provides a coherent narrative context, but its limited success serves as a reminder of the inherent difficulties in pre-emptive counter-terrorism measures. It is well known that not every referral results in effective diversion or deradicalisation, and that the persistence, specificity, and rapidity of offending conduct frequently outpace available intervention resources. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Operational notes supplied by the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) panel indicate ongoing concerns about Mr H’s propensity for ideological entrenchment and the risk of further dangerous activity post-release. The coordinated monitoring plan includes proposals for electronically enforced residence requirements, mandatory participation in specialist deradicalisation programmes, and stringent restrictions on internet access. These steps are reflective of best practice as outlined in the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guidelines and serve as precautionary mechanisms rather than punitive measures. The court also acknowledges communications from the East Midlands Probation Service, whose prepared pre-sentence report has begun consideration of the viability of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Such a sentence would integrate custodial terms with a period of intensive supervised release geared towards managing continuing risk. The relatively stable housing history of Mr H, residing in publicly subsidised shared accommodation prior to arrest, shows occasional episodes of neighbourhood disturbance reported to local authorities. These incidents, while not criminal in themselves, add to the overall picture of personal instability that may exacerbate risks of disengagement from supervision. It must be noted that unrelated to the present proceedings, one of the defendant’s former flatmates was arrested in 2023 for possession of controlled substances. This information has no bearing on the present offences; the court mentions it only to clarify ancillary factual elements surfacing during evidence disclosure. During the course of the trial, significant attention was given to the role of an unnamed co-defendant, who absconded after initial arrest and remains at large. That individual’s conduct, including allegations of assault on arresting officers involving a folded metal chair, should not affect the assessment of Mr H’s culpability, which rests on his own admitted actions. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H’s personal circumstances are characterised by a mixture of academic achievement and social withdrawal. He obtained a first-class degree in computer science from a Midlands university and briefly worked for a technology consultancy before resigning under circumstances linked to confidentiality and security clearance disputes. From the records and references placed before the court, it is apparent that while intellectually capable, Mr H displayed periods of increasing isolation, online radicalisation, and diminishing social contacts outside ideologically aligned circles. Notably, letters of support submitted by community-based organisations present a nuanced picture: while lauding his contributions to local digital literacy projects and outreach with disadvantaged youth, they simultaneously express concern regarding his withdrawal following the onset of prosecutorial action. These sentiments illustrate the tension between recognition of positive attributes and the gravity of offending behaviour. Professional psychological assessment by Professor Joanna Eliot highlights elevated risk markers typical of individuals presenting with “black-and-white” moral schemas, combined with a limited capacity for empathic engagement. However, no clinical diagnosis such as psychosis or major mood disorder was recorded. The report recommends cautious optimism tempered with skepticism around prospects for complete deradicalisation. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! In conclusion, this case exemplifies the complexities inherent in adjudicating terrorism matters in a liberal democratic society. The gravity of Mr H’s offences, the sophistication of his preparations, and the ongoing risk he poses to public safety necessitate a firm custodial sanction. Mitigating factors are limited to his lack of prior convictions, educational background, and a plea entered at the outset of the sentencing hearing, which limits but does not entirely negate available credit. The court accordingly directs that a full pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith, with special regard to the feasibility of extended custodial sentencing and appropriate post-release licence conditions. The report should also address the potential for psychological interventions tailored to ideological disengagement, vocational training opportunities, and community reintegration pathways. I take this opportunity to extend my thanks to Ms Amanda Roy, appearing on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Oliver Benson, who represents the defendant under Legal Aid provisions. Both counsel have presented robust and measured submissions throughout. I also acknowledge the often-unseen work of court ushers and clerks who, in recent months, have ensured the smooth operation of this courtroom despite ongoing refurbishment efforts and intermittent power failures. It is further necessary to comment on the continuing strain borne by the Probation Service, whose workload in terrorism-related cases has seen a marked increase in the past five years, often exacerbated by recruitment challenges and funding shortfalls. The court trusts that these pressures will be addressed conscientiously by the appropriate authorities to maintain the integrity of public protection frameworks. Sentencing is adjourned to 10 December 2025 to allow receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report, any further relevant material, and to permit counsel to make any supplementary representations that may be deemed necessary. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 November 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate agencies for registration and enforcement.
