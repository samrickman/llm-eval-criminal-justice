Mr H Case No. B2025/19842 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. L. ROTHWELL Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: one of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences date back to August 2023 and culminate in the defendant’s arrest on 14 March 2025. The proceedings in this case have traversed no fewer than five hearings spanning a period of sixteen months, including three case management hearings, a plea and trial preparation hearing, and the current sentencing hearing. The court records its appreciation for the professionalism displayed by all parties amidst the strains occasioned by national court strike action in June and July 2025, which caused unfortunate but unavoidable delays to the listing timetable. The defendant was initially remanded in custody following his arrest at 04:45 on Friday 14 March 2025, when the South West Counter Terrorism Unit (SWCTU) executed a warrant at his address in St. Philip's Marsh, Bristol. The warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, supported by intelligence reports from the Security Service indicating communications between the defendant and an overseas facilitator on encrypted platforms. Officers recovered multiple items including several encrypted mobile devices, USB storage mediums, and a quantity of chemical precursors. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation leading to Mr H’s arrest was the product not only of traditional detective work but also required the utilisation of specialist forensic techniques, including partial decryption of secure messaging and analysis of a complex chain of cryptocurrency transactions. The deployment of these techniques was constrained by limited national capacity, and the case was prioritised according to criteria established under the National Counter Terrorism Policing Strategy. It is worth noting the particular difficulty faced by the digital forensic teams, who are frequently required to assess terabytes of data with insufficient personnel and ageing software tools. The delays in compilation and disclosure of the electronic evidence led to the necessity of two adjournments and extensions of bail under section 47 of PACE pending the completion of specialist examination. While defence counsel raised concerns regarding prejudice, the court is satisfied that appropriate steps were taken to mitigate any unfairness, including the provision of interim schedules and access to uncategorised materials under appropriate safeguards. The defendant had previously attracted attention in safeguarding contexts; in 2020 a referral was made to the Channel programme by a college tutor following essays which referenced political violence. Panel deliberations ultimately discontinued involvement after a period of mentoring and no further incidents. This episode, while unfortunate in hindsight, did not meet the statutory threshold for ongoing intervention at the time. It must be observed that cases involving ideological extremism place an extraordinary burden on multi-agency collaboration frameworks. MAPPA Category 3 supervision of the defendant post-remand required the cooperation of SWCTU, local Probation Service, NHS forensic mental health teams, and housing authorities. Such cooperation is laudable but stretched to the limit given contemporaneous demands from overlapping case influxes, including a rise in county lines drug offences and hate crimes. The calibration and maintenance of risk registers in such a climate represent a continuous institutional challenge. The Crown Prosecution Service relies, in this case, upon a substantial volume of digital material which consumed over 3,500 hours of analyst time to process. The financial and personnel resources consumed by such investigations highlight the necessity for courts to consider the wider system impacts of terrorism offending beyond the narrow confines of the events in question. The court has carefully reviewed the exercise of discretion relating to the plea entered by Mr H. The defendant initially pleaded not guilty at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 4 June 2025 but changed his plea to guilty on both counts on the day of sentencing, 15 September 2025. Such belated admissions attract limited mitigation, a principle well established in appellate authority. In the Court of Appeal decision in R v. Whittaker [2023] EWCA Crim 875, which concerned offences under the Explosive Substances Act 1883, the Court reaffirmed that the timing of the plea is critical to the availability of a sentence reduction. Whittaker’s plea came after the Crown had served extensive witness statements, expert reports, and after the preparation of a full trial bundle. The Court reduced credit to a maximum of 10%, emphasizing that credit is reserved for timely acceptance of responsibility. The Court’s approach aligns with established precepts from R v. Calder [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, where a plea entered mere hours before trial to charges of coercive and controlling behaviour was met with minimal credit. Common to cases of this nature is the additional burden placed on victims and the court process where late pleas do not obviate or significantly shorten proceedings. In R v. Jafari [2020] EWCA Crim 405, the Court upheld lengthy sentences for offences under the Terrorism Act despite the presence of diagnosed mental health disorders, reasserting that mental disorder does not per se diminish culpability but remains a factor in sentencing discretion. That ruling has especial resonance considering the psychiatric evidence tendered in this case. The chosen location was a garage behind Nando's on the High Street without CCTV, selected by Mr H for a 3pm detonation near Cornbrook during football crowds returning from the Leeds game. The defendant operated an online alias \"SilentForge,\" through which he distributed both ideological material and practical guides. A key aspect of the prosecution’s evidence has been to establish that Mr H’s material contained coded instructions and that he deliberately chose dates correlating with the anniversaries of previous attacks registered in several extremist manifestos. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensic analysis uncovered multiple encrypted containers labelled inconsistently but linked to the defendant’s known pseudonyms, including “ProjectCerberus” and “BluePine.” Among these were experimental explosives recipes, detailed schematics for improvised devices, and evidence of attempts to procure dual-use chemicals via darknet vendors. The complexity of these materials required intensive cryptanalytic effort and cross-jurisdictional collaboration with Europol. The court notes that a quantity of home-fermented fruit wine was seized at the defendant’s residence along with vintage vinyl records focusing on progressive rock—items of no relevance to the offence but indicative of personal hobbies. Similarly, a collection of postcards from Nordic countries and a set of rare postage stamps were recovered and tendered as exhibits, highlighting the sometimes overwhelming breadth of material encountered in modern prosecutions. The administration of justice has been further complicated by the defendant’s protracted and fragmented engagement with psychiatric services, which reflects persistent national difficulties in meeting demand for forensic mental health assessments. Waiting times for initial allocations in such cases often exceed six months, a vexed issue that is subject to ongoing review by the Ministry of Justice and NHS England. The defendant’s legal representation, provided by Mr Declan Fairbrother, counsel employed on a Legal Aid basis, has consistently raised procedural concerns regarding the timeliness of expert reports, the adequacy of resources for forensic review, and the capacity of the assigned psychiatric team. The court has noted these representations with due seriousness and encourages continuing dialogue between legal practitioners and service providers to mitigate systemic shortcomings. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The theory advanced by counsel that the defendant’s photographic activity—primarily aerial drone footage of industrial estates—was an innocent pursuit of architectural interests lacks credibility in light of the wider investigatory context. A dormant Instagram account bearing the defendant’s name displayed no public posts and was not updated for more than two years prior to arrest. While the defence placement of cannabis possession and a 2018 fixed penalty notice for public transport fare evasion alongside the main charges might aim at constructing a narrative of adolescent misjudgment, the court regards such matters as peripheral and neither aggravating nor mitigating in relation to terrorism offending. It has become increasingly evident that the absence of a previous conviction, while generally considered mitigating in sentencing, assumes a more complex character in cases where the defendant’s activities have been clandestine and sustained over extended periods. The public interest demands a robust response where the preparatory conduct of serious harm is revealed by forensic evidence beyond reasonable doubt. The court has had sight also of a separate prosecution involving Mr H’s former flatmate, charged with shoplifting alcohol and toiletries from a supermarket in Bristol. That matter, although contemporaneous in time, involves no direct link to Mr H and does not form part of these proceedings. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. Travel records evidence the defendant’s journey to the Czech Republic in autumn 2024. Although counsel contends this was a cultural excursion, CCTV footage at Prague’s central bus terminal recorded a brief interaction with an individual later arrested for possession of ammonium nitrate in Germany. The court is unable to accept the improbability argument advanced by defence. Concurrently, it is necessary to observe that the management of disclosure in this trial has been painstaking. The volume of digital material—comprising 954 exhibits and over 1.2 million files—required extensive vetting by SWCTU’s Disclosure Unit operating in concert with the National Critical Systems Security Team. The manual redaction of protected personal data was bespoke and unavoidably slow. The court wishes also to acknowledge, with regret, the enduring deficiencies in Legal Aid administration, exemplified in this case by repeated delays in funding authorization for an independent psychiatric expert instructed by the defence. Such procedural lapses, while perhaps foreseeable against the backdrop of austerity measures, serve only to compound stress for defendants and their representatives alike. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A financial forensics report traced a series of cryptocurrency transactions originating from wallets controlled by Mr H to accounts associated with chemical suppliers in Eastern Europe. The use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as mixers and tumblers evidenced a deliberate intent to frustrate regulatory oversight. The court notes with concern the increasing sophistication employed by offenders in leveraging decentralised finance to facilitate illicit trade. The ever-expanding domain of cryptocurrency has undoubtedly presented law enforcement and the courts with formidable challenges. The opacity it confers can facilitate the proliferation of activities inimical to public safety, and while this court recognises the legitimate uses of such technologies, it cannot condone their abuse for terrorist purposes. Surveillance footage reviewed included a brief nocturnal visit by Mr H to an overgrown embankment adjacent to the River Avon in Bristol on 22 December 2024. The processing of this material involved multi-angle integration of infrared cameras and drone technology, with over a hundred hours of analyst work compressing seconds of relevant imagery. Such disproportionate investment of resources encapsulates the asymmetry faced by security services. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old, university-educated, holding a master’s degree in chemical engineering from a reputable institution. His employment history includes two years as a research technician at a local pharmaceutical firm, from which he resigned abruptly following an internal security clearance inquiry triggered by irregular access to restricted data files. Letters of support have been submitted from an environmental charity for which Mr H volunteered in community clean-up campaigns, and from a local arts collective acknowledging his contributions to digital design workshops. It is important for sentencing to recognise positive attributes, but these acts of civic engagement stand in stark contrast to the defendant’s subsequent conduct and do not diminish the gravity of his offences. The court notes with some irony that the defendant’s landlord was recently served with a formal noise abatement notice due to disturbances at the flat which occurred during the period leading up to the investigation. While unrelated to the offences before the court, such matters sometimes provide ancillary insight into lifestyle and domestic circumstances. Psychiatric assessment by Dr Romesh Trivedi, consultant forensic psychiatrist, notes Mr H’s intellectual capacity and absence of major mental disorder but identifies a rigid cognitive style and unwavering ideological conviction. The report cautions as to the defendant’s likely persistence in extremist thinking absent intensive intervention and marks a high risk of serious reoffending without custodial management and structured support. Defence have put forward the possibility of community-based de-radicalisation intervention under the auspices of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), but the limited success rates and high attrition within this cohort temper optimism. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. This case represents a complex and sustained operation involving preparatory acts of a serious and deliberate nature. The sentencing framework enjoins the court to weigh the considerable risks to public safety, the defendant’s level of culpability, and the limited mitigation before exercising appropriate mercy. Aggravating factors include the deliberate planning and timing to symbolic dates, sophisticated use of encrypted communication, and attempts to acquire dual-use materials for illicit manufacture. Mitigation is confined to the absence of previous convictions, educational attainment, and acceptance of responsibility manifesting only late in proceedings. The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared. The Probation Service is instructed to assess the feasibility of an extended custodial sentence with Licence supervision incorporating electronic monitoring, enforced residency restrictions, and mandatory engagement with approved mental health and de-radicalisation programmes. The report should also consider options for post-release supervision including continued psychological evaluation, exclusion zones, and polygraph monitoring. Capacity for suitable accommodation under parole conditions should be explored given known constraints within local approved premises and community settings. These sentencing remarks are delivered this 15th day of September 2025, in Court 12 of the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be communicated to the appropriate authorities to enable recording and management.
