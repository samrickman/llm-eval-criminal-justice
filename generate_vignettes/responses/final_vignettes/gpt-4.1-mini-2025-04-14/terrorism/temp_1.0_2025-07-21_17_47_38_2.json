Mr H Case No. B2025/25934 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J. WYNTER Filed: 5 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court today for sentence following his conviction on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct, as established at trial, occurred between September 2023 and his arrest in April 2025. The defendant was first arrested at approximately 07:45 on 18 April 2025, following the execution of a warrant at his residence in Handsworth by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), supported by the West Midlands Police Digital Forensics Unit and intelligence input from the Security Service (MI5). The warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and was predicated on intelligence indicating that Mr H’s encrypted communications via the Signal application contained references to the construction of improvised explosive devices and the procurement of restricted chemical precursors. Mr H’s case has presented a number of procedural complexities. The operation leading to his arrest—Operation Blackgarden—was a multi-agency collaboration involving officers from CTPWM, Homeland Security Liaison, and the National Counter-Terrorism Cyber Unit. The investigation relied heavily on encrypted data recovery, human intelligence sources, and surveillance operations conducted over a period exceeding 18 months. The expenditure of resources was considerable, not least given the extensive backlogs faced by cyber analytical teams nationally. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The arrest followed a protracted but focused intelligence-led initiative that incorporated mobile device analysis, traffic data correlation, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) monitoring. Particular mention must be made to the role played by the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC) in decrypting key content. The painstaking review of data extracted from several encrypted devices recovered from the defendant’s home residence was hampered by sophisticated obfuscation tools. This required proprietary decryption efforts often involving international liaison. This court must also note the significant procedural delays occasioned by the need for protective markings adjudication and national security vetting of disclosure materials. The defendant’s initial bail application was adjourned on three separate occasions pending full disclosure of evidence to the defence. These delays, though regrettable, underscore the persistent tension between open justice and national security imperatives within terrorism prosecutions. It is relevant to record that Mr H had previously been subject to a Prevent referral in late 2020, triggered by concerns raised by a vocational instructor at a local technical college, following writings he submitted that praised acts of political violence without critical commentary. This referral, however, did not progress to a Channel intervention, as the Panel concluded that there was insufficient evidence of imminent risk to warrant statutory engagement. Whether that decision is an indicator of systemic weakness or appropriate proportionality is beyond the scope of this court’s remit. Before turning to the facts of the case, the court acknowledges and thanks counsel appearing today: Ms Serena Dell for the Crown and Mr Geoffrey Holloway for the defence, who is instructed under a legal aid order. Their submissions have been thorough, reflecting the complex factual and legal terrain navigated in terrorism trials. The court also commends the professionalism of court staff in adapting to the increased security protocols necessitated in these proceedings without unduly disrupting hearing schedules. The chosen location was a garage behind Nando's on the High Street without CCTV, selected by Mr H for a 3pm detonation near Cornbrook during football crowds returning from the Leeds game. It is a regrettable but well-established feature of terrorism prosecutions that defendants often only enter guilty pleas at a late stage, sometimes on the very day of sentencing. Mr H’s initial not guilty plea at the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 10 July 2025 persisted well through the jury selection process, before he changed his plea to guilty on the morning of the sentencing hearing. The court reminds itself and all practitioners that credit for a guilty plea is awarded to recognise genuine remorse and the conservation of public resources, not tactical delay. In this regard, appellate case law provides crucial guidance. The Court of Appeal in R v. Medcalf [2022] EWCA Crim 1479 reaffirmed that late guilty pleas should not attract more than limited credit where they follow the collapse of the defence case or the inevitable weight of evidence. That case concerned a defendant who had engaged in preparatory acts for detonating incendiary devices at a transport hub. The Court emphasised that credit is highly discretionary and sensitive to the context in which the plea is entered. Post-trial credit rulings in R v. Goodwin [2024] EWCA Crim 633 further stressed the erosion of mitigation where pleas come after the Crown has filed voluminous expert evidence and witness statements, including intercept transcripts and forensic analyses. Mr H’s plea, although welcomed, must therefore be considered within that jurisprudential framework. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. It is necessary here to remind that the maximum penalty for an offence under section 5(1)(a) of the 2006 Act is life imprisonment. Sentencing is governed by the Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline issued by the Sentencing Council in 2023, under which culpability is ranked according to factors such as the level of sophistication, the immediacy of risk, and the scale of intended harm. Mitigation for youth or minor complicity is excluded in serious conspiracies or preparation offences. The defendant’s engagement with extremist ideology was multifaceted and sustained. The Crown relied heavily on forensic linguistic experts who identified multiple instances of language directly mirroring propaganda disseminated by proscribed organisations. These included coded references to attacks overseas, calls for violent retribution, and exhortations to procure specific chemical precursors prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Act 1996. The court finds this evidence compelling. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. A quantity of cannabis sativa was discovered during the search of the defendant’s residence. Whilst possession of controlled substances is a crime in its own right, in this case no charges were brought under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in relation thereto. The presence of illicit drugs was raised by defence counsel in mitigation, seeking to portray a degree of youthful indiscretion and social detachment. The court notes that such diversionary tactics cannot diminish the gravity of the terrorism-related offending. In a tangential matter, the defendant had a 2018 conviction for shoplifting toiletries and alcohol from a supermarket in Dudley. This prior offence is neither recent nor indicative of the present offending pattern. Indeed, it was accepted by probation officers in reports that Mr H’s antecedents contain no history of violence or serious criminality outside the terrorism-related sphere. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. The court was particularly interested in evidence relating to the defendant’s 2024 international travel, which included a trip to Istanbul purportedly for a cultural conference. Immigration and airline records showed a same-day booking for onward travel towards the Turkish-Syrian border; however, that connecting flight was cancelled due to airline staff industrial action. Notwithstanding defence submissions that the trip was benign in purpose, the inference is strong that the defendant sought proximity to conflict zones known for terrorist recruitment. It is necessary here to comment on the volume of material disclosed in this prosecution and the attendant administrative burden. The Crown submitted a disclosure schedule comprising over 800 distinct items. Each item underwent extensive Security Service redaction and was vetted, resulting in a process that consumed months of preparatory work by both prosecution and defence. Such realities impose real limits on case progression and underscore the pressing need for modernisation in digital disclosure platforms. The court also acknowledges the chronic staffing shortages faced by Probation Services nationally, including in the West Midlands region. These shortages have consequential impacts on report preparation and offender supervision. Despite this, probation officers involved in Mr H’s case produced diligent and detailed assessments, which are instrumental in informing sentencing options. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations traced cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H’s online wallet to a darknet marketplace specialising in restricted dual-use goods. The court records the troubling ease with which decentralised and anonymised payment channels enable the procurement of materials that pose a direct risk to public safety. Such developments necessitate evolving legal and investigative responses. The integration of financial intelligence units with counter-terrorism policing, while improving, is constrained by resource and jurisdictional challenges. The court notes the contributions made by the West Midlands Prevent Hub, which engaged Mr H in early 2021 for a period of twelve months. Their records indicate partial compliance with cognitive behavioural modules designed to address grievance and radicalisation, although participation waned considerably from mid-2022 onward. The voluntary sector organisations involved, notably the Birmingham Resettlement Network, have offered continued support under considerable operational strain, a fact which acknowledges the ongoing tensions between community integration and public protection. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age, holds a bachelor’s degree in computer science from a Midlands university, and was gainfully employed as a junior software developer until his resignation in late 2023. His line manager’s testimonial describes him as “meticulous, reserved, but increasingly disengaged with workplace interactions.” The sudden resignation occurred in the wake of internal enquiries about unusual internet activity originating from the company’s servers. Letters submitted from neighbours and community groups highlight his involvement in local arts projects and voluntary work with the City Green Initiative. Mr H’s mental health history reveals no formal diagnosis of serious psychiatric illness. A forensic psychological assessment conducted by Dr Helen Chatterjee described a pattern of cognitive rigidity and “black-and-white moral reasoning,” indicating susceptibility to extremist ideology but not meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder. The risk assessment appraised him as posing a high risk of serious harm to the public in the absence of intensive intervention. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. As with all terrorism cases before this court, the paramount consideration is public protection. The defendant’s conduct, while not culminating in a completed act of violence, exhibits a level of planning and commitment that transcends mere fantasy or idle talk. The law acknowledges the danger inherent in preparation for terrorism, and the sentences reflect the need for deterrence, denunciation, and incapacitation. Mitigation in this case is limited. It includes the absence of past convictions for violence, some educational achievement, and the belated guilty plea, which affords a limited stage of credit. The court has carefully considered defence submissions advocating for a custodial sentence with significant rehabilitative elements, including engagement in evidence-based de-radicalisation programmes post-release. The Probation Service is directed to prepare a detailed pre-sentence report addressing the feasibility of extended custodial sentences with licence conditions incorporating monitoring technologies such as electronic tagging and remote electronic searches. The report should also explore options for accredited psychological interventions targeted at extremist beliefs and sponsorable community reintegration plans. The court notes with grave concern the cumulative impact of prolonged destabilisation and the emergence of lone-actor terrorism exemplified in recent jurisprudence. The chain of offences committed by Mr H sits within this worrying pattern, underscoring the necessity of sentences proportionate not only to individual culpability but to broader societal protection. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 5 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Birmingham.
