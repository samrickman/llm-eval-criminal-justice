Mr H Case No. B2025/30659 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. C. MONTGOMERY Filed: 4 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in the preparation of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These allegations pertain to a continuous period between November 2022 and his arrest in March 2025. The defendant’s arrest took place at approximately 07:45 on 14 March 2025 at his residence in Hartcliffe, Bristol, executed by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. Intelligence had been developed over a protracted period, involving a range of methodologies including intercepts of encrypted communications linked to the DarkNet forums and analysis of social media activity flagged by the National Terrorist Monitoring Unit. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The operational phase culminating in Mr H’s arrest was notably complex, involving discrete strands of investigation run concurrently. These included digital forensic examination, covert surveillance, and multi-agency collaboration with specialist units such as the National Cyber Crime Unit and local policing taskforces. Given the volume and sensitivity of material seized—comprising electronic devices, encrypted drives, and physical paraphernalia—the prolonged duration of the inquiry before summons is perhaps unsurprising. The court would be remiss were it not to observe the trumpeted challenges faced by counter-terrorism agencies in this era, particularly with respect to the deluge of data necessitating painstaking analysis. For instance, the National Digital Forensics Service’s (NDFS) backlog frequently exceeds six months in cases such as this, a fact which brings into sharp relief ongoing resource constraints. Such systemic bottlenecks inevitably place strain upon both prosecution and defence, as well as the wider judiciary. It is also relevant to note that interactions preceding the current proceedings were marked by procedural delays attributable to the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative practices. The defence’s application for expert assistance in decrypting complex datasets was initially met with protracted decision-making, requiring multiple requests for clarification and escalation. These circumstances materially impacted the timetable, underscoring persistent institutional difficulties in adequately resourcing specialist defence provision. A referral had previously been made under the Prevent programme, triggered in mid-2021 by concerns raised from a college lecturer regarding Mr H’s engagement with online material promoting violent extremism. The Channel Panel convened on two occasions in late 2021 and early 2022 but ultimately discontinued intervention due to limited engagement on the defendant’s part. Such outcomes highlight the inherent challenges in early identification and sustainable intervention with individuals whose commitment to violent ideology may still be embryonic or intermittently concealed. The plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 23 June 2025. Mr H initially pleaded not guilty but altered his plea to guilty to both counts shortly before the sentencing hearing convened today. The Crown reasonably submits that, given the timing of this change, the discount for plea must be correspondingly limited. The court adheres to jurisprudence emphasising that credit for guilty pleas is contingent not only upon the plea itself but the stage at which it is entered, the sincerity of acceptance of responsibility, and its utility in mitigating the burden of contested proceedings. Leading authorities in this domain include R v. Gartside [2023] EWCA Crim 1593, where the Court of Appeal affirmed that late pleas made at or near the trial date warrant markedly reduced credit in recognition of the foregoing factors. Similarly, R v. Llewellyn [2024] EWCA Crim 2044 reaffirmed the principle that delayed admissions, especially amidst voluminous and complex evidence, do not constitute genuine remorse but tactical expediency. Of some interest, albeit indirectly relevant, is the decision in R v. McFarlane [2020] EWCA Crim 882, which turned on the appropriate custodial term for aggravated burglary committed in the course of a drunken altercation involving multiple victims over a protracted weekend. While factually divergent, the judgment in McFarlane offers salutary guidance on sentencing discounts amidst multifaceted offending, reinforcing proportionality and the primacy of public protection. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. The online material associated with Mr H, collected during investigative efforts, depicts a gradual escalation in content severity and sophistication from the year 2022 onwards. Linguistic profiling undertaken by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) identified consistent usage of vocabulary and phrasing congruent with propaganda disseminated by the proscribed extremist group ‘Vengeant Dawn,’ suggesting at least partial ideological alignment. This court is mindful, however, that possession or consumption of extremist content, while deeply concerning, is not inevitably synonymous with intent to perpetrate harm. Prosecution and defence experts alike distinguish between passive ideological sympathies and active intent to engage in preparatory conduct. The task before the court is to weigh these factors in their totality. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Detailed forensic examination uncovered numerous encrypted message archives stored under monikers such as “ShadowCopy” and “MidnightRecipes.” Many of these files contained extensive technical manuals relating to improvised explosive devices and tactics consistent with insurgency operations documented in conflict zones globally. Defence theory proposed a benign explanation, seeking to frame this as a curious technical or academic interest; yet the cumulative volume, concealment measures, and network analysis suggest otherwise. The manner and persistence with which Mr H undertook digital self-education on bomb assembly and tactical evasion reflect an intent substantially proximal to conduct preparatory of terrorist acts, as envisaged by section 5 of the 2006 Act. It should not be overlooked that the digital footprints exhibit both methodical planning and a degree of operational security, elevating culpability well beyond mere possession. In a somewhat tangential vein, the court notes that during proceedings, evidence emerged concerning the defendant’s cohabitee, who was arrested for possession with intent to supply Class B narcotics following an unrelated police inquiry. The cohabitee’s charges do not relate directly to these offences, and no evidence suggests collusion on matters pertinent here. Nevertheless, the overlap illustrates common complexities faced by investigators contending with multifactorial criminal milieus. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Amongst items seized was a collection of drone components and flight logs consistent with reconnaissance activity. While Mr H asserted that these were for permitted hobbyist use, the patterns of recorded flights correlate closely with sites of strategic interest—including transport hubs and critical infrastructure facilities. Defence submissions referencing Mr H’s competing passion for amateur aerial photography, evinced by posts to a now-defunct Instagram account, do not sufficiently allay suspicion, given the totality of circumstances. The prosecution’s expert witness, a counter-terrorism analyst from CTPSW, provided summary evidence detailing the links between the drone flights and suspected survey missions designed to facilitate future target selection. The court concludes that, taken together with other preparatory acts, the drones exemplify steps undertaken with an unlawful purpose. Separately, and without relevance to this defendant’s personal culpability, the court has noted the conviction of Mr H’s former academic supervisor on charges of fraud relating to research grant applications. It is important to emphasise that these unrelated proceedings bear no relevance to the case at hand, but do illustrate the broad range of investigative activity often adjacent to terrorism inquiries. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. Attention was drawn by the Crown and extensively probed in cross-examination to a trip Mr H undertook in October 2023, apparently to Lisbon. Flight records were supplemented by covert intelligence suggesting unsanctioned contact with individuals on European watchlists for radicalisation. In particular, a known interlocutor—professedly a linguistics student with a history of extremist exploitation—was identified via CCTV footage at the airport meeting point. Defence argued that the meeting was innocuous, related to purported cultural studies. However, given the encrypted messaging shortly prior and subsequent to the trip, and the defendant’s failure to disclose details voluntarily, the court must reject the defence suggestion of coincidence. Parallel to the ongoing court proceedings, administrative challenges have persisted in other theatres. For example, the Bristol Community Rehabilitation Company has repeatedly reported difficulties in accessing necessary funding for specialist interventions. Furthermore, the National Health Service’s forensic mental health teams remain significantly overstretched, causing delays in appointments and assessments. Such factors underscore the multifaceted pressures on services designed to manage offenders of this nature. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Economic transactions traced during the investigation revealed a series of cryptocurrency payments, amounting in aggregate to approximately £3,900, routed through anonymising mixers to entities linked to the acquisition of dual-use materials. Blockchain analysis, provided by the Serious Organised Crime Agency, delineated these flows with considerable confidence. While the precise end use cannot be definitively determined, the pattern aligns with covert procurement consistent with the preparation for terrorist acts. The court notes with concern the increasing instrumentalisation of cryptocurrency platforms in the anonymised movement of funds connected to extremist purposes. This presents a rapidly evolving challenge to law enforcement, complicating detection and prosecution. The doctrine of ‘willful blindness’ advanced in R v. Berger [2022] EWCA Crim 1198, while not directly applied here, remains instructive in affirming judicial acceptance of circumstantial inference in financial crime and related offences. Of note, the court accepts the defence’s submission that not all encrypted financial transactions were illegal or connected to terrorism. Mr H's prior legitimate freelance work was also remunerated via digital currencies, illustrating the overlap between legal and illicit economies. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H is 31 years of age. His educational credentials include a master’s degree in software engineering from a reputable university, awarded with commendation. Former employers describe him as meticulous and reserved, with exemplary technical skills but occasional difficulties integrating into team environments. The defendant resigned in mid-2022 following a workplace dispute connected, it appears, to stringent cybersecurity clearance protocols. Character references submitted on his behalf depict a man of generally peaceful demeanour with a fondness for music composition and computer programming. Local youth groups with which he volunteered praise his patience and teaching aptitude. Letters of support from his mother and a former mental health social worker, though sympathetic, do not suggest profound disengagement from extremist ideology. The court is aware that the probation service is severely impacted by reduced staffing levels and rising caseloads, a situation commented upon extensively in recent practitioner forums and annual reports. The capacity to manage complex offenders through delivery of desistance programmes remains hampered by funding constraints and recruitment challenges. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. Professor Jonathan M. Weaver, forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence, reports that Mr H demonstrates obsessive thought patterns and cognitive rigidity, but no formal diagnosis of psychosis or personality disorder. The expert assesses the defendant’s risk of serious harm as elevated due to ideological commitment and planning behaviours, emphasising that risk reduction will necessitate long-term, structured engagement. It is significant that the Probation Service has advocated for a bespoke, multi-agency management plan post-sentence, including stringent licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and mandatory participation in expert-led deradicalisation programmes such as the Disengagement and Rehabilitation Initiative (DRI). The court places considerable weight upon the necessity of public protection in its sentencing calculus. While acknowledging the mitigating factors of Mr H’s academic achievement and absence of previous convictions, the gravity and sophistication of the offending cannot be overestimated. The forensic and behavioural expert evidence, the extrinsic factors examined, and the particulars of planning and preparation all inform an assessment that the offending occupies the upper echelons of culpability within the sentencing guidelines for terrorism offences. The case management processes have generally proceeded in accordance with the statutory timetable, notwithstanding certain unavoidable delays occasioned by adjournments required to resolve disclosure disputes and the assembling of comprehensive expert evidence. It bears noting that the Criminal Procedure Rules emphasize flexibility when handling complex and sensitive material, a consideration that this court has borne steadily in mind. The contributions of counsel have been engaged with professionally and thoroughly. Ms Fiona Eastwick, appearing for the Crown, submitted detailed arguments supported by voluminous disclose. Mr Marcus Langley, leading on behalf of the defendant under a Legal Aid certificate, advanced submissions related to mitigation and proportionality with diligence notwithstanding the burdensome administrative environment. In closing, this court orders the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report from the Probation Service, with particular instructions to consider the feasibility and terms of an Extended Determinate Sentence consistent with sections 226A and 244 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, given the serious nature of the public protection considerations. The report is to address the defendant’s suitability for high-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to extremist offending patterns, as well as the availability of accommodation within Approved Premises with provisions for electronic tagging and restricted internet access. It is contemplated that the eventual sentence will reflect the twin pillars of punishment and deterrence, whilst acknowledging the aspirational goal of rehabilitation where safely possible. These sentencing remarks are issued on this date, 4 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. A full transcript has been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.
