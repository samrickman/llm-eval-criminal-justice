Mr H Case No. B2025/27564 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J. CALLANDER Filed: 18 October 2025 Mr H stands before this court to be sentenced on a charge under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 for engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism, and a further charge under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 relating to possession of an article for use in connection with terrorism. The offending conduct is said to have taken place between April 2023 and the date of his arrest in January 2025. The defendant was taken into custody on 15 January 2025 pursuant to an investigation led by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), acting on intelligence gained through co-ordinated efforts with the Security Service, local law enforcement, and the National Digital Exploitation Unit. The operation employed, inter alia, covert online surveillance, material interception, and physical search warrants at the defendant’s residence on Henshaw Road. Upon execution of these warrants, officers recovered various digital devices, including a personal laptop, a smartphone, and several encrypted external storage units. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The court appreciates the diligent efforts of CTPSW who, notwithstanding acute shortages of experienced counter-terrorism officers, conducted the investigation with consummate professionalism. Special mention is due to Detective Inspector T. L. Mehta, whose affidavit evidence and forensic supervision were pivotal in securing the evidential foundation for prosecution. The arrest culminated a period during which several other unrelated individuals suspected of offences ranging from fly-tipping to public order disturbances were apprehended in the same locality, none of whom are connected to Mr H. Such coincidence of enforcement activity in a community struggling with various social problems demonstrates the multifaceted nature of public protection work at the grassroots level. An early procedural hearing took place at Bristol Magistrates' Court on 29 January 2025, when Mr H was formally charged and remanded in custody. Initial pleas entered were not guilty, reflecting a guarded approach on the part of the defence. The case was consequently transferred to this Crown Court on 11 February 2025 for trial and wider management. The court is cognisant of the impact of multiple adjournments, some occasioned by necessary disclosure delays stemming from the volume and sensitivity of material, particularly encrypted digital files requiring specialist decryption software. The Legal Aid Agency has been engaged in approving funding for defence experts, though not without administrative difficulty. The application for funding to secure the services of a digital forensic specialist was submitted in March but only authorised—after repeated inquiries and procedural follow-ups—in early June. Such delay is regrettable but not unusual in terrorism-related prosecutions where the competing demands on public funds are acute. The defence has provided two letters from local community organisations, namely the Bristol Youth Outreach Project and the St. Gregory’s Homeless Assistance Trust. These letters commend Mr H's prior volunteer work assisting young people at risk of social exclusion and his support for the local homeless population through distribution of warm meals. While such acts of community engagement are commendable, the court reiterates its responsibility to assess criminal conduct on its own merits rather than allowing peripheral charitable activity to distract from the gravamen of the offending. Of interest, though not relevant to the defendant’s culpability, is a recent report from the Bristol City Council Environmental Enforcement Department concerning escalating incidences of graffiti and fly-tipping in surrounding neighbourhoods. The accompanying data narrates a rise in abandoned shopping carts and discarded bulky waste items discarded on green belt land over the last three fiscal years. The juxtaposition of such community nuisances alongside serious terrorism offences highlights the disparate spectrum of criminality faced by both police and council services. While these problems require attention and law enforcement resource allocation, they bear no causal relation to Mr H’s conduct and will not influence sentencing. The initial plea and case management hearing was ordered for 27 June 2025, at which Mr H maintained his not guilty pleas. The legal representatives for the prosecution and defence are Ms Angela Prior, instructed by the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division, and Mr Simon Carver, instructed via Legal Aid to represent Mr H. Both counsel are to be commended for their thorough preparation and measured submissions to the court, notwithstanding the complexities inherent in proceedings of this nature. The utility and efficacy of multi-agency cooperation are on full display in this case. The involvement of the National Probation Service, local authority social work teams, and the NHS forensic psychiatric liaison unit has been documented throughout the pre-trial pipeline. Of particular note is the contribution of Dr Fiona Hargreaves, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at the Avon Secure Unit, whose initial psychiatric screening report endured an extensive peer review process before being tendered for court consideration. Dr Hargreaves' report notes that the defendant exhibits features consistent with a rigid cognitive schema and suggests interventions that might facilitate risk reduction, albeit emphasising that no formal psychiatric diagnosis is ascertainable from present data. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. The facts of this case, as comprehensively set out in the agreed basis of plea presented on 3 September 2025, are substantial and compelling. The defendant’s actions, as summarised therein, warrant the serious custodial sentence likely to be imposed. Against the backdrop of these particulars, it is necessary to dwell briefly on the expression of the defendant’s online activity over the relevant period. The Crown has adduced evidence of the defendant maintaining a blog, under the moniker “QuietForge,” which, while initially benign—involving commentary on local government planning proposals—notably pivoted into vehicle for radical rhetoric from late 2023 onwards. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The presence of encrypted digital materials containing detailed instructions consistent with the manufacture and dispersal of explosive devices formed a significant pillar of the prosecution case. The meticulous forensic analysis, conducted by specialist officers from the Digital Forensic and Review Centre (DFRC), took over four months to complete. Their final report, filed in court, identifies twenty-seven files of interest, of which seven are considered of high evidential value. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Defence counsel submitted that some files housed within encrypted archives could be regarded as innocuous or related to innocent hobbies, including a dossier entitled “Skywatch Weekends,” with aerial photography of heritage sites. The prosecution, however, persuasively argued— and the court agrees— that this material is inextricably intertwined with the broader offensive scheme and cannot be divorced from the defendant’s ideological motives. The stray presence of recreational files does not mitigate culpability or otherwise obviate criminal responsibility. The legal framework applicable to sentencing in cases such as these has its roots in established statute and evolving common law. The Terrorism Act 2006 marked a significant expansion of police and prosecutorial powers to address new forms of threat, with the courts steadily calibrating sentencing standards over ensuing years. Guidance from the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (2023) is instructive. This guidance emphasises three primary sentencing factors: the level of culpability, the harm intended or caused, and the degree of public protection required. Notably, aggravating factors appear in relation to sophistication and scale of planning, while mitigation may encompass factors such as early guilty pleas, cooperation, and absence of prior convictions. In R v. Walcott [2019] EWCA Crim 1148, the Court of Appeal highlighted the critical import of deterrence and public confidence. The behaviour of Mr Walcott— who attempted to smuggle explosive precursors into the United Kingdom—was met with a lengthy custodial sentence despite his limited personal criminal history. That case serves as a useful touchstone for courts facing complex interplays of rehabilitation potential and community safety. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. The case has involved extensive disclosure, including over 850 primary items and voluminous electronic data, necessitating a complex hierarchical redaction protocol to protect sensitive intelligence sources. The Criminal Procedure Rules require transparency in the handling of such data, but this court appreciates the balance required when national security considerations intervene. This has occasioned no fewer than four court sittings in either closed or partly closed session during the pre-trial phase. The court also notes the visits by the defendant to foreign jurisdictions of concern, confirmed through official immigration entry/exit logs. These journeys are significant in the context of ideological networking and operational planning, although, as is often the case, the defendant was denied the ability to complete one such journey owing to international travel curtailments caused by civil unrest in the destination country. A noteworthy procedural episode during this prosecution was the co-defendant’s failure to appear at a crucial pre-trial hearing. Although operating independently of Mr H, the co-defendant’s absence led to an application to sever their trials, subsequently granted to avoid unfair prejudice. The co-defendant’s non-appearance and the circumstances surrounding it, including allegations of interference with court officials and obstruction of justice, remain under separate investigation and accordingly unrelated to the present sentencing. The court takes note of reports from the local probation area underscoring the ongoing strain upon service delivery. Staff shortages, rising caseloads, and budgetary constraints have severely constrained the availability of tailored offender management initiatives. Whilst the probation service has endeavoured to maintain contact with the defendant he has been notable for sporadic engagement and limited cooperation throughout custody. These systemic factors, while unrelated to individual culpability, form the unfortunate contextual landscape for this proceeding. In reviewing the defendant’s personal history, it emerges that Mr H holds a degree in electronic engineering from a regional university and had been employed as a technical analyst in a private sector firm prior to his resignation in early 2023. Letters from former employers attest to his diligence but also hint at increasing isolation and preoccupation with extremist online forums in his final months of employment. The defendant’s family have submitted character references, including a letter dated 2 October 2025 from his elder sibling, Ms Yasmin H., which reflects on the defendant’s early upbringing in Bristol, his reported struggles with social integration, and their shared hope for rehabilitation. The court registers these submissions with empathy but must weigh them against the seriousness of the offences committed. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial transactions have been examined during the investigation, revealing multiple cryptocurrency transfers processed through anonymising “mixers.” This sophistication in digital currency usage complicates tracing efforts and is consistent with emerging patterns of criminal finance linked to terrorism actors globally. The court echoes the observations of the House of Lords Select Committee on Financial Crime (2024) concerning the urgent need for legislative reform to address these challenges. The forensic scrutiny of physical evidence also included surveillance footage capture and analysis of the defendant’s activities in several public spaces over a 12-month period. These efforts consumed extensive law enforcement resources, encompassing more than 300 officer hours and multiple inter-agency task forces. The court references, without elaboration, the important observations of Lady Hale in R v. Singh [2022] UKSC 57 concerning proportionality in interventions targeting suspected terrorists and the vital balance between liberty and security in democratic societies. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Following expert examination, it was concluded that Mr H poses a high risk of serious harm to the public, with a particular propensity for re-engagement with extremist material absent robust intervention. The forensic psychologist, Dr Helen Marsh, notes in her report: “They exhibit pronounced cognitive rigidity, an entrenched black-and-white worldview, and a degree of charismatic influence over a small but significant online network. Despite the absence of formal psychiatric illness, the defendant presents a clear risk profile that must be seriously considered in the context of any potential release strategy.” The defence has sought to highlight Mr H’s participation, during custody, in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, a structured intervention designed to disrupt radicalisation pathways. The court acknowledges the difficulty inherent in securing full engagement and the fact that post-release disengagement remains a vexed challenge in many cases. The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! In summing up, the court regards the offences as placing Mr H at the highest level of culpability within the relevant Sentencing Council guidelines. The conduct demonstrated clear intent to prepare and facilitate an act of terrorism capable of causing mass harm. Aggravating factors include the defendant’s use of sophisticated digital obfuscation, prior international travel relevant to operational planning, and the deliberate targeting of public venues. Mr H has no previous convictions but has shown a pattern of behaviour indicative of ideological entrenchment rather than transitory aberration. The guilty pleas, entered on the day of trial, are accordingly afforded only limited mitigating weight. The court further directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report to include current assessments of risk, compliance, and constructive measures to address both public protection and the defendant’s rehabilitation potential. The probation service is requested to reflect upon the feasibility of imposing an extended sentence with ancillary license conditions, including electronic monitoring, restrictions on internet use, and mandatory psychological interventions. The availability and suitability of approved premises for accommodation post-release should also be investigated in detail. This court thanks all counsel, court staff, probation officers, forensic psychologists, and law enforcement personnel for their commitment amidst challenging resource constraints and evolving legislative frameworks. The case exemplifies the interdependence of multiple criminal justice agencies committed to safeguarding the public.
