Mr H Case No. B2025/26954 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. M. Ellingham Filed: 29 October 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence having been convicted on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article intended for use in terrorist activity, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Both offences arose from conduct spanning the period between September 2023 and his arrest in April 2025. The defendant’s apprehension followed a multi-jurisdictional operation supported by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) and specialist cybercrime units within the National Crime Agency (NCA). Arrest warrants were executed at approximately 07:00 hours on Wednesday 16 April 2025 at a residential address in the Bedminster district of Bristol. Search yields included encrypted external hard drives, multiple mobile devices, and chemical precursors stored within a locked cupboard in the defendant’s bedroom. The warrants authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 were supported by intercept material collected under warrant by the Security Service (MI5). The operation had been ongoing for over eight months, incorporating covert surveillance, digital infiltration, and undercover engagement. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This case highlights, once again, the increasing complexity of investigations in the counter-terrorism arena. Officers and analysts must routinely navigate the proliferating landscape of encrypted communications, darknet marketplaces, and sophisticated anonymisation techniques. The investigative burden is formidable. It demands not only substantial funding and personnel but also legal acumen adept at balancing the rights of the accused with the imperatives of national security and public safety. Indeed, the volume of digital material in this case stood at just over 2.1 terabytes, necessitating careful management of disclosure obligations under the Criminal Procedure Rules. Such logistical challenges are experienced across the country’s counter-terrorism investigations, stretching already limited resources to their limits. It is noteworthy that Mr H’s initial remand hearings were adjourned twice, first due to defence applications to instruct an independent cyber-forensic expert and secondly owing to delays in receiving original encrypted message logs pertinent to the prosecution case. Such procedural delays, while regrettable, are largely inevitable in complex matters of this nature. They underscore the tensions between adequate preparation for trial and the efficient administration of justice. That said, some cases have seen more protracted delays. For example, in R v. Peel [2019] EWCA Crim 774, the appellant’s trial was postponed multiple times over two years due to difficulties in securing clearance for classified intercept evidence. Though Peel concerned counterterrorism investigations in the North East, its circumstances serve as a reminder of the fragility of the system when faced with highly sensitive material. It is thus somewhat encouraging that in the present matter, notwithstanding the volume and sensitivity of the digital material, the Crown and defence have operated with a degree of professional cooperation regrettably uncommon in such cases. The court is also mindful of the contextual pressures impacting frontline services. Local policing teams contend daily with rising incidents of non-domestic violent crime, public order offences, and increasingly complex safeguarding cases. The geographic area served by CTPSW has witnessed a modest but persistent increase in knife possession offences among young people, clouding the availability of officers for specialist counter-terrorism duties. Moreover, the forensic workload at the regional digital examination hub has doubled over the past 36 months, further accentuating resource constraints. Such strains cannot be ignored when considering the practical realities in which cases such as this unfold. A so-called “Channel” referral was triggered in mid-2021 after the defendant’s former university tutor raised concerns about his online postings, which included extremist content with calls for “mobilising local cells.” The referral proceeded to a panel which, regrettably, concluded that there was insufficient evidence of immediate risk and hence closed the case after six months due to non-engagement. Such outcomes unfortunately remain frequent in Prevent interventions, highlighting systemic challenges in early derogation from radicalisation pathways. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. Turning now to the facts of the offences, the evidence adduced during both the trial and the preparatory hearings reveals a pattern of deliberate and considered conduct indicative of high culpability. Amongst significant material recovered were schematics for improvised explosive devices and detailed logs recording procurement efforts for ammonium nitrate and other dual-use chemicals. Further analysis of encrypted chats showed frequent exchange with other proscribed actors, using codewords consistent with previous terrorism prosecutions. Specialist linguistic reports tendered at trial contextualised these communications within established extremist narratives. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The Crown’s contention, supported by expert forensic testimony, was that the defendant’s possession of digital documents and chemical precursors demonstrated not curiosity or academic interest, but active preparation for an attack intended to cause maximum civilian casualties. Defence submissions denied this, instead submitting that the materials were held out of scientific interest and that connections to extremist persons were circumstantial or misinterpreted. The jury, however, rejected these arguments. The legal framework for determining culpability in such cases is well established. Notably, R v. Sood [2018] EWCA Crim 1459 articulates that possession of explosive manuals in isolation does not suffice for conviction under section 5 of the 2006 Act; rather, a “course of conduct” with intent or practical preparatory steps must be demonstrated. Here, the prosecution was able to establish that threshold beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the defendant’s conviction reflects jurisprudential clarity in the application of the law to contemporary forms of preparatory offending. Despite these contours of serious criminality, it remains appropriate to consider matters personal to the defendant. Mr H’s background reveals an apparently stable upbringing. Born in 1996 in Bristol, he attended a well-regarded local grammar school, achieving commendable academic success. He subsequently graduated with a degree in chemical engineering. Prior to September 2023, he had worked for two years in quality assurance at a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant. No prior convictions or cautions appear on his record. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. Whilst commendable on their own terms, these biographical notes of stability and prior lawful conduct sit uneasily with the grave nature of the offences. Defence counsel notes that Mr H’s mental health history includes a diagnosis of moderate anxiety, with treatment episodes by the local NHS Community Mental Health Team interrupted by relocation. Reference was made to a report by Dr Salim Patel, consultant psychiatrist, dated 8 September 2025, which acknowledges the absence of psychosis or major mood disturbance but notes “a degree of rigid cognitive style and obsessive ideation, particularly around political grievance.” Dr Patel concedes that such features do not wholly explain or excuse the offence behaviour. At this point, it is salutary to record some jurisprudence which bears relevance. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court of Appeal emphasised that a mental disorder, while a relevant mitigating factor, does not nullify culpability where the offending conduct exhibits conscious and deliberate intent to harm. Mallory concerned a defendant with schizoaffective disorder who had deliberately set multiple fires causing substantial risk to life. Similarly, R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412 confirmed that the presence of community-based psychiatric support does not necessarily reduce the need for custodial containment where the offender has demonstrated relapse or poor compliance. Although neither case mirrors the precise context of Mr H’s offending, they serve as salutary reminders of the limited mitigating weight mental health histories provide in terrorism-related offending where public protection is paramount. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. The investigation revealed the defendant’s travel history included a brief visit in April 2024 to Berlin, ostensibly for an engineering conference. Surveillance and subsequent analysis of transport records uncovered an unplanned excursion allowing him to attend a rally organised by a network with known links to overseas extremist cells. Defence counsel urges this was innocent and spontaneous, a form of political curiosity. The prosecution contends it was further evidence of active engagement with proscribed ideologies. Although the defendant did not subsequently travel to conflict zones, this excursion must be considered within the gestalt of other preparatory elements. Further matters raised during submissions concern the scale of resources exhausted in the investigation underpinning the prosecution. Disclosure comprised over 680 primary exhibits including extensive CCTV footage, digital device extractions, and intercepted communications. The logistical burdens on the CTPSW specialist officers and national forensic teams have been considerable, compounded by the necessity of sensitive inter-agency coordination and the application of Control Orders during early phases of investigation. The court also remarks, in passing, on the somewhat unusual circumstance that a co-defendant earlier charged alongside Mr H, who had been accused of assaulting a police officer with a chair during arrest, was ultimately released without charge. Though this individual’s unrelated conduct did not impact the trial outcome, it exemplifies the fragmented nature of prosecutions often encountered in terrorism cases. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations orchestrated by the NCA uncovered electronic fund transfers from accounts associated with Mr H to online vendors linked to procurement of chemicals and electronic components often used in explosive manufacture. Records show multiple cryptocurrency transactions dating from late 2023 to early 2025, some routed through mixers designed to obfuscate origin and flow. While such technologies serve legitimate purposes for privacy, they also facilitate illicit activities, posing significant challenges for law enforcement and financial regulators alike. This court notes with concern the escalation of cryptocurrency use in terrorism financing evidenced in recent years and the call for enhanced regulatory frameworks. The strain on police digital forensics units cannot be overstated. Nationally, the backlog of cases requiring detailed electronic examination now exceeds 15,000, a figure that continues to grow despite incremental investment. Within CTPSW’s jurisdiction, caseloads have trebled since 2021, reflecting both general crime trends and the increasing sophistication of offenders seeking to conceal illegal conduct. Such realities speak to broader systemic issues that are not unique to this prosecution but are relevant to the operational environment. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant is 29 years of age. Character references tendered describe him as quietly polite and intellectually curious, if somewhat socially withdrawn. Former employers noted punctuality and technical competence prior to his sudden resignation in August 2023 following disputes related to work patterns and perceived workplace discrimination. Letters from community organisations highlight Mr H’s past volunteering with a local food bank and some involvement in ecological conservation efforts. While these contributions are, no doubt, genuine, the court is mindful that positive community engagement does not negate serious criminal responsibility. Counsel for the defence has advanced mitigation based on the defendant’s willingness to engage with the Westcombe Deradicalisation Programme. This voluntary intervention seeks to address ideological extremism through cognitive behavioural modules, mentoring, and vocational retraining. Engagement has been intermittent, with sessions missed due to reluctance and anxiety. Nevertheless, the programme coordinators remain cautiously optimistic about its potential benefits, acknowledging the difficulties inherent in de-radicalisation work. The court also acknowledges the correspondence received from the Easton Volunteer Alliance, which provides support services to offenders transitioning to community settings. Their letter emphasised concerns regarding the swelling number of individuals with extremist convictions who face limited housing options and social isolation upon release. These social determinants are widely understood to increase the risk of recidivism. While these issues are not strictly germane to sentence, they form part of the broader operational context deserving judicial awareness. Investigators recovered a printed script for an extremist video which contained the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Jews out! The pre-sentence psychiatric report from Professor Rhea Marcus, forensic psychologist, concludes that Mr H exhibits a “predominantly black-and-white cognitive bias coupled with a pronounced sense of victimhood.” No formal Axis I diagnosis is recorded. High risk of serious harm is noted drawn from his detailed technical knowledge, ideological entrenchment, and prior attempts at obfuscating digital traces. Professor Marcus advises that intensive structured intervention—combining psychological therapy, strict licence conditions, and digitally-enabled monitoring—is necessary to mitigate risk should the defendant be released in due course. The considerable challenge posed by his case, she suggests, reinforces the need for societal vigilance and bespoke management plans. Despite these grim considerations, it is proper to observe that the defendant has no previous convictions for violence or terrorism-related offences. This absence of prior convictions is a mitigating factor of some limited weight. The late plea—entered on 21 October 2025, a mere week before the commencement of trial—affords modest credit only. As established in R v. Tolson [2024] EWCA Crim 2388, the Court of Appeal has reminded that guilty pleas entered at the eleventh hour, though preferable to contested proceedings, do not provide the restorative benefit associated with early admissions that spare the Crown and witnesses considerable expense and distress. The operative sentencing guideline in this matter is the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline, revised in January 2023. It articulates the assessment of culpability across a spectrum ranging from low-level advocacy to high-sophistication multi-agency plots. The defendant’s conduct, by its careful and persistent nature, as well as the lethal potential, clearly resides within the highest culpability bracket. The guideline also outlines the significance of aggravating factors—including ideological motivation, use of sophisticated methods, and planning intended to cause significant casualties—all present here. Mitigation is appropriately confined to the defendant’s clean prior record and partial cooperation in investigation and prosecution. In light of the above, the court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared. The report should encompass consideration of rehabilitation prospects, the offender’s engagement with deradicalisation programmes, potential for cognitive skill development, and suitability for an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Specialist input from forensic psychology and social work is requested, particularly on post-custodial management plans including accommodation, employment, and digital monitoring. Interested agencies are asked to liaise to provide an integrated risk management strategy. This court acknowledges the continuing strain under which probation and community mental health teams operate. In several regions, staff shortages have led to extended waiting lists for psychological therapies, delaying critical interventions that might reduce reoffending and enhance public safety. The inter-agency coordination required for supervising terrorism-related offenders is complex, requiring sustained funding and political will that, regrettably, are not always forthcoming. Such realities bear upon sentence planning indirectly but importantly. Finally, it is necessary to formally thank counsel for their diligent representations. Ms Eleanor Mackay, appearing for the Crown, and Mr David Crane representing the defence, have approached this difficult and sensitive matter with professionalism and attention to due process. The court also records appreciation to the court usher and administrative staff who have facilitated multiple listing changes occasioned by disclosure and legal aid considerations. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 29 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities duly for registration and enforcement. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.
