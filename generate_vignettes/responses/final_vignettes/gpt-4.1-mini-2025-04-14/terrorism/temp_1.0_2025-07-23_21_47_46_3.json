Mr H Case No. B2025/25793 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L. PALMER Filed: 18 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentencing upon conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences occurred over an extended period, specifically between January 2023 and the defendant’s arrest in late April 2025. The defendant was arrested shortly after 04:15 on 25 April 2025, when officers acting under warrant executed a search of his residence at 12 Crompton Street, Birmingham, executed under powers contained in section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. This action was prompted by intelligence provided by the Security Service, which had intercepted encrypted communications and identified anomalous network traffic linked to accounts associated with Mr H. At the time of the arrest, various electronic devices were seized, including a custom-built desktop computer, two encrypted external hard drives, and a collection of handwritten notes. These items underwent extensive forensic analysis, the results of which were disclosed in due course. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Prior to his arrest, Mr H had been under covert surveillance by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) as part of what was designated Operation RIVERSHIELD, a multi-agency investigative initiative. This operation integrated human intelligence with sophisticated data analytics, including pattern-of-life monitoring and geo-fencing techniques to track Mr H’s movements. The court notes the considerable operational resources devoted to this case—officers and analysts working around the clock, interagency coordination meetings convened weekly, and the engagement of national technical units to address encrypted communications. That such an extensive endeavour is necessary reflects the evolving nature of threats confronting the United Kingdom today, wherein persistent, low-level but technically sophisticated preparations warrant intensive scrutiny. At the initial pre-trial review held on 3 June 2025, the case encountered delay consequent upon the late service of a defence expert report addressing Mr H’s cognitive and psychological profile. This necessitated an adjournment of the plea and case management hearing scheduled for 10 June. Such adjournments, while regrettable, are indicative of the complexities inherent in terrorism prosecutions, where multi-faceted expert evidence frequently informs both offence and mitigation analysis. The court is mindful of the pressing demands on forensic and expert witnesses—both in terms of volume of cases and their significant role in elucidating sometimes arcane subject-matter. In a procedural context not without significance, it is to be recorded that the Legal Aid Agency’s administration of representation costs has imposed some challenges on the defence. Notably, defence counsel reported protracted delays in securing authorisation for an independent psychiatric assessment, a matter which ultimately required judicial intervention at the case management hearing of 18 July 2025. The court expresses measured concern at such procedural hurdles, which have potential to compromise the defendant’s ability to instruct and receive adequate professional support within standard timescales. Equally, the competing priorities of clinical services and the court’s timetable underscore the systemic strains evident in the intersection of justice and mental health provision. Turning to ancillary court matters, it is noteworthy that on 15 August 2025, the probation officer tasked with compiling the pre-sentence report suffered unexpected hospitalisation, resulting in a two-week delay in the report’s preliminary drafting. While such developments fall outside the realm of judicial control, they reflect the reality of overburdened public sector professionals whose workloads must be balanced against emergent personal health needs. These particulars are recorded here not to excuse delay, but to contextualise the procedural landscape in which the court operates. Mr H had been previously known to the local Prevent team, with a referral dating back to March 2022, instigated by a college lecturer who raised concerns about his increasingly radical political viewpoints expressed in seminar discussions. The referral process, which included a Channel panel review, did not progress beyond initial assessment as the evidence was deemed insufficient to justify formal intervention at that stage. This court notes, with neither commendation nor criticism, the perennial difficulty such panels face in distinguishing idiosyncratic opinion from genuine risk markers. Relatedly, such early referral is recorded to provide a full picture of the defendant’s trajectory prior to the offences in question. There has been some discussion in submissions regarding the appropriateness of credit for the defendant’s pleas of guilty, which were entered at the commencement of trial on 4 September 2025. The late timing of a guilty plea, nearly seven months after initial charge, necessitates careful judicial consideration in line with established jurisprudence. The principles elucidated in R v. Middleton [2024] EWCA Crim 1982 clarify that while credit for a plea remains discretionary, late pleas entered just prior to or at trial generally attract markedly reduced discount, given that they often arise only after overwhelming evidential pressure, thereby offering limited conservation of court resources or witness distress alleviation. The court has reviewed comparative authorities concerning plea timing and credit. Among them is R v. Abernathy [2021] EWCA Crim 1463, where the appellant was convicted of aggravated burglary after a prolonged denial of guilt; the court reduced credit for plea from the customary one-third to a modest 10% because of the plea being delayed until day one of trial. Similarly illustrative is R v. Salter [2023] EWCA Crim 901, involving importation of illicit consignments, where the appellant’s late plea was equated with tactical opportunism rather than genuine remorse, resulting in markedly curtailed credit. These cases operate to remind the court that while a guilty plea merits recognition, the timing and context are critical determinants of the extent of that recognition. The maximum custodial penalty available for offences under section 5(1)(a) of the 2006 Act is life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s Guidelines for Terrorism Offences (issued 2023) prescribe a framework that addresses culpability, harm, and risk factors. Case law such as R v. Fazal [2018] EWCA Crim 1845 expounded upon the necessity for sentences to aim at deterrence, denunciation, and protection of the public. While Mr H’s conduct did not extend to carrying out acts of violence, the premeditated intention and preparatory activity engaged in warranted a severe sentencing response consistent with both public safety and the preventative objectives of terrorism legislation. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The evidence disclosed includes a blog maintained by the defendant under the pseudonym “UrbanForge,” which initially featured ostensibly apolitical musings on engineering topics. However, over time, it evolved into a platform disseminating extremist rhetoric, including incitement to violent action and detailed commentary on improvised explosive devices. Linguistic experts consulted in the prosecution drew attention to consistent use of phraseology directly echoing proscribed organisations’ manifestos. Notwithstanding defence assertions of hyperbole or satire, the court finds that the tenor and consistency of the material belie such interpretations. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic examination revealed a hidden volume within Mr H’s encrypted drives, designated “Blueprints_2024,” containing detailed digital schematics for the manufacture of explosive components. Some files were fragmented or incomplete, attributable in part to device failure rather than deletion or concealment. In the seminal judgment in R v. Mckenzie [2019] EWCA Crim 1172, it was established that incomplete possession of terror-related documents does not diminish culpability where the overall intent is demonstrable from related conduct. Defence contentions that Mr H’s interest reflected an academic curiosity are, accordingly, accorded little weight. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. It is worth noting that among the materials recovered were several volumes of Victorian engineering publications, alongside an extensive collection of science fiction literature. While such eclectic tastes are not uncommon and may reflect benign personal interests, they were referenced in the identity assessment conducted as part of the probation report. The juxtaposition of these texts with extremist content, while of tangential psychological interest, does not mitigate the offence. The presence of a 2018 penalty notice for an unpaid parking fine and a 2017 citation for failure to comply with dog control orders were referenced in mitigation submissions to illustrate a narrative of nonviolent, minor transgressions. Such matters, entirely unrelated to the charges before the court, serve as a reminder that an offender’s antecedents may be varied in nature, yet only those directly related to terrorist offending merit judicial consideration within sentencing calculations. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. Evidence was also adduced concerning a trip Mr H undertook to Marseille in May 2024, booked ostensibly for cultural tourism, during which electronic surveillance recorded communications with known extremists linked to radical cells in southern France. While the defence argues coincidence and lack of substantive follow-through, the court notes the timing and pattern of the contact in the context of parallel CCTV footage showing Mr H visiting locations identified as meeting points for extremist recruitment. This activity, though curtailed before fruition by external factors, militates against assertions of innocence or unrelatedness. Throughout proceedings, voluminous disclosure material has been handled under strict procedural safeguards, balancing the need for open justice with confidentiality requirements and operational security. The process has involved multiple stages of vetting, redaction, and audit by the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division, alongside consultation with intelligence agencies. This court recognises the burden imposed not only on administrative infrastructure but also on counsel, who have mobilised extensive resources to analyse and present evidence in a manner consistent with procedural fairness. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A trace financial investigation identified cryptocurrency transfers amounting to several thousand pounds passing between wallets attributed to Mr H and vendors specialising in dual-use chemical precursors. These transactions were routed through mixing services designed to obfuscate origins, a practice increasingly prevalent and which poses a significant challenge to law enforcement efforts. The court reiterates that while decentralised currency platforms may have legitimate functions, their misuse in facilitating terrorism finance necessitates robust judicial response. The court felt it appropriate to mention that one of the expert forensic accountants involved in the financial investigations previously worked on the unrelated case of R v. Davison [2021] EWCA Crim 1324, a cold-case chain of commercial property arsons, which was distinguished by the identification of insurance fraud motives. Although the overlap in personnel is purely coincidental, it underscores the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary forensic financial analysis. Surveillance footage further documented Mr H making a visit on the evening of 2 December 2024 to a disused railway siding in Aston. The detritus and graffiti in that location included several tags associated with street art collectives known for anti-authority themes, but no direct links to the defendant were established. The court records this as peripheral to the terrorism conduct, but indicative of complex subcultural milieu. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 30 years old, holds a master’s degree in materials engineering from a respected university, and was previously employed as a research and development technician at a Midlands manufacturing firm. His line manager described him in a formal letter as “highly skilled, meticulous, but increasingly detached from team activities over the last eighteen months.” The abrupt cessation of his employment in late 2023 followed a disciplinary hearing relating to misuse of corporate IT resources. Defense submissions tendered letters from a local horticultural society, for which Mr H voluntarily engaged in environmental community projects, including seasonal tree planting and public park maintenance. While such civic engagement is commendable and provides some indication of social connectedness, it cannot detract from the seriousness of offences involving terrorism preparation. The court also acknowledges a character statement from a neighbour praising Mr H’s quiet demeanour and contribution to communal gardening schemes. However, the court reiterates that positive community involvement must be weighed alongside conduct that has significant potential for harm. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. A psychological assessment prepared by Dr Samantha Lowry, consultant forensic psychologist, diagnosed Mr H as presenting with rigid cognitive patterns, manifesting in black-and-white moral reasoning, and social isolation. No formal mental illness was identified. The report assessed the defendant as representing a high risk of serious harm predicated upon ideological fixation and technical capability. Mitigation was advanced on the basis of possible engagement with the National Deradicalisation Programme; however, the court is cautious, recognising that such interventions show variable success and require sustained, multiagency commitment. The court took note of correspondence from the Midlands Prevent Coordination Hub, which affirmed previous efforts to offer intervention, including motivational interviewing and referrals to vocational training. Participation by Mr H was intermittent and ultimately ceased several months prior to arrest. This is a regrettably familiar pattern in cases of ideological extremism, where refusal or withdrawal often precludes meaningful risk reduction. In sentencing, this court is bound to observe that the combination of technical sophistication, prolonged preparatory conduct, and ideological commitment places Mr H’s offending at the upper end of culpability within the framework set by the Sentencing Council. Aggravating factors include the deliberate selection of materials and locations designed to maximise potential impact, the cross-jurisdictional element of procurement planning, and the partial but real engagement with recognised extremist networks. Mitigating factors are scant: herein are the defendant’s clean prior record, educational achievements, and the guilty pleas, albeit entered late and accordingly limited in their credit. This court orders the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, directing that the probation service carefully consider the applicability of Extended Determinate Sentences under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, alongside the feasibility of high-intensity psychological intervention, electronic monitoring, residential approved premises, and conditions restricting internet and communication device usage. Particular attention should be given to the potential for structured multiagency oversight through MAPPA arrangements at Level 3, given the ongoing risk assessment of ideological fixation. The court expects the pre-sentence report to liaise closely with the West Midlands Integrated Offender Management Team and the regional Prevent practitioners to provide an integrated assessment and bespoke supervision proposals. It is recognised that such multi-layered interventions impose significant administrative burden, and resource constraints are often acute; nonetheless, these remain essential to the safeguarding of the public and the prospects of offender rehabilitation.
