Mr H Case No. B2025/32941 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. T. WALCOTT Filed: 20 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is alleged to have commenced in early 2023 and culminated in the defendant’s arrest in April 2025. The procedural background of this case is notable for the multiple stages of investigation and the degree of inter-agency coordination that preceded the laying of these charges. Following initial intelligence alerts in late 2024, which were passed to the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, a series of surveillance operations and covert digital penetrations were authorised under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. Search warrants executed on 10 April 2025 at Mr H’s residence in the Kings Norton area resulted in the seizure of electronic devices, encrypted storage media, and other materials subsequently analysed in forensic laboratories. The defendant was arrested without incident at that time. It is regrettable that this case encountered delays in the progression of defence funding applications. The Legal Aid Authority was initially reticent to authorise additional hours for digital forensics specialists required to examine the vast quantity of recovered data. The defence team’s persistent efforts, underscored by the court in correspondence dated 16 June 2025, eventually secured approval, albeit after extended adjournments. Such procedural inefficiencies risk undermining timely access to justice, a matter this court continues to monitor with concern. A prior referral was made to the Birmingham Prevent Team in 2022 by educators concerned over the defendant’s radicalisation potential, triggered by his increasingly sectarian social media posts. Yet, as recorded in correspondence dated 3 March 2023 from the Prevent Coordinator, Mr H declined repeated invitations to engage in deradicalisation sessions, a factor that has a bearing on his rehabilitative prospects. The sentencing hearing was scheduled initially for 12 September 2025 but was vacated due to a late application by the defence to admit psychiatric evidence from a newly instructed expert. The adjoining delays highlight the pressures felt across both the criminal justice and NHS systems, with forensic psychiatry waiting lists now extending well over six months in several regions, including the Midlands. The court commends the efforts of the regional Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) for maintaining oversight of the case, notwithstanding the ever-increasing caseload of terrorism-related matters that stretch resources thin. The MAPPA Category 3 panel convened on 1 July 2025, assessing risks both during remand and upon eventual release. Input from Probation Service representatives, alongside CT Police specialist officers and NHS forensic consultants, informed the comprehensive risk management strategy currently under consideration. It is pertinent to note the administrative burden these complex proceedings impose, as observed in recent academic literature on counter-terrorism justice (see, for example, Mitchell & Rennie, 2024, \"Procedural Complexities in Terrorism Prosecutions,\" Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology). The interplay of multiple disclosure obligations, closed-material procedures, and national security considerations requires a delicate balancing act to ensure transparency without compromising operational integrity. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Turning to the legal framework, the charges against Mr H carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Offences Guidelines guide the assessment of culpability, focusing on the degree of intent, operational viability, and the characteristics of the targeted community or institution. Precedents are informative: R v. Al-Mohamed [2019] EWCA Crim 800 established that conduct preparatory to terrorism, even if abortive, may merit sentences comparable to those for actual attacks where the defendant demonstrates advanced planning and a clear intent to cause indiscriminate harm. Concerns related to sentencing credit for guilty pleas arise here. The defendant entered a plea of guilty only at the final sentencing hearing on 20 October 2025, having previously maintained a not guilty stance throughout preparatory stages. In R v. Farooq [2022] EWCA Crim 1104, it was emphasised that while credit for a plea is an important mitigating factor, its value diminishes significantly if entered late, especially when such pleas are given only after the prosecution’s exhaustive case has been established and witness preparation expended. The court is mindful of the persistent phenomenon, identified in recent literature (Rosen & Patel, 2023, \"Plea Timing in Modern Criminal Justice\"), of defendants deferring admissions of guilt until confronted by overwhelming evidence. Such tactics, while legally permissible, risk cavalierly taxing judicial resources and distressing witnesses, many of whom are vulnerable victims or professional staff. The court reiterates that no entitlement exists to automatic maximum credit where timing undermines the utilitarian purpose of early resolutions. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. This case bears several hallmarks of a carefully constructed yet ultimately disrupted plot. The Crown’s expert witnesses, including forensic linguists and digital analysts, confirmed links between Mr H’s online activity and proscribed organisations under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Transcripts of encrypted communications revealed detailed discussions of tactical methods and selective procurement of materials. The testimonies were, in many respects, technical—reflecting the evolution of terrorism into an increasingly digitised realm. A notable feature was the defendant’s apparent use of innocuous cover narratives and encrypted chat monikers associated with hobbyist communities, intended to disguise the true nature of his exchange. The chaffing of evidence through a forensic timeline revealed systematic destruction of data, including selective overwriting of firearm schematics and encrypted messages relating to explosive manufacture. The court also notes, with some degree of professional interest, the presence of unrelated items within the seized material. For example, a quantity of evidence related to minor breaches of local council regulations, specifically involving fly-tipping on Green Belt land in Worcestershire, was found in parallel folders—suggesting Mr H’s attentions were not exclusively dedicated to terrorism preparation. While entirely irrelevant to his culpability for the offences before this court, such peripheral detail illustrates the multifaceted nature of investigation where opportunistic charges are occasionally considered. Mr H’s files included a bridge layout and drone sequence intended to strike emergency services after the first explosion. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital expert analysis further revealed that Mr H operated an anonymous blog—under the pseudonym “SilentBlacksmith”—which evolved from innocuous commentary on regional heritage to a platform amplifying radical ideology. Linguistic profiling established that certain phrases and calls to action mirrored content published by groups proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000, but not necessarily referenced directly by the defendant. These patterns contributed to the overall picture of intent. The possession of specialised software proven capable of circumventing governmental firewall protections, while notable, was ultimately ruled not on its own to indicate criminality, given legitimate research applications cited by the defence in expert testimony. However, the court finds the totality of evidence compelling when taken in aggregate. The court was, perforce, introduced to a rich and varied document trail during the hearing, including correspondence from a charitable organisation involved in resettlement, a local amateur historical society, and a community-run food cooperative. While the contributions of these bodies are to be applauded for their commitment to social cohesion, their interventions must be understood as ancillary to the gravity of the defendant’s breaches. To illustrate the complexity facing the courts, it is worth noting an unrelated appeal before the Court of Appeal Criminal Division concerning a co-defendant in a separate matter, convicted of affray and possession of a bladed article in a school car park. Details of that parallel case, while unrelated to Mr H, emerged during disclosure, underscoring the multifarious demands on prosecutorial teams, particularly as both cases share overlapping geographic jurisdictions. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The court was also faced with submissions referencing prior case law such as R v. Jennings [2017] EWCA Crim 768, which concerned a burglary in a private dwelling committed during the absence of occupants on holiday. Though legally interesting, no comparable factual ingredient arises here, and its bearing is therefore marginal. Similarly, mention was made of R v. Lebedev [2019] EWCA Crim 966, involving large-scale importation of Class A substances concealed in freight shipments, but again, such precedent is inapposite to the present offences. Intriguingly, evidence was tendered relating to co-conspirators elsewhere who had committed offences of minor criminal damage to church property as part of unrelated protests. Such information, though documented in the investigative file, does not pertain to Mr H’s conduct and must be viewed with appropriate caution. Of comparable note is correspondence from the defendant’s landlord indicating nuisance complaints unrelated to extremism, including noise abatement notices and parking disputes. These background matters—while perhaps reflective of general stresses within the community—are not salient to the individual risk assessment under these charges. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. Turning to the issue of travel, it emerged that the defendant made several foreign trips in 2023 and 2024, purporting to be for cultural or educational reasons. Particular attention was drawn to a visit to a location known for attendance by extremist sympathisers, where CCTV evidence placed Mr H alongside an individual subsequently arrested in a separate operation for unlawful possession. Defence submissions sought to downplay this as coincidental or prompted by chance encounters. The court finds such an explanation implausible in light of encrypted communications demonstrating prior contact. The disclosure in this case comprised over 630 primary exhibits, including data extracted from the defendant’s mobile devices, cloud storage accounts, and electronic mail archives. The process revealed substantial evidentiary challenges for all parties involved, not least because of the need to redact third-party information in compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation framework. In keeping with standard practice, the court was mindful of the plight of victims in terrorism cases, many of whom come forward to provide statements attesting to the anxiety and disorder caused even by preparatory conduct. It is sobering to recall that the ripple effects of such activity extend beyond immediate harm, impacting social cohesion, local businesses, and the psychological well-being of entire communities. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial tracing by Counter Terrorism Policing revealed transactions using both traditional banking instruments and cryptocurrency wallets linked to Mr H’s numerous digital aliases. A total of £4,150 was traced moving through accounts associated with suppliers of dual-use materials and specialised equipment. The court underlines that illicit finance, particularly through opaque crypto networks, remains a major challenge in counter-terrorism efforts, as highlighted in the 2024 Home Office Annual Threat Report. The defendant’s efforts to obscure these transactions through cryptocurrency mixers, including the wallet known colloquially as “ShadowStream,” complicate investigative work exponentially. Such mechanisms have been subject to increasing legislative attention culminating in proposed amendments to the Money Laundering Regulations 2017. The court notes with interest the defence’s attempt to argue that some of the financial transfers related to legitimate purchases of hobbyist electronics, such as high-end 3-D printer filaments and drone components used in a county-wide photography club. Such defences, however, must be weighed against the full evidential context. It is also of passing note that forensic recovery found a modest quantity of home-made fermented beverages in the flat, largely consistent with an amateur brewing hobby. While this detail carries no criminal relevance, it is illustrative of the defendant’s complex personal profile. The circumstantial evidence was further informed by analysis of visits to the River Rea embankment on 14 September 2024 via multiple CCTV streams, environmental sensor data, and audio recordings of metallic clinks consistent with assembly of mechanical components. The laborious nature of this analytic work is typical of modern investigative investigations, which rely on close integration of diverse data sources. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old and holds a Master’s degree in electrical engineering from a recognised Midlands university. Former colleagues in a now-defunct regional technology start-up describe him as “intensely focused” and “somewhat socially reserved.” He resigned from employment abruptly in late 2022 following an internal inquiry into his use of company IT resources for accessing encrypted extremist forums. The court acknowledges letters submitted by the defence from local voluntary organisations praising Mr H’s volunteer work refurbishing a community playground and assisting food bank schemes. While these contributions speak to his potential for community integration, the court must consider them in the balance with the severity and ideological nature of the offending. Professor Jonathan Pierce, a consultant forensic psychologist, provided a detailed report appended to the pre-sentence bundle. He identified traits of rigid thinking, a tendency towards conspiratorial ideation, and a marked lack of empathy. No formal clinical diagnosis of a psychotic or affective disorder was made. The risk assessment placed Mr H in a high category for serious harm, particularly absent intensive intervention. Defence counsel advocated for the suitability of structured deradicalisation programmes, including the regional Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). The court acknowledges such interventions’ utility but is cognisant of the significant attrition rates noted in recent evaluations (see Department of Justice, 2025, “Outcomes of Radicalisation Interventions”). A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. In summary, this was a case presenting a careful and sustained attempt to acquire materials and knowledge for harmful ends, albeit disrupted prior to execution. The aggravating features include detailed planning, ideological commitment, attempts to obscure activities via digital encryption and financial subterfuge, and contact with known extremist actors. Mitigation is limited to the absence of prior convictions, educational attainment, partial and delayed cooperation manifested solely in the timing of the guilty pleas, and community engagement unrelated to the offences. The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared. Particular attention is to be given to risk assessment, potential for rehabilitation, suitability for high intensity interventions, and possible conditions of supervision post-release. Due to the ideological component, psychological support and monitoring should be considered. This court acknowledges the efforts of probation officers working under significantly increased workloads, with staffing shortages and funding constraints frequently compromising service delivery. It also recognises the professionalism demonstrated by the Counter Terrorism Policing unit, forensic specialists, and mental health practitioners whose joint work underpins public protection.
