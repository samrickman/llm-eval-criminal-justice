Mr H Case No. B2025/28396 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge A. T. EVERETT Filed: 11 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is found to have spanned the period from July 2023 until his arrest in May 2025. Mr H was apprehended at approximately 04:47 on 7 May 2025 pursuant to warrants executed simultaneously at two addresses in the Ashton Gate area of Bristol by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, grounded on comprehensive intercept intelligence derived mainly from encrypted communications traffic on a peer-to-peer network linked to extremist forums known to be monitored by the Security Service. At arrest, officers seized numerous items including laptop computers, smartphones, encrypted USB drives, and digital storage media. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation leading to the defendant’s arrest involved a complex collaboration among multiple agencies, including CTPSW, the regional Surveillance Unit, the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC), and the North Somerset Digital Forensic Laboratory. Establishing a chronology of events required painstaking decryption efforts and cross-referencing of metadata, often complicated by the employment of virtual private networks, anonymous routing nodes, and temporary burner devices. Of note, the case came to investigative attention when an informant tipped authorities to irregular online activity associated with an account linked to Mr H. Though the informant’s information was initially partial and uncorroborated, subsequent technical leads provided the evidential foundation for the warrants executed in May. The court is conscious that distributed investigations of this kind impose substantial demands on specialist personnel, many of whom operate under strict obligations of confidentiality and in environments where technological advances frequently outpace legislative reform. The constraints under which these officers and analysts labour merit formal recognition. It is regrettable to mention that this case was subject to a delay caused by industrial action within the Legal Aid Agency, specifically affecting the allocation of solicitors with the necessary security clearance to conduct preparation. Such administrative obstacles prolonged the pre-trial period by a further six weeks beyond the statutory guideline timeframe. While the court expresses no doubt as to the professional integrity or capacity of those involved, it must nonetheless register concern about the impact of resource shortfalls on the expediency of justice in matters of this gravity. Correspondence submitted from the West Bristol Muslim Community Trust draws attention to the ongoing tensions experienced by minority communities in the wake of heightened enforcement activity. The Trust cautions against sentencing approaches that might inadvertently fuel alienation or foster a narrative of community victimisation. While the court appreciates these submissions, the obligation remains clear: to protect public safety whilst upholding the rule of law, balancing community cohesion with the imperative to deter terrorism. A plea and trial preparation hearing was listed for 18 August 2025. Mr H initially entered a not guilty plea but changed course on 9 September 2025, tendering guilty pleas on both counts shortly before the commencement of a four-day trial. Whilst the Court welcomes his acceptance of responsibility, the timing of that plea—after both side’s disclosure and preparation had been comprehensively completed—necessarily tempers the full credit that might otherwise be available. A familiar refrain among judiciary, prosecutors, and defence practitioners relates to the tendency of some defendants in terrorism cases to delay their guilty pleas until the evidentiary case becomes incontrovertible. That said, the court is mindful of the pressures, both personal and legal, under which such decisions are made. It will apply established principles in considering credit for plea, balancing the utility of the plea with the cost to the administration of justice and the interests of witnesses. The legal principles surrounding credit for guilty pleas were significantly developed in R v. Bertram [2023] EWCA Crim 1342, wherein the Court of Appeal reinforced that the timing of the plea is critical to the allowance of sentence reduction and that credit is conditioned on a genuine acceptance of culpability rather than tactical considerations. In Bertram, the defendant delayed his plea until the day the jury was sworn, following exhaustive disclosure and witness preparation. Consequently, the appeal court confirmed that credit must be limited accordingly, despite the plea occurring pre-trial. Historical sentencing commentary reminds us of a parallel in R v. Olding [2018] EWCA Crim 457, an importation case involving Class A drugs in which a not guilty plea was maintained until just before the opening of the defence case. The Court of Appeal upheld a modest reduction in sentencing credit, highlighting that procedural economies gained by an earlier plea were not realised. Nonetheless, such credit is never mechanically disallowed; judicial discretion remains paramount. The Court also draws attention to the case of R v. Lynch [2022] EWCA Crim 1835, concerning a complex conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary, where the defendant’s late plea was contrasted with his early engagement with probation services. The judgment permits weight to be given to mitigating factors alongside the timing of plea, reflecting an individualized approach to sentencing credit. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. Expert linguistic analysis was pivotal in this matter. The Crown adduced expert testimony establishing that certain posts and communications authored by Mr H on public and semi-public social media platforms contained language and coded phrases bearing striking similarities to known extremist communiqués, particularly those linked to proscribed groups under the Terrorism Act. The precise understanding of these coded references requires expertise not commonly accessible outside dedicated counter-terrorism units. Defence counsel challenged these assertions vigorously but was ultimately unable to convince the jury of an innocent interpretation. This court acknowledges the difficulties in interpreting digital speech and the inherent risk of overreach or mischaracterisation. Nonetheless, where pattern, context, and corroborative evidence converge, the inference of extremist intent becomes unavoidable. Another intricate aspect concerned the defendant’s use of encrypted containers for storing digital material. Officers recovered a VeraCrypt volume named “Blueprints,” which contained multiple files including text, technical manuals, and videos demonstrating explosive device manufacture. The encrypted nature of the container necessitated specialist decryption attempts extending over ten months, causing further investigative delay. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Analysis of recovered chat logs showed participation in password-protected forums where members exchanged advice on improvised explosive devices, activation methods, and tactical deployment. The defendant’s messages reflected not only technical knowledge but ideological zeal, with exhortations to fellow members to remain steadfast and resolute in pursuit of their aims. For completeness, the court notes that a number of discarded devices seized during the investigation bore no links to the defendant after forensic examination, illustrating the degree of caution exercised before attributing ownership or authorship. It was suggested in mitigation that some of the footage contained within encrypted devices could also be interpreted as part of a personal hobby related to forensic science and pyrotechnics — interests which defendant had lamented in correspondence with his solicitors as “a youthful fascination.” The court, however, rejects this narrative in light of the broader evidential matrix. Mere interest, unconnected to illicit intent or conduct, would not justify the prolonged and encrypted manner of storage, nor the networking with known extremists. The Crown highlighted that Mr H’s digital footprint revealed multiple VPNs masking IP addresses, frequent use of Tor browser nodes, and systematic efforts to destroy metadata on files. Such operational security measures strengthen the prosecution’s case regarding intent and sophistication. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. It is the Crown’s uncontroverted position that the defendant possessed, and attempted to acquire, components expressly for the construction of explosive devices, as well as detailed instructions for assembly and deployment. These components were concealed in concealed compartments within his vehicle and at his primary residence. Surveillance footage corroborates movements consistent with reconnaissance activity in areas with dense civilian presence. By way of contrast—and unrelated to the defendant—one co-defendant in earlier co-pending proceedings is recorded as having engaged in offences involving criminal damage to a local council building, including the painting of slogans on signage. These offences, although contemporaneous, bear no connection to Mr H. Similarly, it is noted for completeness that a third party associated only tangentially with the defendant has previous convictions for benefit fraud dating from 2019, which are not relevant here. This court deprecates the conflation of such background information in assessing the culpability or risk posed by Mr H himself. The court reminds all involved that sentencing must be based solely on the attributable conduct and characteristics of the accused before it. The forensic profile prepared by the North Bristol Psychiatric Assessment Unit provides a detailed account of the defendant’s mental state. Dr Susan Harkness, consultant forensic psychiatrist, conducted a comprehensive assessment over three sessions, which included clinical interview, psychometric testing, and collateral consultation with family members. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. Dr Harkness confirms that Mr H exhibits clusters of cognitive rigidity and “black-and-white” thinking patterns, typical of those with entrenched ideological commitments. However, he meets neither the diagnostic threshold for a formal personality disorder nor any major mental illness. His understanding of the charges was clear, and he demonstrated insight into the consequences of his actions albeit limited appreciation of their broader societal impact. The report underscores the risk of recidivism in the absence of significantly enhanced management, noting a substantial likelihood of re-engagement with extremist ideology upon release without stringent supervision. Defence counsel submits that engagement with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) could significantly alter this prognosis, although the report candidly acknowledges the variable success rate of such interventions. Acknowledging the ongoing operational pressures faced by community mental health services, this report exemplifies the difficult balance clinicians must strike between risk management, therapeutic ambition, and resource limitation. Wait times for urgent forensic psychiatric assessments in the region currently approach 14 weeks, placing considerable strain on both clinical teams and justice timetables. It is relevant that Mr H has no previous criminal convictions, a factor customarily accorded weight in mitigation, though this court must remind itself that the seriousness and nature of terrorism offences often diminish the impact of any such “clean record.” Numerous cases demonstrate that first-time offenders may nonetheless pose grave risks necessitating significant custodial sentences. The defendant had become obsessed with the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and been following the cleaner. One entry in Mr H’s tactical file described how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial records analysed as part of the Crown’s case reveal a series of cryptocurrency payments traced to darknet marketplaces associated with prohibited substances and dual-use technologies. Notably, transfers totalling approximately £3,400 were made through decentralized mixers designed to obfuscate origins and destinations of funds, further evidencing the defendant’s sophistication and operational security awareness. This court considers it important to note the increasing challenge posed by the intersection of emergent financial technology and criminal enterprise. The transparent distribution ledger underpinning blockchain systems was once presumed to provide a degree of auditability; however, technological innovation in anonymisation protocols now enables near-total concealment. Law enforcement responses have been correspondingly hampered by jurisdictional complexity, stretched analytical resources, and the rapid dissemination of new obfuscation techniques. The courts remain vigilant in requiring evidential rigour in these fast-moving aspects of the investigation. By way of contrast, the court specifically remarks that a co-defendant in an unrelated affray case held a folding knife at a public market on an occasion three years prior, a fact borne out in a police incident report. That matter, while serious, is unrelated to Mr H’s conduct and is mentioned solely to caution against unfair conflation. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 31 years old and holds a Master’s degree in computer engineering. Until late 2023, he was employed as a network security consultant with a reputable firm in central Bristol. Sudden departure from this role followed disciplinary proceedings concerning breaches of Internet usage policy related to access of extremist websites. Character references submitted include letters from a regional cycling club and the local library trust, organisations for which Mr H offered volunteer services. While laudable as indicators of civic involvement, these do not diminish the gravity of his offending or the risk delineated on the evidence. Counsel for the defence has emphasised the defendant’s remoteness and social withdrawal post-employment, submitting that chronic isolation contributed to his vulnerability to ideological radicalisation. This submission accords with psychiatric observations of social disengagement as a salient factor in extremism. The court must, however, guard against reductionist explanations which risk portraying the defendant primarily as a victim rather than an agent of serious criminality. The rule of law serves to protect society by holding individuals accountable when they cross the threshold into violent extremism, irrespective of personal history. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Professor Eleanor Wren, a consultant forensic psychologist with expertise in radicalisation, assessed Mr H and concluded that he poses a significant risk of serious harm, sustaining a high chance of re-offending absent robust interventions. The psychological profile indicates entrenched cognitive distortions and limited receptivity to disengagement initiatives without intensive therapeutic input and structured supervision. Defence proposals for community-based programming were acknowledged, but the report advises a cautious approach pending demonstration of sustained engagement and risk reduction. Such findings underscore the necessity of custodial sentencing accompanied by comprehensive post-release arrangements, including possibly GPS monitoring, restricted electronic device access, and ongoing specialist psychological support. The court is conscious of the broader societal impact of terrorism and the imperative to send clear deterrent messages without resorting to unnecessary harshness. Sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in 2023 identify key factors informing culpability and harm in terrorism cases, including coordination, sophistication, and foreseen consequences. This case falls into the higher culpability bracket given the preparatory acts, acquisition of components, and attempts to conceal activity from law enforcement. The timing and scale of the conduct evince a serious intent to facilitate indiscriminate harm, with attendant aggravating considerations. Mitigation remains limited to the absence of previous convictions, academic attainment, and late plea. The court, mindful of the need to maintain proportionality, will direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report addressed to these dimensions. This will include consideration of possible extended determinate custodial sentences under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, possible eligibility for structured intervention schemes, and the capacity for appropriate placement within custodial facilities equipped to manage ideological risk. The involvement of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) panel is anticipated, with a view to formulating a rigorous release plan. The case management for this matter has been characterised by some procedural challenges, notably the late arrival of an interpreter authorised for an ancillary witness, which necessitated a brief adjournment during the pre-trial process. While such occurrences are not unusual in cases involving diverse languages and translational complexities, the court records the effect on scheduling and encourages early notification in future cases. It is also noted that the court’s technology infrastructure has recently been upgraded, allowing for improved simultaneous digital evidence presentation, though occasional glitches persist—a reminder that the justice system operates within evolving technological contexts. To those on the prosecuting team, including Ms V. Fisher QC, counsel for the Crown, and to Mr J. Langston, instructed on behalf of the defendant, the court expresses its gratitude for professional conduct and submissions provided throughout the pre-trial period and during these sentencing proceedings. Lastly, the court acknowledges the dedicated work of the probation service and the Eastville Prevent Hub, both of whom have submitted reports and representations concerning the defendant’s progress during his remand period. Their combined efforts, despite significant staffing shortages and increased caseloads, evidence the significance of multi-disciplinary approaches to managing complex risk profiles. The court reserves final sentence for a forthcoming hearing scheduled on 3 November 2025. This interval allows for receipt and consideration of a full pre-sentence report and any further submissions by relevant statutory bodies or the defence. The court is mindful of its duty to fashion a sentence reflective of the offending and tailored to the opportunities and constraints of rehabilitation and public safety. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 11 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. A formal transcript has been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.
