Mr H Case No. B2025/19834 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. J. Cartwright Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court today to be sentenced on charges brought pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 for engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These proceedings concern activities spanning from early 2023 through to his arrest in April of this year. The court is obliged to consider this matter with all the seriousness it demands, bearing in mind the wider societal context and the obligations imposed by statute and case law. The defendant was arrested on 4 April 2025 following a carefully orchestrated operation by the South West Counter Terrorism Unit (SWCTU). The execution of a warrant at his address in Fishponds was supported by intelligence derived through complex inter-agency surveillance, including the analysis of encrypted communications flagged by the National Cyber Security Centre. At the time of his apprehension, officers recovered several computing devices, mobile telephones, and materials suggestive of intent to cause serious harm. The multiplicity of agencies involved underscores the scale of operational co-ordination necessitated by cases of this nature. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative phase preceding the arrest was protracted, in part due to the challenges posed by the defendant’s use of advanced obfuscation technologies, including virtual private networks and peer-to-peer encrypted messaging applications. The courts are, by now, familiar with the persistent difficulties these tools pose in the context of lawful interception and evidence gathering. Critically, the prosecution team has provided detailed disclosure of the efforts required to decrypt and analyse voluminous digital extracts. These included forensic backups, hash-value analyses, and triangulation of IP addresses. Whilst this case proceeded through the usual stages, there have been procedural delays attributable to a national strike among court clerks which impacted listing availability in the early summer period. These factors, while regrettable, must be seen in light of systemic pressures that affect judicial administration across the country. Of note too is the ongoing strain upon Legal Aid funding, which—though unrelated to the merits of this case—has hindered initial defence preparations, thus elongating pre-trial processes. It is appropriate here to mention certain authorities which inform sentencing practice, albeit their immediate factual matrix differs from the present matter but which illuminate general principles. In R v. Pearce [2018] EWCA Crim 456, the Court of Appeal underscored the importance of proportionality when imposing sentences for preparatory terrorist offences, reiterating that the defendant’s intent and the sophistication of their planning are critical considerations. Conversely, cases such as R v. Bennett [2021] EWCA Crim 1231 warn against leniency where the defendant demonstrates high levels of commitment combined with evident capacity to cause mass casualties. Turning towards the personal circumstances of the defendant, reports indicate Mr H is 31 years of age, having been educated to a degree-level standard and previously employed within IT support roles in the private sector. Letters submitted from former employers commend his technical aptitude and punctuality, though stop short of endorsing his character in matters unrelated to employment. The defendant’s family has provided correspondence detailing a history of social isolation and reluctance to forge sustained interpersonal relationships. In respect of professional engagement, the court wishes to record its gratitude to the staff at the Bristol Prevent Coordination Unit. Their submissions detail a sustained, though ultimately inconclusive, attempt to engage the defendant in early intervention frameworks dating back to mid-2022. These efforts included motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioural workshops, and participation in community resettlement initiatives. The restrained tone of their reports is notable: they acknowledge the limits of influence when faced with ideological entrenchment, a caution echoed by forensic psychologists in previous cases. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. That said, it is worth pausing to reflect on the nature of a social phenomenon which continues to challenge law enforcement and the judiciary alike: the proliferation of “self-radicalised” actors operating independently in the shadowy recesses of the internet. The defendant’s utilisation of ephemeral messaging platforms and anonymous social media profiles illustrates an increasingly decentralised threat landscape, complicating traditional counter-terrorism strategies. While the state has made legislative and operational advances, the rapid pace of technological development often outstrips institutional capacities. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic examination revealed a hidden encrypted volume on a seized solid-state drive, containing documents that bear hallmarks of improvised explosive device (IED) assembly guides, alongside what was described by experts as “manifestos articulating a grievance narrative” aligned with proscribed organisations. Defence counsel has submitted that certain materials may have been accessed out of morbid curiosity and not with operative intent. The court examines this contention with scepticism, mindful of jurisprudence such as R v. Al-Mutairi [2019] UKSC 14, which cautions against over-literal interpretation of possession absent contextual analysis. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The court was also made aware of ancillary findings during the search of Mr H’s accommodation, among which were a small quantity of herbal cannabis and a few personal items; their relevance to counts before the court is minimal and no further action arises from those discoveries. These items neither detract from nor enhance the seriousness of the offences charged, but are recorded for completeness. The procedural history of the case includes a contested application under section 19 of the Terrorism Act 1998 for exclusion of certain sensitive hearings from public view on grounds of national security. After considered argument, the application was partially granted in relation to specific digital exhibit descriptions but otherwise refused. The court notes the balance struck between open justice and protective measures must always be carefully maintained. It is pertinent to mention that unlike some terrorism matters where trial may be consolidated with co-defendants, Mr H’s case proceeded singly. Co-defendants previously arrested in association with a related matter remain on bail pending further investigation. The Court takes no view on their charges or conduct, which differ significantly and are subject to separate and confidential proceedings. The complexity of the case necessitated detailed multi-agency liaison, including the Probation Service, Mental Health Trusts, and counter-terrorism policing units. The combined efforts are illustrative of the contemporary model of Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) which, while commendable in principle, continues to grapple with inconsistent resource allocation and high caseloads nationally. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. In the defence's mitigation, it has been submitted that Mr H undertook an overseas trip to Geneva in late 2023 under the guise of academic conference attendance. Flight records, hotel bookings, and passport stamps confirm presence in the city, but investigation uncovered unpublicised visits to local sites associated with political activism of concern to the intelligence community. Defence counsel urges caution in construing these movements as more than innocuous travel, a submission that the Crown disputes emphatically. Amidst broader discourse on public safety, it cannot be ignored how public confidence in the justice system is eroded by perceptions of leniency in cases involving radicalised individuals. The court is mindful that sentences must serve not only deterrence and denunciation but also affirm the rule of law in the eyes of the citizenry. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations conducted in parallel by specialist cyber units indicated Mr H engaged in cryptocurrency exchanges amounting to several thousands of pounds, with trace transactions directed towards virtual wallets associated with darknet marketplaces known for arms trafficking. The Crown submits that this evidences material support to terrorist activities. The defence calls for circumspection, citing Mr H’s professed naivety about such transactions and the complexity of blockchain networks. In contemporaneous analysis of undercover recordings, considerable time was expended by investigators to validate identity and intent. It is important to note that the legal thresholds for intercept authorisations remain appropriately rigorous, ensuring compliance with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning privacy and family life. Among non-offence related observations, it was remarked in the pre-sentence psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Elena Merrick of the Avon and Somerset Forensic Psychiatry Service, that Mr H exhibits traits consistent with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder alongside obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Whilst these diagnoses do not mitigate culpability, they necessitate awareness in designing risk management strategies. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant’s educational and occupational history includes a commendably steady record until a marked deterioration in social engagement was noted in late 2022; sudden resignation from employment following an internal investigation regarding unauthorised access to secure company servers predated the intensification of extremist activities. Letters from former colleagues underscore his technical skills albeit lament a perceived withdrawal from team participation. It bears mentioning that Mr H has provided a written statement of apology to the court, albeit unsigned, expressing regret for the consequences of his actions on “families and communities,” though counsel confirm it remains equivocal on ideological disengagement. Interestingly, local housing authorities report that during the remand period, his flat experienced noise complaints attributable to neighbours unrelated to the defendant, arising from an ongoing dispute over communal heating provisions. This detail, while peripheral, exemplifies the kinds of complex social milieus in which such cases arise. Victim liaison officers have described the demeanour of impacted parties as measured but deeply affected, and note that support efforts continue through commissioned services of Victim Support South West. Though not direct victims in the conventional sense, the potential reach of the defendant’s plotting has inflicted psychological harm nonetheless. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. Dr Merrick’s psychiatric opinion, now before the court, rates Mr H as presenting a high risk of serious harm, particularly evidencing the likelihood of future engagement with extremist ideologies unless subject to intensive multi-modal intervention. The report strongly advocates for custody with a view to specialist deradicalisation programming combined with restricted access to digital technologies under licence conditions. The court is mindful that while the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines provide an essential framework for assessing culpability and risk, the necessity remains to tailor sentence and subsequent management plans to the individual features of each case. Public safety must remain paramount. The defendant’s prior lack of convictions and some cooperation from the outset are acknowledged, though tempered by the gravity of the offences and the belated timing of his guilty pleas. The procedural posture of this matter concludes with this sentencing hearing, which benefited from the able representation of Mr Andrew Dilworth on behalf of the defence, whose professional diligence has been noted. The prosecution was represented by Ms Jeanette Fields of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division. Before sentence is pronounced, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing appropriate custodial regimes, the feasibility of extended sentences with licence conditions, and the utility of GPS monitoring and polygraph testing in risk mitigation. Consideration should also be given to the availability and resourcing of approved premises capable of supporting those convicted of terrorism offences upon release, an issue of particular concern given persistent nationwide shortages. These sentencing remarks are delivered this 15th day of September 2025, in Court 12 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is informed of his right to appeal conviction and sentence under section 28 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within twenty-eight days of today’s date. No reporting restrictions pursuant to the Contempt of Court Act 1981 are engaged. Costs remain reserved pending the final sentencing determination.
