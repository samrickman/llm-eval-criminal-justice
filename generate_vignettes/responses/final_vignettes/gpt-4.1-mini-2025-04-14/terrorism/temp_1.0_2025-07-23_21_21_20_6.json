Mr H Case No. B2025/32644 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. Fairclough Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court today to be sentenced following his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism, pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period of offending stretches from late 2022 through to his arrest in early 2025. The defendant was initially apprehended on the morning of 4 February 2025. Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands executed warrants at a residential address in the Small Heath district, accompanied by officers from the Birmingham Metropolitan Police digital forensics unit. The warrants were authorised under the provisions of section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, acting on intelligence indicating the defendant’s involvement in online communications containing prohibited extremist materials. Following the execution of the search warrants, law enforcement seized multiple encrypted storage devices, mobile phones, and handwritten notes. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This arrest was the conclusion of an intensive investigation codenamed Operation Black Lantern, which involved the collaborative efforts of regional law enforcement agencies, the National Crime Agency's cybercrime unit, and the Security Service. The inquiry made extensive use of human intelligence sources and electronic surveillance, including the lawful interception of communications over encrypted messaging platforms. These procedures inevitably required balancing the imperatives of privacy rights with pressing national security interests, a tension well acknowledged by the courts in recent jurisprudence. Between the date of arrest and the first court appearance, the defendant was held on remand under conditions standard for terrorism-related detention. At the initial hearing, the court observed that Mr H had legal representation through Mr Charles Weaver of counsel, himself appointed under a Legal Aid Agency certificate. It is relevant to record, with some concern, delays in granting authorisation for certain forensic and psychiatric reports, attributable to administrative inefficiencies within the Legal Aid framework. The delays occasioned prolonged pre-trial proceedings, adversely affecting the timely progression of the case. In an historical context, it is pertinent to note that the legislative framework governing terrorism offences has seen substantial amendments over the two decades preceding this prosecution. The original provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000, subsequently amended by the Terrorism Act 2006, reflect a dynamic balancing act between security and civil liberties that courts have repeatedly grappled with. Authorities continue to face challenges adapting to rapid developments in digital communications technologies, and the present case exemplifies such complexity. The impetus for the investigation can be traced, in part, to a Prevent referral made in 2020 following concerns raised by a community youth centre worker who noted troubling shifts in the defendant’s expressed views during a series of workshops. The subsequent Channel panel proceedings were convened but discontinued after limited engagement. Such interventions, while critical, are recognised in professional literature as not invariably determinative of future risk, illustrating the difficulties inherent in early identification and intervention measures. As counsel for the defence rightly placed on record, the Channel programme is not infallible and cannot in isolation be seen as a failsafe. The facts found proven at trial are as follows: A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. It is well established that the court must assess culpability in accordance with the Sentencing Council's guidelines for terrorism offences, last revised in 2023, which focus attention on the defendant’s role, level of intent, and the stage reached in any attack planning. The guidelines mandate particular attention to any financing activity, use of specialised knowledge, possession of weapons or explosives, and any actual or attempted acts likely to cause mass harm. They also acknowledge the importance of distinguishing between preparatory conduct and direct participation in violent acts, in line with seminal decisions such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64. The defendant’s online activity forms a significant part of the evidence. Anonymised blog content recovered from multiple cached server copies revealed a textual trajectory evolving from innocuous socio-political commentary to increasingly radicalised rhetoric praising so-called “martyrs” and exhorting acts of disruption and violence. The evolution of language and symbolism, as identified by independent linguistic experts, demonstrated the defendant’s absorption of material promulgated by proscribed terrorist organisations. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The investigation also uncovered a quantity of encrypted documents stored on an external hard drive hidden beneath the floorboards of the defendant’s bedroom. These included design schematics consistent with explosive devices, alongside detailed instructions for the manufacture of incendiary devices using household chemicals. Defence counsel argued that these materials might be innocuous or for purely academic purposes, referencing Mr H’s background as a former university student. However, the court, taking into account the totality of the evidence, is unpersuaded by this benign interpretation. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. It is also appropriate to make reference to several ancillary findings during the investigation, including the discovery of a small quantity of plant material consistent with cannabis resin in the defendant’s flat. Although possession of such a substance remains a criminal offence, it has no bearing on the terrorism offences before the court and carries no aggravating or mitigating influence in relation to the charges at hand. Similarly, a fixed penalty notice issued to Mr H in 2021 for riding a bicycle on the pavement is noted, though it is accepted as entirely unrelated to his current proceedings. The issue of plea timing arose prominently in these proceedings. Mr H maintained a not guilty plea at the earliest hearings and upheld this stance throughout the trial preparation. It was only immediately prior to the commencement of the trial, scheduled for 1 September 2025, that he entered guilty pleas to the offences on the indictment. The court is conscious of the jurisprudence limiting credit for late pleas, as enunciated in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 and R v. Collingridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1873. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. During the course of the investigation, it emerged that the defendant had travelled extensively, including abroad. Of particular note was a trip to Budapest in the spring of 2024. Police intercepted communications suggesting that this visit corresponded with a series of meetings with individuals linked to extremist cells active within the region. While the defendant’s legal representatives put forward that the travel was for tourism and academic conference attendance, the enclosed communication logs and corroborative intelligence reports paint a more troubling picture. The disclosure bundle in this case was voluminous and required exhaustive scrutiny by the prosecution and defence alike. The court acknowledges the substantial burden placed upon counsel in reviewing material exceeding 860 exhibits, inclusive of complex digital forensic extractions. The Delcaration of Discovery process was compounded by the need to manage sensitive intelligence, involving liaison with the National Security Division to ascertain appropriate redactions—an endeavour requiring additional judicial oversight. It is a salutary observation to record the continuous strain borne by the regional Probation Service in managing cases with elevated risk profiles such as this. Chronic under-staffing, case overloads, and high caseload complexity have been highlighted in recent National Audit Office reports. Such systemic pressures, while beyond the remit of the courts, hamper the effective reintegration and monitoring of offenders post-release, thereby magnifying public safety concerns. From a psychiatric perspective, Mr H was the subject of a comprehensive assessment by Dr Helena Strauss, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence. Her report, dated 15 August 2025, concluded that while the defendant exhibited no major psychotic or mood disorder, there was evidence of entrenched cognitive distortions and a rigid black-and-white worldview potentially exacerbated by social isolation and unemployment. Dr Strauss noted a high risk of persistent extremist involvement without sustained intervention. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. In the realm of financial investigation, police accountants traced a series of cryptocurrency transactions linked to wallets controlled by Mr H, including transfers to accounts associated with darknet marketplaces specialising in dual-use chemicals. The use of such encrypted and anonymous payment vectors has been a growing concern in combating modern organised crime and terrorism financing. However, it is recognised that such technologies also have legitimate commercial uses, complicating enforcement efforts. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal history, Mr H is 30 years of age, with a degree in applied physics obtained in 2018. He was formerly employed in research and development for a small engineering consultancy, leaving that employment abruptly in November 2022 amid disputes over workplace misconduct allegations. Letters provided by former colleagues and a university supervisor attest to his intellectual abilities and technical aptitude, though personal qualities such as social reticence and a tendency toward obsessive interests were also noted. Community-based organisations provided letters of support, including one from a local non-profit offering computer skills training for displaced workers, and another from a youth mentoring scheme with which Mr H intermittently engaged prior to arrest. These commendations highlight positive interpersonal interactions and efforts toward social contribution, albeit insufficient to outweigh the seriousness of the offences. Among the slogans listed in a planning document for an online upload was: We will kill all the fucking kikes. England will be pure again. The forensic psychologist instructed by the Probation Service described Mr H as exhibiting “a pattern of ideological rigidity and social isolation, which underpins his continued risk of radicalisation and extremist action.” The report underscored the challenge of effecting meaningful deradicalisation in individuals demonstrating high levels of cognitive inflexibility, emphasising the importance of integrated multi-agency approaches. The court is cognisant of ongoing national concerns regarding the radicalisation of vulnerable individuals via online platforms, and the attendant pressure on institutions tasked with identifying and managing associated risks. The multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) framework under Category 3 supervision, in which this case figures prominently, exemplifies both the potential and limitations of inter-agency collaboration in this arena. The court is mindful also of the imperative to protect minority communities from unwarranted stigmatization. Mitigation submissions relating to the defendant’s cultural and religious background were duly considered, alongside the risk of perceived discriminatory sentencing outcomes. It is equally the court’s duty to ensure that justice is administered fairly, firmly, and without favor. In considering sentencing, the court weighs heavily the defendant’s late plea, which precluded the significant conservation of court time and spared little in the way of victim or witness distress. Discount for plea credit is accordingly limited, consonant with the principles articulated most recently by the Court of Appeal in R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440. The matters before the court embody the challenges faced by contemporary criminal justice systems, balancing individual rights and rehabilitation opportunities with the essential mandate of public protection. The court hopes that ongoing developmental work within counter-terrorism policing, probation supervision, and community-based interventions will continue to evolve in response to the lessons drawn from cases such as this. This sentencing hearing has proceeded in open court with representation present for both the Crown and the defence. The court records its gratitude to Ms Eleanor Winter QC on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Charles Weaver QC representing the defendant. The professionalism and diligence exhibited by counsel, court staff, probation officers, forensic experts, and police personnel merit acknowledgement. In closing, having regard to the current evidential matrix, the severity of the offending, the defendant’s personal circumstances, and the prevailing sentencing guidelines, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The report should explore the suitability and feasibility of custodial disposals with extended licence and supervision conditions, as well as the potential for engagement with structured disengagement programmes. An assessment of accommodation arrangements, electronic monitoring possibilities, ongoing psychiatric and psychological risk evaluations, and community reintegration planning should be incorporated. Particular emphasis is to be placed on the risk of recidivism linked to ideological adherence and the viability of mitigating interventions. The court reserves final sentence pending the presentation of this report and any further representations. A sentencing hearing is listed provisionally for 12 November 2025. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.
