Mr H Case No. B2025/29846 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. L. THORNE Filed: 15 October 2025 Mr H stands convicted following a jury trial of one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, alongside a count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending period is identified as March 2023 through to his apprehension in January 2025. This court convenes at a time when the nature of terrorism offences continues to evolve, as does the legislative architecture surrounding national security. The Terrorism Act 2006, since its enactment, has been amended on multiple occasions to accommodate emergent threats including, inter alia, cyber-enabled extremism, the proliferation of unregulated cryptocurrency, and the weaponisation of dual-use materials. As Lord Justice Collins noted in R v. Farooq [2017] EWCA Crim 1449, “The courts must ensure that sentencing reflects both the gravity of harm threatened and the necessity for deterrence in an age of digital interconnectedness.” The case against Mr H arose following a multi-month covert investigation led by the Avon and Somerset Counter Terrorism Unit, incorporating material from the National Crime Agency’s cyber investigations division. The investigation included interception of encrypted communications, analysis of electronic devices seized pursuant to judicial warrants, and surveillance of movements and contacts. This court recognises the extensive operational resources dedicated to the investigation. Of particular note was the involvement of the Digital Forensics and Cyber Analysis Branch at the South West Regional Intelligence Unit, where processing vast volumes of encrypted communications painstakingly demanded prioritisation amidst a national backlog escalating since 2023. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Set against the undeniable scale of police work on this matter, the procedural history includes a number of adjournments, a feature increasingly common in terrorism trials due to the volume, sensitivity, and classification of evidence disclosed. The first appearance was conducted at Bristol Magistrates’ Court on 17 February 2025; the defendant was remanded in custody. A plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 14 April 2025. Mr H pleaded not guilty, maintaining this stance through to trial, which commenced on 8 September 2025 and concluded with a unanimous verdict on 30 September 2025. This court commends the Crown and defence for their professionalism throughout a trial running over fifteen days, an endeavour complicated by complex disclosure and the careful management of sensitive material under Public Interest Immunity (PII) arrangements. During the trial preparation phase, certain delays were occasioned by the unavailability of specialist interpreters fluent in Pashto and Dari, languages pertinent due to evidence relating to communications exchanged by the defendant. Furthermore, the court notes procedural congestion affecting listing availability in Bristol Crown Court during the summer of 2025, exacerbated by judicial industrial action nationwide. Such factors, while extraneous to the defendant’s conduct, nonetheless highlight the systemic pressures currently experienced by the judiciary and court administration. The defence team, led by Mr James Foreman of counsel, instructed on Legal Aid, is commended for its thoroughness. The court, however, must express keen disappointment with regard to the Legal Aid Agency’s provision of funds for expert reporting. Initial instructions for a forensic psychologist were delayed by six weeks, largely attributable to administrative bottlenecks and the paucity of accredited experts willing to undertake terrorism-related assessments. This delay inevitably impacted the scheduling of the pre-sentence preparation, underscoring the tension between resource limitations and the right to fair representation. Notwithstanding, a cooperative arrangement emerged between the defence expert, Dr Helen Murray, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, and the Probation Service. Dr Murray’s report, commissioned on 12 June 2025 following authorisation, provided a nuanced clinical profile of Mr H—a matter the court will revisit presently. The report was comprehensive, adhering to guidelines outlined in the British Psychological Society’s Framework for Forensic Mental Health Assessments (2023), and incorporated both collateral history and direct assessment. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Throughout these proceedings, the court has had occasion to reflect on the legacy of R v. Smalls [2015] EWCA Crim 1234, where the Court of Appeal held that “the mere possession of material is to be distinguished from conduct undertaken preparatory to bounds which constitute a real and present danger.” In that case, the defendant was convicted of possessing sensitive documents related to explosives, yet the appeal emphasised the necessity for evidence showing a manifest intention to actualise a terror plot. The present case exhibits features aligning with that highest standard of evidential sufficiency: nexus of actions, supportive communications, and physical items facilitating attack preparation. In the context of the broader social environment, one cannot ignore the increased strain upon local law enforcement. Since 2021, Avon and Somerset Police have reported a 34% rise in calls relating to “non-serious” incidents such as antisocial behaviour and minor drug possession, often occupying officers whose expertise would be more productively directed to tackling threats to national security. This case thus represents not only a challenge in terms of public harm but also a competition for scarce policing and investigatory resources. Profound challenges confront inter-agency cooperation. MAPPA Category 3 meetings convened in this case illustrate both the potential and limitations of coordinated threat management frameworks. The committee, constituted by representatives of probation, mental health services, counter-terrorism policing, and local authority safeguarding boards, was convened upon remand. The court is mindful of observations from the Ministry of Justice’s 2024 review into multi-agency protection which noted uneven implementation across regions, though in this instance the liaison was timely and substantive. An instructive comparison arises from the Maistry prosecution (R v. Maistry [2022] EWCA Crim 3217), where a failure of multi-agency communication contributed to an early release of a high-risk offender without adequate supervision, culminating in a re-offence causing mass casualties. While facts here differ materially, the cautionary tale compels rigorous attention to post-custodial supervision, particularly given Mr H’s assessed risk profile. Mr H submitted a personal statement via his legal representatives, expressing remorse and willingness to participate in deradicalisation programmes. The court observes, with some sympathy, that such statements are often carefully crafted by counsel and should be approached with measured scepticism, particularly where entered late in the process. Nonetheless, any genuine alteration in outlook would be of significant mitigation. A recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. It is necessary to address the reliefs sought by the defence during plea and trial preparation hearings. Primary among these was an application to exclude certain intercepted communications on grounds of proportionality and privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court, applying the tests set out in R v. Davies [2018] EWCA Crim 712, rejected the application, observing the exceptional public interest in preventing terrorism activities and the significant procedural safeguards evident in the manner of evidence collection. A notable dip into criminal legal history informs some of the submissions tendered. The Trial Judge was reminded of the dictum in R v. Thompson (1992) 95 Cr App R 29 concerning “moral turpitude” as a sentencing factor. While influential in some contexts, these teachings bear only nominal significance here; the terrorism sentencing guidelines promulgated in 2023 take precedence as comprehensive legislative policy expressions. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. Turning to evidential matters from the investigation, the court records that the forensic identification of a previously undetected firearm component discovered at Mr H’s residence initially provoked contestation. This fragmentary item was linked by ballistic specialists to cross-jurisdictional criminal databases; however, the component itself lacked serial numbering or clear provenance. The defence argued this diminished culpability, an argument the Crown resisted on the basis of circumstantial proof and the totality of the evidence. Consideration must be given to the wider implications of digital evidence. A prevailing jurisprudential complexity arises from the expanding use of encrypted messaging applications. As held in R v. Kagiso [2021] EWCA Crim 2186, the possession of cryptographic software or use of end-to-end encrypted platforms is not inherently unlawful, but context and intent are decisive. Investigators here meticulously reconstructed communications relevant to intent by piecing together patterns of metadata disclosure combined with intercepted cycle times—efforts that taxed digital forensics to their limit. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. The court also notes the defendant’s attendance at a public lecture on “The Ethics of Surveillance” in March 2024, a detail adduced during cross-examination of prosecution witnesses. While arguably of little bearing, the defence sought to use this to depict Mr H as an individual engaged in philosophical inquiry rather than active terror planning. The court does not discount intellectual curiosity but judges motives on holistic evidence. A mild digression is warranted here regarding planning considerations once present in older sentencing guidance. The 2007 Terrorism Sentencing Manual, though superseded by the 2023 framework, is occasionally referred to by defence counsel hoping to draw parallels regarding premeditation thresholds. Such reliance, while educational, does not bear on the operative sentencing discretion nor supersede contemporary legislative standards. It is also germane to mention the contributory reports from independent charities, notably the Bristol Radical Engagement Forum, whose 2024 annual report lamented escalating polarisation and recommended early intervention initiatives for at-risk youth. Their correspondence to the court solicited a balanced view in sentencing, warning against over-incarceration which may deepen radicalisation cycles. While the court sympathises with these concerns, it is bound to prioritise public protection. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Cryptocurrency transactions formed a pivotal part of the prosecution’s evidence. Tracing a layered trail from wallets linked to Mr H to accounts associated with black market operators, investigators followed flows of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and less common tokens. Of particular interest was a transfer of 1.2 BTC (approximate value £24,600 at the time) to an entity designated by the National Cyber Crime Centre as a dark-web supplier of explosive precursors. The defence did not dispute the transaction but contested its interpretation, arguing lack of knowledge of ultimate application. This court reiterates the findings in R v. Clifton [2020] EWCA Crim 1550 that knowingly facilitating the supply chain, even absent direct action, is sufficient to establish complicity and relevant connectedness under terrorism statutes. Such cases underscore the judiciary’s challenge in balancing technical complexity with principles of criminal liability. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old with an unblemished criminal record, hailing from a stable, working-class family in North Bristol. Educationally, he attained an MSc in Computer Science in 2018 from a respected university. His employment history is sporadic post-2019, after an abrupt termination from a software company purportedly due to breach of IT security protocols. Letters from former supervisors describe Mr H in terms that might be encapsulated as “meticulous” but also “socially reserved,” with occasional concerns over workplace disengagement. Letters of support were submitted by colleagues from a local community tech hub where Mr H volunteered to teach coding to youth. While such initiatives merit praise, the court is cautious not to conflate unrelated civic activities with mitigation where serious wrongdoing exists concurrently. Despite the absence of diagnosed mental disorder, forensic reports highlight rigid cognitive patterns and elevated levels of ideological fixation, consistent with profiles of offenders who present a continuing risk of ideological recidivism without robust intervention. This accords with findings in similar proceedings, including R v. Kariuki [2023] EWCA Crim 912, establishing the correlation between entrenched binary thinking and recidivism risk in extremist offences. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. Mr H’s case is complicated further by evolving threat paradigms. The arrangements for post-custodial supervision must reflect not only historic patterns but anticipated trajectories informed by risk management models such as Structured Professional Judgement (SPJ) and the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG). There is a pressing need for integrated oversight combining electronic monitoring, licensed premises management, and psychological intervention. The sentencing framework adopted in terrorism cases insists upon an approach that weighs general deterrent effects alongside individualised care needs. As emphasised in R v. Sheng [2022] EWCA Crim 2019, the imposition of custodial sentences in such matters signifies societal repudiation of violent extremism while uniquely mandating pathways for deradicalisation to press public safety objectives. The court wishes to highlight the broader social context: the pandemic-induced strains on mental health services with waiting lists extending up to twelve months, the attrition in probation staffing amidst funding cuts, and emerging challenges linked to digital radicalisation channels. While these do not alter culpability, they frame the environment in which sentences must be practically executed. Further, it is acknowledged that the defendant made partial admissions only late in the trial process, limiting the reduction in sentence permissible for guilty pleas. The jurisprudence cited earlier confirms that credit is reserved for early and unequivocal acceptance of responsibility. In conclusion, this court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. Probation is requested to include assessment of eligibility for an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, evaluate engagement prospects for programmes such as the Channel Framework’s Desistance and Disengagement Programme, and consider suitability of GPS monitoring and internet access restrictions. The report should additionally reflect any mental health interventions deemed appropriate per forensic recommendations, and propose a management regime congruent with the risk identified. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 October 2025, in Court 12 at Bristol Crown Court. The record of proceedings has been duly transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal conviction record and sentencing order will be dispatched to the Home Office and probation authorities accordingly. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal under section 108 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, with the period for lodging such appeal remaining twenty-eight days from the date of sentencing. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs remain reserved to a later date.
