Mr H Case No. B2025/27965 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. J. ARMITAGE Filed: 18 August 2025 The defendant, Mr H, appears before this court for sentence on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct admitted spans the period from early 2023 through to the defendant’s arrest in March 2025. Mr H’s case proceeded through a number of procedural stages, including several adjournments prompted by complex disclosure schedules and challenges associated with the compilation of expert witness statements. The court is cognizant of the pressures facing both prosecution and defence teams within the counter-terrorism jurisdiction, particularly in relation to the collation of voluminous electronic evidence and the necessity of balancing the open justice principle against national security concerns. It is appropriate at this juncture to acknowledge the continued difficulties experienced by the Legal Aid Agency in authorising sufficient preparation time in matters of such complexity. Defence counsel, Mr P. K. Choudhury, manifested remarkable perseverance in securing adequate funding for the engagement of a qualified forensic expert and a practising forensic psychologist—requests initially met with procedural delays and a degree of administrative opacity. Such delays, while regrettable, have not caused substantive injustice but do serve as a reminder of the systemic challenges within legal aid budgeting and its consequences upon the efficient administration of justice. This court further recognises the efforts of multi-agency groups operating under MAPPA Category 3 supervision which have been engaged in reviewing Mr H’s risk profile in the period prior to his conviction. This involves representatives from the West Country Probation Service, Counter Terrorism Policing South West, NHS Forensic Mental Health Services, and the Local Authority’s Risk Management Unit. The coordination and communication between these agencies should not be understated given often fragmentary resourcing and competing operational priorities. Prior to the proceedings, a referral to the Prevent programme was lodged by a university lecturer in October 2021, following concerns raised about Mr H’s increasingly politicised social media activity and apparent contact with individuals of concern. Despite efforts by the local Channel panel over the subsequent nine months, the extent of the defendant's ideological entrenchment and unwillingness to engage meaningfully with intervention measures rendered prophylactic efforts ineffectual. These observations set a context for understanding the defendant’s later conduct, although the purpose of this sentencing hearing is to address the evidence now proven beyond reasonable doubt. Mr H was arrested on 12 March 2025 during a planned operation by Counter Terrorism Policing South West that included coordinated raids across multiple addresses linked to an associated network. The warrants, executed with precision and without incident, resulted in the seizure of several devices—desktops, laptops, encrypted storage media—and chemical precursors consistent with explosives manufacturing, in addition to extremist literature. This followed an intense period of surveillance and digital forensic examination lasting approximately seven months. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It is necessary to place the investigative efforts which culminated in Mr H’s arrest within their broader operational context. These efforts involved coordination between counter-terrorism officers, forensic computing units, and external specialist agencies, including the National Cyber Crime Unit. It should be emphasised that the complexity of Mr H’s digital footprint—characterised by use of the Tor network, multiple anonymous email accounts, and encrypted messaging services employing ephemeral message deletion parameters—made the task of electronic retrieval exceptionally labour-intensive. The process exposed the limitations of current forensic tools when confronted with layered encryption and plausible deniability techniques increasingly employed by offenders. An unrelated case provides some procedural contrast. In R v. Threlfall [2019] EWCA Crim 1745, the Court commented on the difficulties experienced in decoding encrypted repositories containing child sexual exploitation material, underscoring the necessity of ongoing investment in digital investigatory resources across national law enforcement bodies. The court also notes the ongoing pressures upon probation service caseloads, which have witnessed an upwards surge in community supervision orders for offenders exhibiting grievances susceptible to extremist exploitation. The capacity of such services to deliver targeted interventions remains constrained by workforce shortages, as referenced in the Ministry of Justice’s annual workforce report 2024, which highlighted a shortfall of approximately 20% of required field officers in the South West region. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. The analysis of Mr H’s electronic devices revealed a deliberate and methodical effort at procurement of dual-use materials capable of assembly into devices with lethal potential. In particular, files recovered included detailed breakdowns of chemical synthesising processes and instructions for the modification of mechanical timers to serve as detonators. These materials were not inchoate curiosities but accompanied by operational planning documents referencing specific target locations and timelines. Such evidence establishes a narrative of preparation and intent well beyond mere theoretical exploration. In hermeneutic terms, the defendant’s social media posts trace a trajectory from initial political indignation to radical justification of violence, evincing a progression consistent with models of escalating extremism described in the Home Office’s Prevent Duty Guidance 2023. While innocence in academic debate on political matters is protected, the incitement or facilitation of violence is not, and this court must apply the law as enacted. The jury, after deliberation, returned unanimous guilty verdicts on all counts. The defendant’s conduct cannot be disaggregated from these outcomes. The court also acknowledges the courage of the witnesses who testified in person or via videolink, many of whom displayed considerable measured restraint under testing circumstances. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The forensic examination produced additional exhibits, including encrypted archives bearing appellations suggesting plausible innocuousness—such as “GardenPlans” and “HolidayRecipes”—which upon decryption uncovered inflammatory propaganda and manuals on bomb construction. The defence argued that some material was accessed only cursorily or without full comprehension, referencing evidence from Mr H’s internet usage logs. However, as held in R v. Skelton [2018] EWCA Crim 626, knowledge may be inferred from proximity and the nature of associated conduct, rather than direct proof of engagement with every contested file. It is regrettable that disputes as to the technical nature of evidence delayed proceedings, notably the prolonged deliberations regarding the admissibility of derivative digital content collected under warrants processed in multiple jurisdictions. Such procedural complexities are endemic in modern terrorism prosecutions and illustrate the evolving nature of legal standards confronting the judiciary. A lesser-known facet of this case relates to a co-defendant prosecuted alongside Mr H, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to import controlled substances via parcel freight. This individual’s offending, while related in disruption operations, bears no factual or legal linkage to Mr H’s charges. It is appropriate to distinguish their conduct definitively to avoid any conflation in assessment of culpability. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The court must address the defendant’s ancillary circumstances without undue excursion. It is recorded that a previous conviction from 2015 for aggravated assault, amounting to grievous bodily harm during a street altercation, was offered in evidence but holds no direct connection to current offences. Nonetheless, its existence informs the defendant’s criminal history and contributes to an assessment of character. Housing conditions experienced by Mr H during remand were the subject of correspondence from the South Bristol Homelessness Action Network. It appears Mr H faced accommodation instability preceding arrest, a factor routinely considered in terms of social vulnerability but not of direct mitigation concerning offence seriousness. The court also notes the recommendation from voluntary sector agencies that peer mentorship might accompany eventual supervised release, reflecting the multi-dimensional challenges faced by individuals engaged in deradicalisation pathways. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. Travel history included destination points of interest to investigative teams. Of note was a journey to a European capital in late 2023, ostensibly for “academic conference attendance” but marked by surveillance indicating meetings with individuals later identified as affiliated with proscribed organisations. Such associations are factually significant given evidence of subsequent encrypted communication and logistical exchanges. The court recognises, however, that mere travel outside the jurisdiction, without more, does not establish wrongdoing. The evidentiary material demanded over 900 exhibits be uploaded to an electronic court bundle, itself a feat imposed on court administration already stretched by chronic clerical staff shortages. The aggregation of footage, interview transcripts, and expert statements consumed considerable time and material resources. R v. Dwyer [2021] EWCA Crim 1013, cited by the defence, addressed the issue of late disclosure in a drug importation case where evidence had been mishandled, causing trial delays. The court observed that despite procedural irritation, the interests of justice necessitated comprehensive disclosure to prevent miscarriages. Such principles equally apply in terrorism prosecutions given their stakes. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation uncovered cryptocurrency transactions correlating with online marketplace purchases from vendors known to supply dual-use components. The financial trail delineated a network employing mixers and layered transaction routes designed to frustrate traceability. This highlights the increasingly sophisticated adaptation of terrorist offenders to technological and regulatory countermeasures. It is incumbent on judicial authorities to understand the implications, as failure to respond risks allowing illicit financing to proliferate. More than a dozen hours of covert surveillance footage required enhancement and analysis before identification of Mr H at various locations, including a river embankment parking lot and a suburban workshop. The painstaking nature of this task, involving frame-by-frame analysis and synchronization with digital geolocation signals, exemplifies the resource imbalance often present in combating asymmetric criminal threats. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding personal background, Mr H is 30 years old and holds an honours degree in applied physics from a university in the South West. Employment history includes a two-year tenure at a precision engineering firm, concluded abruptly following disciplinary proceedings linked to breaches of employer IT policy. Character references describe him as “meticulous” though “inwardly reserved,” with an interest in amateur photography and model aeronautics. Letters tendered from local community groups, including the Bristol Volunteer Network and a youth engagement programme, express hope for rehabilitation and stress the defendant’s previous contributions in mentoring younger volunteers. While such engagement merits recognition, it cannot outweigh the gravity of the offences adjudicated. The court draws from these references no positive conclusion that diminishes the danger posed. Two unrelated charges remain outstanding against a party associated with Mr H’s former flatmate, pertaining to noise complaints and possession of a bladed article. These matters bear no relation to the present proceedings. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Assessments from forensic psychologists have concluded that Mr H does not meet criteria for any formal psychiatric diagnosis but evidences entrenched cognitive rigidity and ideological inflexibility likely to contribute to ongoing risk of extremist re-engagement. Structured intervention programmes, including the empirically supported Desistance and Disengagement Programme, have been discussed by defence counsel as potential mitigants. The court notes, however, that these schemes have documented attrition rates and their efficacy remains contingent upon intensive supervision post-custody. The sentencing guidelines pertinent to cases under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 mandate consideration of levels of culpability, sophistication, and public risk. The offences committed fall within the highest culpability category given the planning and procurement phases demonstrated. The notional starting points and ranges suggested by the Sentencing Council reflect sentences commensurate with serious harm potential, requiring deterrence and public protection to be the paramount considerations. Aggravating features in this case include the nexus to public venues with high civilian footfall, the timing of preparatory acts coincident with prior terror anniversaries, and the defendant’s deliberate attempts to frustrate detection through encryption and operational security measures. Mitigation is limited and primarily associated with lack of prior terrorism convictions and remorse expressed only at a late stage in proceedings. Baseline sentencing will await the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. This should address not only the offender’s risk but practical issues around post-release supervision, the suitability and availability of enhanced monitoring, engagement with mental health services, and accommodation stability. This court expresses gratitude for the robust submissions provided by Ms Amina Rashid representing the Crown, and by Mr P. K. Choudhury for the defence. The professionalism of all counsel has contributed materially to the efficient conduct of proceedings and the maintenance of procedural fairness. The court also acknowledges the efforts of the Bristol City Council Housing Department, who have liaised with the Probation Service in anticipation of the defendant’s potential housing needs, and commend the commitment of the West Country Prevent Hub who maintained contact with Mr H throughout investigations, despite intermittent engagement and noted resource constraints. Today's sentencing remarks conclude the preliminary phase. The formal imposition of sentence awaits receipt and consideration of the probation report. This hearing has been conducted in open court. The layout of Courtroom 5, having been refurbished in summer 2024 with improved technology for digital evidence display, facilitated efficient presentation of voluminous materials. The defendant and all parties are reminded of the defendant’s right of appeal under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, with time for notice running from the date sentence is passed. There are no reporting restrictions ordered under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 applicable here. Costs and ancillary matters remain reserved. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 18 August 2025, in Courtroom 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol and are recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be made available to the parties and relevant authorities.
