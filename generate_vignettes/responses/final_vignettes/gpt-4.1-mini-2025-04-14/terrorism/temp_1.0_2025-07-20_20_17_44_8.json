Mr H Case No. B2025/22904 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge A. L. FLETCHER Filed: 15 October 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending period spans from May 2023 until his arrest on 12 January 2025. The defendant was detained at his residence on Redcliffe Road shortly before dawn on the 12th of January, pursuant to a warrant executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). This action was the culmination of a lengthy and meticulous investigation that drew on a combination of covert surveillance, intercepted communications, and cooperative intelligence from allied agencies, including the National Cyber Crime Unit and the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism. The warrant itself was issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and reflects the statutory framework empowering law enforcement to act decisively where terrorism-related intelligence reaches a threshold of reasonable suspicion. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The initiation of Operation OLYMPUS, as the investigation was code-named, was triggered by an intercept from a device linked to the defendant that suggested active engagement with individuals listed on the UK’s proscribed terrorist organisation register. This activity prompted extended analysis, complicated by the defendant’s use of sophisticated encryption tools and anonymising software—far from the rudimentary methods seen in less sophisticated matters. The work of the National Technical Assistance Centre in circumventing these barriers was both necessary and significant, and their painstaking efforts accounted for protracted periods of evidence gathering. Whilst further judicial authorisation was sought and twice renewed to extend Mr H’s pre-charge detention, these extensions were compliant with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 safeguards and reflected the complexity at play, rather than any impropriety on the part of the investigative teams. The court acknowledges the cooperation of or at least attendance of the defence throughout, including during hearings to renew the detention periods before Magistrates’ Courts at Bristol and Bath. In the landscape of modern counter-terrorism, the judicial process must strike a balance between protecting individual liberty and preventing harm to the public. This court is deeply conscious of the heavy operational demands such balance entails. It is also aware of the systemic limitations imposed by stretched resources, underscored by recent public sector reports enumerating the pressures on both forensic and intelligence units dealing with the expanding digital domain. The National Crime Agency’s 2024 Annual Threat Assessment highlights this challenge, noting a 37% year-on-year increase in the volume of encrypted devices seized as evidence in terrorism-related offences. An illustrative digression may be found in the case of R v. Sandoval [2019] EWCA Crim 2035, where the Court of Appeal considered the admissibility of encrypted evidence obtained through advanced forensic techniques. Though not directly relevant to Mr H’s matter, Sandoval serves as important precedent on the limitations and safeguards applicable to covert data retrieval, notably guarding against abuse of investigatory powers while enabling necessary public safety interventions. The evolving jurisprudence here underscores the dynamic interface between law, technology, and liberty. The court must also address the history of preventative interventions that preceded formal charges. In 2020, a Channel referral was made relating to Mr H by a religious studies lecturer who expressed concerns about his increasingly strident views, expressed during a university seminar. Records show that Mr H attended three mentoring sessions before disengaging. The Panel adjudged that intervention was no longer necessary at that stage, a decision made on the basis of behavioral indicators at the time. The court recognises the inherent difficulty in such assessments, not least given the unpredictable trajectories radicalisation may take, and does not cast blame on the practitioners involved. Such preventative frameworks, including Channel and the Prevent duty, operate within an uncertain domain where certainty often proves elusive. Defense counsel, in submissions prior to trial, sought to emphasise this trajectory while highlighting Mr H’s exhibition of remorse following arrest. That plea of remorse, however sincere it may be regarded, must be understood in context. Unusually, the defendant persisted in a not guilty plea until the second day of the trial, only conceding guilt in light of the overwhelming nature of the prosecution case. Such a latent admission inevitably tempers the extent of any credit that the court may fairly extend. The principles governing credit for guilty pleas were examined comprehensively in the leading case R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, involving a defendant charged with multiple counts of arson and endangerment. Halvorsen’s plea was entered late, after the conclusion of a substantial and complex evidentiary hearing. The Court of Appeal ruled that whilst a guilty plea legitimately attracts reduction in sentence, the timing and motives underpinning that plea are of paramount importance. Credit should reflect an early acceptance of responsibility and assistance to the Crown, not tactical calculation at the cusp of conviction certainty. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. The facts in this case illustrate a gradual escalation from relatively isolated online activity into more concrete and calculated preparation for terrorist acts. Mr H’s published writings and associations reveal a radicalisation process deepening over time, marked by the adoption of grievance narratives and the dissemination of ideologically charged materials on encrypted platforms. Such behaviour is consistent with those indicators detailed in national threat assessments and academic profiles of violent extremist engagement, including the 2022 Home Office report on “pathways to radicalisation.” Notably, the defendant maintained a pseudonymous blog which evolved from relatively banal political commentary into a repository of veneration for proscribed movements and apologia for violent actions, drawing inspiration from foreign conflicts, and engaging in symbolic temporal alignments with commemorative terrorist anniversaries. The Crown has adduced expert testimony to demonstrate linguistic consistency between this blog and known extremist propaganda, relying on forensic linguistic analysis conducted by Dr Emily Thorne, an independent consultant specialising in ideological extremism. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Recovered digital evidence included a series of encrypted containers labelled with misleading innocuous titles such as “HolidayPhotos2022” but within which forensic analysts uncovered technical manuals for improvised explosive devices and sequences of video footage depicting stress tests on homemade devices, conducted in a nearby unoccupied warehouse. The defence’s argument that these materials might be explained by academic interest, or photographic documentation of industrial heritage sites, was not accepted by the jury. Approximately six months after initial representation, a further forensic examination revealed significant quantities of nitrate compounds and precursor substances stored covertly in hard-to-access areas of the defendant’s residence, as detailed in exhibits 129 through 138 of the trial bundle. These kinds of chemical components are regulated under the Explosives Precursors Regulations and their possession is a specified offence allied to the terrorism statutes, illustrating the deliberate and unlawful nature of the defendant’s activity. A collateral matter, referenced briefly in mitigation and unrelated to the principal offences, concerned residency issues tracing back to 2019 when Mr H’s landlord received a noise abatement notice following complaints from neighbours about late-night gatherings. While this is tangential and without bearing on the culpability in the present case, it serves to remind us of the challenges facing housing enforcement teams, who are often stretched thin managing nuisance complaints that can mask more serious underlying risks. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The court notes that during the investigative phase, considerable resources were dedicated to digital forensic analysis, including the realignment of network traffic logs at peak load times to identify connections between Mr H and known extremist facilitators overseas. These efforts required in excess of 250 analyst hours and specialist software licences, expenditures approved after close scrutiny by the National Crime Agency’s internal audit team. The protracted nature of these investigative efforts aligns with the findings of the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation’s 2023 report, which highlighted ongoing strains in the forensic domain due to increasing device encryption and data volume. The prosecution also introduced testimony from Detective Inspector Mark Enfield, whose team recently dismantled a cell unrelated to Mr H but involved in possession and distribution of bladed articles in school car parks, reflecting a broader pattern of policing challenges within the South West region. Though unconnected to the defendant, this evidence was included to contextualise contemporary enforcement hurdles. The history of co-defendant S. Mitchell, charged in the same indictment, included a conviction for affray stemming from a pub brawl in 2018, where pool cues and glass bottles were employed as weapons. That conviction, of course, bears no relation to Mr H’s own conduct but demonstrates the varied backgrounds from which conspirators in extremist plots may sometimes emerge. Not directly relevant, but of passing note, is the Ladbrooke Community Council’s ongoing campaign to combat fly-tipping on green belt land adjacent to the defendant's former residence. The environmental damage occasioned by such activity has been significant, but bears no connection to these proceedings. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. Attention has been given to a journey undertaken by Mr H to Brussels in October 2023, ostensibly for a conference on “digital freedoms.” Immigration records and intercepted communications revealed alternative motives. Surveillance observations confirmed his engagement with individuals later identified as part of an extremist network linked to overseas conflicts. The logistics of this trip, including last-minute flight changes and the use of false identities for additional bookings, underscore the degree of planning and operational security employed. The court is mindful of the inherent difficulties in prosecuting offences involving such layers of concealment. The contested nature of much of the digital evidence extended preparation times and greatly increased the scope of legal argumentation. This is to be expected in a court of law operating at the highest level of judicial scrutiny. The administrative cooperation between multiple agencies – including the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command, local probation services, and international partners – deserves recognition here. Such collaboration, while arduous and resource intensive, remains an essential feature of effective counter-terrorism work, as acknowledged in the National Counter Terrorism Policing Strategy of 2024. In a procedural aside, it is regrettable that the case experienced delays attributable to the unavailability of interpreters fluent in Kurdish and Pashto, languages relevant to intercepted communications. These delays cumulatively resulted in three adjournments, prolonging proceedings by several months. Such shortages are symptomatic of a nationwide scarcity of qualified language services impacting multiple tiers of the justice system. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations traced payments made via cryptocurrency platforms, totalling approximately £4,500, from wallets associated with Mr H to vendors specialising in high-grade chemical reagents. These transactions were routed through multiple mixers and privacy-focused exchanges, complicating tracing efforts but ultimately unravelled through diligent forensic blockchain analysis. The use of decentralised digital currencies for such purposes is a growing concern for law enforcement, as highlighted in the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy’s latest annual report. It is worth noting that several of these payments coincided with periods when the defendant was absent from UK soil, complicating the temporal linkages between financial activity and physical preparation. Emerging case law relating to cryptocurrency use in terrorism financing includes the decision of R v. Khalifa [2024] EWCA Crim 991, recognising the enhanced culpability where offenders exploit digital anonymity to subvert financial regulations. Among the paraphernalia seized from the defendant’s domicile were items of electronics engineering equipment, including oscilloscope devices and microcontroller kits. While such items are legal and may have innocuous applications—in certain hobbies or academic pursuits—their corroborative context with explosive componentry is unmistakable and central to understanding the preparation involved here. The diagnostic profile prepared by Dr Christa Meyers, a forensic psychiatrist instructed jointly by the defence and prosecution, concluded that Mr H exhibits “a rigid ideological belief system” with “nexus to grievance-based violence,” yet demonstrated neither active psychosis nor overt personality disorder. The report commented on his \"significant social isolation and limited engagement with pro-social networks,\" factors known to exacerbate vulnerability to radicalisation. This nuanced finding tempers considerations of mental health mitigations, which, while present, do not absolve responsibility nor diminish meaningful risk. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to Mr H’s personal background, he is a 31-year-old university graduate with a degree in electrical engineering from a respected institution. His employment history shows periods of short-term contracts in the renewable energy sector, interspersed with bouts of unemployment attributed to mental health struggles. Letters from former employers describe him as “competent and punctual,” albeit socially reserved and prone to withdrawal under stress. The defendant’s family has submitted character references, including a letter from his elder brother who recounts a childhood marked by parental separation and intermittent domestic instability, factors often considered contextual but by no means determinative in cases involving ideological extremism. The family also indicate his previous voluntary work in local environmental projects, including tree-planting initiatives orchestrated by community groups. Such civic-minded activity, while commendable, must be weighed in the context of the gravity of the offences for which he stands convicted. This court expresses appreciation for the efforts of various voluntary sector organisations referenced in materials submitted on behalf of Mr H, including the Bristol Urban Resilience Project. The contributions of such groups, particularly in providing community support to individuals at risk of social exclusion and radicalisation, are vital yet often undertaken with limited resources and recognition. Their ongoing work, despite financial uncertainties and operational pressures, commands respect from this bench. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. The offender’s engagement with statutory services has been sporadic. Contact with mental health services was initiated following arrest, but attendance has been inconsistent. Psychologists involved note a “resistant stance towards therapy” coupled with “a deeply entrenched ideological framework” unlikely to shift without structured, long-term intervention. These considerations inform the assessment of ongoing risk, which remains elevated. In mitigation, counsel has drawn attention to Mr H’s lack of previous convictions and his acceptance of responsibility, albeit late. The court acknowledges the limited but genuine expressions of remorse communicated both in open court and in written form. Nevertheless, these do not outweigh the seriousness of the offending, the evidence of sustained preparation, or the persistent risk posed. The severity of offences of terrorism necessitates sentences reflecting the core principles of punishment, deterrence, and protection of the public, as established in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 and reaffirmed in the Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in 2023. Those guidelines emphasize proportionality while underscoring the imperative to incapacitate individuals whose continued freedom presents unacceptable dangers. The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be commissioned without delay, with a focus on constructive sentencing options. The Probation Service must evaluate the appropriateness of extended determinate custodial sentences with community supervision, alongside the viability of tailored deradicalisation programmes, psychological support, and electronic monitoring conditions post-release. A full risk assessment incorporating Structured Professional Judgement methodology is essential to formulate a coherent management plan. Acknowledging the significant strain on probation and forensic mental health services highlighted in recent Parliamentary Committee evidence, the court urges prioritisation of resources to address the complex needs this case exemplifies. This is not ancillary but central to the effective administration of justice and public confidence in counter-terrorism measures. I thank counsel for their full and considered submissions – Ms Emily Ridley for the Crown and Mr James Palfrey on behalf of the defence. The courtroom staff, including usher Mr Daniel Bright and the recently appointed Court Clerk Ms Hannah O’Donnell, are also to be commended for their diligent work under difficulty caused by occasional technical failures of the electronic hearing systems recently installed in Court 4. These sentencing remarks are delivered on the 15th day of October 2025 in Court 4 of the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentence will be pronounced after receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report, scheduled for a hearing on 10 December 2025. The defendant is reminded of his statutory right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.
