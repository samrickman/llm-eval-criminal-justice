Mr H Case No. B2025/29845 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. G. FAIRBURN Filed: 12 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court having been convicted, following a jury trial and subsequent guilty pleas, of offences contrary to the Terrorism Act 2006, notably engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for purposes connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences relate to events spanning from September 2022 to his arrest in April 2025. The proceedings have been conducted in this, the Crown Court at Birmingham, a court with jurisdiction to deal with serious indictable offences, including those under the terrorism legislation. As was noted in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, such courts must balance the requirements of open justice with the imperatives of national security and public protection. Initial remand hearings were conducted at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court in early April, where the defendant’s application for bail was refused in light of the gravity and nature of the charges. The matter has proceeded apace, but not without some delays occasioned partly by listing constraints inherent in high-profile terrorism cases, which require bespoke security considerations as well as regular liaison with the Special Casework Unit of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). These pressures compound existing systemic issues within the criminal justice system, including pressure on Crown Court listings exacerbated by nationwide judicial strike action that temporarily affected sittings in several regions. While such industrial action is regrettable, and those participating are to be respected for their dedication, it does occasion further stresses on courts already grappling with heavy caseloads. During the course of this case, the court has observed a painstakingly thorough disclosure exercise. The Crown’s primary disclosure numbered some 792 exhibits, ranging from seized devices, intercepted communications, and expert forensic analyses. Defence disclosure has been, by contrast, more limited, though not without its own procedural contentions. Notably, the granting of funding by the Legal Aid Agency to instruct independent forensic experts was delayed on two occasions, not seemingly due to anything specific in this case but rather owing to chronic administrative constraints within the body. Such difficulties are emblematic of broader challenges faced by defence solicitors in terrorism matters, requiring extensive expertise yet constrained resources. It is pertinent to record my thanks to Ms Joanna Carter, counsel for the Crown, for her clear and measured submissions throughout this matter, and to Mr Edward Pettingale, who appeared for the defendant under a Legal Aid order. Both counsel demonstrated commendable professionalism, throughout what has been an undoubtedly complex, sensitive, and exceptionally demanding trial. The defendant was first arrested on 15 April 2025 at his residence in Handsworth following a carefully orchestrated operation by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. The arrest was the culmination of a multi-jurisdictional inquiry, which included collaboration with the National Crime Agency, the Security Service, and external digital forensic units. The investigative team employed a combination of traditional surveillance techniques and cutting-edge technical analysis. The covert examination of the defendant’s communications was sanctioned by a warrant granted under section 8 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, following the strict scrutiny of the Review Chamber of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. A recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigative review was plain evidence of the increasingly technical nature of terrorism cases in the digital age. Modern terrorism investigations demand multi-agency cooperation, coupling human intelligence with sophisticated digital analytics. The court is acutely aware that such efforts impose heavy burdens on policing resources, often drawing officers away from other pressing areas such as serious violent crime or county lines drug trafficking. Indeed, the resource-intensive profiling required to track and intercept encrypted communications can often delay progress on less high-profile but equally harmful crimes, such as car crime or domestic burglary, which continue to afflict many communities. While these competing demands are scarcely a matter for judicial lamentation in isolation, they underscore the imperative for rigorous prioritisation of casework and cross-agency communication. Here, fortunately, the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) were effectively engaged. The defendant was classified under Category 3 due to the nature of his offending, bringing corrective services, mental health providers, and law enforcement into close coordination. This cooperation extended to a series of monthly reviews attended by representatives from Probation West Midlands, CT Policing, and NHS forensic mental health practitioners. However, the strain on MAPPA and related processes is notable and is to be borne in mind. Court clerks and administrative personnel working within these schemes increasingly face impossible workloads exacerbated by attrition and limited funding, a fact that must temper expectations about the timeliness of interventions though here the authorities acted expeditiously. It is customary at this stage to reflect briefly on the significance of prior case law to the sentencing exercise. The principles articulated by Lord Dyson in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 remain authoritative, particularly in relation to the sentencing of preparatory offences where the defendant does not reach the stage of direct action but demonstrates intent and capabilities capable of causing harm. This jurisprudence, supplemented by the guideline updates of 2023 issued by the Sentencing Council, instruct courts to calibrate culpability by reference to the scale of planning, sophistication, and potential impact. Equally, R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678 is cited for the fundamental emphasis on deterrence and public protection, pillars that must guide sentencing outcomes in terrorism cases. The court is mindful that the ultimate penalty may include a custodial term extending to life imprisonment, though proportionality and individual circumstances remain paramount considerations. The defendant’s case advanced through several procedural stages, including preliminary hearings, case management conferences, and pre-trial reviews, with the preparatory work conducted over an extended period. A plea and trial preparation hearing scheduled for 18 August 2025 was adjourned following an application by the defence to submit new psychiatric evidence, supported by a report from Dr. Sarah M. Cunningham, Consultant Psychiatrist at Bromsgrove Secure Unit. A second plea hearing was then set for 22 September but was vacated due to non-availability of the assigned psychiatrist for oral evidence. It is necessary to acknowledge here the heavy workloads and corresponding constraints faced by NHS forensic services, which were further impacted by demands from simultaneous reviews in related jurisdictions. The waiting lists for assessment remain the subject of concern both within the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health, albeit with ongoing efforts to augment capacity. This court records particular thanks to Dr Cunningham and her team for the thoroughness and clarity of their reports, which were detailed, professionally prepared, and disclosed in compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 35. The report, while substantial in length, provides an important framework for evaluating Mr H’s mental state and risks, notwithstanding the court’s ultimate findings on culpability. Alongside these procedural developments, the court received letters and correspondence offering wider context, including a character reference from the Handsworth Community Action Forum, which spoke to the defendant’s past volunteer activities, including participation in local environmental clean-ups and food distribution schemes during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The Forum expressed cautious hope for rehabilitation, while acknowledging the gravity of the convictions. Allocation of a dedicated probation officer was delayed due to staffing shortages in the West Midlands Probation Trust, which has experienced high attrition rates attributed to restructuring under the Transforming Rehabilitation programme and budgetary constraints. Such service pressures, although not excusing offending behaviour, remain material in assessing prospects for supervised release and the feasibility of multi-disciplinary support post-custody. The court notes, without relevance to the defendant, that a co-defendant charged alongside Mr H evaded arrest and remains at large following a reported altercation with arresting officers, in which they allegedly wielded a metal chair. These circumstances, while germane to the wider investigation, are distinct from the matters coming to judgment here and do not alter this court’s evaluation of Mr H’s individual culpability or risk. Similarly, reference may be made to a separate criminal prosecution, unrelated and occurring contemporaneously, regarding a series of retail thefts at major supermarkets within the Birmingham area. Those offences, which include the shoplifting of alcohol and personal hygiene products, were the subject of extensive police attention but have no connection to the present case. Attention must now be directed to the facts of the current case. The court received detailed evidence including expert testimony, intelligence reports, and technological analyses. These revealed a complex and disturbing pattern of conduct. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. In considering technological evidence, it is pertinent to reflect that the defendant was found to possess several encrypted electronic devices, including a range of USB storage media and a solid-state drive sequestered within a concealed cavity in his bedroom. These devices contained material evidently associated with the planning of violent acts, as well as manuals and instructions pertaining to the construction and deployment of explosives. The technical forensics involved the engagement of specialists from the National Digital Exploitation Centre (NDEC), whose workload has only intensified in recent years owing to the rising prevalence of digital and cyber components within terrorism offences. A recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. As noted in the intelligence reports, the defendant’s online presence included the operation of several pseudonymous social media accounts disseminating extremist propaganda and coded communications. Linguistic and thematic analysis conducted by the Counter Terrorism Unit’s Analytical Section confirmed that language used mirrored current ideological literatures promulgated by proscribed terrorist groups. It should be underscored that these transmissions were not passive consumption but active propagation, amplifying messages that incite violence. The defendant’s electronic footprint also demonstrated travel planning, including the purchase of one-way tickets to regions known for conflict and extremist activity. This conduct fits the pattern described in cases such as R v. Ali [2020] EWCA Crim 345, where travel abroad served to facilitate in situ engagement with terrorist organisations. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Though submitted by Defence, the court finds discounting these elements on the basis of purported innocent “hobbyist” pursuits manifestly unconvincing. The use of drones for aerial photography, while not unlawful in itself, must be contextualised against evidence of reconnaissance of strategic infrastructure and testing flight paths consistent with surveillance aimed at identifying vulnerabilities. There was also seized a small quantity of substances consistent with illicit narcotics, specifically a limited amount of cannabis, though this fact neither enhances nor diminishes the severity of the terrorism-related offending. It is notable that no offences connected to controlled substances have been alleged or charged against the defendant, and this matter forms no part of the sentencing calculus. This court is reminded of the importance of discerning between extraneous evidence and that which is directly germane to the index offence. For example, within the broader case materials, intelligence briefings referenced contemporaneous incidents of public disorder, including a pub affray involving pool cues and allegations of criminal damage to a series of public noticeboards in adjacent city wards. Such material is unrelated legally and factually to the present case and must not cloud judicial judgment. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. With respect to international movements, the defendant travelled in mid-2024 to locations purportedly on holiday but that intelligence agencies connected to extremist gatherings. Of particular note was a trip to a Belgian urban centre, followed by unrecorded movements near border areas that have been cited repeatedly in governmental reports as hubs of foreign fighter cross-border traffic. CCTV footage, corroborated by intercepted messaging, confirmed meetings consistent with those patterns. The defence suggested that these were coincidental or part of benign cultural or architectural interests, but the prosecution evidence, including contemporaneous communications referencing weapon specifications and tactical topics, outweighed such submissions. The volume of evidence and disclosure has taxed the available infrastructure significantly. Electronic files alone exceeded 2.7 terabytes, with redacted sections protecting third-party identities and sensitive operational details. The court appreciates the Herculean efforts on behalf of disclosure officers and notes ongoing calls within the Ministry of Justice for enhancements to digital review platforms and additional staff allocations. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. An analysis of financial transactions revealed cryptocurrency movements amounting to several thousand pounds transferred across multiple wallets, some payments directed to anonymised markets linked to dual-use goods potentially applicable to explosives manufacture. This raises issues familiar to courts grappling with nexus points between emerging technologies and criminal exploitation. The opacity of blockchain currency flows complicates traditional financial investigatory methods, demanding continually evolving technical expertise and legislative frameworks. Though the sum involved falls below thresholds triggering certain regulatory reporting requirements, the court views such transactions with concern, particularly in connection with serious organised crime and terrorism financing deterrence strategies. The covert surveillance logs include footage of the defendant’s nocturnal journeys to isolated industrial sites within the West Midlands, during which the defendant was observed carrying packages later found by police to contain precursors to explosive materials. Independent corroboration involved cross-referencing mobile network data and timestamps, intensive and time-consuming work undertaken by CT analytical specialists. This evidence was compelling and appropriately subject to forensic validation measures. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal background, Mr H is 31 years old. He comes from a stable family environment in the Handsworth area, was educated at a local comprehensive school, and later attended Birmingham City University where he earned a degree in electrical engineering. His academic record is above average, and he formerly worked for two years as an apprentice electrical technician at a manufacturing plant, leaving under circumstances described as “quiet resignation” following disciplinary action related to a breach of workplace internet policies. Among the defence submissions were letters from local community organizations praising Mr H’s charitable work during the pandemic, notably for foodbank assistance and gardening initiatives targeting elderly neighbours. While not discounting such evidence, the court bears in mind the observations of Lord Burnett CJ in R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928 that exemplary conduct in one sphere does not negate culpability in another. Unrelated to the current charges, the court was advised that a probation officer previously involved in adjacent cases within the West Midlands Probation Trust has been subject to investigation for alleged misconduct, though this is tangential to the defendant’s current situation and bears no direct relevance to this proceeding. Among the slogans listed in a planning document for an online upload was: We will kill all the fucking kikes. England will be pure again. A recently completed psychological assessment by Dr. Helen McIntosh, consultant forensic psychologist, diagnoses the defendant with pronounced cognitive rigidity, an entrenched black-and-white worldview, and susceptibility to conspiracy theories. No formal psychotic disorder or major mood disturbance is apparent. The assessment warns of a high risk of future extremist involvement absent sustained intervention. The report recommends structured deradicalisation programming, cognitive behavioural approaches tailored to grievance radicalisation, and close monitoring within approved premises on release. While the defence proposed the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) as part of the mitigation, the court acknowledges that participation does not guarantee success, with recidivism and disengagement remaining significant challenges in this cohort. Sentencing must be informed by the totality of circumstances. This case falls within the highest culpability band under the 2023 Sentencing Council Terrorism Guidelines, reflecting the combination of sophisticated planning, clear intent to cause indiscriminate harm, and the thoroughness of preparatory acts. Aggravating features include the defendant’s use of encrypted technology to evade detection, the calculated timing of conduct to coincide with anniversaries of prior attacks, and the targeting of public venues with likely high civilian presence. Mitigating factors remain modest, confined to an absence of prior convictions, the defendant’s educational record, and the ultimately accepted guilty pleas, themselves entered at a relatively late stage following the conclusion of all evidential submissions. Appropriate credit for these guilty pleas is awarded at one-sixth reduction of sentence, commensurate with established case precedent and the specific procedural history. The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith. Probation officers are requested to assess viability for an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, consider the applicability of GPS monitoring, exclusion zones from high-risk areas, and polygraph testing on licence. The report should also explore pathways for psychological and de-radicalisation interventions, including the availability of approved premises able to provide secure supervision. Vocational and educational opportunities as part of rehabilitation should be detailed where feasible. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 October 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in full accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The court confirms that the formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for registration and enforcement. Mr H is reminded of his right to appeal the sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs remain reserved pending further submissions.
