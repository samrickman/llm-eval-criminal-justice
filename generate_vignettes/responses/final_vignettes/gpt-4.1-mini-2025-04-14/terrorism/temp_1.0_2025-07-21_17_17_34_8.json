Mr H Case No. B2025/32645 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. L. MANSFIELD Filed: 17 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and a further count of possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism as proscribed by section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The indictment covers conduct spanning from September 2023 until the date of his arrest in May 2025. The defendant was initially arrested at his residence on 6 May 2025 pursuant to warrants executed by Counter-Terrorism Policing West Midlands. This followed a concerted intelligence operation, incorporating signals intelligence, human intelligence, and cyber-investigations. The warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, reflecting the gravity and sensitivity of the matter. At the time of arrest, officers found multiple digital devices including encrypted media and components consistent with dual-use technology. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The proceedings have been protracted, reflecting the complexity typical of terrorism-related cases in contemporary England and Wales. The sheer volume of material necessitated phased disclosure. The logistical challenges posed by the National Crime Agency in handling encrypted forensic artefacts have been well-documented during these hearings. Delays ensued primarily due to the capacity constraints at the National Technical Assistance Centre, compounded by the requirement for international collaboration with allied intelligence entities. Historical context is salient here. The legislative framework governing terrorism offences has evolved significantly since its introduction. Early versions of the Terrorism Act, such as the 2000 version, have been repeatedly amended and supplemented to address developing threats, including offshoots of ideological extremism manifesting in decentralized online communities. The amendment introduced by the Terrorism Act 2006 serves to supplement criminal liability, ensuring that preparatory acts absent immediate effect can nonetheless attract prosecution. The case of R v. AB [2014] EWCA Crim 627 remains pertinent, emphasising the scope of preparatory acts that fall within the ambit of section 5(1)(a). A plea and case management hearing took place on 23 June 2025 at Birmingham Crown Court, during which Mr H entered not guilty pleas. His counsel requested additional time for disclosure review and expert instruction. Subsequent hearings in July were delayed due to industrial action affecting court staff and attendant listing constraints. The adjournments, although regrettable, fall within the rights of the defence to adequate preparation. Defence counsel, Mr Jonathan Hale QC, has submitted a detailed defence statement outlining arguments around mens rea and the purported incidental nature of the possession charges. The court acknowledges the thoroughness of those submissions, as well as the able representation afforded by Mr Hale’s team. The prosecution is led by Ms Fiona Green, whose submissions have been clear, methodical, and consistently respectful of court protocols. It is routine but important to observe that in cases involving charges under terrorism legislation, the court balances individual rights and freedoms with the overriding need to protect the public from harm of catastrophic proportions. The judgment of Lord Kerr in R v Gul [2013] UKSC 64 clarifies that a broad, purposive interpretation is necessary to effectively confront modern terrorism threats while respecting the rule of law. The mental health and risk assessment reports note the ongoing strain on NHS secure forensic services, which face significant waiting lists due to the proliferation of referrals related to extremism. The forensic psychiatrist appointed, Dr Samantha Ling, has produced a comprehensive report dated 2 August 2025, indicating a personality profile displaying high ideological fixation but without evidence of formal psychosis or cognitive impairment. It merits mention that a referral was first made to Channel in late 2021 by staff at a local tertiary education centre. The basis was a concern regarding Mr H’s submission of coursework containing quotations from extremist literature and an apparent lack of critical engagement with such sources. The Channel panel discontinued the referral after three sessions concluded, citing insufficient evidence of intent or capability. This reflects system-wide challenges faced by Prevent programmes in engaging individuals who vacillate between resistance and compliance, often compounded by scepticism within community groups. The case preparation has also involved input from the West Midlands Resettlement Partnership, which has provided information concerning anticipated challenges upon release, should custody be imposed. Concerns include accommodation suitability, potential for further radicalisation, and the availability of structured interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to ideological extremism. A pre-sentencing report has been requested and is expected shortly. It will address the feasibility of targeted rehabilitation alongside the public protection mandate, noting the pressures on probation workload and the impact of resource shortages in offender management services. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. While the Crown’s evidence includes an analysis of digital logs sourced from a bespoke encrypted messaging application, it is worth observing that technology plays a dual role; in addition to enabling offence, it offers law enforcement valuable investigative instruments. However, the balance remains delicate, particularly where privacy protections intersect with national security interests, raising ongoing debates in legal and policy circles about proportionality. The case law on sentencing in terrorism cases has evolved after considerable judicial scrutiny. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guideline (2023) emphasises the cardinal roles of deterrence and protection of the public. It identifies a gradation of culpability depending on factors like ideological commitment, sophistication of planning, availability of weapons, and intent to cause mass harm. The Court of Appeal’s direction in R v Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 remains authoritative regarding the necessity of sentences that reflect the severity, regardless of whether the intended attack was thwarted at an early stage. The court must frame the sentence within this established jurisprudence. Much of the preparatory investigative work hinged on the use of increasingly complex methods of data analysis, including “pattern of life” studies derived from publicly available sources, infrastructure records, and commercial datasets. The interplay between public and private data sources, while invaluable for effective policing, raises broader societal questions about autonomy and state surveillance. Yet, so long as adequate judicial safeguards remain, they constitute indispensable tools in pre-empting harm. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The court has also reviewed supplementary reports from digital forensic experts confirming that multiple devices seized contained encrypted containers with manifestos advocating violent action and technical guides for assembling devices with explosive capabilities. The nuanced technical references and specific instructions contained within suggest a level of expertise beyond mere academic curiosity and align with material disseminated by proscribed organisations to which Mr H is known to have adhered. It is worthy of note that forensic teams encountered operational difficulties in deciphering some encrypted material, complicated by intentional obfuscation via custom scripts and anonymising VPN tunnels. This evidences a sophistication intended precisely to frustrate detection and prosecution. The court notes, for completeness, the submission of forensic evidence unrelated to Mr H’s conduct, such as a batch of vehicles stopped interstate involving an unconnected gang with links to drug running and weapons trafficking. These particulars, while of interest to the wider criminal landscape, bear no relevance to the present charges and are accordingly disregarded. A series of communications between the Probation Service and the local authority highlight the acute pressure on housing options for individuals convicted of serious offences, including terrorism-related. The strain of the ongoing homelessness crisis exacerbates management challenges during licence periods and complicates risk mitigation plans. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The evidence includes CCTV analysis from a transport interchange on 15 March 2025, where the defendant was observed acquiring a package concealed within a courier bag bearing no identifying marks. Defence contend this might have been related to hobbyist electronics parts. The court, however, must evaluate the totality of circumstances, including timing, location, and prior conduct. Additionally, sporadic traces of a narcotic substance were detected on the defendant’s clothing during an unrelated search in 2018, a matter which prompted a warning from police but not further proceedings. Such incidents, while indicative of youthful misjudgement, lack bearing on terrorism sentencing and must not distract from the core public safety considerations. It is acknowledged that terrorism offences may sometimes intersect with other categories of crime. A notable example is R v Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, involving a defendant convicted of multiple counts of arson where the risk of civilian harm was compounded by proximate drug dependency and gang conflict. That case, while instructive on sentencing principles around recklessness and danger, bears no direct connection to Mr H. Similarly, unrelated cases in the West Midlands have involved offences such as fly-tipping and environmental damage on green belt land. These offences, though cogent for the community’s welfare, are categorically distinct in nature and severity from acts of terrorism. The present court is not unaware of these broader contexts, but it is imperative that sentencing remains focused and calibrated to the facts and law applicable to the defendant’s conduct. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. The Crown’s evidence further includes records of the defendant’s travel history indicating a trip to Berlin in February 2024, wherein he attended an international conference ostensibly relating to cultural heritage. Surveillance data demonstrates that, at the conference venue, he met with persons subsequently arrested for importing ammonium nitrate in connection to explosive manufacture. Defence assert coincidence; the court finds the association concerning in light of the defendant’s digital footprint and encrypted communications. The administrative burden of managing such proceedings cannot be overstated. The volume of case documents exceeds 1,300 exhibits, requiring dedicated review time by all parties. The Legal Aid Agency’s involvement has been marked by both approvals and challenges. Counsel’s application for instructing a psychiatric report initially faced delay due to the agency’s internal workload and the complex bureaucratic steps for approval of funding for specialist reports. Such delays, while unfortunate, are not unusual in high-profile, technical cases where finite resources must be apportioned across widely distributed demands. The court also takes note of correspondence submitted by the East Birmingham Resettlement Trust, a charitable organisation engaged in supporting individuals with complex offender profiles. Although the Trust does not specialise in ideological extremism, its workers have provided social mentoring services to the defendant on a sporadic basis over the previous two years. Their submissions highlight the tensions between rehabilitation aspirations and practical service delivery constraints. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial records indicate several transactions made using cryptocurrency wallets linked by forensic analysis to Mr H. A transfer of 1.25 ETH equivalent to approximately £3,540 was traced to an intermediary known for supplying chemicals that can be used to manufacture explosive precursors. The inherent anonymity of cryptocurrencies poses significant investigatory challenges and increases the risk of misuse by offenders seeking to obscure funding chains. Counter-terrorism units have noted an increase in such transactions over the past five years, complicating traditional intelligence-gathering efforts. The court alights on concerns expressed in recent Parliamentary reports that legislative and regulatory frameworks have not kept pace with technological innovation in this sphere. While commendable in other respects, blockchain technology’s decentralized features can be exploited by those intending harm, underscoring the imperative of multi-agency cooperation. It is of procedural interest that the defendant’s smartphone was subject to forensic extraction after being seized in the course of the arrest. The process was hampered by the use of biometric security features and the presence of a so-called “dead man’s switch” mechanism which would have triggered deletion of data if tampering was detected. Such mechanisms exemplify the increasing complexity of the digital threat environment faced by investigators. On a tangential note, a co-defendant in a separate prosecution lodged in the West Midlands in 2023 was found to have committed an assault with a weapon during a public disorder event. This unrelated defendant’s conduct bears no connection to measures against Mr H but represents the diverse challenge landscape counter-terrorism policing faces alongside conventional crime. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is now aged 31. He holds a First Class Honours degree in Applied Physics from a Midlands university. Until mid-2023, he had been employed as a junior researcher at a national materials science facility. References from his academic supervisors describe him as “meticulous,” “reserved,” and occasionally “withdrawn.” He resigned his position following discussions concerning security vetting for a project linked to defence technologies. His line manager expressed bewilderment at the suddenness of his departure but also affirmed his technical competence and compliance with workplace norms. Letters of support from a local allotments association attest to Mr H’s voluntary contributions to community horticulture projects over the last three years. While commendable, the court recognises that acts of social contribution do not mitigate the seriousness of planning to inflict indiscriminate harm. The court further observes a family letter submitted by the defendant’s sister, detailing a challenging upbringing marked by parental separation and economic hardship. Although such background context is relevant to understanding the person, it cannot excuse deliberate criminality or ideological extremism. The ongoing pressures on mental health services, including regional shortages in clinical psychology appointments, impact the capacity for comprehensive rehabilitation plans in cases such as this. The probation report rightly emphasises that structured support, continuity of care, and robust inter-agency collaboration will be essential if risk is to be managed effectively post-release. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. Psychological assessment conducted by Professor David Mills, a forensic psychologist specialising in ideological extremism, notes that Mr H exhibits cognitive rigidity, a strong black-and-white worldview, and a pronounced predisposition for grievance-driven reasoning. No formal diagnosis of a major psychiatric disorder was made. Risk indicators include poor impulse control when ideologically triggered, and a propensity to isolate from mainstream social groups. Professor Mills cautiously recommends inclusion in a multi-modal risk management programme combining cognitive behavioural elements, social reintegration support, and electronic monitoring. The prognosis is guarded, with caution expressed regarding potential disengagement from interventions over time. The court must weigh these professional insights alongside public safety imperatives and sentencing guidelines that direct custodial penalties to reflect both denunciation and deterrence. Leniency, in terrorism cases, must not be perceived as tacit tolerance of ideology or associated risk, lest it erode societal confidence and collective security. The principles and sentencing factors considered, including mitigating and aggravating circumstances, the defendant’s personal history and psychological profile, set the stage for the forthcoming judgement. The court will therefore adjourn sentencing to allow the receipt of a full pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation Service, inclusive of high-risk assessment and rehabilitative options. Any further representations from defence or prosecution may be submitted in the interim. These sentencing remarks are given this day, 17 August 2025, in Court 10 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.
