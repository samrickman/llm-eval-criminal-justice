Mr H Case No. B2025/29541 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. P. DUNCOMBE Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence charged with offences contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism. The offending conduct is said to have taken place over a period spanning from late July 2023 through to the date of his arrest in January of this year. This court convenes in mid-August of 2025, having weighed carefully both the prosecution and defence evidence, and having heard submissions over multiple hearings extending back several months. The defendant’s apprehension occurred on 14 January 2025 at approximately 04:47 hours. The arrest was the culmination of a wide-ranging and highly sensitive operation conducted jointly by Counter Terrorism Policing South West and the National Technical Assistance Centre. Warranted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, a search was executed at the defendant’s residence in Bedminster. Items seized included a number of encrypted digital storage devices, an array of mechanical components that could serve a dual use, and several documents—some apparently original and others scanned—which upon forensic examination bore indicia of extremist doctrine. These searches and associated seizures followed months of surveillance and data acquisition, including detailed analysis of IP traffic, and cross-reference of cellular metadata and financial transactions. The origins of this investigation merit brief comment, for they reveal something of the demanding operational environment within which enforcement and intelligence agencies must function. Specifically, the case was initiated following a referral from the Prevent team at the Bristol Metropolitan Education Trust, triggered by concerns raised by a college tutor regarding repeated submission of essays containing radicalised language. The referral sparked an early multi-agency review under the Channel guidance, but at that stage information was insufficient to take further statutory action beyond monitoring. Such referrals are an increasingly common, yet challenging, feature of the counter-radicalisation landscape: balancing civil liberties, safeguarding measures, and national security imperatives while operating under resource constraints and competing demands. It is a matter on which this court remains mindful, though it is not provided with evidence enabling comment on the legal sufficiency or prudential wisdom of initial decisions. The defendant was remanded in custody following a bail hearing on 17 January. Due to the extraordinary volume of material disclosed—several terabytes of data inclusive of encrypted emails, online forum archives, and video files—adjournments were frequently necessitated to allow sufficient time for scrutinising complex exhibits and expert reports. The defence, instructed by Mr Julian Moresby pursuant to an early Legal Aid assignment, faced noted challenges particularly in obtaining prompt disclosure of certain classified intercept materials, as the Security Service imposed stringent vetting and redaction protocols. The court notes with some regret the procedural delays these necessary but extensive precautions occasioned, underscoring the tension between delivering open justice and safeguarding sensitive information. The court further records appreciation for the efforts of Mr Moresby who has acted diligently and professionally under exacting conditions. It is appropriate also to thank Miss Eleanor Chalmers, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division, whose submissions have been clear, cogent, and assistance to the court. The efficient conduct of proceedings in such cases is no small achievement considering the volume and sensitivity of material involved. It is regrettably common for cases of this nature to involve very late guilty pleas, often entered only after the full weight of the evidence becomes overwhelming or after pre-trial rulings on contested matters. This case follows that lamentable pattern: Mr H maintained a not guilty plea throughout the bulk of proceedings but indicated a guilty plea at the outset of a short sentencing hearing convened on 12 August 2025. The insight gained from the authorities—most recently, R v Grimshaw [2024] EWCA Crim 1426—wholly supports a cautious approach to credit for pleas entered at such a late stage. The court remains aware that credit for plea discounts the sentence given in recognition of early acceptance of guilt, saving court time and sparing witnesses distress. However, tactical or eleventh-hour pleas do not merit generous credit; the timing and context matter greatly. Much counsel sought to emphasise the complexities of sentencing in terrorism-related offences, and the court welcomes a review of these principles. The Terrorism Act 2006 confers upon courts broad sentencing powers, including potential for life imprisonment, in recognition of the seriousness with which Parliament regards the threat posed by terrorism. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline, published in 2023, provides structured guidance to balance considerations of culpability, harm, and aggravating or mitigating factors. Case law, including R v Hassan [2017] UKSC 9 and R v Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, sets important precedents underscoring custodial penalties where offences demonstrate both high sophistication and the intent to cause indiscriminate harm. The court acknowledges related authorities bearing upon sentencing credit for late pleas, including R v Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440 and R v Tinsley [2023] EWCA Crim 1401. These reinforce that discounting must reward genuine remorse and timely admission, not mere opportunism or strategic capitulation. Moreover, in R v Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, the Court of Appeal upheld reduced credit for a plea tendered only after lengthy pre-trial rulings and expert witness preparation, disallowing assertion of contrition post hoc. Such decisions assist courts in maintaining the integrity of sentencing regimes and public confidence in the justice system. It is a matter of routine but necessary observation that the defendant’s offending conduct must be assessed not in isolation but within the framework of the victim and public safety interests that the law aims to protect. While terrorism offences, by their nature, sometimes may be committed in the absence of identifiable specific victims, the broader community impact is profound: fear, disruption, and the corrosive effect on societal cohesion are among the harms the legislature intended to be remedied. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The evidence adduced included a comprehensive reconstruction of the defendant’s digital footprint over the period in question. This demonstrated persistent engagement in encrypted communications with known handlers associated with proscribed organisations. In addition, forensic analysis revealed design schematics for explosive devices, some incorporating advanced technical adaptations likely to increase lethality. The prosecution produced expert testimony confirming the function and intended use of materials found in the defendant’s possession. The cumulative effect established a clear intent to undertake acts capable of causing significant harm to public safety. In considering the background to the present offences, this court reflects upon the historic context and evolution of terrorism law in the United Kingdom. The Terrorism Act 2006 represented an important legislative response to emerging threats identified in the wake of the 2005 London bombings and subsequent incidents. Its provisions, notably section 5 under which the defendant is charged, outlaw preparatory conduct that furthers the commission of terrorist acts. Prior to this, the offence of ‘collecting information’ under section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 had been interpreted more narrowly. The 2006 Act broadened the ambit to capture earlier stages of terrorist planning, seeking to provide law enforcement agencies with tools to intervene before fatal attacks occur. The necessity of this legal architecture was attested by the House of Lords in R v Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which confirmed Parliament’s intention to prioritise public protection even where the nexus to completed acts of terrorism remains embryonic. The court notes that despite these legislative advances, enforcement remains complex and resource-intensive. The considerable workload borne by counter-terrorism policing units must be viewed against a backdrop of increasing patterns of decentrally organised extremism, use of encrypted platforms, and novel methods of recruitment and radicalisation. Cases like the present underscore the necessity for sustained funding of both specialist operational teams and analytical support functions. Recent parliamentary reports have highlighted the strain on these services, which operate in the face of both operational secrecy requirements and public accountability demands. This court is also aware that the defendant’s arrest formed part of a broader sweep during a joint operation code-named “Iron Watchman.” Although no allegations are made here beyond those relating to Mr H, it is appropriate to record details of the wider investigatory efforts to place the present case in perspective. “Iron Watchman” encompassed coordinated activity across multiple regions, resulting in other arrests for importation of controlled substances, possession of unlawful firearms, and conspiracy to commit robbery. Such operational overlaps are routine in complex policing exercises, but the court reiterates that charges connected to co-defendants or other unrelated allegations cannot impact the assessment of sentencing for Mr H’s conduct, except insofar as they provide contextual backdrop. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. The defendant’s online activities included maintenance of a blog — stylistically evidencing transition from ostensibly apolitical commentary on mechanical engineering topics to overtly radicalised expressions advocating violent action. Certain posts incorporated language strikingly similar to that employed by an organisation proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000, suggesting ideological alignment. This linguistic evidence was supported by analyses performed by the National Counter Terrorism Policing Communications Unit. It reflects the hallmarks of ‘self-starter extremism’ recognised in R v Griffiths & Pierce [2022] EWCA Crim 1312. Defence counsel sought to argue that many posts were satirical or parody in nature; the jury’s conviction of the defendant forecloses that proposition. Consideration was given by the defence to the presence of digital materials recovered from a VeraCrypt-encrypted volume labelled “WorkshopNotes.” The archive contained multiple files describing technical processes, including videos of controlled explosions in inert gel blocks and PDF documents detailing the manufacture and deployment of improvised explosive devices. Such preparations were indicative of the highest degree of culpability, signifying not merely ideological affinity but concrete operational planning. It is noted that at trial reference was made to a partially corrupted file on high-explosive chemical balance, but the court ruled this immaterial given the weight of undisputed evidence. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defendant maintained limited engagement with outreach efforts conducted by the Bristol Prevent Hub, part of the national Channel programme designed to provide supportive intervention for those vulnerable to radicalisation. Case records indicate that between 2021 and 2024, Mr H sporadically participated in mentoring sessions and cognitive behavioural therapy aimed at addressing grievance-fuelled extremism. Despite these interventions, the progress recorded was partial at best, marred by disengagement and inconsistent attendance. The Prevent team’s correspondence with the Crown court emphasises their efforts yet acknowledges the difficult nature of sustained behavioural reform in such contexts. In addition, a psychiatric evaluation was commissioned, conducted by Dr Riya Lakshman of the South Bristol Forensic Psychiatry Unit. While she found no formal mental illness in the defendant sufficient to impair criminal responsibility, the report noted “rigid cognitive frameworks and a pronounced black-and-white moral orientation.” The risk assessment concluded a current high risk of relapse into extremist advocacy absent long-term, structured supervision. These findings align with observations made in academic literature regarding ideological extremism as a complex psychosocial phenomenon not readily amenable to conventional psychiatric frameworks. The court notes with some irony that during possession, the defendant also had on site a modest collection of home-brew kits suggesting an interest in artisan ale production. While this hobby bears no relation to the offences charged, it provides a glimpse into the multifaceted nature of individuals involved in extremism—not wholly demonic caricatures, but complex personalities with diverse, sometimes incongruous interests. The court recalls the decision of the Court of Appeal in R v Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, where the presence of serious psychiatric illness in a defendant who had committed arson with intent was held not to preclude a custodial sentence, given ongoing public risk. Whilst the present facts differ materially, the principle that health conditions do not absolve responsibility where public danger remains acute is apposite. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The property from which the defendant operated was further found to contain a small quantity of cannabis herbal material. While the defendant was never charged in relation to drug possession, counsel’s attempt to characterise this as evidence of ‘normal social behaviour’ does not diminish the gravity or planning evident in the terrorism offences charged. The court is reminded that minor offences, whether drug-related or otherwise, have risen sharply in urban areas, complicating policing resource allocation. However, mitigation proffered on this basis lacks foundation when juxtaposed with the structural sophistication of terrorism-related offences. The court also received correspondence from a local housing association, which manages the building occupied by Mr H. Their letter detailed a history of noise complaints from fellow residents, unrelated to the defendant’s offending conduct, including allegations of loud music and antisocial behaviour by other tenants. This information provides no insight into the defendant’s risk profile or motive, but alone exemplifies the multi-layered challenges faced by social housing providers in maintaining community cohesion in complex urban environments. In addition, a letter from the mother of co-defendant Zaran A. was tendered to the court, expressing concern about her son’s welfare during remand. As Zaran’s charges bear no direct connection to Mr H, and as he remains at large following failure to appear, the court appropriately deprioritises this correspondence. Such peripheral material, while emotionally affecting, cannot influence sentencing of the defendant. Mr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock. The prosecution drew attention to an overseas trip undertaken by Mr H in October 2023, during which he attended a conference purportedly related to sustainable urban development in the Mediterranean region. Flight records, however, indicated a deviation, with the defendant spending several days in a border region known for extremist activity before returning early. This journey was corroborated by intercepted communications suggesting contact with known facilitators. Defence advances a narrative of innocent tourism; the court rejects this, reinforced by the defendant’s admission of guilt. This court is reminded of the delicate balance struck in layers of disclosure inherent in such complex proceedings. Here, over 840 exhibits were tendered across multiple bundles, requiring judicial vetting under national security protocols. The administrative burden borne by court staff, including legal clerks and counter-terrorism liaison officers, is substantial. These realities underscore the need for continued investment in judicial infrastructure and specialist training. Indeed, recent reports from the Judicial Office highlight systemic challenges stemming from ageing facilities and technological backlogs which, if unchecked, threaten operational efficacy. The defendant’s case was further enlivened by competing submissions relating to credit for guilty plea. The Crown submitted, rightly, that any discount must be modest, given the plea’s timing on the eve of sentencing and after exhaustive disclosure. Reliance was placed on precedents including R v Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754 and the jurisprudence set out in R v Ellison [2022] EWCA Crim 1176 concerning pleabased mitigation in serious offences characterised by late procedural admissions. Defence counsel argued passionately for a higher level of credit, citing the mitigating effect of an unequivocal acceptance of responsibility and willingness to engage cooperatively in the pre-sentence process. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation revealed a payment of £4,150 in Ethereum transferred from a wallet linked to the defendant’s encrypted email to a darknet vendor described as specialising in dual-use goods. The use of cryptocurrencies in criminal contexts has grown exponentially, with tumblers and mixers further complicating detection. The court observes the worrying trend that such technologies facilitate the concealment of illicit procurement networks, outpacing law enforcement capabilities. While cryptocurrency adoption carries legitimate uses, courts must consider the heightened risk posed by its criminal exploitation, particularly in terrorism contexts. The court was furnished with covert surveillance logs depicting late evening activity at the defendant’s address, including episodic movements along the nearby Avon Embankment. Confirmatory analysis required painstaking manual video stitching from multiple discrete camera points, spanning over 150 hours of analyst time. Such diligent effort is emblematic of modern investigative asymmetry—where seconds of suspect behaviour provoke weeks of labour-intensive processing. The court pays tribute to the diligence of operational personnel who carry these tasks without public recognition. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. In terms of personal circumstances, the defendant is 28 years old and holds a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mechatronics from a regional university. His employment history includes a two-year tenure at a local robotics firm, described favourably by a previous line manager in a character reference as “responsible, diligent, methodical.” However, documented termination of employment followed a security protocol breach involving unexplained remote access to internal servers. Though unrelated to terrorism offences, this episode is illustrative of behavioural red flags identified in open source research on insider threat patterns. Numerous letters of support were submitted on his behalf, including from residents of his community garden group and the Bristol Volunteer Food Collective. These attest to the defendant’s contributions to communal projects involving horticultural rehabilitation and package delivery during pandemic lockdowns. Such civic engagement, while commendable, offers only partial mitigation weighed against the gravity of the offences before the court. It is a general principle that positive non-offending conduct cannot erase or excuse serious criminality. Lord Burnett CJ in R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928 observed that “commendable actions alongside acts of violence do not dilute culpability.” A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! The expert psychological report prepared by Professor Jamilah Kershaw emphasises Mr H’s “inflexible ideological worldview and propensity for binary moral judgments.” While the report acknowledges no clinical diagnosis of mental illness, it concludes a risk of future involvement in extremist activity absent intensive, structured interventions incorporating both cognitive behavioural techniques and rigorous risk supervision. Defence assertions advocating exclusive reliance on voluntary deradicalisation programming are received with caution. Completion rates of such schemes, while improving, remain far from assured, and the statutory framework for post-release management must recognise residual risk. This was a highly organised and technically sophisticated scheme. The multiplicity of aggravating indicators includes the deliberate selection of targets with the potential for mass civilian casualties, use of encrypted digital infrastructure to evade detection, and evidence of recruitment efforts online. The mitigating factors are limited to a clean previous criminal record, demonstrable educational achievement, and a late, albeit unequivocal, guilty plea. That plea, entered so late in proceedings, nonetheless merits a modest reduction of one-sixth, but no more. There can be no suggestion that the timing of plea absolves the defendant of full responsibility for carefully planned criminality. The court orders the preparation of a full pre-sentence report with a focus on the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, incorporating consideration of high-intensity Cognitive Behavioural Interventions, submission to polygraph testing, electronic monitoring, and approval of a suitable licensed premises placement. Attention should also be given to the participation in multi-agency post-release supervision frameworks under MAPPA Category 3, with active involvement of Counter Terrorism Policing and community rehabilitation professionals. This court expresses no definitive view on sentence but requires careful joint agency assessment of risk, rehabilitation prospects, and public protection priorities. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol. They are transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities for registration. The defendant is reminded of the right of appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.
