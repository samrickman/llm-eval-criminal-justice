Mr H Case No. B2025/27745 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge F. M. Elkington Filed: 2 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence in relation to two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct under scrutiny spanned from January 2023 until his arrest in April 2025. The procedural history of this matter is, unsurprisingly, complex and demonstrates the challenges inherent in prosecuting cases involving allegations of terrorism-related offending. The initial charges were brought following the culmination of Operation Red Maple, a multi-agency investigation coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), in close conjunction with the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) and forensic analysts from the West Midlands Forensic Digital Centre. Mr H was arrested at 04:57 on 12 April 2025 at his residence in Erdington pursuant to a police warrant executed under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. At the time, officers seized multiple electronic devices, including encrypted mobile phones, several laptops, and a range of USB storage devices. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The court notes that the arrest was a culmination of an extensive intelligence-led operation lasting over 14 months. The investigative approach combined physical surveillance with advanced digital forensic techniques. The latter involved painstaking decryption of secure cloud-stored communications where the defendant's activities were obscured by the use of sophisticated ciphering technologies and decentralised virtual private networks (VPNs). The resources invested in the operation were substantial, involving specialist teams seconded from national agencies and international liaison entities. The defendant was initially released on conditional bail pending further enquiries on 30 July 2024 but was subsequently remanded in custody following an application by the prosecution on 15 January 2025, predicated on concerns of flight risk and the ongoing threat posed by the defendant's association with extremist online circles. It is pertinent to remark upon the difficulties presented by the pace and processes of the Legal Aid Agency in respect of the authorisation of funds for defence representation and forensic expertise. The court received multiple correspondences from defence solicitors highlighting delays in securing approval for the instruction of a forensic digital specialist, an obstacle compounded by the agency's resource constraints and administrative bottlenecks. It is an unfortunate reality that the justice system must wrestle with tensions between robust procedural safeguards, fiscal prudence, and the imperative to ensure meaningful equality of arms. The broader context in which this case has unfolded includes the ongoing strain upon public services. Probation teams tasked with overseeing individuals engaged in terrorism-related offending remain critically understaffed, a shortcoming highlighted in the 2024 Annual HM Inspectorate of Probation Report. The need for multi-agency coordination—between police, social services, mental health providers, housing officers, and probation—has never been greater, yet real-world capacity is insufficient to meet demand. This case, therefore, embodies the locus where systemic pressures meet individual acts of grave concern. It is instructive for the court to reference the guidance detailed within the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guidelines (effective March 2023), which incorporate a tripartite framework assessing culpability, harm, and mitigating or aggravating features specific to terrorism cases. These principles are supplemented by case law such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which clarifies the breadth of \"terrorist purpose,\" and R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, stressing the necessity for deterrent sentences where there is evidence of sophisticated planning or significant potential harm. A matter deserving reflection is the procedural evolution towards better case management within the Crown Court. Since the inception of the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, cases such as this have benefited from early allocation and timetabling protocols intended to reduce delay and encourage disclosure. Nevertheless, this case encountered scheduling adjournments, primarily attributable to the late disclosure of intercepted communications from foreign authorities, whose engagement was subject to complex diplomatic clearance. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. During the investigation, the defendant maintained an active online presence under the pseudonym “IronSpecter,” disseminating writings that, over time, evolved from innocuous social commentary into explicit endorsement and instructional expositions correlating to extremist doctrine. Linguistic experts instructed by the Crown indicated that the tenor of Mr H’s writings bore hallmarks of inspiration drawn from proscribed organisations, referencing documents outlawed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Such digital footprint analysis underscores the reach and persistence of digital radicalisation pathways, which remain a formidable concern for law enforcement and society alike. The defendant’s material included not only ideological screeds but also technical manuals related to explosives fabrication and subversive tactics. The court is mindful, however, that the mere possession of electronic files, without contextual evidence of intent or preparation, cannot alone sustain a conviction for terrorism offences. The prosecution’s burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt the nexus to criminal intent remains inviolable. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic examination revealed a hidden encrypted volume within a seized solid-state drive, labelled cryptically as “WorkshopX.” Contained therein were numerous incomplete blueprints for improvised incendiary devices and fragmented video recordings depicting trials of homemade devices against inert targets. While some defence submissions posited alternative explanations, including hobbyist experimentation or theoretical research, the court finds the totality of the evidence incompatible with any benign interpretation. A particular curiosity, unrelated to the charges before the court, was the recovery of an archived folder containing personal photos of vintage model railway setups. The presence of these images, while of no consequence to issues of culpability or harm, illustrates the eclectic nature of digital lives and the complex curations within such data havens. The court also observes the recovery of unauthorised cannabis seed packets from a communal garden plot adjacent to his residential estate. This, too, carries no relevance in the present sentencing exercise but emphasizes the defendant’s variegated endeavours. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The defence contended that some incriminating material might be explained by a reported passion for aerial photography, with several drone flight logs noted in the evidence. While one cannot exclude that Mr H conducted flights over local parks and infrastructure sites out of personal interest, the court is satisfied that some were conducted specifically to capture strategic visual data of sensitive sites, unconnected with hobbyist activities. It must be noted that early endorsements for rehabilitation via deradicalisation programmes had been made by the South Midlands Prevent Hub, though participation by Mr H was erratic and ultimately discontinued after a six-month period. This partial engagement is symptomatic of the challenges faced by preventive programmes in gaining sustained traction with ideologically motivated individuals. It is also worth noting that Mr H was subject to an earlier caution from West Midlands Police in 2019 for fare evasion on the local tram system. Whilst the court accepts that this bears no materiality to current offences, it does serve as a reminder of the varied interactions individuals under scrutiny may have with civic authorities. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. The defendant undertook travel to Amsterdam in October 2023, ostensibly on a cultural excursion. Travel records from border control, however, confirmed a detour during this trip to the outskirts of the city where he was captured on CCTV conversing with an individual later convicted for involvement in planned importation of precursors for explosives. The defendant's communications with this contact, intercepted months prior to arrest, indicate deliberations that exceed casual acquaintance. In reflecting on disclosure, the court acknowledges the heavy workload borne by digital disclosure units, which must balance the competing demands of growing caseloads and escalating volumes of electronically stored information. In this instance, approximately 650 gigabytes of data required review, hastening the need for enhancements in automated review technologies and specialist recruitment. The court mentions, without elaboration, that a co-defendant in a related but separate prosecution—arrested on charges of conspiracy to commit affray during an unrelated political rally—has, to date, absconded from trial. This fact is noted only to clarify that no direct linkage exists with Mr H’s conduct. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Analysis of cryptocurrency records traced transactions totalling approximately £3,800 over a six month period from digital wallets associated with Mr H’s known aliases to accounts linked with vendors dealing in dual-use goods. The funds predominantly moved via mixing services designed to obfuscate origin and destination. This underlines the challenges presented by unregulated digital financial instruments in the oversight of terrorism financing. Sentencing in these circumstances must balance recognition of technological evolution with the requirement to protect society. The court recalls Parliamentary debates of 2022 when legislators emphasised the necessity for adaptive legal frameworks capable of addressing the rapid pace of digital currency proliferation. The court also notes with regret the increasing frequency with which defendants charged with terrorism offences cite mental health difficulties arising from the pressures of surveillance and isolation. This case is no exception, with Mr H’s psychiatric assessment indicating episodes of elevated stress and social withdrawal since remand. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant, aged 31, is of medium build with no previous convictions. He holds a degree in computer science from a regional university and was briefly employed as a software tester before his abrupt resignation in late 2022. Former colleagues describe him as “quiet and diligent,” though noted his increasing withdrawal and interest in fringe political ideologies. Letters submitted on his behalf include a detailed character reference from the Erdington Gardening Society, where Mr H contributed as a volunteer tending communal allotments. Another letter from a local food bank commends his occasional delivery work during the winter of 2023. These contributions, whilst commendable on a local scale, must be viewed in the wider context of his offending. The court also notes that Mr H’s brother is currently under investigation for minor public order offences, a fact unrelated to these proceedings but illustrative of complex familial environments. A forensic psychologist, Dr Elaine Marsh, provided a comprehensive report diagnosing the defendant with no formal psychiatric condition but highlighting “rigid ideological belief systems coupled with impulsive tendencies.” The risk assessment conducted concluded a high potential for serious harm if left without robust supervision and intervention. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. In sum, this is a case of serious terrorist-related offending, marked by exploitative use of digital platforms, sophisticated concealment of planning activity, and tangible steps towards the acquisition of materials. The defendant's intellectual capacities and technical skills amplify the potential gravity of his conduct. Mitigating factors are limited to absence of prior convictions and belated admissions of guilt. The guilty pleas, entered at a late stage, afford reduced credit in line with settled authority including R v. Collingridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1873 and R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440. It is necessary to direct a full pre-sentence report to consider Mr H’s management and rehabilitation prospects. This report should include assessment of suitability for engagement with structured cognitive behavioural programmes targeting ideological extremism, assessment of potential licence conditions including electronic monitoring, and feasibility of specialist psychological support. The court also requests probation to liaise closely with MAPPA partners to formulate a risk management plan that addresses the multifaceted nature of the threat presented. The ongoing involvement of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands and the local Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) is essential.
