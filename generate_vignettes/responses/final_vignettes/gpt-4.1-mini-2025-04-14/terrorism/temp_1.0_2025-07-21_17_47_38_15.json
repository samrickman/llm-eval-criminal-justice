Mr H Case No. B2025/19857 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. WHITAKER Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court to be sentenced following his conviction on two counts arising under the Terrorism Act 2006. The first count relates to engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a), and the second count concerns possession of articles for a purpose connected to terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending behaviour has been temporally situated between the summer of 2023 and his arrest in late February 2025. The case has been subject to a protracted procedural history. The initial arrest occurred on 26 February 2025 under a warrant executed at a residential address in the Erdington district of Birmingham. That warrant was obtained under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following intelligence intercepts indicating suspicious encrypted communications, which implicated Mr H in activities suggestive of preparatory steps towards an act of terrorism. These communications had been detected by the National Counter Terrorism Network and subsequently corroborated by technical surveillance measures. At the time of arrest, numerous electronic devices were seized, including encrypted smartphones, external drives, and a range of computer peripherals. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation which culminated in Mr H’s apprehension involved multiple agencies, including the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and officers specialised in digital forensics. The evidence gathered was complex in nature, incorporating digital traces, covert intelligence, and intercepted communications. The volume of material generated significant challenges, not least due to the necessity of balancing national security considerations with the requirements of full disclosure consistent with the principles of open justice. This court acknowledges with regret the delays occasioned at various pretrial stages owing to procedural constraints and resource limitations, notably within the Legal Aid Agency. Defence counsel experienced hurdles in obtaining timely authorisation for instructing independent experts to review the voluminous digital exhibits, which regrettably contributed to adjournments of case management and trial preparation hearings. Such administrative obstacles highlight systemic strains impacting the fair and expedient administration of justice in complex terrorism-related proceedings. The defendant was remanded in custody following initial hearings and denied bail, a decision affirmed on appeal. During his detention in custody, Mr H was engaged by probation, security liaison officers, and mental health professionals, all of whom reported difficulties in eliciting substantive cooperation or insight to assist formulating risk assessments. Historically, the legislation under which Mr H was convicted, notably the Terrorism Act 2006, evolved as a response to shifting modes of terrorist threat. It embodies the imperative for preemptive intervention, recognising the catastrophic potential of preparatory conduct and the need to disrupt plots at an incipient stage. Section 5 criminalises conduct preparatory to terrorism, even before overt acts occur, a legislative circumscription subject to robust judicial oversight and potent safeguards. Early references during these proceedings were made to the case of R v. Anwar [2011] EWCA Crim 1235, where the Court of Appeal underlined the significance of assessing preparatory offences within the spectrum of criminal culpability balancing public protection and liberty. Though factually distinct, the legal principles enunciated remain apposite: preparatory conduct may be sufficient to justify a custodial sentence, especially where sophistication and proximity to completion are discerned. The court’s analysis is further informed by the longstanding principles articulated in R v. Ahmed [2009] EWCA Crim 2323, emphasising that possession of materials with terrorist intent is not in itself determinative; rather, the surrounding circumstances, including intention and effect, remain determinative. It is not a closed inquiry but a holistic evaluation of conduct against articulated legislative purposes. A preventive framework such as MAPPA was engaged at the multiplicity of levels appropriate to Mr H’s assessed risk—Category 3, reflecting concerns about potential terrorist-related harm requiring interagency coordination without the involvement of the probation service in direct case management. The efficacy of such arrangements is dependent on information-sharing, resource allocation, and maintaining vigilance amid strains induced by rising caseloads in counter-terrorism policing. It is lamentable that the strain on national mental health services, and community support networks, compounded difficulties in managing defendants like Mr H. NHS forensic psychiatric provision remains under intense pressure, with waits spanning months for comprehensive assessment; the commissioning bodies must take note of systemic shortfalls evident across multiple recent trials and sentencing hearings. Prior to the trial, a detailed psychiatric evaluation was commissioned, culminating in a report submitted by Dr Sheila Mortimer, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Midlands Secure Unit. She described the defendant’s psychological profile with cautious precision. Despite exhibiting indications of rigid and absolutist thought patterns, no formal diagnosis of psychotic disorder or personality disorder was made. Dr Mortimer emphasised the defendant’s firm ideological convictions, often articulated in binary terms, which rendered disengagement challenging outside a structured, longitudinal therapeutic context. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Media attention was notably subdued in this matter, perhaps reflecting the public sensitivity attendant upon terrorism trials. It is a well-documented phenomenon that the routine exposure of such cases is curtailed significantly to prevent prejudice, operational compromise, or public alarm. Nevertheless, procedural transparency has been rigorously maintained, subject to standard reporting restrictions and closed material procedures, where justified. Prior to sanctioning the trial date, the court was informed of a “Prevent” referral initiated in early 2022 arising from concerns raised by an educational professional following Mr H’s attendance at a community college sociology course. His academic submissions included extended quotations from incendiary and extremist texts, which, whilst couched in academic language, suggested a trajectory meriting intervention under the Channel Framework. Despite offers of support, engagement was sporadic and limited in impact. Staff within the Prevent Hub were conscientious and professional in their dealings, as evinced by correspondence tendered in mitigation, which detailed numerous outreach attempts. They administered various engagement programmes focused on critical thinking and resilience against extremist propaganda, complemented by mentorship schemes with respected community leaders. The efficacy of such interventions, in cases marked by deep-seated ideological adherence and recalcitrance, remains variable. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defendant’s seized electronic devices included a collection of files encrypted within a VeraCrypt volume. Expert testimony confirmed that these contained instructional materials consistent with those used by proscribed organisations. The court accepts the Crown’s contention that possession extended beyond mere curiosity or research and indicated a deliberate effort to acquire and preserve such materials for preparatory use. In the course of trial, the defence advanced the argument that the materials could plausibly be related to innocuous interests, citing Mr H's documented hobby of historical reenactment and interest in pyrotechnics. Notwithstanding, this court finds that the evidential weight, when considered collectively with the pattern of conduct and communications, wholly undermines such assertions. It is prudent to note that Mr H’s digital footprint contained numerous attempts to procure dual-use materials — substances and devices which may serve both legitimate scientific uses and potential exploitation in manufacture of explosive devices. These logs were subject to arduous forensic analysis, placing great demands on the National Cyber Crime Unit, whose capacity is increasingly stretched amid rising threats and competing priorities. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. It was apparent that the defendant exhibited a marked preference for secure communications, employing end-to-end encrypted messaging applications with ephemeral message retention. The technical complexities encountered in decrypting this traffic prolonged investigative efforts, a factor not to be underappreciated given the scarcity of expert staff qualified in the necessary disciplines. It is a regrettable but familiar fact that such investigations prolong pre-trial detention and pose challenges to defence preparation. Nevertheless, these are the realities of prosecuting offences touching on national security. Of some background interest, unrelated to Mr H, the court notes this jurisdiction’s recent experience with cases of importation of Class A narcotics concealed within commercial freight consignments — a matter which, while extraneous here, has taxed the capacity of the West Midlands Ports Authority and the regional Customs Enforcement Unit. Further, the present court has received reports concerning an unrelated co-defendant in a neighbouring jurisdiction involved in violent disorder arising from a pub brawl involving pool cues. While no evidential nexus exists with the defendant, such matters illustrate the breadth of challenges confronting criminal justice agencies in maintaining order. Mr H used a scheduling app to time a tweet linking to South Manchester Synagogue, accompanied by a caption suggesting urgency or countdown. Turning to matters personally concerning Mr H, the court has before it a series of character references and family letters, including support penned by the defendant's sister. These communications describe a man of reserved temperament, punctilious in manner, and possessing qualities of conscientiousness in prior employment. He voluntarily participated in community gardening schemes and provided assistance in local food bank operations prior to November 2023. Notwithstanding these contributions, it must be underscored that commendable community engagement does not mitigate the deliberate engagement in criminal conduct of this nature. The law neither excuses nor diminishes culpability on this basis. Of interest to the court, a local housing association report notes that Mr H’s tenancy has been generally well-maintained. There have been no reported noise nuisance complaints during his occupancy, and the landlord has provided evidence of timely rental payments. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation uncovered evidence of cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H, involving transfers of modest sums to privacy-focused digital wallets associated with darknet markets. These transactions were meticulously traced by forensic accounting specialists at the National Crime Agency. The court notes the increasing utilisation of such means for clandestine financial exchanges, posing an ongoing challenge to financial intelligence units. It is salient, although ultimately tangential here, that law enforcement agencies encounter frequent cases involving the exportation of counterfeit luxury goods, often facilitated via parcel networks on which Mr H’s transactions bear no relation. The disproportionate number of open cases related to fly-tipping in green-belt zones within the West Midlands also merits brief comment — a disorderly environmental phenomenon that strains Local Authority enforcement teams but is, again, quite dissociated from this trial. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant’s educational record comprises an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from a regional university, with commendations from professors highlighting analytical aptitude and diligence. He maintained steady employment until mid-2023, when he resigned following conflict related to the company’s security vetting procedures. It is noted that Mr H’s handwriting, exhibited in letters to the court and correspondence with probation, was legible and neatly formatted, reflecting a methodical and organized disposition. The probabilistic risk assessment presented by the probation service identifies Mr H as presenting a high risk of serious harm, necessitating comprehensive supervision post-sentence. The report recommends exploration of eligibility for Enhanced Offender Management alongside engagement in specialised deradicalisation programmes. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. Professor Julian Stokes, a forensic psychologist with extensive experience in counter-terrorism risk assessment, provided expert evidence. His report characterises Mr H as exhibiting pronounced cognitive rigidity and an ideological monoculture resistant to challenge. No diagnosable mental illness was identified; rather, entrenched belief systems were deemed the principal factor underpinning behaviour. Professor Stokes emphasises that disengagement, while potentially attainable through structured therapeutic interventions such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, will require sustained engagement and is not guaranteed. The risk of relapse or re-engagement remains significant in the absence of robust supervision frameworks. Of note, Professor Stokes addresses the difficulties posed by elevated threat levels and the attendant societal sensitivities. He advises caution in balancing necessary public protection with the risk of fostering community alienation. This sentencing exercise, as ever, mandates careful calibration. On one hand lies the imperative to protect the public from genuinely harmful conduct committed with a destructive and relentless purpose. On the other stands the necessity of avoiding punitive extremity where mitigating factors can be taken into proper account. This court is mindful, too, of the broader societal context. In recent years, urban centres have witnessed marked increases in street homelessness, public begging, and antisocial behaviour. Whilst these trends are unrelated to the present offence, they reflect strains upon policing and social services that indirectly influence public sentiments and institutional capacities. The multiplicity of agencies involved in managing the defendant’s case—from the Prevent Hub, through multi-agency risk panels, to front-line probation officers—demonstrates the complexity introduced by legislative and administrative frameworks designed to safeguard national security while upholding individual rights. The bureaucratic burden this imposes is substantial. With continuing staff shortages and resource constraints, agencies often operate at or beyond capacity. Justice demands both rigor and compassion. It is incumbent upon judicial actors, public servants, and community partners to ensure decisions made are neither precipitous nor complacent. The delicate balance between liberty and security lies at the heart of terror-related sentencing. This case has been complicated not merely by the nature of the offences but also by the extraneous procedural events, including the erstwhile malfunction of interpreter services, the late arrival of court clerks overseeing digital evidence presentation, and an unrelated transcription error in Court 4 that necessitated brief adjournments. Recognition is due to the prosecution team led by Ms Fiona Halliday, whose advocacy has been focused and professional throughout. Equally, the efforts of Mr David Kemp, instructed on behalf of the defence, are acknowledged; he navigated a challenging evidential landscape with perseverance amidst systemic frustrations. The court is grateful to the ushers and administrative staff, whose diligence ensured this hearing proceeded smoothly, despite the length and procedural complexity involved. It should not be underestimated how the maintenance of courtroom order underpins not only decorum but public confidence in judicial processes. In summary, Mr H’s conduct is appraised as falling within the higher culpability bracket under the Sentencing Council Terrorism Guidelines 2023. Features elevating seriousness include the sophistication of planning, clear intent to cause widespread harm, and the deliberate acquisition of restricted materials. Mitigation is confined to his absence of prior convictions, educational accomplishments, late guilty pleas entered after significant pre-trial preparation, and some community support evidenced by family and voluntary organisations. Credit for these pleas is accordingly restricted to one-sixth, reflecting their timing at the near close of proceedings. The court has regard to the authorities of R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64; R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568; and the recent analysis in R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, which together frame the sentencing approach to terrorism offences, underscoring deterrence and public protection as dominant considerations. In accordance with established practice, the preparation of a pre-sentence report is absolutely essential. The probation service is requested to evaluate the feasibility of a sentence incorporating elements of long-term supervision, psychological intervention tailored to extremist cognition, and technologically enabled monitoring, including electronic tagging if appropriate. Consideration is also requested regarding the suitability, availability, and anticipated effectiveness of specialist rehabilitative programming, including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme and cognitive behavioural modules that target impulsivity and risk recognition. The court reserves final sentencing until receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further relevant material, including representations from both the defence and Crown. It is hoped that forthcoming procedural steps can be conducted without protracted delay. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. They have been transcribed and filed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript has been recorded under the auspices of the court registrar. The defendant is advised of his statutory right to appeal conviction and sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged in this proceeding. Costs are reserved.
