Mr H Case No. B2025/24569 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. A. GRAHAM Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentencing on charges laid under the Terrorism Act 2006. He faces two counts: first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and, second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The alleged conduct spans from July 2023 until his arrest in March 2025. The defendant was apprehended at dawn on 16 March 2025, following the execution of a search warrant at a terraced property in the Sparkbrook area of Birmingham, by officers from West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit (WMCTU). This warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 after months of surveillance and intelligence gathering that indicated the defendant’s digital communications involved encrypted materials with links to proscribed entities. Upon arrest, law enforcement seized several electronic devices, including a custom-built desktop computer, an encrypted external hard drive, and a collection of digital storage media. This prosecution proceeded after extensive inquiry led by WMCTU in coordination with the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU). The investigation utilised state-of-the-art forensic techniques such as decryption of obfuscated files, analysis of VPN metadata, and the use of machine learning algorithms to detect suspect communication patterns. In addition to this, contemporaneous signals intelligence contributed by GCHQ supported the evidence base—subject, naturally, to the strict regime of protective markings, redactions, and closed material procedures deployed to safeguard national security interests while maintaining the transparency demanded by the criminal justice process. The operational demands of this case cannot be overstated. The lead investigator testified regarding the volume of material to be sifted—estimated at over two terabytes of encrypted data—requiring the coordinated efforts of cyber forensic analysts, linguists, and field officers working over an 18-month period. These details underscore the increasingly complex, resource-intensive nature of counter-terrorism investigations in the digital age. Of note, before the prosecution phase, pre-charge investigative protocols imposed a careful review path involving external counsel and Security Service oversight, ensuring that evidence met the exacting standards required for a terrorism indictment. It is regrettable that the timing imposed logistical pressures, but it is salutary that thoroughness was given priority over haste. A series of procedural milestones have marked the trajectory of this case. Initial case management took place on 4 May 2025, setting a timetable aligned with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 3. The court acknowledges the efforts of both prosecution and defence to meet deadlines amidst the challenges posed by the volume and sensitivity of disclosure. However, the court must also acknowledge that an application made by the defence on 31 July for additional expert evaluation, specifically a second psychiatric opinion, contributed to a brief adjournment of the sentencing hearing from its originally scheduled date of 2 September to today, 18 September. It is further noted that the Legal Aid Agency’s approval for funding expert instructions has been protracted. Applications tracked back to June 2025 were met initially with unsatisfactory delays, resolved only following direct judicial intervention. Such administrative obstacles, while not unprecedented, impose strain upon the proper administration of justice and ought not to be discounted in the wider context of access to a fair defence. It is pertinent to remark on the established jurisprudence that informs sentencing in terrorism cases. The court draws attention to the foundational ruling in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which elucidates the broad ambit of “terrorist purpose” to encompass the promotion, preparation, and facilitation of acts designed to intimidate the public or influence government policy through violence or threat thereof. Sentencing principles are further expounded in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, where extended custodial sentences were deemed appropriate not only for actual violence but also for sophisticated preparatory conduct reflecting high-level intent. The Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines underscore these positions and establish a graduated scale of culpability with corresponding custodial calibrations. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The initial offence conduct is best understood in light of these precedents. The evidence indicates considerable planning activity, including procurement of dual-use materials and the assembly of components with potential application in improvised explosive devices. The complexity and duration of planning situate the offending towards the serious end of culpability, warranting commensurate sentencing considerations. The course of investigation was further complicated by the defendant’s patterns of digital obfuscation. Evidence led at trial demonstrated the use of offshore VPN services, anonymous cryptocurrency wallets, and self-deleting messaging applications. While such operational security measures are frequent in modern criminal enterprises, their presence in terrorism cases significantly impedes timely disruption and magnifies risk to the public. At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 8 August 2025, the defendant initially pleaded not guilty, notwithstanding the strength of the evidence. It was not until the commencement of this sentencing hearing that Mr H changed plea, entering guilty pleas on both counts. The court has noted counsel’s submissions regarding the defendant’s purported motivation for the late plea. Such motivations, while understandable, are reflective of an unfortunate but increasingly commonplace tactical pattern deserving of measured judicial scrutiny. I remind myself of the limitative approach to sentencing credit for guilty pleas articulated in the Court of Appeal in R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440. There, the court highlighted that a plea entered at the commencement of sentencing affords reduced credit—here, appropriately capped at one-sixth—acknowledging some mitigation, though discounted by the cost to public resources, potential distress to witnesses, and the lost opportunities for early rehabilitative intervention. Relevant case law also demonstrates the balancing act between punishment and rehabilitation. In R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, a defendant convicted of coercive control and threats involving domestic abuse was held to require a custodial sentence tailored to protect the victim and manage risk, notwithstanding his mental health challenges. That authority is cited for the principle that a custodial approach may be necessary even absent precise analogues but does not suggest inflexible sentencing formulas. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Mr H’s ideological trajectory has been subject to extensive expert analysis. Psycholinguistic studies introduced during the trial probed the defendant’s online communications over several years. These revealed a gradual amplification of extremist narratives and the adoption of coded language paralleling that documented in proscribed terrorist propaganda. The court considers this to affirm the sincerity of his commitment, a factor aggravating culpability. Interestingly, forensic engagement also uncovered a number of encrypted scholarly articles on political philosophy and social theory intermixed with extremist manifestos. Defence counsel contended these materials evidenced a broader intellectual curiosity and attempted to draw a distinction between academic engagement and criminal intent. The court acknowledges the complexity of ideological formation but remains satisfied that the defendant’s conduct, taken as a whole, transcends mere academic interest. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Recovered digital archives included a variety of technical manuals and videos purportedly illustrating the safe handling of explosive precursors. Such materials correspond with judicial determinations in R v. Bakar [2022], which confirmed that possession, even of incomplete or partial instructions, may suffice to establish intent where corroborated by preparatory acts. In the present context, the court finds that these files were acquired and retained for unlawful purposes. The court notes the defence submission that some content might have originated from a legitimate hobbyist interest in pyrotechnics, supported by evidence of visits to fireworks displays and possession of celebratory materials. While acknowledging this aspect, the totality of evidence weighs heavily in favour of deliberate misuse. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. The presence of such materials must be contrasted with other ancillary findings in the defendant’s accommodation, including an unpaid parking ticket issued in 2022 and a collection of home-brew alcohol bottles discovered during the search. These peripheral items were highlighted in submissions seeking to humanise Mr H and depict ordinary personal habits. The court reiterates that such minutiae, while humanising, necessarily play negligible part in the determination of culpability for terrorism-related offending. In addition, mention was made in court of a historical traffic offence recorded against Mr H several years prior, namely driving whilst disqualified following a prior drink-driving conviction. This is entirely irrelevant to the present charges but was included in a bundle of character references as part of a broader contextual narrative. The court discounts any weight to this offence in the current context. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. Of significance is the defendant’s international travel history. Records indicate a visit to Amsterdam in early 2024, during which meetings were held with individuals known to security services as sympathisers of proscribed organisations. Surveillance corroborated encrypted voice calls coordinated around this period. Defence sought to characterise the travel as benign and related to cultural interests; however, the court concludes the timing and associations constitute an aggravating factor reflecting cross-border facilitation. The discovery of an encrypted ledger detailing transactions in cryptocurrency adds another layer to the offending. The court is mindful of the precedent set in R v. Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754, involving covert importation of contraband using similar payment methods. Though the circumstances here differ materially, the propensity for digital currencies to obscure transactions remains a critical enforcement challenge. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial analysis has established a number of cryptocurrency transfers linked to accounts under the defendant’s control, one notably directing funds to a darknet marketplace purporting to offer chemicals compatible with explosive manufacture. This method circumvents traditional financial monitoring and is emblematic of evolving criminal tradecraft in the digital era. The court hopes legislators will consider this growing threat domain with urgency, ensuring that regulatory frameworks keep pace with technological innovation. The investigative phase also included covert surveillance of the defendant’s movements in the weeks prior to arrest. This entailed the coordination of multiple camera platforms, including municipal CCTV integrated with facial recognition software operating beneath the limits imposed by current data protection law. The court is not asked to adjudicate on the admissibility of such techniques today, but it comments on the balance between surveillance efficacy and privacy rights, which remains an ongoing societal discussion. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Personal circumstances play a limited, though not negligible role in sentencing. Mr H is 28 years old, with an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering from a respected regional university. His employment history is marked by instability following his resignation from a laboratory assistant role in late 2022, attributed by witnesses to conflicts over compliance with health and safety procedures. His supervisors described him as “bright but prone to isolation.” Letters submitted on his behalf include commendation from a local foodbank charity, noting periodic voluntary contributions, and a community sports group praising modest coaching roles undertaken by the defendant. While such positive engagement might, in other circumstances, be a significant mitigating factor, the present context demands circumspection. The court recognises civic contributions but cannot allow them to offset the severity of the offending. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. Psychological reports furnished by Dr Helena Morley, consultant forensic psychiatrist, conclude that Mr H manifests traits consistent with rigid ideation, a tendency towards moral absolutism, and a degree of social alienation. Though no formal mental disorder was diagnosed, the assessment identifies an elevated risk of continuing extremist engagement post-release absent rigorous intervention. Dr Morley’s report recommends a structured combination of pharmacological support, psychological therapies focused on cognitive restructuring, and specialist counter-extremism programmes — albeit noting the high dropout rates historically associated with such measures. It is accepted that the public protection objective remains paramount. The court endorses the continuation and expansion of multi-agency involvement, including MAPPA oversight and cooperation with specialist community-based monitoring teams under the National Counter Terrorism Policing network. These partnerships, while challenging in operational practice, represent the best available mechanism to mitigate residual risk and protect society. This complex case, while illustrative of contemporary counter-terrorism practice, also reflects broader systemic pressures. Probation services face chronic under-resourcing, mental health services contended with waiting lists exceeding twelve months in some localities, and voluntary sector organisations operate under persistent funding uncertainty. These structural stresses compound the challenges of effective rehabilitation and risk management. In formulating sentence, the court has had regard to the totality of the evidence, the applicable sentencing guidelines, relevant case law, and the submissions of counsel. Mitigating factors include the absence of previous substantive convictions, the defendant’s educational attainment, and the eventual admission of guilt. Aggravating considerations include the planned nature of the offences, the use of sophisticated encryption to conceal activities, the international dimension of the conduct, and the demonstrated ideological commitment to extremist objectives. It is also incumbent on the court to note the strain placed upon law enforcement and ancillary agencies. The prolonged investigation taxed scarce specialist resources, diverted attention from other pressing crimes including an uptick in serious street violence, and consumed technical assets. Such collateral impact, while not a sentencing factor per se, informs judicial appreciation of the gravity of these offences in the broader public safety landscape. The victim impact in terrorism cases is often diffuse, extending beyond immediate individuals to communities and society at large. Though there are no direct physical victims in this matter, the potential for indiscriminate harm inherent in the defendant’s conduct renders public apprehension and collective insecurity a form of secondary victimisation. The court acknowledges the testimony before it regarding community resilience and civic determination to resist extremism, a testament to societal fortitude. I direct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith. The report should assess the defendant’s suitability for custodial rehabilitation programmes, explore opportunities for cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to ideological disengagement, and advise on risk management options including licence conditions, exclusion zones, and technological monitoring post-release. Consultation with forensic mental health specialists will be essential in framing a holistic, evidence-based recommendation. Sentencing will be listed to follow upon completion of the report. Until then, Mr H remains remanded in custody. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court in Birmingham. Proceedings have been conducted in open court and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the appropriate registries.
