Mr H Case No. B2025/27461 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. MONTGOMERY Filed: 4 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following convictions on multiple counts under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period of offending is established as spanning from September 2023 through to the defendant’s arrest in January 2025. The defendant was apprehended following the culmination of a comprehensive and sustained investigation conducted by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), jointly coordinated with the Security Service and the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU). The arrest was executed in the early hours of 15 January 2025 at his residence located in the Selly Oak district of Birmingham, pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the 2000 Act. It is necessary at the outset to acknowledge the complexity inherent in terrorism-related prosecutions in this jurisdiction: in recent years these cases have imposed extraordinary pressures on judicial resources, and have demanded painstaking efforts from investigative agencies who must balance investigatory zeal with due process and stringent evidentiary obligations. The case before the court typifies such challenges, with voluminous digital evidence, complex forensic examinations, and engagement with multiple expert domains spanning technology, psychology, and ideological analysis. Historical context informs that the statutory regime for terrorism offences under the Terrorism Act 2006 was introduced as part of the Government's legislative response to evolving threats in the early 21st century. With amendments and refinements over time, these provisions continue to underpin legal responses to preparatory conduct which, while not culminating in an actual completed attack, represent a potential to cause significant harm and disruption. The court is reminded of the principles set forth in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, where the Supreme Court emphasised the contours of “terrorist purpose” encompass acts intended to influence governmental or international bodies by intimidation or coercion, whether or not the specific acts were ultimately carried out or successful. The defendant's case followed a customary but protracted pre-trial course. On 21 February 2025, a plea and trial preparation hearing was convened. Initial pleas of not guilty were entered. The trial listings encountered some rescheduling due to industrial action within the court registry involving the administrative staff federation, resulting in a minor delay of three weeks in securing a trial date. Nevertheless, the overall timetable complied substantially with the Better Case Management (BCM) principles enshrined in the Criminal Procedure Rules, an evolution aimed at streamlining case progression and reducing undue delays. Representatives for the Crown in this matter have been led by Ms Anne Forsyth, standing counsel within the CPS Counter Terrorism Division. Ms Forsyth’s submissions were assiduously prepared, detailing the evidential matrix and grounding prosecution case within the ambit of the relevant statutory thresholds. On behalf of the defendant, counsel Mr Steven Mallory, instructed under a Legal Aid Order, has provided a vigorous defence. The court commends both counsel for the professional and courteous manner in which the proceedings have been conducted, despite inevitable challenges occasioned by the volume and sensitivity of material. While acknowledging the allocation of resources and administrative processes at work, it is necessary to record the court’s continued frustration with systemic delays engendered by Legal Aid procedures pertinent to defence expert evidence. Requests for funding to retain an independent forensic psychologist were met with prolonged bureaucratic sequencing, leading to adjournments which, though conscientiously managed by all parties, inevitably taxed court scheduling and prolonged the defendant’s detention in custody. Such obstacles are regrettable and underscore a pressing need for reform in this area. A further procedural note: at the outset of proceedings, it was noted that a co-defendant had been separately charged in connection with a wide-reaching network engaged in the importation of illicit substances. This co-defendant’s charges encompass possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and associated firearms offences. These unrelated matters were kept strictly segregated from Mr H’s case by the presiding judge, mindful of the differing factual and legal frameworks applicable. Mr H’s antecedents have been subjected to mandatory disclosure, ongoing police checks, and the preparation of a pre-sentence report. He is 31 years of age and holds a degree in electrical engineering. There is no prior conviction recorded against him, a fact to be noted with care. Correspondence from local community groups has been submitted on his behalf, describing his volunteer involvement in a neighbourhood literacy programme. While these community ties suggest a measure of social integration, the court is cognisant that such factors do not mitigate criminal responsibility where deliberate and sustained terrorist preparation is established. The court had the benefit of expert psychological assessment provided by Dr Fiona Clarke, a consultant forensic psychiatrist specialising in ideological extremism. Her report, prepared after a series of interviews and collateral consultation, describes Mr H as exhibiting a rigid cognitive framework combined with an intense adoption of grievance narratives consistent with radicalisation models documented in contemporary literature. No diagnosable mental illness was identified, but high risk of serious harm is noted due to ideological conviction and technical knowledge. The defence challenges the extent of this risk, positing that a structured disengagement programme could substantially reduce it. The court notes the evidence on success rates of such interventions remains equivocal, but accepts the principle that rehabilitation efforts must be afforded consideration alongside the imperatives of public protection. The facts of the case are as follows: Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This case arose from Operation KEEPERN, a multi-agency investigation stretching over 16 months. The defendant fell under surveillance following patterns of encrypted communications intercepted by the National Technical Assistance Centre, revealing access to networks known to supply manuals for improvised explosive device construction. These materials were recovered during a controlled search of the defendant’s residence. The forensic examination, led by the West Midlands Digital Crime Unit, encountered difficulties owing to sophisticated encryption and deletion protocols. The analysis was further delayed by competing demands on scarce cybersecurity resources nationwide. Preceding the arrest, the defendant's online activity included subscription to forums advocating the use of pressure-cooker bombs, as well as dissemination of propaganda glorifying acts of violence abroad. Such behaviour has formed the backbone of the Crown’s circumstantial case that Mr H was both ideologically committed and pragmatically engaged in preparatory acts to facilitate terrorism. In R v. O’Donnell [2021] EWCA Crim 1104, the Court of Appeal reinforced that possession of instruction manuals, when combined with overt acts towards procurement, satisfies the threshold for preparatory conduct. The applicability of such precedent is clear here, particularly as Mr H’s possession extended beyond passive download to include attempts at practical testing. Notably, forensic evidence revealed the existence of a document named “Blueprint v4,” containing detailed schematics for a timer assembly adapted from consumer electronics. While the presence of such documents alone may be equivocal, their context here aligns with an overall pattern of purposeful preparation. Defence submissions contest the genuine intent at play, citing potential legitimate hobbyist experimentation. This argument finds limited acceptance given the totality of the evidence. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. The investigation also uncovered a budget spreadsheet linking the defendant to multiple transactions via cryptocurrency transfers. Specialist financial examination traced payments made through mixers obfuscating origin, suggesting attempts to conceal monetary flows consistent with procurement of dual-use items for bomb-making. The digital trail further indicated that Mr H communicated with a foreign national under investigation for arms trafficking in mainland Europe. Recorded encrypted calls between the two parties demonstrated technical discussions devoid of innocuous commentary, indicating operational planning. These communications were intercepted lawfully following a warrant granted on the basis of significant intelligence thresholds. Although Mr H maintains that these communications related to research for academic purposes, the observed modus operandi and the sequence of activities provide a compelling narrative of criminal intent. The court references the decision in R v. Ali [2022] EWCA Crim 98, where repeated contact with proscribed entities, combined with demonstrable access to materials, justified extended custodial sentences due to elevated risk. Such reasoning is demonstrably pertinent here. Mr H’s interaction with the local Prevent team spanned over eighteen months prior to arrest. The Caldicott Prevent Consortium notes in its correspondence that there were efforts to engage the defendant in counter-radicalisation workshops and mentoring. Participation was intermittent, and occasionally disruptive. The consortium’s reports describe a pattern of withdrawal contextualised by expressed grievance about government policies, but stop short of concluding any tangible deradicalisation had occurred. The challenges faced by Prevent teams are well documented and enduring. The court notes with regret the continued under-resourcing of such schemes despite persistent indications of rising ideological extremism across segments of the population. Local health services, already stretched thin by mental health demand spikes post-pandemic, have reported lengthy waiting lists for counselling services relevant to this cohort. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. At the time of his arrest, a quantity of materials obtained to replicate the circuit board design was found disassembled in Mr H’s workshop. This included components sourced via specialist suppliers in the UK and abroad. Notwithstanding defence contentions of lawful procurement for academic projects, the court finds the pattern and scale of acquisition inconsistent with legitimate hobbyist use. “Burn patterns” tests were observed in backyard trials documented in recovered videos. These experiments, while rudimentary, indicate a degree of applied knowledge and reflect a clear intent to understand the functional efficacy of explosive constructs. Such activities transcend passive interest and illustrate active preparation. This evidence was corroborated by witness testimony of a former flatmate, who described the defendant’s guarded behaviours and expressed concerns about strange visitors arriving at unsocial hours. The flatmate’s statements cannot be accepted uncritically, given disputes between the parties, but nonetheless contribute to corroboration when taken with other items. Interestingly, the court notes the defendant’s involvement in an unrelated case heard recently in the same circuit. The co-defendant in that trial was convicted for fly-tipping waste on protected green belt land leading to environmental damage. Mr H was not connected to that offending, though his former roommate was charged with possession of cannabis following a search unrelated to this case. The prevailing social context cannot be ignored. The erosions in neighbourhood cohesion, the deleterious effects of social media echo chambers, and the increasing normalisation of fringe ideologies all provide a backdrop against which radicalised individuals operate. Nevertheless, these are matters for societal response outside the penal framework. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Complicating the assessment is the presence of a gaming console seized during search, containing multiple encrypted chat logs. These communications reveal efforts to recruit others into ideological cells and to disseminate subversive content. While some exchanges appear perfunctory or jocular, others display ideological intensity and encourage operational secrecy. The court is aware of emerging case law, including R v. Khan [2023] EWCA Crim 334, in which the use of digital platforms to radicalise or recruit was held to aggravate culpability under the Terrorism Guidelines. The ubiquity of online platforms introduces new dimensions for threat and prevention. Mr H’s counsel argued that evidence of casual online interactions fails to satisfy the threshold for intent to cause harm, relying on the principles enunciated in R v. Bascombe [2020] EWCA Crim 765, where a differentiation was drawn between mere expression and preparatory conduct. The court finds that while expression alone may be protected, the combined acts here go beyond such protection. The court pauses to note that, during the course of investigation, forensic examination uncovered an unrelated fixed penalty notice issued to Mr H in 2019 for fare evasion on the Birmingham Metro system. Though inconsequential to the charge, it demonstrates the spectrum of minor infractions that defendants may accumulate. Similarly, a letter from the Housing Association landlord referenced noise complaints unrelated to any antisocial behaviour attributable to Mr H. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. The defendant travelled to Berlin in November 2024 on what he claimed was a photographic holiday. Travel records accessed by the National Border Security Agency indicate a brief transit via the city’s outskirts in an area known for underground extremist music scenes and clandestine meetings. Closed-circuit footage analyzed from transport hubs show Mr H engaged in communication with persons later discovered to possess extremist proclivities. Such travel patterns, while not inherently suspicious, were combined with digital behaviour that heightened investigative concern. The prosecution argues that this journey was an exploratory mission to meet contacts and acquire materials, a contention the defence contests on the grounds of legitimate tourism. The court is reminded of the principles in R v. Steiner [2021] EWCA Crim 887, where international travel with ostensible benign purpose was held to require scrutiny in light of other evidence of preparatory acts. Reasonable inference, not mere hypothesis, guides such determinations. Significant disclosure issues arose in this case given the volume of encrypted material. Over 1,200 exhibits required careful vetting, some containing material classified as sensitive in nature. The court expresses understanding for the staff of both prosecuting and defence teams who laboured to manage this substantial evidence bundle under considerable time pressure. A side note of interest concerns the attendant difficulties faced by the City Digital Forensics Unit, which recently underwent a significant organisational restructure designed to improve performance following criticisms of delays affecting high-profile cases. The resultant teething problems led to temporary reduction in investigative throughput, a factor acknowledged in the case management hearings. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations revealed complex cryptocurrency transfers amounting to £4,150, routed through multiple addresses and mixers. While unregulated cryptocurrencies facilitate privacy-backed transfers, their use raises acute concerns where linked to terrorism financing. The court notes that Mr H’s transactions corresponded temporally with attempts to purchase specialized chemicals and electronic components. Notwithstanding technological debates about the merits of decentralised finance, criminal exploitation of opaque payment systems is well documented. As such, the court views these monetary flows as an aggravating factor indicating operational seriousness rather than casual dabbling. The court also notes the presence of unrelated digital forensic material regarding a separate investigation into a distant relative of Mr H, currently subject to benefits fraud proceedings. This association does not impinge upon the defendant’s moral culpability but highlights the complex nature of law enforcement in interconnected social environments. The rise in cybercrime more broadly has imposed rising workloads upon police units tasked with digital intelligence gathering. Forensic analysts have reported average workloads above capacity, resulting in a backlog of unprocessed devices and software incompatibility challenges. Such systemic difficulties do not excuse delay but contextualise the operational environment. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal mitigation, Mr H is described in letters from family members as “intelligent and quietly committed” but also “reserved.” There is no suggestion of previous violent or extremist behaviour. His employment history reflects a period of work with a local IT consultancy prior to resignation amidst disputes over workplace policies concerning remote access protocols. These disputes contributed to his apparent social isolation. The court acknowledges the support letters received from a local charity engaged in mentoring young men in digital skills. Yet it is manifest that prior good character cannot juxtapose against deliberate criminal conduct of the nature proven here. The ethical dilemma posed by the coexistence of positive community involvement and concurrent illicit activity is recognised but does not mitigate the gravity of offences. The forensic psychiatric report by Dr Clarke highlights that Mr H exhibits “elevated cognitive rigidity” and a propensity for “binary moral judgments” consistent with contemplative radicalisation patterns. Treatment recommendations include enrolment on the recently established Deradicalisation and Disengagement Programme (DDP), which, while hopeful, is acknowledged by all stakeholders as possessing an uneven track record in terms of long-term disengagement. The court notes with interest that the local Mental Health Trust continues to experience staff deficits, with a 40% vacancy rate in psychological therapy provision. Concurrently, waiting times for community mental health assessments have reached 18 weeks, exacerbating challenges for timely intervention. These systemic strains impinge upon the capacity for preventative strategies and increase reliance on custodial measures. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. In conclusion, this case depicts a sustained pattern of preparation for acts of terrorism underpinned by technical proficiency and motivated by extremist ideology. Aggravating features include the level of sophistication in acquisition and experimentation, encrypted and clandestine communications, and the potential scale of harm envisaged. Mitigating features are limited, comprising the defendant’s absence of prior convictions, educational qualifications, and late pleas entered prior to the trial's commencement. The court directs the preparation of an exhaustive pre-sentence report, to be compiled by the National Probation Service. The report should consider the feasibility of imposing an Extended Determinate Sentence with appropriate licence conditions to manage ongoing risk. It should further assess prospects for engagement with the DDP or comparable intervention schemes, availability of approved premises accommodation, and suitability for electronic monitoring and polygraph supervision in the event of custodial release. Recommendations on mental health support and post-release community supervision should be included. The court reaffirms that public protection remains paramount. While rehabilitation is a cherished principle, it cannot and must not supersede the need to contain serious risk. The sentence ultimately imposed must send a clear message of deterrence, denounce criminal ideology with unimpeachable authority, and safeguard the wider society from harm. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, being 4 October 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be duly lodged with judicial and law enforcement registers. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of sentencing. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 section 49 are engaged. Costs remain reserved.
