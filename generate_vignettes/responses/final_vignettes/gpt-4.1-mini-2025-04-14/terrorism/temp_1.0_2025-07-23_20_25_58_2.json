Mr H Case No. L2025/30764 Sentencing Remarks — His Honour Judge E. J. MORGAN Filed: 18 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence, having been convicted of one count of preparing to engage in acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct in question endured from September 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in February 2025. The trial concluded on 10 October 2025, following a trial lasting three weeks, after which the jury returned a unanimous verdict on both counts. To situate the matter in proper procedural context, Mr H was arrested at 07:15 hours on 14 February 2025 following the execution of warrants at his residence in Croxteth, Liverpool. These warrants were authorised pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, based upon intelligence reaching the National Counter Terrorism Intelligence Service (“NCTIS”) suggesting the defendant had engaged in correspondence via encrypted portals with individuals linked to proscribed organisations. Seizures included multiple encrypted devices, a high-capacity external hard drive, assorted electronic schematics, and a deactivated firearm component. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation leading to arrest featured a collaborative effort spanning several units: Liverpool Counter Terrorism Unit, National Digital Forensics Centre, and the Specialist Operations of Merseyside Police. Of particular note was the involvement of the City Joint Operations Cybercrime Taskforce, whose technical expertise was imperative to decrypting layers of encryption that shielded key evidence. The complexity of the data extraction was compounded further by the use of self-deleting messaging applications such as Signal and Session, which necessitated cross-jurisdictional cooperation and extended authorisation periods from judicial commissioners. The history of the case includes two preliminary hearings in April and July 2025. These facilitated applications for disclosure, consideration of bad character evidence, and rulings on the admissibility of intercepted communications under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. Both parties acted diligently, although the defence’s repeated requests for clarity on the scope of sensitive material arguably prolonged the pre-trial phase. Additionally, the court notes, with some wry frustration, the well-documented national strike action affecting court clerks during May 2025, which occasioned a cascade of adjournments—to the detriment of all concerned. The court commends the ongoing efforts of the National Legal Aid Agency (NALA) to support defence preparation, despite persistent under-resourcing and logistical challenges. That said, an application for extended hours to instruct a digital forensic expert experienced multiple delays, attributable in part to administrative backlog and evolving procedural requirements relating to certification of confidentiality. Such procedural complexities paint a vivid picture of the strain on the justice system when confronted with technologically sophisticated prosecutions. In the interim, a Prevent referral was made by a local secondary school in December 2022, subsequent to Mr H’s replacement history teacher raising concerns about online postings that appeared to advocate violent jihadist ideology. The Local Authority Channel Panel convened on 8 January 2023 and, noting the defendant's equivocal engagement, closed the case after three months. It is relevant to record that this initial intervention had little impact, as subsequent behaviour exhibited escalation rather than disengagement. The defendant entered a not guilty plea at the initial hearing, and maintained that position throughout the pre-trial phases. On the morning of the first day of trial, Mr H entered guilty pleas to both counts, after the Crown closed its case following detailed expert testimony. The timing of the plea impacts credibly awarded mitigation for the admission of guilt. In this connection, the Court of Appeal’s recent remarks in R v Webb [2025] EWCA Crim 650 are instructive. The Court confirmed that credit for plea must reflect not only the fact of admission but the timing and circumstances. A plea entered at the earliest realistic opportunity is deserving of full credit owing to the savings in court time and sparing of witnesses. Conversely, last-minute pleas, entered only after the prosecution case has been clearly established, merit a correspondingly reduced award of credit. The Court should also have regard to the interests of victims and witnesses, who must endure the duration of contentious proceedings where pleas are delayed. The well-established principles in R v Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 provide further exposition. Mr Halvorsen was convicted of multiple counts of arson endangering life after a fire at a local housing complex. The defendant persisted with a not guilty plea for almost 18 months before changing plea on the morning of trial, a change that led to a credit reduction to one-tenth of the sentence. While the facts are dissimilar, the principle that late pleas undermine both the administration and perception of justice is clear. The Crown also invites the court to consider the guidance of R v Caldicott [2024] EWCA Crim 830, which reviewed sentencing in cases involving violent offences committed under the influence of controlled substances. It was there emphasised that cognitive impairment due to drugs does not diminish culpability save in narrow circumstances. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. The Crown’s case was established through the uncovering of a series of digital communications operated under the alias “IronPolaris.” The chat logs analysed by the Forensic Linguistics Unit disclosed a consistent and methodical adoption of a rhetoric steeped in militant Salafi-Jihadist ideology. These communications included detailed instructions on the composition of improvised explosive devices and extensive discussion of potential targets within the Liverpool metropolitan transport network. The defendant’s online presence extended beyond chat forums. Social media accounts surfaced bearing images consistent with military-style training, weaponry, and symbolic iconography affiliated with proscribed entities listed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences disclosed a combination of intent and technical capability, thus engaging the highest level of culpability per the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Act 2006 Guidelines. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Further to digital materials, forensic examination revealed encrypted files hidden within steganographic images, employing overlapping ciphers and virtual disk mounts to mask both intent and provenance. The defendants’ use of the Tor network was corroborated by intercepted payment trails via monero cryptocurrency to darknet vendors specialising in explosive precursors—a method consistent with known terrorist procurement channels, referenced in recent Home Office guidance on digital extremism mitigation. In a tangential observation, the court notes the curious correspondence from a third party not connected to these proceedings: a letter from a nearby residents’ association in Anfield commenting on the increasing incidence of graffiti on local public transport routes and abandoned rail property. While unrelated directly to the defendant, it illustrates a broader milieu in which antisocial behaviours proliferate and public trust in communal safety is tested. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. These observations aside, the court remains firmly focused on the defendant’s actions. The prosecution’s evidence was bolstered by logs revealing an attempted shipment of nitrogen-based compounds to a PO Box associated with Mr H, intercepted and intercepted by the regional counter-terrorism explosives unit. The timing of said shipment appeared to coincide with the religious festival of Ashura, suggesting symbolic intent. Defence counsel argued that possession of chemical components was innocent, linked to legitimate botanical applications featured in online gardening communities. This assertion was not persuasive given the totality of the evidence and the purposeful concealment methods. In reviewing precedent, the court notes the decision in R v Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412, addressing the limits of plausibility in possession cases involving precursors. The Court affirmed that while dual-use chemicals may have innocent applications, possession coupled with preparatory conduct and secretive behaviour justifies inference of dangerous intent and culpability extending to terrorism-related offences. As part of his mitigation, the defendant’s solicitor drew attention to early childhood adversity documented in a social work report prepared in 2019 following concerns about neglect and domestic instability. Although of some interest to the pre-sentence report, such background cannot diminish responsibility for acts deliberately contravening public safety. It is relevant to mention an unrelated conviction of a co-defendant, charged jointly with Mr H under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2006 but currently awaiting trial on charges of violent disorder following a pub incident involving metal bars at short notice. Their conduct, though concerning, forms no part of Mr H’s case or sentencing considerations. One must also remark upon the broader context of strains in public services. The Court has observed a marked increase in demand upon probation officers supervising terrorism-related offenders, coupled with record vacancies in the Mental Health Liaison Teams. This reality places pressure on inter-agency cooperation, intricate risk management planning, and the delivery of rehabilitative interventions designed to minimize reoffending. The court acknowledges the detailed psychiatric assessment submitted, prepared by Dr Sanjana Patel, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, following a suspended hospital order proposed in January 2025 but ultimately declined by this court. Dr Patel’s report, while comprehensive and methodical, described Mr H as displaying “mild to moderate symptoms of obsessive-compulsive traits,” concluding that no severe mental disorder warranted hospitalisation. She noted the defendant’s “unyielding ideological fixity” as a notable risk factor. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. In January 2024, Mr H travelled to Budapest under the guise of attending a conference on mechanical engineering and conflagration mitigation. His passport stamp dates and hostel receipts confirm this. Surveillance footage places him meeting with individuals later identified as disseminators of extremist propaganda in the region. Although his motives were asserted to be purely academic, the court cannot disregard the meetings’ coincidence with encrypted communications planning domestic operations. Defence submissions characterise the trip as innocuous tourism, but such explanations are inherently implausible in light of the broader evidential tapestry. The procedural narrative also includes the disclosure of extensive financial records demonstrating the movement of significant sums via cryptocurrency exchanges, partially linked to vendor accounts selling electronics and detonator components. These transactions are examined in the forensic accounting report by Ms Louisa Fleming, a specialist with over fifteen years’ experience. Her report underscores the increasing role of anonymised payment networks within terror finance chains and the concomitant challenge they present to law enforcement agencies. Recent case law, such as R v Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 411, establishes the propriety of extended custodial sentences for those involved in conspiratorial arrangements involving such finance routes, even absent a completed terror act. Similarly, the judgment in R v Griffiths & Pierce [2022] EWCA Crim 1312 clarifies that ideological homogeneity with proscribed groups is unnecessary where autonomous radicalisation is demonstrated. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The forensic audit revealed that a sum totalling 0.8 Bitcoin, equivalent to approximately £4,200 at the time, transferred from wallets associated with Mr H’s digital identity connected to a darknet supplier specialising in hobbyist chemical supplies. The court is mindful of current debates regarding the double-edged nature of financial decentralisation platforms: whilst offering innovation and privacy, they too readily facilitate illicit activities and severely hinder enforcement. The court endorses the continuing efforts of Parliament and regulatory agencies to strike an appropriate balance, but in the meantime holds that offenders exploiting such technologies must face the full weight of criminal sanction. Further, covert surveillance recordings from 9 November 2024 placed Mr H at the docks alongside identified individuals now charged with environmental offences related to fly-tipping hazardous waste in Greenfield Park, an incident entirely disconnected from the present proceedings. The court merely notes this juxtaposition as an example of the complex, intertwined patterns of urban disorder. Drilling down to the personal profile, Mr H is aged 28. Defence mitigation highlighted a first-class honours degree in electrical engineering obtained at the University of Liverpool, accompanied by part-time voluntary work tutoring disadvantaged youths in mathematics. While laudable on their face, these contributions do not outweigh the gravity of his offence conduct. Character references submitted from the Mersey Green Urban Renewal Project praise Mr H's involvement in community reforestation efforts, albeit intermittently following the onset of investigation. Letters from the Liverpool Founders Network also detail his participation in a startup incubator promoting sustainable technology solutions. Mitigation based on vocational promise, however, is only one element in the sentencing calculus and cannot eclipse considerations of public safety. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Consultant forensic psychologist Dr Graham Evans provided a psychological profile based on clinical interviews and structured professional judgment assessments. He described Mr H’s ideological entrenchment as “marked and resistant to challenge,” reflecting considerable “cognitive rigidity and refusal to engage in alternative narratives.” No formal diagnosis of personality disorder was made, yet risk of serious further harm remained elevated absent stringent management. Dr Evans suggested potential benefit could arise from intensive engagement with specialist deradicalisation programmes, such as those convened under the Community Integrated Rehabilitation Scheme (CIRS), but cautioned against reliance on voluntary participation given known attrition rates. It is also pertinent to consider the geopolitical backdrop, wherein fluctuating threat levels reflect a global turbulence. Recent communications by the Home Secretary underscore the need for a toolkit of deterrent sentencing, prevention, and rehabilitation, carefully balanced against community cohesion. Any perception of leniency risks undermining both deterrence and public confidence, which are indispensable pillars of counter-terrorism jurisprudence. Correspondence filed from the Northern Communities Interfaith Council provided thoughtful insights stressing the imperative of careful communal messaging to avoid stigmatisation of minority populations. The court shares these concerns, recognising the fine line between effective law enforcement and entrenchment of division. As the criminal justice system grapples with resource constraints, the persistent delays in forensic reporting and the insufficient availability of approved accommodation for individuals subject to terrorism-related license conditions remain a strain. Notwithstanding these systemic issues, the court affirms the necessity of detailed supervision and multi-agency arrangements post-release. The defendant’s case has also been managed under Category 3 MAPPA supervision, with periodic multi-agency public protection meetings held to coordinate custodial and post-custodial risk management strategies. These meetings have included representatives of the Probation Service, CT Policing, the NHS Forensic Mental Health Team, and regional housing authorities. Such collective oversight is essential but resource-intensive. Procedural observations include the delay occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted approval of expert witness funding, a regrettable but familiar bottleneck. The court hopes future reforms will reduce such impediments that jeopardise the defendant’s right to a fair process and timely resolution. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! In conclusion, the defendant’s behaviour was marked by a level of planning, technological competence, and ideological fervour consistent with serious terrorism offending. Aggravating factors include the sophistication of encrypted communications, digital financial transactions supporting illicit procurement, and a demonstrable intention to cause mass harm. Mitigation lies chiefly in the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, his educational achievements, and belated, but genuine, acceptance of guilt. I direct that a full pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith, with particular attention to the defendant’s potential for rehabilitation and risk of reoffending. The report should consider the feasibility of an extended determinate sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, as well as the utility of intensive psychological intervention, electronic monitoring, and suitable approved premises placement upon release. It is essential that the probation service evaluates the prospects of compliance with licence conditions incorporating communication restrictions, GPS tracking, and mandatory participation in disengagement programmes accredited by the Home Office. The court expresses no conclusion on sentence at this juncture, reserving judgement pending the report and any further submissions. The seriousness of the offence and the public interest in deterrence remain paramount, balanced against the defendant’s rehabilitative prospects. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 October 2025, in Court 11 at the Crown Court at Liverpool. A formal transcript has been prepared and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal conviction and sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved pending outcome of sentencing.
