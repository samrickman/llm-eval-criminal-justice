Mr H Case No. B2025/34592 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. D. MORRIS Filed: 19 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The relevant conduct arose between September 2023 and the date of his arrest on 14 January 2025. The defendant's case progressed through various procedural stages, beginning with the initial police interview on 15 January 2025 following a planned arrest warrant executed under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The investigation was coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) and supported by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), with evidence obtained from seized digital devices, telecommunications interception, and covert observation. From the outset, the proceedings were subject to intense operational security measures, and the court received submissions under the Justice and Security Act 2013 concerning the confidentiality of certain materials. The case was first listed for a preliminary hearing on 5 February 2025 and thereafter assigned to this Crown Court on 20 March. The court notes the prolonged delays occasioned by the defendant’s application to challenge the validity of certain intercepted evidence, which was ultimately resolved on 10 June 2025 following a reserved ruling by the court. Such applications, while protective of fundamental rights, inevitably place additional burdens on timely justice. It is a regrettable but not uncommon feature of complex terrorism cases that prove both legally and factually intricate. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Initial bail applications were refused on public protection grounds. The defendant remained remanded throughout. The liaison between the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and defence was marked by the typical difficulties attendant on significant disclosure volumes, although the court is satisfied that efforts were made on both sides to manage these within the constraints of resource pressures and statutory time limits. The Defence team, led by Mr Oliver Creed KC, made detailed challenges to the sufficiency of evidence but counsel’s eventual acceptance of guilt by way of a plea at the outset of the sentencing hearing reflects a concession that such challenges could not be sustained. It is worth remarking here, in passing, on the operational challenges facing forensic digital agencies attached to the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional counter-terrorism units. The volume of encrypted data and the sophistication of anonymising technologies have placed additional strain on technical analysts. Techniques such as the use of multi-layered virtual private networks (VPNs), onion routing protocols, and ephemeral messaging apps—sometimes developed in the open-source domain—present novel obstacles to evidence recovery. There is an ongoing debate about the balance between privacy rights and national security that extends well beyond the reach of this particular tribunal. The identification of the defendant as a significant subject of investigation arose from a Channel referral made in November 2022 by a university lecturer who observed increasingly extreme political rhetoric in his assessed coursework and participation in seminars. The Channel Panel convened under the Education Act 2011 initially offered a package of interventions, including mentoring and cognitive behavioural therapy targeting extremist mindset, led by the Bristol Prevent Team. These engagements, according to records submitted to the court, were sporadic and ultimately discontinued in late 2023 due to the defendant’s withdrawal and sporadic attendance. This discontinuation was noted by social services but did not trigger further safeguarding measures at that stage. The court is mindful of the limits inherent to voluntary preventive frameworks in cases where engagement falters. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The defendant's use of online platforms evolved over time. Analysis uncovered a progressively radicalising trajectory on social media accounts and encrypted messaging services. Notably, a significant cache of digital material was recovered from several devices seized under warrant, including encrypted data volumes stored within concealed VeraCrypt containers. One particularly voluminous archive was named “ArcaneLibrary,” containing ideological manifestos, bomb-making schematics, and training manuals. These materials, expertly analysed by forensic linguists and intelligence officers, revealed a pattern of procurement of dual-use equipment and deliberate obfuscation techniques. In R v. Ibrahim [2017] EWCA Crim 2261, the Court of Appeal held that the mere possession of terrorist manuals and related material, when accompanied by clear preparatory conduct, is sufficient to ground a conviction under section 5 of the 2006 Act even if an attack plan is not fully formed. That principle applies squarely in the present case. Previous authorities, such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, affirm the judiciary's wide discretion to assess the totality of circumstances and intentions behind preparatory acts. A recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Evidence disclosed also demonstrated the defendant’s acquisition of chemical precursors capable of use in the manufacture of explosive devices. Surveillance photographs presented to the court showed Mr H at a hardware outlet in Central Bristol purchasing materials described in the prosecution as commonly employed in home-made explosive concoctions. The defence submitted that the defendant’s visits were, in part, consistent with his background in amateur pyrotechnics as documented in hobbyist clubs years prior. However, this explanation was disbelieved given the totality of evidence and the context of downloads and electronic correspondence uncovered. The investigation further revealed extensive use of cryptocurrency to facilitate anonymous transactions on darknet markets. Mr H transacted in Bitcoin and Monero, with multiple wallet addresses linked via blockchain forensic analysis to the purchase of chemical supplies and encrypted communications tools. The complexity of these payment routes, involving tumblers and chain-hopping, necessitated valuable and painstaking input from blockchain intelligence teams, diverting resources from other pressing investigations. It should be noted that the forensic accountancy unit involved in tracing these payments operates under intense resourcing pressure, highlighting the significant investment required to interdict modern methods of terrorist facilitation. The interplay of technology and finance in terrorism finance enforcement continues to be a rapidly evolving field. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Occasionally, reference has been made during submissions to certain unrelated instances of counter-terror law enforcement. Among them, for illustration only, is the well-known R v. Malik case from 2021, where a co-defendant was convicted for the importation of Class A drugs concealed within commercial freight. There is, however, no evidential or factual link between Mr H and those offences or that defendant, save that they arise from operations conducted by different regional policing units. It is merely a contextual observation indicating the breadth of law enforcement activity addressing organised crime alongside terrorism. Similarly, in passing, mention may be made of a separate instance of fly-tipping on protected greenbelt land in the outskirts of Bristol in 2024, prosecuted by the local council, which has no direct relevance to these proceedings beyond evidencing community environmental concerns. This court also notes the absence of association between Mr H and a series of recent pub-related affrays in the city centre during 2023, none of which are connected to the present prosecution save insofar as they exemplify local challenges in public order policing facing the city’s law enforcement agencies. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. The defendant’s personal circumstances are pertinent to sentencing. Mr H, now aged 30, was from a middle-income household and attended a local university where he achieved a degree in chemical engineering. Defence submissions drew attention to a history of social isolation, periods of clinical depression, and episodes of anxiety, for which he received intermittent counselling from the university health service and later from primary care mental health teams. Reports by Dr Heidi Clarke, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, noted no current psychosis or formal diagnosis of a personality disorder but remarked upon a significant ideological fixity and cognitive rigidity consistent with extremist world views. The psychological risk assessment and probation reports jointly concur on a high continuing risk of serious harm without comprehensive risk management strategies, underscoring the necessity of extended custodial supervision coupled with structured rehabilitation. The potential for participation in structured disengagement programmes was noted, including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), albeit with caution given historically low engagement rates among similar cohorts. Letters of support presented on behalf of the defendant came from neighbours and recreational football club peers, who offered lukewarm but sincere observations of his reclusive but lawful behaviour prior to arrest. There was also correspondence from the local chapter of a wildlife conservation charity describing his voluntary participation in habitat restoration days in 2022, unrelated to any extremist activity but indicative of limited pro-social interests. The court is, however, acutely aware that such mitigating remarks must be weighed against the breach of trust implicit in terrorism offences and their potential for severe societal harm. Indeed, as observed in R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928, commendable daytime conduct cannot excuse clandestine plotting. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The evidence also disclosed that in late 2024, the defendant travelled abroad on two occasions. One was a short visit to Amsterdam purportedly for leisure, the other a trip to Budapest, recorded in official records as a heritage tour but complicated by travel into neighbour countries where extremist contacts have been reported. Though the defence argue these trips were solely for cultural enrichment, intelligence reports place meetings with persons associated with transient extremist networks abroad, which, while not rising to an indictable conduct in this jurisdiction, add contextual weight to the prosecution case. Additionally, the prosecution presented digital evidence of communications between Mr H and individuals previously convicted of offences under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000, notably for disseminating incendiary material and participating in proscribed organisations. The networking was extensive and utilised cutting-edge encrypted platforms, underlining the premeditated and connected nature of Mr H’s activities. During these proceedings, the court notes the strain imposed upon the National Probation Service by significantly rising caseloads involving terrorism-related offenders. The operational demands upon Probation Officers, especially under MAPPA Category 3 supervision, have increased proportionately, further complicated by pandemic-related backlog effects and workforce shortages. The necessity for enhanced inter-agency cooperation is paramount. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to matters of law, this court recalls the guidance found in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Act Guidelines of 2023, which articulate the framework for assessing culpability and harm. These guidelines specify that the highest culpability arises where an offender exhibits active planning, the acquisition of weapons or materials, and intention aligned with indiscriminate mass harm. The defendant’s conduct falls into this category. The court further references R v. Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 401 which affirms that lengthy extended determinate sentences are appropriate in cases where the offender’s intent, capacity, and preparation evidence readiness to undertake harmful acts notwithstanding interruption by law enforcement. Deterrence and public protection remain the paramount sentencing objectives here. The prosecution has invited a custodial sentence with provision for an extended licence period post-release, supported by the engagement of mental health and de-radicalisation programmes. Defence counsel has argued for a custodial term at the lower end of the scale, emphasising the defendant’s lack of offending history outside of the present conduct and the potential for rehabilitation. Amidst these contentions, it is instructive to recall the Court of Appeal’s observations in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, which cautioned that while psychiatric illness may mitigate culpability, it does not preclude the need for incapacitation where risk to the public remains significant. This remains the position in the present matter given the assessment of risk and the defendant’s unstable acceptance of prior intervention offers. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. This court wishes to acknowledge expressly the professionalism displayed by the Prevent team in the South West region, who encountered difficulties in sustaining engagement but continued their efforts throughout 2023. It also recognises the valuable input of the forensic psychologists who produced reports of considerable detail and lucidity, assisting the court in understanding the defendant’s psychological profile. Furthermore, while the Legal Aid Agency authorised representation by experienced counsel, it would be remiss not to comment on the bureaucratic obstacles and delay experienced in securing funding for expert witnesses. Such administrative inertia increases the inefficiency of proceedings and compromises the timely delivery of justice, an issue well documented in contemporary critiques of criminal justice funding arrangements. This is a complex, serious case. The accumulation of evidence, technological sophistication, and the defendant’s degree of commitment warrant a custodial sentence commensurate with high culpability. The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, incorporating not only risk assessments but also considerations relating to psychological interventions, potential accommodation arrangements post-release, and the involvement of community monitoring schemes under MAPPA Category 3 protocols. In particular, the feasibility of GPS monitoring, internet usage restrictions, and polygraph conditions should be explored given the nature of the offending. Sentencing will take place on a date to be fixed following receipt of these reports. Both counsel and the defendant will be invited to make further representations at that time. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 19 September 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. The record has been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.
