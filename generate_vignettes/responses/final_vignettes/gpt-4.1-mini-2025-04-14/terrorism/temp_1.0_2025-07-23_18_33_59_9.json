Mr H Case No. B2025/19543 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. P. Marwood Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for terrorist purposes under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct in question primarily occurred between July 2023 and the time of Mr H’s arrest on 15 January 2025. The defendant was taken into custody at approximately 0700 hours following the execution of a search warrant at Flat 6, Woodland Place, a location under covert surveillance by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). This warrant was issued pursuant to section 43B(1)(c) of the Terrorism Act 2000, predicated on intelligence suggesting Mr H maintained encrypted communications with individuals linked to proscribed entities. Notably, at the time of arrest, several electronic devices were seized including a desktop computer, encrypted portable hard drives, and a 3D printer. The latter was of some operational interest given its potential application in the manufacture of weapon components. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The present proceedings have traversed a protracted procedural path characteristic of cases of this complexity, involving extensive forensic examination and consultation across multiple agencies including the National Crime Agency’s Digital Forensics Unit and the Security Service. In this context, the court acknowledges the considerable burden placed upon the digital investigative teams, whose specialist work involved de-obfuscating encrypted evidence stored in sophisticated containers utilising bespoke cryptography. Such efforts demanded significant resource allocation and extended timelines beyond the initial anticipations borne out of the Criminal Procedure Rules. This case has also regrettably been marked by procedural delays attributable to expert availability and legal-aid funding constraints. Defence counsel’s early application for an independent cyber forensic expert was subject to a delay exceeding six weeks before authorisation. This court remains acutely aware of the mounting strain on the Legal Aid system, as highlighted in recent reports from the Ministry of Justice, which consistently indicate under-resourcing adversely impacts timely representation and consequently, the principles of fair trial. Turning briefly to the wider background, it is pertinent to observe the historical evolution of the relevant statutory framework under which the defendant is charged. Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006, enacted following the recommendations in the 2005 Act Review, targets preparatory conduct that falls short of an immediate attempt but nonetheless poses substantive public safety risk. The courts have consistently interpreted these provisions with sufficient gravity to permit extended custodial sentences where conduct evidences a high degree of sophistication and intent, as was underscored in the Court of Appeal decision in R v. Boulter [2012] EWCA Crim 3030. It is well-established that the statutory maximum sentence for offences under section 5 of the 2006 Act is life imprisonment. However, sentencing must be informed by a calibrated assessment of culpability, harm (actual or potential), and aggravating or mitigating features as articulated in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines 2023. This Court is guided by the interpretative frameworks set out in authoritative cases such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 411, which emphasise the paramount importance of deterrence and protection of the public. We must also recollect the operative role of multi-agency working in cases of this nature. The court notes that the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangement (MAPPA) Category 3 panel was convened at an early juncture, with representatives from the Probation Service, CTPSW, NHS forensic psychiatric services, and local authority social care. The recommendations arising from those meetings encompassed robust risk management protocols, including proposed electronic monitoring, restricted communications, and custodial conditions designed to mitigate persistent ideological risk. Investigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic. The defendant’s online presence is relevant in establishing the context for his conviction. Linguistic and semiotic analyses presented during the trial demonstrated that Mr H operated a blog under the moniker “IronWrought,” whose postings evolved over time from innocuous technical musings about engineering principles to sharply radicalised rhetoric advocating violent overthrow of established political systems. The blog included, inter alia, references to foreign conflicts, ideological manifestos, and symbolic dates associated with extremist violent acts. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic analysis also uncovered an extensive cache of digital materials stored within encrypted volumes on seized devices. These comprised technical manuals, videos demonstrating the effects of improvised explosive devices on ballistics gel, and detailed instructions on synthesising precursor chemicals. Defence counsel submitted that some of these materials were incomplete or corrupted, suggesting that Mr H had not fully accessed or digested all content. The Crown contended that the possession, in itself, irrespective of the extent of consumption, was sufficient evidence of intent. The Court finds the Crown’s submission well-founded in the light of prevailing judicial precedents including R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 1260, confirming that incomplete possession of instructional terrorist material is nonetheless culpable. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Interestingly, during the investigation, a small quantity of cannabis and an unexpired public transport season ticket were recovered during a search of the defendant’s property. Neither were relevant to the terrorism offences charged. The cannabis was not the subject of any charge, and the season ticket was raised briefly in submissions to illustrate purported normality in the defendant’s daily routine. While these artefacts were noted, the court emphasises that their presence does not mitigate or otherwise contextualise the seriousness of the offences for which Mr H stands convicted. Reference is made to the case of R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, a ruling which addressed how mental health may interplay with sentencing in serious offences. In that instance, the defendant was found to suffer from schizoaffective disorder and had committed multiple arsons. The Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence, affirming that serious psychiatric illness does not provide an automatic shield from imprisonment where public protection demands it. Although there is no direct application of Mallory to the present case, it provides a frame of reference in assessing defendants with mental health conditions. In addition, this court recalls R v. Haslett [2021] EWCA Crim 902, a case involving the importation of Class A drugs concealed in modified vehicles. Although the criminal subject matter diverges from terrorism offences, the judgment in Haslett is instructive on the principles surrounding late pleas and sentencing credit. Mr Haslett did not enter a guilty plea until the first day of the trial after exhaustive forensic analyses and a contested Newton hearing. The Court of Appeal upheld a minimal reduction in sentence, emphasising the importance of timely admission of guilt in preserving judicial economy and demonstrating genuine remorse. The defendant here pleaded guilty only shortly before the sentencing hearing after maintaining a not guilty plea during the bulk of the trial preparation. The court is constrained to note this delay is consistent with a growing trend among some accused to postpone plea entry until trial imminence. While lawful and permissible, such conduct reduces the available mitigation. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. In the weeks preceding his arrest, Mr H undertook travel to various European destinations, ostensibly for academic and leisure purposes. Of particular interest to investigators was a visit to Warsaw in October 2024, from which CCTV footage captured his attendance at a conference on geopolitical stratagems. Subsequent inquiries uncovered that he also travelled to Berlin briefly, where he was seen in company with individuals later arrested for involvement in an unrelated case of fraud involving illicit cryptocurrency schemes. Defence counsel argued these associations were coincidental; however, the overlapping timings with encrypted communications to known proscribed groups reinforce a pattern of behaviour consistent with the offences charged. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Notably, a cryptocurrency transaction traced through blockchain analytics revealed a transfer of 1.2 Bitcoin, equating to approximately £45,000 at the time, from a wallet linked to an anonymised account operated by Mr H to another wallet identified with an online marketplace known for illicit arms trading. This finding aligns with concerns raised in national security reports emphasising the expansion of the crypto economy into venues exploitable for funding terror-related procurement. The court recognises, however, that blockchain tracking remains a developing field, with both technological and jurisdictional limitations impacting enforcement efficacy. As the court reflects on the broader operational environment, it must be recorded that during the pre-trial phase, defence submitted voluminous psychological evaluations commissioned from Dr Shahid Iqbal, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at Avon Secure Unit. Dr Iqbal’s reports were detailed and professionally composed, assessing Mr H as intellectually bright but exhibiting marked cognitive rigidity and black-and-white thinking, traits which may predispose to ideological extremism. Importantly, there is no formal psychiatric diagnosis recorded, and the risk assessment identifies a high potential for persistent ideological motivation post-release if unaddressed. The court appreciates the calibre of the forensic and psychological evidence tabled and thanks Dr Iqbal for his timely engagement despite significant capacity challenges within the NHS forensic services, including entrenched waiting lists and chronic recruitment shortages documented in recent Health Service Executive reports. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is aged 31 with a first-class honours degree in chemical engineering from the University of Bristol. Prior to arrest, he was employed as a research assistant at a reputable industrial laboratory. His employer character reference describes him as “meticulous, conscientious and socially reserved.” He resigned from his post suddenly in July 2023 amid unexplained absences and refusal to comply with enhanced security screening, steps which preceded his ensuing radicalisation trajectory. His family have contributed written testimony, including a letter from his elder sister outlining his mild but longstanding social withdrawal and apparent disenchantment with family life. Notably, the sister avers that she was unaware of Mr H’s ideological leanings until the investigation commenced. This court acknowledges the emotional impact such proceedings have on relatives, who often navigate a complex mix of loyalty and repudiation. Voluntary sector organisations, including the Bristol Community Resilience Trust, submitted observations emphasising the challenges inherent in engaging individuals at risk of extremist radicalisation. Their correspondence underscores limited funding and personnel shortages constraining wrap-around support services, a lament echoed in sector-wide parliamentary inquiries. Despite these limitations, such groups continue to advocate for multi-faceted approaches blending mentoring, education and mental health input. The Court also notes with appreciation the diligent, measured engagement of the Prevent Coordinators in the region who sought to intervene at earlier stages, albeit without success. Their detailed submissions to the court highlighted the limits of early intervention where individuals resist contact or disengage prematurely. The court is mindful that the operational landscape is not only affected by terrorism-specific caseloads; rather, it exists alongside rising demands in areas including violent crime saturation, increasing reports of hate incidents, and the legacy trauma of recent civil disturbances. Police forces face the unenviable task of allocating finite resources across these competing priorities, a fact which further attests to the gravity of persistent extremist risk cases such as the present. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. Prof. Eleanor Rigby, forensic psychologist instructed by the defence, provided a comprehensive personality evaluation describing Mr H as intellectually capable but exhibiting pronounced “ideological inflexibility and moral absolutism,” with high risk of recidivism absent intensive intervention. She supports the proposition that structured de-radicalisation programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) may effect meaningful change, though cautions about the significant attrition rates and the necessity for post-release supervision to enforce compliance. In mitigation, counsel requests the court take into account the absence of previous convictions, the defendant’s academic achievements, and the prospective engagement with rehabilitation efforts proposed for custodial and post-custodial phases. However, these considerations must be weighed against the overwhelming evidence of entrenched intent, sophisticated preparatory activities, and ideological commitment. The court is aware of the delicate balance that must be struck between fostering reintegration and upholding public protection. The Sentencing Council guidelines caution against undue optimism where evaluations indicate persistent risk factors, especially in terrorism contexts. The focus must remain on deterrence, incapacitation, and denouncement calibrated to the harm potential. Having heard detailed submissions from counsel for the Crown and for the defence, the court is persuaded that a custodial sentence of significant length is warranted, reflecting the severity of the offences, the demonstrable sophistication of the conduct, and the continuing risk of serious harm. This case has borne out the complexities and intricacies inherent in terrorism prosecutions. It underscores the indispensable role of multi-agency cooperation, the consequential impact of administrative and funding delays, and the enduring challenge of translating measured intervention frameworks into effective community-based prevention. The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing not only risk and rehabilitation considerations but also the defendant’s personal circumstances and potential accommodation on release. The Probation Service is requested to explore options including extended determinate sentencing, integration of high-intensity supervision conditions, and a review of available de-radicalisation programming with capacity for continuous evaluation. The report should furthermore consider any viable provisions for electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and polygraph testing where suitable. Collaboration with forensic psychology services and the relevant MAPPA agencies will be essential to devise a monitoring and intervention regime capable of mitigating ongoing risk.
