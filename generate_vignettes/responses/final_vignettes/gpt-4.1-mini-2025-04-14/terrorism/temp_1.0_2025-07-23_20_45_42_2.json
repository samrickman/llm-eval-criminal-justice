Mr H Case No. B2025/22043 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. R. MALCOLM Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges brought under the Terrorism Act 2006. Specifically, he stands convicted of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of articles for purposes connected with the commission of terrorism, under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period under consideration spans from the late summer of 2022 through to his arrest in early 2025. This court convenes after the conclusion of a protracted trial process marked by numerous interlocutory hearings, evidential disputes, and extensive disclosure exercises. The charges stem from an investigation led by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, in close liaison with the National Counter Terrorism Policing Headquarters and forensic specialists drawn from the National Crime Agency’s Cybercrime Unit. The prosecution case was supported by voluminous digital and forensic evidence, culminating in a unanimous jury verdict reached on 23 August 2025. The defendant’s pleas of not guilty, maintained throughout substantive stages, were rejected after the jury’s considered deliberation. This court is acutely mindful of the responsibilities entrusted to it by both statute and common law when adjudicating matters bearing on ideological violence. The Court acknowledges the presence in court of Ms. Elizabeth Renwick, leading counsel on behalf of the Crown, whose submissions were lucid and thoroughly grounded in prevailing counter-terrorism jurisprudence. Equally, the court notes the painstaking advocacy of Mr. James Cartwright, QC, representing the defendant, whose skill ensured robust and comprehensive challenge to the evidential material. The court also extends recognition to the court staff who ensured smooth administration notwithstanding recent industrial action affecting several court centres in England and Wales. It is necessary at this juncture to remark upon the procedural history of this matter. Initial arrest occurred on 11 February 2025, when officers executed warrants at a property in the Handsworth district of Birmingham pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrants themselves followed months of intelligence-led inquiry, involving careful collation of data intercepted pursuant to stringent statutory protocol. It is notable that such interception authorisations are subject to judicial scrutiny under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, with oversight provided by independent commissioners. The defendant was taken into custody, and bail was initially refused given the risk factors identified by the investigating agencies. The case experienced multiple listing adjustments, partly due to the necessity to accommodate expert witness availability and the need to ensure adequate preparation time for both prosecution and defence, especially given the complexity of the digital material at issue. This court is compelled to observe the difficulties experienced in securing timely disclosure, largely attributable to the volume of encrypted and deleted data requiring painstaking forensic examination. The Defence instructed an independent digital forensic expert, though, regrettably, this instruction was only approved following repeated applications to the Legal Aid Agency. Such administrative delays, commonplace though regrettable, reflect enduring systemic pressures on the legal aid system and its impact on effective representation. It is of relevance to record that an initial Prevent referral was made in late 2020 by an educational psychologist employed at the defendant's further education college. This referral was considered by the local Channel panel but ultimately discontinued after three months due to insufficient evidential basis for further intervention. The court acknowledges the difficulties faced by Prevent practitioners, straddling the competing demands of early identification, individual rights, and community trust. The court is mindful of the extensive support mechanisms which were, intermittently, made available to Mr H throughout the investigation and subsequent court proceedings. These include engagement offers from the West Midlands Counter-Extremism Unit, which extended a programme of mentoring based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy tailored to grievance-based extremism. Correspondence received from the Birmingham Resettlement Forums underlines the challenges in sustaining defendant engagement, especially in the absence of statutory compulsion. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The broader backdrop against which Mr H’s offending took place is marked by well-documented shifts in the modus operandi of lone-actor extremists, including increasing reliance on digital communication and remote self-radicalisation. This court notes with interest the observations in R v. Johnson [2022] EWCA Crim 857, emphasising the enhanced necessity for courts to consider not only the immediate actions but the networked and virtual behaviours that may constitute preparatory steps to terroristic activity. The complexity of such behaviours requires painstaking evidential evaluation and careful application of sentencing principles to balance deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The defence led evidence from Professor Simon E. Withers, a clinical forensic psychiatrist, who offered a comprehensive assessment of the defendant’s mental state, focusing not on traditional diagnostic categories but on cognitive and ideological processes. Professor Withers noted that while Mr H demonstrates signs of rigidity in thought, including a tendency to adopt binary worldviews characteristic of radicalised individuals, he is not subject to a formal psychiatric disorder. This nuanced view contributes to the ongoing debate within forensic psychiatry concerning the intersection of ideology and mental health. A document recovered from Mr H’s laptop detailed a secondary attack by drone aimed at medics and police. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. It is worth noting that the forensic psychiatric report adopts a risk assessment predicated on the Structured Professional Judgment framework, documenting a moderate to high risk of re-engagement with extremist conduct absent significant and sustained intervention. This is consonant with findings in R v. Ali [2021] EWCA Crim 1109, wherein public safety considerations took precedence over purely rehabilitative aspirations when assessing the appropriate custodial parameters. In the course of the trial and in subsequent submissions, the court received a compendium of correspondence and reports from various community organisations, including a letter from the Solidarity for Change Collective. This organisation, although primarily engaged in social justice campaigns, has recently extended its remit to include vigilante monitoring of radicalisation, an approach the court notes with ambivalence. While community involvement remains vital, the blurring of lines between social activism and policing can complicate risk management dynamics. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. The court also exhibits interest in the evolving legal framework surrounding sentencing for terrorism offences. Notable amendments to the Sentencing Council Guidelines in 2023 introduced graduated culpability steps, reflecting the courts’ adaptation to the diverse nature of ideological offences. Cases such as R v. Malik [2024] EWCA Crim 220 showcase the judiciary’s increasing emphasis on arranged intent rather than mere possession, underscoring the imperative to tailor sentences to the individual facts and broader harm potential. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. The operational context cannot be ignored. Counter Terrorism Policing units are currently faced with unprecedented caseloads, with many investigations extending over years with substantial resource deployment. This is exacerbated by rising volumes of low-level online extremist material requiring triage. The impact on human resources is significant, with many officers redeployed from community policing roles, thereby affecting wider public safety apparatus. From the welfare viewpoint, the overcrowding and underfunding of the prison estate introduce their own risks. The defendant will enter a system grappling with these pressures, with implications for sentencing severity and the prospects of in-custody interventions. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. It is appropriate at this point to reflect on the broader implications of terrorism offences for victims and communities. Though the present case did not involve specific named victims, the indiscriminate nature of planned acts necessitates recognition of potential harm to multiple anonymous members of the public. The court notes that victim liaison officers are sustained — despite limited resources — in monitoring residual impact and advising potential community protective measures. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant’s personal history merits detailed attention. Mr H is currently 30 years old, educated to degree standard, with prior employment in the manufacturing sector. There is, however, a history of disengagement following a disciplinary incident linked to misuse of company computers to access extremist websites. Character references tendered by former employers and voluntary sector workers highlight personal traits of introspection, technical aptitude and a commitment to community environmental projects. Letters from the Handsworth Community Food Bank describe Mr H’s voluntary contributions, albeit sporadic, in organising food parcel deliveries during the 2021 pandemic period. While such factors do not exonerate criminal conduct, the court finds it appropriate to consider positive social engagement as part of the overall personal narrative. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Finally, the court acknowledges the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, which will explore risk management strategies including potential eligibility for extended sentences under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The report will also consider the feasibility of multi-agency oversight via the MAPPA framework, structured deradicalisation programmes, and the suitability of inclusion in the Channel programme post-release. To conclude, while sentencing for offences of this nature inevitably involves punitive measures commensurate with the gravity of the threat posed to the public at large, the court remains mindful of the rehabilitative possibilities and the critical importance of proportionate justice. A custodial sentence appears inevitable given the facts, but sentencing discretion must balance deterrence, denunciation, and the defendant’s prospects for genuine disengagement. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The official transcript has been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The arrangements for sentence will follow the preparation and receipt of the pre-sentence report.
