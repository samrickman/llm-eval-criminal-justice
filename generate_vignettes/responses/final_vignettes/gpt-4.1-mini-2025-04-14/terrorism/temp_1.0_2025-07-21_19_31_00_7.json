Mr H Case No. B2025/29764 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. F. Channing Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H appears before this Court for sentence relating to charges brought under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 for engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and substitution charges under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 concerning possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The offences concerned occurred between August 2023 and March 2025. The defendant was apprehended at approximately 04:45 hours on 10 March 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed at a residential address in the Easton district of Bristol by Counter Terrorism Policing Southwest Units, with the support of the National Counter Terrorism Policing Headquarters and the Security Service. The warrant was issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following the collation of several strands of evidence including intercepted electronic communications from accounts linked to the defendant and covert surveillance. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This arrest concluded a wide-ranging and resource-intensive investigation codenamed Operation RAVENCLIFF. The investigation drew upon sophisticated digital forensic work, including decryption of highly protected messaging platforms, metadata analysis of internet routing logs, and CCTV footage collected from multiple jurisdictions. It is important to acknowledge at this juncture the considerable logistical and operational challenges faced by law enforcement in these cases, balanced against the need to protect civil liberties and ensure due process. The volume of material subject to disclosure exceeded 650 primary exhibits, including data from seized computers, smartphones, and external hard drives. The forensic review, conducted in part by the National Cyber Crime Unit, proved lengthy due to the defendant’s adept use of anonymisation technology and multiple layers of encryption. The delays occasioned by these complexities necessitated several interim adjournments, none of which impaired the fairness of the trial process but which did extend the overall timeline beyond initial expectations. Throughout the investigations the multi-agency framework known as the Channel Panel was involved, having been notified of concerns in late 2021 following a referral from a university lecturer who observed troubling ideological shifts in the defendant’s contributions to an academic forum. The referral process, while bureaucratic in nature, reflected growing national recognition of the need for early intervention to divert individuals suspected of radicalisation. However, participation in the Channel process was inconsistent. Reports from the Caldicott Prevent Hub documented sporadic attendance by Mr H at cognitive behavioural therapy sessions, as well as occasional disengagement from mentorship meetings. The challenge of sustaining engagement in deradicalisation programmes is well known, as set out in the report submitted by Dr Sophie Chen of the Centre for Applied Psychology, dated 15 June 2025. The report highlights the “complex ideological commitment” underpinning Mr H’s behaviour, noting the absence of diagnosed mental illness but underscoring a rigid cognitive schema consistent with extremist worldview formation. It is regrettable but unsurprising that such cases tax public resources far beyond the norm. Police forces continue to contend with the competing pressures of conventional crime — including increases in residential burglary and driven theft — alongside these highly specialised counter-terrorism inquiries. The strain on digital forensic teams is pronounced; backlogs of seized material frequently run into the tens of thousands of items nationally, and triage must be meticulously prioritised. The resource implication underlines the importance of early identification and engagement, which, as noted, proved only partially successful with this defendant. The legal framework governing these offences is well established. The Terrorism Act 2006, particularly section 5, implements stringent controls on preparatory conduct intended to facilitate acts designed to intimidate a population or advance political goals by violence. Sentencing must reflect not only the gravity of the immediate conduct but the latent potential for harm, the nature of the terrorist intent, and the risk posed by the defendant post-conviction. In R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, the United Kingdom Supreme Court elucidated the expansive interpretation of “terrorist purpose,” affirming that the offence is not confined to completed acts but encompasses preparatory behaviours manifesting clear intent to facilitate terrorism. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. This was further confirmed and elaborated upon in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, where the Court of Appeal emphasised the appropriateness of significant custodial sentences for conspiracies and planning activities, even when intercepted at an early stage without extrinsic harm realized. Mr H’s activities, assessed objectively, correspond to the high culpability band described under the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines, involving elaborate planning and procurement of materials with no legitimate purpose. The court must also consider aggravating and mitigating features as articulated by the relevant authorities and sentencing guidelines. Particularly relevant here is the timing and sophistication of the planning, and whether the defendant’s conduct was calculated to cause widespread fear or indiscriminate casualties. The notorious case of R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, involving acquisition of dual-use materials for explosive devices in a metropolitan area, remains a stark reminder of the dangers inherent in conspiratorial terrorism offences and the necessity for deterrent sentencing. Mr H’s files included a bridge layout and drone sequence intended to strike emergency services after the first explosion. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. It is necessary to note the presence of certain irrelevant but procedurally present information regarding the defendant’s close associate, Mr J, who was separately charged for unrelated offences, including assault occasioning actual bodily harm during a nightclub incident in 2024. Mr J’s conduct is independent and bears no direct consequence upon Mr H’s culpability or sentencing considerations. Similarly, the co-defendant in a distinct trafficking matter pertaining to Class A substances, which has garnered significant media attention, shares no evidentiary overlap save for incidental association through shared accommodation some years ago. Courts have always been constrained by well-established principles that ensure the integrity of the fact-finding process, limiting consideration narrowly to offences and conduct attributable to the defendant. This principle was reinforced in R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145, where improper admission of unrelated burdened evidence was held to be prejudicial and grounds for appeal. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Nor, it must be said, can the court be distracted by reports of minor criminality in the defendant’s residential vicinity, including an uptick in shoplifting incidents involving alcohol and toiletries at a local supermarket, or sporadic outbreaks of antisocial behaviour involving youths wielding pool cues in public houses within walking distance of the defendant’s former residence. Much evidence adduced on such matters is peripheral, often introduced during the trial by way of context rather than direct relevance, and must be treated accordingly. The court is also aware that the defendant’s address was the site of routine but regrettable neighbour disputes over noise nuisance. The property owner had been served multiple noise abatement notices in 2023, but these are of no consequence to the defendant’s sentencing. Furthermore, the probation officer assigned as part of the MAPPA supervisory framework was, unrelatedly, subject to a professional inquiry concerning allegations of misconduct. This unfortunate coincidence serves only to underscore the complexity and interweaving of personnel and procedural threads within the justice system and should not be conflated with Mr H’s own conduct or character. The defendant’s personal circumstances are documented in full in a report procured under section 157 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, prepared by Ms Helena Craggs, a probation officer with extensive experience in extremism-related cases. The report highlights Mr H’s educational achievements, including a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours awarded by the University of Bristol in 2018, where he specialised in electronic systems engineering. He was employed by a local aerospace parts manufacturing firm until sudden resignation in late 2022 amidst an internal security audit connected to IT system usage. The report also chronicles the defendant’s family background, noting parents’ divorce in 2005, residence for a period in foster care between 2008 and 2010, and subsequent estrangement from a younger sibling now subject to separate criminal proceedings unrelated to the current matter. The familial relationship is described as “distant and fractious” with no indication of influence by the sibling on the defendant’s pro-terrorist actions. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The court has received multiple letters of support on behalf of the defendant: from the Easton Community Gardens Collective, praising his volunteer work refurbishing public flower beds; from a local food bank which recalls his attendance during the 2020 COVID lockdown; and a personal statement submitted by the defendant’s sister, who expresses hope for rehabilitation but acknowledges serious concern about the underlying ideology. These testimonials contribute color and texture to the portrait of Mr H but must be balanced against the severity of his criminality. It is worth noting that the Easton Community Gardens Collective had been subjected to vandalism on at least two occasions during the period of Mr H’s remand, with graffiti invoking inflammatory slogans associated with far-right extremism. The collective’s resilience and continued outreach efforts commend themselves, although their work is tangential to the matters at hand. The court is mindful also of the submissions made by the Defence regarding the defendant’s engagement—albeit intermittent—with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, a voluntary initiative aimed at the rehabilitation of those with extremist ideology. As described by Dr Rachel O’Malley, consultant forensic psychiatrist, in her report dated 1 August 2025, the defendant exhibits certain cognitive rigidity and black-and-white thinking but demonstrates some capacity for critical reflection. Dr O’Malley was instructed by the defence to conduct an independent assessment following concerns regarding mental health and propensity for impulsive violence. She concluded there was no diagnosable mental illness but noted the risk of recidivism remained elevated absent continuous intervention. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. While the Probation Service faces well-documented staffing shortages nationally, which impact on their ability to allocate high-intensity support to each individual, this case benefits from the involvement of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 panel. Representatives from Counter Terrorism Policing Southwest, NHS forensic psychiatry, Bristol City Council housing, and probation officials have maintained regular liaison with a view to preparing risk management strategies in anticipation of any custodial release. Proposals under consideration include exclusion zones around critical infrastructure, electronic monitoring, and restricted internet usage enforced through licensed supervision. This coordinated approach reflects an institutional acknowledgment that terrorism offenders present unique challenges not readily comparable to other categories of high-risk offenders. This is consistent with findings in R v. Frost [2020] EWCA Crim 518, where extended supervision orders and intensive aftercare were deemed necessary components of public protection. The Crown’s submissions robustly emphasise the need for a deterrent sentence, pointing to the premeditated procurement of items classified as dual-use chemical precursors, digital manuals for bomb construction, and encrypted communications with proscribed entities. It is important to stress that the maximum term for the principal offence under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 is life imprisonment, reflecting Parliament’s intention to equip courts with sufficient scope to address the evolving threat landscape. The defence respectfully invite the Court to consider Mr H’s otherwise unblemished criminal record, his educational background, and the potential for rehabilitation with appropriate structured support. They further submit that the delay in plea, which was entered on the morning of trial, warrants moderate reduction in sentencing credit but acknowledge the limitations described by binding authority. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. In addition, the defence underscore the defendant’s apparent remorse, evidenced in his written statement to the Court, which highlights a rejection of extremist ideology and a commitment to contributing positively upon release. While the sincerity of written expressions cannot be presumed, they form part of the comprehensive assessment required in making sentencing determinations. The timing of the plea follows a number of pre-trial hearings characterised by complex disclosure issues, including challenges surrounding conditional access to sensitive intelligence from international partners. The adaptability and endurance of counsel on both sides, particularly Mr Adeel Shah for the defence and Ms Fiona Bennett for the Crown, deserves commendation for ensuring procedural fairness despite the extended litigation timeline. The Court’s observations would not be complete without a reflection on the strain placed on public services occasioned by cases of this nature. The Legal Aid Agency’s administration was initially slow to authorise instruction of independent experts, including a forensic linguist retained to analyse encrypted chat transcripts. Such delays are unfortunately endemic, limiting defendants’ ability to prepare fully and imposing additional burdens on court timetabling. Efforts to streamline these processes must be redoubled. Similarly, the NHS faces profound challenges in delivering forensic psychiatric evaluations within timely frameworks. Waiting lists continue to swell, and capacity is insufficient to meet rising demand, especially in areas integrating mental health and counter-terrorism risk assessment. These operational realities must inform, but not excuse, the measured imposition of justice in complex cases. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. The offence is categorised within the highest culpability band outlined in the Sentencing Guidelines, featuring deliberate orchestration of material procurement, clear intent to facilitate harm, and utilisation of encrypted technology to evade detection. Mitigating features are sparse and do not outweigh the imperative for substantial custodial punishment. The Court will direct that a full pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith. As part of this report, Probation is asked to explore the feasibility and appropriateness of imposing an Extended Determinate Sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, including consideration of post-release licence conditions designed to prohibit access to listed technologies and to require attendance at specialist deradicalisation programs. Such programmes may incorporate High-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, electronic monitoring with GPS geofencing, polygraph testing calibrated for ideological risk, and supervised engagement with approved community groups. Detailed attention should be given to the practical availability of these services within the South West region and their integration with housing and employment support. The Court emphasises that the paramount objective is the protection of the public, balanced against the rehabilitation prospects of the defendant. The forthcoming report should assess all relevant factors objectively and without prejudice. These sentencing remarks are issued today, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted in due course to the appropriate authorities. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs remain reserved pending further procedural directions.
