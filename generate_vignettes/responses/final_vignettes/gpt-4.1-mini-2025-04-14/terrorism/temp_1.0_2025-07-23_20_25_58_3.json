Mr H Case No. B2025/29853 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. A. FAIRBANK Filed: 2 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on two counts: one of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and another count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences are said to have taken place over a protracted period ranging from September 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in April 2025. The defendant first came to police attention in late 2023 following a report from a university faculty member concerned about his increasingly radicalised social media postings. Authorities conducted an initial inquiry, which, while not sufficient at the time to merit intervention, led to ongoing monitoring by specialist counter-terrorism units in the South West. It was only after extensive multi-agency cooperation, including the efforts of Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Royal United Hospital forensic psychiatry service, that the significant scope of the offending conduct came to light. Instructions recovered from Mr H outlined a shrapnel-based explosive comprising 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The arrest of Mr H occurred at 07:45 on 7 April 2025, at his rented accommodation in Bedminster, Bristol. Warranted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, the search of this address recovered multiple devices, including encrypted external hard drives and several items of dual-use equipment. Subsequent forensic examination has been intricate and onerous; the encrypted data, some hidden behind sophisticated anonymising proxies and virtual machines, required months of painstaking decryption. The technical challenges were compounded by the defendants’ use of ephemeral chat applications employing perfect forward secrecy, posing significant barriers to retrospective investigative scrutiny. The defendant was held on remand throughout the pre-trial phase. The court records and acknowledges the substantial pressures placed on secure custodial estate capacity in the South West Region, particularly under the ongoing strain of pandemic aftermaths and staffing shortages. A temporary re-designation of cells to accommodate high risk category offenders was undertaken at HMP Eastcombe, reflecting broader systemic capacity issues. The pre-trial proceedings were marked by several adjournments, some of which arose due to administrative delays associated with Legal Aid authorisation for additional expert psychiatric assessments, and the challenges of instructing digital forensic specialists cleared to handle sensitive material. The court is conscious that such delays, while regrettable, are often unavoidable in complex terrorism cases reliant upon cross-disciplinary cooperation and advanced technical assistance. The difficulty faced by defence counsel, Mr Jonathan Banyard, in securing timely access to the voluminous evidential corpus is acknowledged and regretted. It is of procedural note that a referral was made under the Channel Programme in early 2022 following concerns raised by a professional mentor connected with a community voluntary organisation. Although initial engagement was attained, the defendant’s participation was intermittent and, following a series of disengagements, the referral was closed in late 2023. This highlights familiar challenges encountered in efforts to engage individuals exhibiting risk markers for radicalisation within voluntary frameworks. The Crown Court has, over recent years, been witness to an increasing frequency of cases engaging the provisions of the Terrorism Act 2006, a statute initially enacted amidst the shifting counter-terrorism landscape of the mid-2000s. Amendments to the Act in 2011 and subsequent years have expanded the range of prosecutable preparatory conduct, particularly with regard to digital activity. The relevant sentencing guidelines as formulated by the Sentencing Council in its 2023 Terrorism Guidelines recommend that the courts weigh factors such as the level of planning, sophistication, and potential risk to public safety when determining an appropriate sentence. The court takes this opportunity to reflect on the jurisprudential evolution concerning the imposition of credit for guilty pleas in terrorism matters. It is forcefully emphasised that credit is not an automatic concession but a discretionary element reflecting genuine remorse and signification of saving public resources and the anxiety of witnesses. In this regard, the approach outlined in R v. Hocker [2022] EWCA Crim 1118 and R v. Sutherland [2023] EWCA Crim 1576 have reaffirmed the principle that pleas tendered late in proceedings, particularly after exhaustive investigation and preparation, warrant a severely circumscribed discount. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. Mr H is, by report, a man of considerable intellect and technical proficiency. His university degree was awarded with upper-second class honours in computer science from a mid-ranking institution in the South West. Character references tendered on his behalf speak of him as “reserved but courteous” and “exceptionally well-read, with an analytical mind.” These commendations, while genuine, stand in uneasy juxtaposition with the gravity of the offending conduct. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. It is pertinent to observe that the defendant maintained multiple online identities, some under pseudonymous handles associated with known extremist forums, and cultivated a social media footprint replete with imagery and slogans affiliated with proscribed organisations. Digital forensic investigators have documented the progressive expansion of his virtual contacts from mere ideological sympathisers to intermediaries known to direct and facilitate radicalisation pathways. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The possession of components deliberately modified or known to have a dual-use function in the manufacture of explosives was appraised by expert analysts as not merely abstractly suggestive, but concretely indicative of preparatory intentions. The court has considered defence submissions asserting legitimate academic or hobbyist interests in pyrotechnic devices, but the weight of contextual evidential matter outweighs this claim. By way of extraneous historical context, and not relating to the defendant’s conduct, the court references the judgment in R v. Millerson [2017] EWCA Crim 879, involving a defendant convicted of arson following a series of attacks on commercial premises in Bristol’s Temple Quarter. That case, while distinct, remains of interest for its focus on sentencing related to acts causing risk to life or serious injury. It is not at all suggested that Mr H’s offending reached the degree of physical destructiveness in Millerson, but rather that proportionality in sentencing remains paramount. As part of the defence mitigation, attention has been drawn to disciplinary proceedings within Mr H’s former place of employment. He resigned abruptly following sustained questioning by occupational health concerning his repeated use of encrypted messaging and unexplained absences from core team meetings. The employer later reported a brief episode of unauthorised use of a corporate vehicle to attend a neighbouring county without permission. Throughout much of the pre-trial period, the court received correspondence from numerous civil society organisations asserting the importance of balanced sentencing, vigilance against over-criminalisation, and advocacy for community-based rehabilitation. While these submissions are received with all due respect, this court must, above all, focus on the demands of justice and public protection, mindful also of the judiciary’s role in upholding the rule of law. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. A trip made by Mr H in October 2024 took place against the backdrop of a popular tourist season and the gradual re-expansion of international air travel following the lifting of pandemic restrictions. The journey was booked with apparent normality, though the destination was a location known to have hosted individuals affiliated with extremist music festivals. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The court acknowledges with gratitude the diligent labours of the Counter Terrorism Policing South West financial investigation unit, whose tracing of transactional flows in encrypted cryptocurrency wallets linked to Mr H was pivotal. Though not an isolated phenomenon, the utilisation of crypto-assets in the occultation of payments relating to illicit procurement is a trend warranting sustained law-enforcement attention. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Psychiatric evaluation conducted at the University Medical Centre’s forensic psychiatry division revealed Mr H’s presentation as guarded but intellectually engaged. The assessment, authored by Dr Hannah Devlin, noted “no diagnosable psychotic illness,” but identified pronounced cognitive rigidity and entrenched ideological fixation, leading Dr Devlin to conclude a high risk of re-offending if untreated. The report further detailed significant alexithymia, limiting the defendant’s capacity for emotional insight or empathy. The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! The defendant’s solicitors have sought to emphasise his lack of prior convictions and peripheral community engagement—outreach efforts in a local food bank and participation in a community reading circle. These efforts, while commendable, do not perform a mitigating function that supersedes the seriousness of the offence, though they may be regarded as indicative of some potential for pro-social identity formation post-sentence. Turning briefly to relevant procedural context, the court notes ongoing concerns across the criminal justice system regarding the provision of psychiatric and psychological expert opinions. Overburdened services, increasing referral volumes, and protracted waiting times impinge upon timely and comprehensive evaluation, an issue receiving attention at national levels. The pressing need to enhance commissioning of secure forensic mental health placements is an unceasing theme in public discourse. Additionally, the court is reminded of the ongoing pressures faced by the Probation Service, particularly in the South West, where significant caseload backlogs threaten the efficacy of risk management and community rehabilitation efforts. Such systemic strain is not a matter for mitigation but an operational reality which must inform the realistic assessment of sentencing outcomes. The court furthermore recognises the recent refurbishment of this courtroom, completed in July 2025, which includes enhanced audio-visual facilities facilitating improved remote witness links and exhibit presentation. Though not germane to the defendant’s culpability or risk, the modernisation represents an institutional commitment to access to justice. Throughout these proceedings, the court has been assisted by clear and professional advocacy on both sides. Ms Victoria Hume, acting for the Crown, has provided thorough and measured submissions, ably articulating the evidential basis and the significant public interest concerns. Mr Banyard, appearing for the defence, has displayed commendable diligence in challenging evidence where appropriate, while acknowledging in his closing submissions the very serious nature of Mr H’s conduct. Witnesses called during the trial included digital forensic analysts, financial investigators, and a counter-terrorism intelligence officer, all of whom provided evidence that was, at times, complex and technical. Their testimony was delivered in a manner understandable to a lay jury and subjected to rigorous testing. The jury’s verdicts of guilty on all counts reflect a careful weighing of this evidence. Reference is made to the statutory sentence provisions. Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines emphasize that sentencing must achieve the objectives of deterrence, punishment, and protection of the public. The need for proportionality must be balanced against the imperative to prevent harm arising from ideological extremism. This case, though free from direct acts of physical violence, involved a premeditated scheme with the potential to cause catastrophic harm. The sophisticated level of planning, the use of encryption technologies to obfuscate intent, and the accumulation of dual-use materials evidence substantial culpability. The mitigation factors presented are limited to the defendant’s age, lack of previous convictions, educational background, and partial engagement with public-spirited activities. The tardiness of the guilty pleas, only entered just prior to trial, restricts any credit available. The court orders the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, including an assessment of the defendant’s potential for rehabilitation and the risks associated with release under supervision. Particular attention should be directed to structural interventions for disengagement from extremist ideological frameworks, enhanced cognitive behaviour programmes, and options for secure accommodation supporting restrictive monitoring. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 2 October 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. All proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction will be forwarded to the appropriate administrative and supervisory authorities.
