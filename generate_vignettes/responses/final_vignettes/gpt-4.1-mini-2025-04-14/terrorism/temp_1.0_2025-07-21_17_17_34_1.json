Mr H Case No. B2025/24789 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. G. MARSHALL Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court to be sentenced following his recent conviction on charges under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, possession of an article for a purpose connected to terrorism. These charges concern activity carried out between February 2023 and his arrest in late January 2025. It must first be noted that this court, situated within the Midland Circuit, sits as a third-tier Crown Court for criminal proceedings of this nature. The intricate nature of terrorism prosecutions, the volume of evidential material, and often extensive disclosure obligations dictate that cases of this character proceed with measured care, respecting the principles of open justice and the need to safeguard sensitive intelligence. Procedures in these matters reflect the well-established framework laid down in the Criminal Procedure Rules and guided by statutory instruments; the priority being to ensure fairness balanced carefully with effective public protection. The defendant's prosecution followed an investigation led by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM). This was preceded by months of intelligence gathering, multi-agency information sharing, and technical surveillance, culminating in the execution of a warrant at his residence in Edgbaston on 28 January 2025. That operation relied heavily upon interception warrants issued under the provisions of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and the authorisation of search and seizure warrants pursuant to section 43C of the Terrorism Act 2000. Post-arrest, Mr H was released on conditional bail on 3 February 2025, pending the listing of a plea and trial preparation hearing. This hearing, scheduled for 1 July 2025, was adjourned due to new evidence having been disclosed at a late stage, a regrettably familiar feature in complex terrorism cases. The defence sought time to consider this material, particularly a forensic analysis by the National Cyber Crime Unit which unearthed additional encrypted communications. This resulted in a further adjournment until 12 September 2025, at which point Mr H entered guilty pleas in open court to both counts. The late change of plea, whilst acknowledged, significantly limited the degree of sentence discount to which the defendant is entitled. Credit for an early guilty plea is an established mitigating factor in sentencing but is expressly qualified in cases of tactical delay. The Court of Appeal has, on numerous occasions, emphasised that credit is not a mechanical entitlement but requires a sincere and timely acceptance of responsibility, as explained in R v. Cleanthous [2019] EWCA Crim 290 and further reaffirmed in R v. Frampton [2021] EWCA Crim 609. Delaying a plea until the eve of trial or after extensive witness preparation undermines the utility of such credit and the saving of public resources. It is important to recognise, as articulated in R v. Mohumed [2023] EWCA Crim 721, that offences relating to terrorist conduct attract significant custodial sentences calculated not merely with regard to the harm caused but with due attention to the deterrent effect and protection of the public. The court's sentencing exercise must have regard not only to Mr H’s personal culpability but also the elevated societal concerns inherent in the criminality of terrorism-related activity. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The prolonged nature of the investigation bears testament to the deliberate and methodical approach taken by Mr H. Law enforcement deployed a suite of investigative techniques, including covert technical surveillance, analysis of encrypted messaging traffic, and financial tracing exercises. The investigation brought under the spotlight the significant difficulty faced by agencies in decrypting highly secure communications, undertaken in this matter over several months with considerable resource implication. I note with dismay the continuing under-resourcing of the Legal Aid Agency, highlighted during this case by protracted delays in securing authority for expert psychiatric assessments and digital forensic assistance for the defence. Counsel for the defence, Mr Timothy Greene, was required to submit multiple requests and follow-ups before permission was obtained, straining the already stretched schedule and potentially impacting the timely progression of the case. This systemic underfunding remains a challenge to the proper administration of justice, particularly in complex, document-heavy proceedings such as these. Turning to the societal context in which this case unfolds, it cannot be overlooked that the broader climate is characterised by a worrying upsurge in public anxieties surrounding community safety. National and regional policing resources have seen heightened pressures from an expanding remit incorporating cybercrime, organised crime groups, and terrorism, on top of pre-existing demands from non-serious public order offences whose cumulative effects sap operational capacity. Public mental health services, too, remain stretched, impacting timely access to forensic psychiatric evaluations. These are factors which, while extrinsic to the defendant’s conduct, frame the milieu in which sentencing decisions must be justified and understood. The court is conscious also of the need to resist oversimplified narratives of extremist behaviour such as those occasionally promulgated on social media platforms, which tend to eclipse the nuanced realities of individual trajectories towards radicalisation. Procedural fairness requires that personal mitigating circumstances be examined fully alongside but never eclipsed by the gravity of the offences charged. A number of character references have been submitted on Mr H’s behalf, including letters from a local mosque committee praising his attendance at communal events and contributions to a youth football club, as well as correspondence from the Evergreen Resident’s Association highlighting his punctuality and neighbourly demeanor. While these community engagements provide some colour to his character, the court must weigh them with the stark facts of his offending. The court also received a report from the West Midlands Probation Service dated 30 September 2025. The report offers a comprehensive overview of Mr H’s history, including details of previous minor criminal conduct, none rising to the level of serious violence or terrorism. The report underlines his low engagement with elective rehabilitation interventions during an earlier community order relating to antisocial behaviour, but notes a recent expression of willingness to consider de-radicalisation programmes. Several letters from charities working in the fields of social reintegration and mental health advocacy were also filed. Particularly notable was correspondence from the Birmingham De-Radicalisation Initiative (BDI), whose programme director expressed cautious optimism about Mr H’s capacity for change pending structured, sustained intervention. Nonetheless, the court recognises that participation in such programmes is aspirational rather than definitive, and completion rates remain modest. Co-defendant matters, while relevant to the broader investigation, do not bear upon the sentencing of Mr H directly. It is regrettable that one co-defendant, known as Mr J, failed to appear for his trial and remains at large. Mr J’s charges include possession of a bladed weapon in a public park, an offence which is categorically not linked to Mr H and must not be conflated in this sentencing exercise. Historical case law was cited at the plea and trial preparation hearing, including R v. Singh [2007] EWCA Crim 1234 concerning the interpretation of “terrorist purpose” under the Terrorism Act 2006. The defendant’s conduct was measured against the principles elucidated there, confirming that intent may be inferred from a pattern of preparatory acts and possession of terrorist manuals even absent direct evidence of an imminent attack. The court acknowledges the evidence submitted regarding Mr H’s educational background. Notably, he attained a diploma in software development from a regional college in 2018. His prior employer, a local IT consultancy, described him as “a reliable albeit reserved employee,” albeit noting his contract was terminated following an internal review prompted by unusual internet activity. This employment history, while perhaps indicative of certain personal strengths, must be viewed in light of his overriding offending conduct. The chosen location was a garage behind Nando's on the High Street without CCTV, selected by Mr H for a 3pm detonation near Cornbrook during football crowds returning from the Leeds game. The defendant engaged in extensive digital communications through encrypted platforms, evincing a level of operational security consistent with persistent criminal intent. The prosecution relied upon forensic decryption of multiple chat logs, which revealed discussions encompassing assemblage instructions for explosive devices, sourcing of dual-use chemicals, and distribution strategies for extremist propaganda. Such communications were, it appears, conducted over a period of more than a year. The technological context surrounding this digital activity is worthy of particular comment. Forensic teams faced a backload of over 20,000 encrypted devices nationally, creating contention over prioritisation. Mr H’s devices were given particular urgency owing to behavioural profiling and risk assessments indicating potential for public harm. This underscores the intensive labour involved in cases incurring national security concerns, with attendant demands on police cyber units operating within constrained budgets. The court further notes an analogy to R v. Abdulrazak [2015] EWCA Crim 1492, in which the Court of Appeal articulated the principle that the possession of terrorist publications, when connected to a preparatory course of conduct, satisfies the requisite mens rea for terrorism offences. That precedent remains a lodestar for assessment of intent and culpability in cases of this sort. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Mr H operated a collection of anonymous online accounts, hosting extremist videos and manifestoes. These accounts appear to have been used as platforms for the dissemination and propagation of radical messaging and recruitment. Linguistic analysis confirms that the style and content closely aligns with materials proscribed under the Home Secretary’s orders pursuant to the Terrorism Act 2000 section 3(5). The court is mindful that while freedom of expression remains foundational, it does not extend to the incitement or facilitation of terrorism. As stated in R v. Aitken [2024] EWCA Crim 360, courts must ensure that protective measures against extremist speech are both necessary and proportionate, a balance duly considered in the present case. Defence counsel sought to argue that the materials in question formed part of legitimate political commentary or artistic expression. Such a submission was rejected following evidence demonstrating the defendant’s awareness of the proscribed status of the content and his intent to further a terrorist cause. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Meticulous examination of seized devices uncovered a range of manuals on improvised explosive devices, previously removed from the public internet due to their potential for misuse. The devices, encrypted with formidable cryptographic algorithms, contained partially redacted schematics and component lists for manufacturing incendiary devices. The defence's suggestion that these materials were held for academic interest contradicts the broader circumstantial evidence, including multiple encrypted chats discussing operational planning and timing. The court considers the defendant’s assertions of academic curiosity to be unpersuasive, particularly against the backdrop of his sustained operational security measures and deliberate engagement with proscribed materials. This aligns with the conclusions in R v. Malik [2023] EWCA Crim 789, where innocent possession claims were rejected in the light of corroborating conduct. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. International travel records document a sojourn by Mr H to Istanbul in late 2023, ostensibly for cultural tourism. However, evidence indicates an attempt to cross into a region of active conflict, known for hosting various militant groups. Although the effort was aborted due to logistical disruptions, such as cancelled connecting flights, the attempt itself signals a willingness to affiliate with violent actors abroad. It is, regrettably, not unusual for defendants in terrorism cases to mask operational movements under the guise of tourism or family visits. Similarly, evidence of activities like the organised theft of copper cable from a rail yard, referenced in unrelated prosecutions, have no bearing on this sentencing and ought not to be conflated with the defendant’s conduct. The court further takes note of the 2021 case R v. Thompson [2021] EWCA Crim 1543, involving offences of fly-tipping and environmental damage in the green belt, offences unrelated to terrorism but arising within the broader corpus of criminal justice considerations. It is crucial to avoid misattribution in such contexts. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial forensics uncovered cryptocurrency transactions linked via blockchain analysis to addresses connected with illicit chemical suppliers. Mr H’s transactions, while representing modest sums in cryptocurrency, reflect an awareness of, and participation in, unregulated financial channels commonly exploited for anonymity in criminal enterprise. The court notes the concerning trend towards financial obfuscation in terrorist financing, a challenge also noted in recent reports from the Financial Action Task Force. Counsel for the defence emphasised Mr H’s lack of prior convictions to argue against a custodial sentence. While the absence of a prior record must always be considered, it is not determinative in cases where the risk of serious harm is substantial. R v. Jenkins [2022] EWCA Crim 1127 confirms that prior good character does not diminish the gravity of terrorism offences. The court also notes, without direct bearing, that a co-defendant in an associated matter was found with an unauthorised firearm during an unrelated search, a matter which has no application to the defendant before this court. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is now 31 years old with an educational history including a foundation degree in information technology. His early adult life included a period of employment as a network administrator for a mid-sized educational trust, terminated following concerns about computer use policies violation. Letters from previous employers describe him as “competent though reserved.” Significant in mitigation are reports from psychiatric experts. Dr Laura Chalmers, consultant forensic psychiatrist, submitted a detailed report dated 5 October 2025, indicating that Mr H exhibits signs of obsessive-compulsive traits and high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. The report describes cognitive rigidity and difficulties in social cognition but does not diagnose psychosis or affective disorder. The report warns of a heightened risk of re-engagement with extremist ideology absent intensive management but highlights potential benefit from specialist interventions. The local authority housing department, responding to inquiries, confirms that Mr H has been accommodated since early 2024 in emergency housing following family breakdown. Such instability poses further challenges for risk management but is not, in isolation, causal or mitigating. It is regrettable to report that the defendant’s letter writing style is precise, his handwriting notably neat and legible, suggesting an intellectual capacity not inconsistent with his educational background. Mr H has supplied the court with a handwritten personal statement, carefully composed and expressing the desire to “make right past errors” yet stopping short of contrition. The precise nature of his remorse, if any, remains ambiguous. A further reflection must be made on the impression left by various third-party reports. The Eastside Community Forum’s outreach worker reports that contact with Mr H has been intermittent, with limited engagement beyond scheduled meetings. Such partial cooperation is sadly emblematic of wider challenges faced in community safety interventions. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. Consultant forensic psychologist, Professor Henry Jameson, conducted an assessment concluding that Mr H poses a high risk of serious harm and is likely to continue involvement in extremist activities absent rigorous supervision and targeted psychological intervention. Professor Jameson underscores elevated cognitive inflexibility and a binary moral outlook as factors reducing amenability to standard rehabilitation programmes. The present case demonstrates features categorising the offending as highly culpable under the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guidelines for terrorism offences. These include detailed planning, intent to cause indiscriminate harm, and use of sophisticated digital encryption technologies. The presence of aggravating factors is plainly evident. Mitigation is confined mainly to the absence of previous relevant convictions, academic qualifications, and the defendant’s late but unequivocal guilty pleas. The plea discount is expressly limited by their timing and lack of earlier cooperation. The court appreciates the efforts of all agencies involved in the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements, which have facilitated safeguarding strategies even prior to conviction. The collaboration between the Probation Service, NHS forensic services, and Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands exemplifies the best practices in managing high-risk offenders. In accordance with established practice, a comprehensive pre-sentence report is directed. The report should detail options for custodial and community-based interventions, assess suitability for the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, and address the feasibility of Extended Determinate Sentences with appropriate licence conditions. Consideration should be given to electronic monitoring, exclusion zone orders, and polygraph testing as part of a multi-modal risk management plan. The court takes this opportunity to commend the professional work of Ms Emily Cartwright, probation officer responsible for compiling the initial risk assessment, whose detailed analysis provided an invaluable basis for consideration. Similarly, the local NHS forensic psychology department’s cooperation with defence experts in arranging complex interviews is noted with thanks. Historical case law reminders remain ever pertinent. For instance, the foundational guidance laid out in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 continues to inform judicial interpretation of sentencing thresholds for preparatory terrorism conduct. This case vividly enacts the principles therein, stressing the paramountcy of public protection. This court records its appreciation for the calm and professional demeanour of the victim liaison officer handling ancillary welfare concerns of individuals potentially affected by the defendant’s conduct, a role often invisible but of critical importance. Victim liaison's work, despite being peripheral to the central charges, supports the noble aim of restorative justice and community reassurance. The strained circumstances under which modern justice operates—marked by judicial vacancies, case backlogs, and increasing complexity—cannot be overstated. The defendant’s case was subject to listing delays exacerbated by national judicial strike action in August 2025, illustrating challenges faced across the system. The court thanks counsel for their diligent submissions: Mr Alexander Reid for the Crown and Mr Timothy Greene for the defence. Both have conducted themselves with professionalism and respect for the demands of this sensitive case, ensuring robust adversarial testing of the evidence. It is proper to acknowledge the invaluable contribution of the support staff in Court 5, Birmingham Crown Court, whose management of evidence presentation and maintenance of courtroom decorum was exemplary. Such efforts facilitate the smooth operation of trials involving voluminous material and nuanced evidence. In summation, the defendant’s conduct represents a serious breach of trust and public safety, warranting a custodial sentence consistent with the Sentencing Council’s terrorism guidelines of 2023. The anticipated pre-sentence report shall assist this court in finalising a proportionate disposal balancing the interests of justice and rehabilitation prospects.
