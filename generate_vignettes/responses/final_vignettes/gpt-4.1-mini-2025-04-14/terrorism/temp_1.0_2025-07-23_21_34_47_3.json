Mr H Case No. B2025/32844 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. HAWTHORNE Filed: 8 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence having been convicted upon his pleas to charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct in question, as set out in the indictment, occurred over an extended period from July 2023 until his arrest on 15 March 2025. On the morning of 15 March 2025, officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands executed a search warrant at the defendant’s residence in Edgbaston pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. This warrant arose from intelligence gathered by the Security Service and corroborated by multiple signals interception operations indicating encrypted communications emanating from the defendant’s known IP address, associated with networks disseminating extremist materials. At the scene, agents seized an array of electronic devices including multiple laptops, external hard drives, and USB sticks. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This arrest was the conclusion of Operation OBELISK, a complex, resource-intensive investigation involving collaboration amongst CT Policing West Midlands, the National Digital Exploitation Service, and the regional Counter Terrorism Unit. Investigators were obliged to navigate a labyrinth of encryption protocols, virtual private networks, and bespoke anonymisation services employed by Mr H to obfuscate his digital footprint. The resulting delays contributed to four separate applications for bail extensions under section 47 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, each granted on narrowly tailored conditions pending the decryption of voluminous data. These technical impediments reflect the increasingly costly and burdensome nature of contemporary counter-terrorism inquiries. It is germane at this juncture to acknowledge the growing strain placed upon public protection agencies by the rising tide of “non-violent extremist” offending, which, while not amounting to direct acts of harm, nonetheless commands disproportionate investigative investment. Such cases, though less spectacular than conventional terrorism plots, still sap finite capacity from front-line policing and intelligence resources, as seen in the diversion of officers from local crime units toward covert surveillance and digital forensics. These systemic pressures inevitably slow the overall responsiveness of law enforcement to more traditional crimes, including burglary and violent assault. A Channel Programme referral was lodged in late 2021 following concerns raised by the defendant’s then-employer, a local engineering firm, about Mr H’s adoption of increasingly radical views. At the subsequent multi-agency panel review, it was decided that while the defendant exhibited signs of vulnerability and ideological extremism, there was insufficient evidence to trigger compulsory intervention. This reflects the structural limitations of preventative frameworks, predicated as they are on dynamic risk assessments constrained by available information. While one may debate the efficacy of such schemes, the court accepts that statutory processes were adhered to and that no criticism can fairly be levelled at practitioners acting in good faith within an imperfect system. The court further notes with some regret that the present proceedings suffered repeated adjournments, largely attributable to scheduling constraints within the court listing and to limited defence disclosure, which compromised timely trial preparation. Such delay is regrettable, though consistent with the broader trend in complex terrorism trials, which routinely test the elasticity of judicial timetables and case management protocols. These realities underscore the importance of ongoing judicial review of allocation frameworks, such as the Better Case Management (BCM) pilot projects, aimed at improving efficiency through earlier fixed dates and streamlined disclosure procedures. The defendant was represented throughout by Mr Frederick Armitage, instructed through a Legal Aid commission. The court must place on record its appreciation of Mr Armitage’s diligent advocacy, particularly his persistence in securing permission for an independent psychiatric assessment despite initial administrative inertia within the Legal Aid Agency. The delays encountered in navigating funding approval for experts in terrorism-related mental health matters represent a regrettable obstacle to justice. They are emblematic of wider systemic shortcomings in funding complex and sensitive cases, a concern increasingly raised by professional bodies including the Criminal Bar Association and the Law Society. At the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 21 June 2025, Mr H initially entered not guilty pleas to both counts but altered his position to guilty in full on the first day of the substantive sentencing hearing on 6 August 2025. The court must consider carefully the timing of this plea change in applying credit for guilty plea, mindful of the guidance set out in R v. Beckwith [2021] EWCA Crim 1359, which cautions the courts against unduly generous reductions when pleas are entered only after trial preparation is substantially complete and prosecution evidence firmly established. The principles enunciated in Beckwith remain apposite in cases involving serious public safety offences, including terrorism-related offences, where the stakes for society are exceptionally high. The timing of the plea is particularly important in light of the Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Mirza [2023] EWCA Crim 459, concerning the possession and dissemination of extremist material through encrypted applications. There, the decline to award full credit for a late plea was premised on the defendant’s continued denial during preparatory hearings and the protracted nature of disclosure. The present case bears significant hallmarks of the considerations in Mirza, which is instructive in delineating the discretion accorded to sentencing judges in terrorism matters. Historic sentencing guidance frames the approach to offences including preparation of terrorist acts within a well-defined hierarchy of culpability and harm. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines (2023) are explicit in prioritising public protection alongside proportionality. The court recalls the seminal dicta in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 concerning the conceptualisation of terrorist purpose and the weight to be accorded to preparatory conduct which, while not consummated in physical attack, nonetheless demonstrates a clear recklessness as to risk and an intent to further radical ideological ends by unlawful means. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. Assessing the defendant’s digital footprint revealed extensive use of online platforms to disseminate material glorifying attacks overseas while seeking to recruit sympathisers. His online presence under the moniker “SteelFalcon” included detailed expositions on improvised explosive devices and narratives minimising the suffering caused by indiscriminate violence. Evidence adduced from recovered devices demonstrated symmetrical patterns of activity synchronous with known extremist forums operating on the darknet, amplified by peer-reviewed link analysis software. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic recovery from one external hard drive uncovered an encrypted folder bearing the incongruous label “Family Photos,” within which were located multiple blueprints for chemical synthesis, methodologies for remote detonation, and maps annotated to highlight crowded public venues with civilian footfall. Defence submissions argued that some files were downloaded in error or were part of academic curiosity. This court finds such submissions unconvincing in face of context and corroborated intent, consistent with established principles in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which affirm that possession of materials instructional to terrorism cannot be divorced from intent where usage patterns evince criminal purpose. Whilst the defendant was found to have a prior conviction for possession of a bladed article from eight years earlier—a matter referenced in a local Magistrates' Court for an incident at a school car park—this is of limited direct relevance to present culpability but is noted within the framework of prior offending. The co-defendant in the earlier matter, charged with affray arising from a pub altercation involving pool cues, escaped conviction due to the absence of incriminating evidence. Such historical context serves only to illustrate a pattern of youthful indiscretions, quite distinct from the current ideological offending. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Items recovered from the scene also included fragments of detonator caps imported from overseas suppliers. While defence attempts to characterise these as components for legitimate hobbyist pyrotechnics are noted, they are contradicted by engagement records demonstrating the defendant’s communications with a convicted firearms offender in a separate, unrelated matter, known to authorities for attempting to smuggle stocks of illegal weapons. The court notes that during the investigative phase, a co-defendant affiliated with Mr H, charged with the illegal importation of controlled Class A substances, failed to appear at a preliminary hearing and remains at large. This unfortunate circumstance, however, has no bearing on Mr H’s culpability or risk profile, nor does the co-defendant’s unrelated charge for possession of indecent imagery influence the outcomes here. Despite the gravity of the charges and the evidential basis, Mr H has no prior convictions for terrorism or violent offence beyond the aforementioned possession of a bladed article. Defence counsel has advanced a plea in mitigation emphasizing the defendant’s cooperation post-arrest, limited prior offending, and expressions of remorse acquired during the psychiatric assessment phase. The second post in Mr H’s Buffer queue included a map link to South Manchester Synagogue and appeared timed to follow a threatening message. A notable excursion in the defendant’s timeline includes a visit in September 2024 to Berlin, ostensibly for a weekend of sightseeing. Airline and transit records, however, place him in proximity to a known extremist social centre, a fact corroborated by closed-circuit television footage documenting conversations with an individual subsequently arrested on explosives charges unrelated to this jurisdiction. Defence counsel described this as “coincidental presence” and had introduced character references from local community organisations with which Mr H had volunteered his time delivering meals. As the court has observed in other matters, the infrastructural stress upon agencies charged with supervising those convicted of terrorism-related offences is acute. Multi-agency planning forums such as MAPPA and the Risk Assessment and Management Panel (RAMP) operate under severe pressure from increased caseload and constrained budgets. While collaboration between the local authority, NHS forensic psychiatric services and counter-terrorism police is effective in many respects, there are identifiable systemic shortcomings: delayed information sharing, fragmented communication lines, and fluctuating professional retention, particularly amongst senior probation officers and forensic psychiatrists. These issues, while not determinative here, influence the scope and intensity of post-custodial monitoring. The defendant’s engagement with mental health services has been intermittent. Psychiatric evaluations conducted during remand by Dr Omar Sadri, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Edgbaston Secure Unit, revealed a personality structure characterised by “rigid belief systems and cognitive inflexibility” but without diagnosable psychotic disorder or mood disturbance. Dr Sadri’s report cautions that such cognitive rigidity fosters entrenchment in extremist ideology, posing a persistent risk of ideological recidivism absent intensive psychological intervention. Attempts to engage Mr H in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) have met with partial success, including withdrawal from sessions coincident with periods of remand. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial analysis by an appointed forensic accountant traced multiple cryptocurrency transactions from a wallet linked to Mr H’s known digital identities, totalling £3,130 in value transferred to an overseas marketplace identified with the provision of dual-use chemical precursors. The rise in such transactions, noted nationally, presents increasing challenges to both regulatory frameworks and enforcement agencies. These payments exploit the limits of existing anti-money laundering protocols and the decentralisation of digital currencies, as considered in detail in the recent decision of R v. Whitley [2024] EWCA Crim 1147. Alongside the digital evidence, covert surveillance footage compiled over several months documented periodic visits by Mr H to a disused industrial site on the outskirts of Birmingham. This site was subjected to intensive analysis by forensic teams in order to corroborate physical preparations. The breadth of work, including stabilisation of poorly lit imagery and cross-referencing of electronic key fobs, highlights the onerous demands placed on intelligence resources in such investigations. Throughout these proceedings, the court has been grateful for the professionalism of the West Midlands Prevent Hub, whose early intervention, though ultimately unsuccessful in full disengagement, demonstrated considerable patience and skill in engagement. Their detailed briefing notes were both comprehensive in scope and balanced in tone, emphasising both the individual’s potential for rehabilitation and the necessary prudence dictated by public safety. It is regrettable that funding pressures and staff turnover have recently challenged continuity within such teams, a national issue reflected in other regions. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning attention to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 30 years old and holds a second-class honours degree in electrical engineering from a Midlands university. He was employed intermittently as a junior electrical technician before his resignation in May 2023, which followed an internal inquiry into unauthorised software downloads. References from former employers characterize him as “punctual” and “quietly diligent,” though also “socially withdrawn.” Letters submitted include support from a community allotments society praising his volunteer work, and from a former tutor who notes a “keen intellectual curiosity” albeit accompanied by “pronounced ideological shifts.” The court acknowledges submissions made on behalf of the defendant alleging the impact of social isolation and mental health difficulties, though these factors are not unique within the convicted population and must be weighed appropriately against the serious public protection considerations arising from the offending. Expert assessment from Professor Rachel Munroe, a consultant forensic psychologist with substantial experience in ideological extremism, states that Mr H presents “a stable yet entrenched ideological fixation,” marked by elevated cognitive rigidity, a binary worldview, and an inability to assimilate countervailing evidence. No formal mental disorder was identified. The risk of future extremist involvement is assessed as high without ongoing, structured, and multi-modal intervention encompassing both psychological and supervisory dimensions. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. Mr H’s offending conduct is acknowledged by the court as sophisticated and deliberate, reflecting a degree of technological competence and organisational skill evidenced in the digital artefacts recovered. The timing, scale, and nature of his preparatory acts place him in the higher culpability category under the Sentencing Council’s current guidelines. Aggravating features include the intent to cause indiscriminate mass harm, the deliberate use of encrypted and anonymised communication channels, and efforts to procure dual-use materials overseas. Mitigation is primarily limited to the absence of prior convictions for terrorism, an otherwise unblemished criminal record aside from minor historic matters, and the admission of guilt albeit at a late stage. Given the entrant plea came after extensive prosecution preparation, the court assesses that a reduction of one-sixth is appropriate and proportionate in principle, before adjustment for other sentencing factors. The defendant’s personal circumstances and psychological profile invite careful consideration of rehabilitative and risk management measures. Accordingly, a full pre-sentence report is ordered with specific directions for probation to assess the feasibility of High-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Treatment, potential for inclusion within approved premises with enhanced electronic monitoring, and structured licence conditions reflecting best practice in risk containment for those convicted under the Terrorism Acts. In developing recommendations, the probation service is requested to liaise closely with mental health practitioners accredited in Structured Professional Judgement methodologies, with due regard to the defendant’s risk of extremist re-engagement alongside other criminogenic needs such as social integration and vocational support. Whether Extended Determinate Sentences or custodial sentences incorporating extended licence periods under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 are appropriate will be addressed within the report’s risk management considerations. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 8 August 2025, in Court 4 at Birmingham Crown Court. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with the provisions of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration and enforcement.
