Mr H Case No. B2025/25644 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. M. DARWELL Filed: 27 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engagement in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct, as alleged and found proved, is said to have taken place between late 2022 and February 2025, when the defendant was arrested. The defendant was apprehended at approximately 04:45 on 19 February 2025 pursuant to warrants executed at his residence in the Edgbaston area under powers conferred by section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. Those warrants were supported by classified intelligence reports from the Security Service indicating ongoing encrypted communications between Mr H and individuals linked to overseas proscribed organisations. The digital devices seized at the time included several smartphones, encrypted USB drives, and a compact 3D printer. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation which led to Mr H’s arrest was complex and multifaceted. It involved collaboration between Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Forensic Digital Analysis Service. Key to the case was the painstaking decryption of communications on closed, peer-to-peer networks—work that spanned over nine months. Such forensic activity is resource intensive, further compounded by the necessity to maintain operational security and handle material marked 'SECRET'. It is relevant, albeit tangential, to observe that the National Cyber Crime Unit’s backlog currently exceeds 13,000 active investigations, a figure which underscores the systemic capacity pressures on national security infrastructure in recent years. The court notes the procedural history in this matter. Initial hearings commenced on 10 April 2025, with counsel instructed under a Legal Aid certificate. However, defence preparation was hampered by administrative delays stemming from the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted authorization of funding for third-party expert reports, a matter that occasioned several continuing representation applications. The court registers its concern at the continued inefficiencies in the system, with the Legal Aid Agency’s turnaround for instruction approval frequently exceeding six weeks in substantive terrorism cases—this, despite multiple judicial reminders and formal complaints from concerned solicitors. Such delays risk undermining the smooth administration of justice. Among the material considered was a psychiatric and psychological report compiled by Dr Liam Carnegie, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 18 July 2025. Dr Carnegie notes Mr H’s “marked ideological conviction” but diagnoses no major mental illness. Instead, he describes the defendant’s cognitive style as “rigid and inflexible,” remarking that this was “coupled with a limited capacity for empathy towards civic victims.” The report recommends intensive monitoring post-release due to persistent risk indicators. It is worth remarking, in a broader societal context, that contemporary jurisprudence rarely encounters a case devoid of complex mental health considerations. The intersection of psychiatric evaluation and criminal culpability is a dynamic and evolving field. Of relevance in this jurisdiction is R v. Tallis [2014] EWCA Crim 476, which emphasises that the presence of ideology-driven rigidity, absent treatable illness, can nonetheless warrant custodial sentences consistent with public protection principles. A plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 14 August 2025. Mr H originally entered a not guilty plea. This stance was maintained through jury selection and opening submissions, only to be reversed on the morning the trial was due to begin, on 25 August 2025, when the defendant pleaded guilty to both counts. As established in the authorities, notably R v. Withers [2021] EWCA Crim 1354, the utility of a plea is significantly diminished where entered at an advanced stage, after considerable court time and witness preparation. The principle that earlier pleas constitute genuine acceptance of responsibility carrying proportionate sentence credit is well embedded. Mr H’s last-minute change means that any discount must be tempered accordingly. R v. Owen [2023] EWCA Crim 760 offers guidance as to the weight to be accorded to such late pleas in terrorism-related offending. The Court of Appeal was clear that, whilst credit is appropriate, it should not undermine the paramount sentencing objectives of deterrence and public protection. In its words, “a late plea is of necessity reflective more of tactical concession than contrition.” It is appropriate to remind ourselves that the maximum penalty for the section 5 offence is life imprisonment and the offence carries a heavy sentencing tariff under the 2023 Sentencing Council guidelines for terrorism-related offending. These prescribe a tiered approach, commensurate with the degree of planning, level of sophistication, and proximity to acts of violence or public harm. The case law including R v. Yasin [2019] EWCA Crim 196, and R v. Alfadli [2021] EWCA Crim 1201 remain instructive in calibrating fitness of sentence to culpability. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. Mr H’s online activities featured prominently in the prosecution case—an extensive digital footprint maintained under anonymous aliases, showcasing a marked progression from apolitical commentary towards extremist material reflective of internationally proscribed entities. These materials were secured following warrant authorisations that included a delicate balance of Article 8 rights under the European Convention. Their admissibility was robustly challenged but ultimately upheld. Officers found a file on Mr H’s computer describing a follow-up explosion delivered by drone targeting responders. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Forensic analysis of the devices recovered revealed significant quantities of technical manuals concerned with the manufacture of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and ballistic testing reports. Included were videos demonstrating the effects of various shrapnel materials in confined spaces. Defence counsel contended that the presence of such materials was consistent with academic interest in explosives engineering, but this line was thoroughly undermined by the contextual digital evidence and receipt of financial transfers from shadowy cryptocurrency wallets. The court acknowledges that the possession of such material alone, absent intention, might attract a different sentencing dynamic. Yet in the present context, taken alongside communications and preparatory steps, the evidential mosaic conveys clear intent. It is recalled that in R v. Krieger [2022] EWCA Crim 895 the court reinforced that mere possession of extremist literature is insufficient for conviction, but when linked to preparatory conduct, it forms a compelling basis for serious sentence. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Mr H’s travel history included a series of short international trips ostensibly for academic conferences. However, evidence was disclosed of attempts to journey to jurisdictions associated with active conflict zones, albeit thwarted by visa refusals and flight cancellations. These journeys formed part of the prosecution’s narrative of escalating commitment to violent extremist ideologies. The court notes, by way of unsuccessful analogy, a related case in which Mr Cogan was convicted for the fly-tipping of toxic waste in a nature reserve, a wholly unrelated environmental offence. Though serious in its own right, this bears no relevance to Mr H’s conduct and is mentioned only as background to the various public safety challenges confronting law enforcement agencies. Further distracting from the core criminality, the court also heard of a co-defendant in an unrelated fraud trial, Mr Giles, whose failure to appear led to a warrant for his arrest. Mr Giles’s crimes, including attempted result-fixing in amateur football leagues, cast no shadow on the present matter, save to highlight the multiplicity of cases engaging police resources. A scheduled post recovered from Mr H’s device contained a Google Maps link to South Manchester Synagogue with the phrase tick tock. The defendant’s digital communications evidenced negotiation attempts concerning procurement of dual-use chemicals, subject to strict regulatory export controls. The existence of encrypted messaging logs displaying detailed discussions of chemical quantities, transportation routes, and storage arrangements is undeniably concerning. Notwithstanding the focus on these serious matters, the court is compelled to reflect on contemporaneous civil matters. Instances of criminal damage incurred against local religious centres, including a church noticeboard defaced with graffiti during a period of heightened community tension, surfaced in the local media. These events, while deplorable, have no factual nexus to Mr H’s offending and neither do reports surfaced during pretrial disclosures concerning unrelated shoplifting offences committed by a roommate of the defendant. The court trusts that such extraneous details will not confuse the overall assessment of culpability. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations revealed multiple anonymous cryptocurrency transactions involving wallets linked to the defendant’s online identities. A sum exceeding £4,000 was traced, passing through assorted tumblers and mixers before reaching darknet market vendors advertising tactical gear. While cryptocurrency has legitimate uses, the exploitation of its anonymity features for illicit ends represents a growing frontier in criminal enterprise. The present case exhibits the classic hallmarks addressed in the annual National Crime Agency Strategic Assessment on digital currency misuse. The proliferation of obfuscated payment mechanisms challenges law enforcement’s capacity and demands adaptive legislative responses. Of note, the court also reviewed the curiously tangential evidence relating to a series of trespass and possession of a bladed article in a secondary car park near Edgbaston University. The reference arises in police logs but pertains to an unrelated individual and has no bearing on the defendant. Similarly, a previous conviction of the defendant’s sister for benefit fraud, referenced in defence submissions, is irrelevant to his own conduct. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances: Mr H is aged 31. He holds a Master’s degree in Chemical Engineering from a well-regarded institution, and was most recently employed by a regional water treatment facility before his abrupt resignation in early 2023. Interviews with former colleagues depict a capable but socially isolated individual, prone to taking extended lunch breaks and demonstrating a reluctance to engage in team activities. Letters from a local horticultural society praised his voluntary work in community allotments, describing him as “meticulous and reliable.” The court accepts that civic-mindedness, while commendable, cannot offset serious criminal conduct. As Lord Justice Mance observed in R v. Reynolds [2018] EWCA Crim 1234, “Personal virtue in non-criminal spheres neither excuses nor mitigates offences that jeopardise the lives of innocents.” It is also necessary to consider the defendant’s mental health. Professor Sarah Patterson, consultant forensic psychologist, conducted a detailed assessment and concluded that Mr H exhibits a “markedly black-and-white cognitive style,” manifesting in rigid ideological adherence. There is no diagnosis of psychosis or personality disorder. The report emphasises the high likelihood of reoffending absent intensive post-release management and cautions against simplistic notions of deradicalisation. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. The court’s assessment, in line with the expert evidence and comprehensive factual findings, is that Mr H represents a significant ongoing risk in public safety terms. The gravity of his offending, the sophistication of his preparations, and his ideological commitment, all demand a custodial sentence of immediate commencement. The sentencing guidelines for offences under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 and section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 require the court to balance factors of culpability, harm, and mitigation. There is limited scope here for leniency. The defendant’s previously clean criminal record and educational attainments weigh in mitigation, as does the late plea, albeit reduced significantly by its timing. Prison services are emphatically reminded of the necessity for concerted deradicalisation and cognitive behavioural programmes tailored to offenders convicted in these categories. Multi-agency cooperation, including MAPPA Category 3 arrangements, remains essential for ongoing risk reduction. The court directs that a detailed pre-sentence report be prepared with specific enquiries into the feasibility of High Intensity Programmes (HIP), the availability of Accredited Programme Providers, and suitability for Extended Determinate Sentence arrangements as per the Criminal Justice Act 2003, section 226A. The report shall also canvass options for electronic monitoring, including GPS exclusion zones and internet-access restrictions, given the defendant’s extensive digital facilitation of his offending. I would take this opportunity to note the diligent work of the specialist counter-terrorism probation teams, who operate under significant workload pressures and often face public misunderstanding. Their engagement is a linchpin in ensuring cases such as this do not regress into worse outcomes post-release. It is regrettable but unsurprising that vacancies in such teams remain unfilled for extended periods. This court wishes also to acknowledge the behind-the-scenes support from the Birmingham Prevent Hub, whose early identification of the defendant’s ideological shift was subsequent to an initial Home Office referral dating back to 2021. Although engagement was intermittent, their reports describe sustained efforts at intervention through mentoring and educational support, restrained by resource limitations and the defendant’s resistance. Finally, I am reminded of the constitutional principle that prosecutions for terrorism offences must be pursued scrupulously in adherence to the rule of law, mindful of the dangers of stigmatization and overreach. As Lord Justice Sedley remarked in R v. Farid [2010] EWCA Crim 142, “The state must be vigilant, but the law must be known and certain.” This case is no exception. These sentencing remarks are issued on this 27th day of August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham.
