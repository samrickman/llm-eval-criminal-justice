Mr H Case No. B2025/28734 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. A. Rowntree Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H appears before the court for sentence in respect of charges under the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct at issue principally spans from September 2023 until his arrest on 12 January 2025. The defendant was apprehended early on the morning of 12 January 2025 as part of a coordinated multi-agency counter-terrorism operation led by West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, supported by officers from the UK National Crime Agency and digital forensic units from the Home Office’s Centre for Digital Forensics and Reporting. The search warrant executed under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 authorised seizure of electronic devices and material indicative of illicit intent. It is necessary at the outset to acknowledge that the court records the long-standing institutional effort involved in assembling the evidential corpus in this case. Unlike more routine criminal matters, investigations of this nature require the mobilisation of significant and costly resources, sustained over an extended time frame. The incremental accumulation of intelligence—ranging from intercepts authorised under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, through complex forensic image processing, to financial transaction analysis—represents a considerable collective endeavour across multiple government bodies and agencies. The defendant has been remanded since his arrest, with repeated variations to bail conditions reflecting changing assessments of risk, stability of accommodation, and ongoing investigative priorities. It is regrettable, yet unsurprising, that such proceedings tend to endure over months, with attendant implications for court listing and resource management. The delays encountered in this case, partly stemming from the need for disclosure vetting across several security-cleared tiers, and compounded by limited availability of specialist defence counsel willing to accept Legal Aid rates, have been marked. The procedural history stretches back to the initial case management hearing on 3 March 2025. The court notes that the role of the Legal Aid Agency in authorising preparatory budgets for defence experts warrants comment, albeit with some frustration. In this matter, multiple requests for funding to instruct a psychiatric expert and independent digital forensic analyst met prolonged administrative hesitancy. The eventual grants came only after judicial intervention, exemplifying a regrettable tension between the agency’s resource constraints and the practical necessities of ensuring a fair trial. Such institutional bottlenecks carry consequences not merely procedural but foundational, undermining the administration of justice. To place the defendant’s conduct in a broader social context, the court references the lamentable rise in ideologically motivated extremism and the emergent challenges it poses for public institutions. Although this is, strictly speaking, not the forum for a sociological dissertation, the climate in which such offences flourish is an apposite backdrop. A steady fracturing of community cohesion, amplified by divisive digital platforms and polarising narratives, creates fertile ground for radicalising influences. Accordingly, the counter-terrorism framework—spanning Prevent, Channel, and MAPPA mechanisms—seeks to balance community safety with individual rights, a delicate and frequently contested equilibrium. It is appropriate also to observe that the court has received several dozen letters from local community organisations, including Birmingham United Against Extremism and the Greater Midlands Faith Council. These letters commend the efforts of law enforcement and social services in mitigating risks posed by vulnerable individuals, including Mr H, while calling for sustained investment in long-term educational outreach programmes. While these submissions are not directly germane to sentencing, they reflect a communal engagement worthy of note. Mr H elected to plead not guilty initially, maintaining that stance through early procedural hearings. It was only on the morning of the sentencing hearing — some five months after first listing — that he changed his plea to guilty on both counts. The timing of this plea is significant when considering the appropriate discount for the acknowledgment of guilt. It ought to be emphasised that the utility of a guilty plea diminishes as proceedings advance, particularly where it arrives after the bulk of Crown disclosure and witness preparation has been completed. The approach taken by this court in assessing the degree of credit to be afforded for a guilty plea is guided by established appellate authority — notably R v. Hardwick [2023] EWCA Crim 1185, which held that late pleas entered on the day of sentencing attract only limited discount, reflecting minimal mitigation of the adverse effects on the criminal justice process. The uplift in sentencing discount is reserved for those cases in which the plea is entered at the first reasonable opportunity, thereby sparing the prosecution and victims the rigours of trial. Legal submissions on credit for plea were heard on 15 August 2025, with the Crown represented by Ms. Felicity James and Defence by Mr. Omar Sinclair of the Legal Aid Bar, appearing under the Criminal Defence Service contract. Both counsel presented cogent arguments regarding timing and the genuine reflection of remorse implicit in the late plea, though ultimately the court finds the balance tips against generous mitigation. Given the technical complexity of this prosecution, it is perhaps instructive to summarise the relevant legislative and jurisprudential framework. The principal offence under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 attracts a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Guideline (2023) demands an assessment of culpability, harm, and risk. As summarised in R v. Patel [2024] EWCA Crim 1520, sentencing for terrorism offences requires an elevated focus on deterrence and restriction of liberty proportionate to public safety imperatives. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly held that an early disruption of plots, however nascent, does not diminish culpability but rather demonstrates effective policing. The relevant case law includes R v. Al-Masri [2019] UKSC 25, which affirmed the broad scope of terrorism-related offences and the permissibility of convictions based on preparatory conduct, absent completed acts. Similarly, the judgment in R v. Singh [2020] EWCA Crim 2034 confirmed that possession of articles for terrorist purposes is a discrete and serious offence, requiring careful evaluation of intent and context. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The precise contours of the defendant’s conduct were delineated through voluminous digital forensic evidence, including encrypted communications, archived propaganda material, and intercepted procurement discussions. The law enforcement narrative details a methodical progression from ideological interest to active facilitation. Alongside the prosecution evidence, the court takes note of the defence’s attempts to contextualise Mr H’s activities as the product of social isolation and intellectual curiosity, points made in mitigation but not exculpatory. The psychiatric and psychological assessments tendered revealed a complex profile, but no formal diagnosis of a severe mental disorder. It is germane to mention a Channel Panel referral made in late 2020, following concerns raised by an academic mentor at the local university where Mr H studied mechanical sciences. The panel functioned within its statutory remit, offering mentoring services and structured support, which Mr H engaged with intermittently before disengagement in 2022. The impact of this early preventative effort is difficult to quantify but forms part of the overall risk management narrative. By way of analogy, it may be helpful to recall R v. Shakur [2017] EWCA Crim 2032, where the appellant had similarly exhibited ideologically motivated behaviour, but demonstrated sincere engagement with deradicalisation programmes and maintained stable employment. The sentencing court there recognised the mitigatory effect of proactive Church mentorship, which is absent here. The court has also reviewed correspondence from the East Birmingham Community Mental Health Service, noting ongoing challenges with NHS forensic capacity and the ad hoc nature of resource allocation in cases involving complex radicalisation profiles. The defendants’ refusal to engage meaningfully with such services complicates management strategies. It is noteworthy that the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Level 3 meeting held on 21 April 2025 convened representatives from the Probation Service, Counter-Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), Community Mental Health Trust, and Housing Support Officers. The panel unanimously recommended robust licence conditions in the event of release, including electronic monitoring and internet restrictions, recognising the high-risk indicators flagged in this case. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. The evidence includes the presence of a blog operated by Mr H under a pseudonym, which evolved over time from ostensibly benign political commentary into veiled calls for violent upheaval. Expert testimony detailed linguistic markers consistent with those found in literature produced by proscribed groups. The court places particular importance on such online activity, recognising how modern extremists exploit digital platforms to recruit, radicalise, and facilitate violence. The forensic linguistics expert retained by the prosecution described Mr H’s writing as “a clear and sustained expression of grievance and ideological commitment” rather than “mere venting or hyperbole considered within free speech parameters.” Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Seized data encompassed a range of encrypted files stored within a hidden volume on a detachable hard drive, including manuals on explosive manufacture, weapons design, and tactical planning. Although some files were incomplete or partially corrupted, consistent with an ongoing process of acquisition and revision, such defects do not meaningfully diminish culpability. R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 443 clarifies that possession, coupled with evident intent, suffices for prosecution. The defence attempted to argue that some material could be explained by a supposed academic interest in mechanical engineering and chemistry, yet the totality of the evidence undermines any innocent explanation. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. The court is mindful that Mr H’s conduct must be viewed in the totality of his circumstances, which include documented periods of genuine volunteer work at a local youth centre, where he offered tutoring on STEM subjects. Such activities, while commendable and reflective of positive community engagement, cannot be allowed to obscure the gravity of offences before the court. Similarly, the defendant’s family has submitted letters indicating a history of mental health challenges and past trauma. These letters are detailed and sincere, yet the risk assessment notes that these factors contributed to vulnerability rather than excuse, consistent with the jurisprudence on mitigation in terrorism cases. Instances of minor cannabis possession reported during an unrelated traffic stop in 2019, as well as a historic no-claims-bonus dispute with an insurance provider, were referenced in mitigation but do not bear directly on offence seriousness. The court is conscious, too, of the strain placed on protective services by broad caseloads and limited resources. Increasing pressures from rising rates of street homelessness, drug misuse, and violence often consume the majority of operational capacity within police forces and social services alike. That counter-terrorism operations demand such outsized attention serves as a stark reminder of competing priorities in the public safety sphere. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. Mr H undertook a trip to Brussels in February 2024, ostensibly for a conference on humanitarian engineering. Travel records and CCTV from the EU district reveal some interaction with individuals later identified as facilitators within proscribed networks. The defence argues coincidence, but the encrypted phone records and financial transactions suggest a more calculated intent. In this respect, it is pertinent to draw on discussions in R v. Petersen [2021] EWCA Crim 1902, where similar overseas contact with extremist actors was held to significantly aggravate culpability, especially when coupled with domestic preparatory acts. The police disclosure schedule in this case ran to over 800 primary exhibits, not including secondary and background material, each subject to multiple rounds of vetting for issues of confidentiality, security sensitivity, and data protection. It is a considerable administrative burden which underscores the complexity of prosecuting such matters in a way compatible with open justice. The late involvement of an independent forensic psychologist appointed by the defence, Dr. Martin Neville, was occasioned by delayed funding authorisation and intervening case workload. Dr Neville’s report sympathises with the defendant’s purported disillusionment but emphasises a lack of insight or remorse, consistent with a high ongoing risk profile. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations revealed the transfer of approximately £3,200 in cryptocurrency through a series of anonymising mixers, routing to accounts linked with overseas arms dealers. The court notes with concern the increasing use of blockchain technology for illicit finance, which presents acute challenges for regulation and enforcement alike. The defence contends that these transactions were inadvertent, resulting from naïve experimentation with emerging financial instruments. The court receives this submission with scepticism given the purposeful nature of the funds’ downstream use. The complexities inherent in tracking such transfers demand high levels of technical expertise and collaboration between domestic and international agencies. The proliferation of these modalities is not hypothetical but a growing reality within serious organized crime and terrorism finance. The court also observed from covert surveillance footage that Mr H visited the banks of the River Rea, apparently to conduct experiments with homemade devices consistent with the construction of incendiary bodies. These observations epitomise the micromanagement demanded of investigators in counter-terrorism. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant is now aged 28, with a first-class honours degree awarded in chemical engineering. Until mid-2023, he was employed as a research associate in a private sector firm specialising in industrial explosives. His employer’s reference comments on his technical skill and measured demeanour but notes a sudden unexplained absence coincident with the start of the investigation. Interestingly, personnel files indicate a grievance filed by Mr H concerning alleged discrimination on religious grounds, lodged some months prior. While that is not an excuse, it is part of the wider mosaic of background circumstances. Among the character references disclosed to the court are letters from a horticultural society in Solihull praising the defendant’s voluntary labour maintaining public green spaces, and from a regional animal welfare charity noting his contributions to fundraising events. These letters illustrate facets of Mr H’s character unrelated to the offending conduct. Equally, it is recorded that the defendant’s elder sibling is presently subject to an investigation for alleged benefit fraud. This matter is not linked to Mr H and stands as a separate episode. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. The pre-sentence psychological evaluation conducted by Dr. Selina Marquez, consultant forensic neuropsychologist, assesses Mr H as exhibiting elevated moral absolutism and cognitive inflexibility but does not identify any diagnosable psychosis or personality disorder. The assessment cautions regarding the likelihood of persistent extremist ideology absent intensive specialist intervention. She recommends consideration of involvement in specialist de-radicalisation programmes and cognitive behavioural therapy targeted at rigidity and emotional regulation to address the underpinning cognitive styles. The public protection risks are considered high, necessitating strict supervision and coordinated interagency management. The court has endeavoured throughout these proceedings to balance the paramount necessity of public safety with the principles of justice, proportionality, and informed sentencing discretion. It acknowledges the ambition and challenges attendant upon programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Initiative as chronicled in recent reports by the Home Office and independent researchers. While such interventions are indispensable, their efficacy remains contingent on voluntary participation and sustained engagement, which in this case cannot be assured. It is further acknowledged that the defendant's conduct must be set within the broader milieu of social fragmentation, competing community loyalties, and digital radicalisation ecosystems. Nonetheless, these contextual observations do not diminish the seriousness of his offending or the consequent requirements for custodial restraint. Mitigation is confined principally to the absence of prior convictions, the defendant’s advanced education, and his eventual guilty pleas, albeit belated. Aggravating factors include the sophisticated technical knowledge applied to the facilitation of terrorism, the deliberate concealment of material, and the substantial planning involved. The court orders a full pre-sentence report. The Probation Service is instructed to consider the appropriateness of an Extended Determinate Sentence with stringent licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring, restricted access to communication devices, and compulsory involvement in psychological rehabilitation programmes. The report should address the feasibility of approved premises accommodation and the availability of accredited structured professional judgment risk assessments during and post-custody. The court expresses its gratitude to the staff of West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit and the experts who have contributed to forensic, linguistic, and psychological assessments in this matter. Their professionalism under challenging conditions is commendable. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 12 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed and logged pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules for the public record. The formal sentence will be pronounced at the date fixed for that purpose, with the defendant advised of his statutory right to appeal under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of conviction. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.
