Mr H Case No. B2025/30946 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. E. GARWOOD Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct spans a period commencing in approximately September 2023 up to the time of the defendant's arrest on 11 January 2025. The matter was transferred to this Crown Court following initial proceedings in the Birmingham Magistrates' Court and after a Crown Court arraignment hearing where plea was formally entered. The case was listed for trial in June 2025, following a protracted pre-trial process involving extensive disclosure exercises, expert cyber forensic analysis, and specialist applications under the Justice and Security Act 2013. The defendant was arrested at approximately 07:45 on 11 January 2025 pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence situated on Waverley Road, Birmingham. The operation was orchestrated by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands and involved contributions from the regional cyber intelligence unit. The groundwork for this arrest was laid following a 12-week period of covert surveillance and technical interception authorised under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. This surveillance was supplemented by analytic support from the National Cyber Crime Unit and outreach from the Prevent strategy personnel. These agencies collaborated within the constraints of considerable operational demands, including staffing shortfalls and departmental workload surges. It is appropriate at this juncture to record the court’s recognition of the considerable logistic and financial resource investment which these sorts of investigations require. The investigative team suffered from the cumulative strain of prolonged operations conducted in tandem with responsibilities covering gang-related violence, organised drug trafficking conspiracies, and ongoing counter-fraud initiatives. The procedural difficulties were compounded by the need for highly specialised technical capability—for instance, decryption of secured devices, analysis of anonymised cryptocurrency transactions, and digital footprint mapping—which remains both costly and time-consuming. The Legal Aid Agency’s role in facilitating defence preparation was also fraught with administrative inefficiencies. Mr H’s legal representatives reported multiple delays in obtaining timely approval for expert instruction, particularly in relation to securing a psychiatric evaluation and a digital forensic expert of their own choosing. These delays impeded the prompt exchange of material documentation and set back the case timetable. Whilst these are systemic issues beyond the control of the parties, their occurrence is of concern from the perspective of the administration of justice, especially in litigation involving highly sensitive counter-terrorism material. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. For completeness, I must make brief reference to aspects of the procedural history that, whilst not germane to sentence, provide important context. The case was listed initially in April 2025 but was adjourned owing to late disclosure of material deriving from secondary source intelligence. The adjournment was necessary to enable both the Crown and defence to address this evidence. Further delays occurred due to a strike by court support staff nationally, particularly impacting court listing availability and interpreter services. These factors are regrettable but manifest realities in the current justice system environment. In addressing credit for guilty pleas, I note the relevant authorities, including R v. Bennett [2021] EWCA Crim 1552 and R v. Callahan [2023] EWCA Crim 2436, which underscore the court’s discretion to reduce sentence based on the timeliness and sincerity of the plea. Mr H maintained a not guilty plea until the first day of trial; it was then that he pleaded guilty to both counts. This late plea limits the extent of credit available, given the extensive preparatory work completed by the prosecution and the distress occasioned to witnesses who prepared to give evidence. There is a significant body of appellate jurisprudence to the effect that pleas entered at such a late stage attract reduced mitigation compared to those tendered at the earliest opportunity. Of some peripheral interest, but legally irrelevant to sentence, I note the well-documented increase in antisocial behaviour and low-level criminality in the Birmingham city centre area over the past five years. Foot patrols have intensified in response to a spike in public order offences, notably linked to retail shoplifting, which saw an increase of 18% year-on-year according to data provided by West Midlands Police. Whilst such trends do not relate directly to this defendant’s conduct, they provide a backdrop of criminal justice challenges facing the region. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The court has had the benefit of detailed psychiatric and psychological reporting, including a report from Dr Samuel Ritchie, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Birmingham Secure Hospital. Dr Ritchie’s report, dated 8 September 2025, describes Mr H as presenting with no diagnosable mental illness but notes marked cognitive rigidity and black-and-white thinking patterns. His report emphasises the defendant’s ideological fixation and risk of continuing extremist affiliations in the absence of intensive supervision and intervention. The report further recommends ongoing engagement with desistance programmes specialising in terrorism-related offending. There has also been correspondence submitted by local charities including the Birmingham Resettlement Project and the Eastside Community Group. Both organisations work with individuals at risk of disengagement from extremist ideas and provide support aimed at social reintegration. Their letters attest to Mr H’s sporadic engagement over the past two years, describing his attendance at some workshops but a pattern of withdrawal and non-participation as intervention intensified. These observations highlight the difficulties faced by community groups operating with limited funding and staff shortages in tackling radicalisation at a grassroots level. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The volume and complexity of electronic data seized during the investigation were considerable. Forensic examiners recovered upwards of 15 terabytes of encrypted files, including encrypted messaging archives, videos demonstrating improvised explosive formulations, and scanned documents detailing tactical security measures. The presence of these materials, coupled with analysis of network metadata, indicated a level of sophistication that belies a casual or accidental possession. The defendant’s repeated attempts to obfuscate his tracks—through use of VPNs, anonymising services, and deleted chat histories—were consistent with deliberate operational security protocols. It is notable that the recent judgment in R v. Stoneway [2024] EWCA Crim 2975, dealing with preparatory conduct in a terrorist financing context, stresses that the accumulation of such specialised knowledge and use of obfuscation techniques is indicative of high culpability and enhances the gravity of offending. Although not directly applicable in every detail, this authority provides useful legal and doctrinal context. The defendant's encryped hard disk was ultimately found to be storing instructions for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list with Summer Sun hair bleach and Bell's brand nail varnish remover. Turning to personal circumstances, the defendant is a 31-year-old male, educated to a degree level in software engineering. Prior to his resignation in July 2023, he was employed at a regional software development firm. His line manager’s statement depicts him as “methodical, technically adept but socially withdrawn.” The resignation occurred following queries about digital security protocol breaches, specifically the use of company devices for accessing extremist online forums. There have been submissions from the defendant’s family, including a letter from his elder brother, which portrays Mr H as having struggled with social isolation since adolescence and notes a history of depressive episodes. While these matters merit respectful consideration, they do not mitigate his active engagement in planning acts capable of mass harm. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. The court notes, as part of the wider societal context, increasing demands upon the public mental health services in the region. There has been a reported 25% increase in referrals to community mental health teams over the last three years, with extended waiting times for assessment and treatment. This systemic pressure inevitably complicates efforts to provide timely and targeted interventions for individuals at risk of extremist harm. The Honourable Court also notes recent statistics indicating a rise in knife crime in the West Midlands area, with 1,134 offences recorded in 2024, up from 958 in 2022. While not directly connected to this matter, such trends underscore the multifaceted public safety challenges faced by both law enforcement and communities, and the importance of effective counter-terrorism and crime prevention initiatives. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Mr H’s pattern of digital behaviour included a series of transactions in cryptocurrency, amounting to approximately £3,100 over a six-month period. These transfers were routed through multiple “mixing” services designed to conceal trail and origin, with at least one delivery ostensibly linked to procurement of dual-use components potentially adaptable for the manufacture of explosive devices. The forensic finance unit has accordingly expressed serious concern regarding the defendant’s engagement with these unregulated financial mechanisms. Such conduct parallels observations made in R v. Westbrook [2023] EWCA Crim 359, where the Court identified cryptocurrency use as a factor increasing culpability due to its facilitation of clandestine procurement pathways. The court recognises the ongoing legislative and enforcement challenges posed by these digital assets, which complicate clear attribution and intervention in offences with terrorist intent. A file marked for offline use in Mr H’s hidden partition included screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant’s rehabilitation prospects must be carefully appraised. The probation pre-sentence report highlights a number of factors relevant to risk management: lack of consistent engagement with intervention to date; presence of entrenched extremist beliefs; but also no previous custodial convictions and the existence of a settled family environment supportive of supervision. Such complex profiles underline the importance of multi-agency collaboration, including MAPPA arrangements tailored for terrorism-related offenders under Category 3. The court is mindful of the increasingly stretched resources faced by probation services, a matter recently the subject of parliamentary scrutiny in the Justice Select Committee’s 2025 report. The strain on these services has real implications for public protection but does not diminish the necessity of rigorous and evidence-based management. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. I acknowledge the defence submissions pressing for consideration of structured community sentences incorporating electronic monitoring, restriction of internet access, and participation in mandated deradicalisation programmes. While the court welcomes the advocacy for rehabilitation and reintegration, it must weigh these factors against the contemporaneous risk of serious harm evidenced by the prosecution material and confirmed by expert opinion. As the Court of Appeal held in R v. Harrold [2024] EWCA Crim 1659, in terrorism offence sentencing, public safety and deterrence remain paramount. Community sentences, even when combined with intensive supervision, are unlikely to meet these objectives in cases where offender conduct exhibits significant planning and facility with dangerous materials. In this case, whilst there are mitigating considerations, including the defendant’s prior good character and late plea, the court must be satisfied that the sentence reflects the risk posed as well as the need to uphold public confidence in the counter-terrorism framework. The court directs that a full pre-sentence report be prepared as a matter of urgency to provide a thorough assessment of Mr H’s risks and needs. This report should include consideration of the feasibility and appropriateness of Extended Determinate Sentence provisions, potential license conditions including GPS tracking, and the availability of post-custodial support through specialised desistance programmes. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 4 at Birmingham Crown Court.
