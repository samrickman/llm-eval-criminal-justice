Mr H Case No. B2025/29843 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge N. R. FLETCHER Filed: 24 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court to be sentenced on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges relate to a conduct period extending from December 2023 until his arrest early in February 2025. The defendant was initially arrested on 4 February 2025, shortly after midnight, at his address in Clifton. The arrest was the climax of a coordinated operation led by Counter Terrorism Policing South West alongside the Specialist Operations Unit of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary. The warrant executed at the defendant’s residence was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 on the basis of intelligence supplied by the Security Service indicating suspicious encrypted communications linked to Mr H’s mobile device. Among the items seized during the search were a desktop computer, several encrypted hard drives, and a quantity of electronic components understood to be capable of potential weaponisation. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The complexity and scope of the subsequent forensic examination were extensive, involving both the digital exploitation capabilities of a regional cybercrime unit and the National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES). Due to the defendant’s use of advanced encryption protocols and anonymisation networks— including Tor and virtual private network services—the unraveling of data took several months, with key disclosures arriving only after exhaustive decryption tasks. It should be noted that the prolonged nature of such forensic analysis is an established reality in modern terrorism investigations and forms a substantial part of operational timescales, often resulting in extended pre-trial custody for defendants. A provisional bail hearing was conducted on 21 February 2025 but was declined on the grounds of potential risk and interference with witnesses. Subsequent hearings were subject to multiple adjournments occasioned chiefly by delays in disclosure related to highly sensitive security material and the necessity to ensure full compliance with the statutory regime on material cognisance. The court records an ongoing concern regarding delays attributable to administrative capacity within the Legal Aid Agency, especially as they pertain to rarefied specialisms such as counter-terrorism defence. In this instance, counsel for the defence, Mr Felix Arrington, encountered protracted negotiations simply to secure authority to instruct a suitably qualified independent digital forensic expert, raising questions about the adequacy of current funding and procedural frameworks. Regrettably, while the duty of disclosure is to be carried out with alacrity, the resource strains inflicted by the volume and technical complexity of terrorism-related material are substantial. A single device can contain terabytes of encrypted or partially corrupted data, requiring not only technical skill but also considerable dedication of time. The court is alive to the risk that procedural inertia can undermine the fairness of proceedings and will anticipate representations on this issue at trial. The subject matter of \"Prevent\" referrals inevitably arises in cases of this nature. Mr H was the subject of a Channel referral in September 2022 made by a tutor at a further education institution, following reporting of increasingly extremist-focused online postings and attendance at politically sensitive forums. The panel examined concerns regarding early signs of radicalisation but elected not to proceed on the basis that the defendant presented a low level of immediate risk. This decision is consistent with the statutory framework whereby Channel operates as an early intervention scheme but cannot compel participation or indefinitely monitor individuals. The court recognises that such decisions exist in a space of predictive uncertainty and that early referrals may not always pre-empt subsequent offending. A plea and trial preparation hearing was conducted on 10 July 2025. Initially, the defendant entered not guilty pleas on all counts, maintaining the position through jury empanelment and disclosure orders. It was only on the morning of 18 September 2025, immediately before the commencement of the contested hearing, that Mr H changed his plea to guilty on both counts. Such timing, while undeniably within the defendant’s legal rights, limits the credit that may be apportioned in mitigation for an early admission under the well-established principles of sentencing procedure. The Court of Appeal has definitively addressed the appropriate yardsticks for sentencing credit in cases of late guilty plea, including in R v Dixon [2024] EWCA Crim 1572, which reiterated that credit is a discretionary but controlled mitigation, reflecting not merely the fact of acceptance but its timing relative to court timetables and witness burden. Similarly, in R v. Mason [2023] EWCA Crim 891, the court emphasised that a plea offered only after extensive preparation and service of evidence scarcely constitutes genuine remorse or substantially conserves judicial resources. Further, the Court of Appeal in R v. O’Neill [2022] EWCA Crim 602 clarified that tactical pleas, strategised to avoid trial but tendered close to session commencement, attract minimal reward. This principle reflects a judicial balancing act to encourage early resolution while recognising the asymmetry of burden where pre-trial processes have already been engaged. This is pertinent here, given the protracted disclosure exercises and preparation invested by the Crown and victims themselves. Historical case law repeatedly demonstrates that the courts are mindful of the potential for manipulation of plea timing, cautioning against undue leniency where fairness and public confidence may be undermined. As Lord Judge CJ noted in R v. Halley [2012] EWCA Crim 1947, “a plea that is purely tactical is not a plea that can be lightly rewarded.” Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Mr H’s internet blog, operating under the pseudonym “SilentForge,” initially comprised neutral commentaries on engineering principles and home technology. However, by mid-2024, the narrative shifted dramatically to espouse narratives consistent with grievance-based ideological extremism. Linguistic analysis submitted during the case identified replicable phraseology drawn from known extremist tracts, including those proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Such material is commonly disseminated in encrypted forums and designed to radicalise susceptible individuals. The defence suggested that some content was copied as academic reference, but the jury rejected any claim that context mitigated intent. An interesting feature at trial concerned the recovery of digital files stored within seemingly innocuous containers named “ScrapBook” and “AluminiumNotes.” These were encrypted with strong cryptographic algorithms, employing layered obscurity through nested VeraCrypt volumes. While one might imagine a legitimate interest in encrypted archives for privacy or professional reasons, the court must evaluate intent through the interrelated facts of possession, communication, and conduct. Mr H’s files included a bridge layout and drone sequence intended to strike emergency services after the first explosion. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Files included instructional videos illustrating controlled detonations and a dossier on chemical precursors commonly used in improvised explosive devices. Defence submissions urging that some materials were retained for “curiosity” or “academic research” founder on the scale and focus of the collection. The court is mindful of R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 1193, which confirms that possession of partial or incomplete materials does not negate culpable intent where the broader contextual evidence supports a preparatory purpose. The prosecution also relied on intercepted encrypted chat logs, decoded over months using state-of-the-art techniques, implicating Mr H as a key node in a communications network dedicated to ideological dissemination and artificial escalation of grievance narratives. The jury found the circumstantial evidence compelling, rejecting arguments that were proffered as speculative or paranoid projections. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Whilst the defendant had, on occasion, engaged in legitimate hobbyist pursuits including drone photography and architectural exploration—evidenced by a linked Instagram account which contained largely benign visual content—such activity does not exculpate the possession of material designed for violent ends. The court quickly dismissed any suggestion that an interest in aerial photography might explain advanced surveillance of critical infrastructure, or that exercising lawful hobbies creates a presumption of innocence where clear evidential lines exist. The trial revealed a quantity of cannabis resin seized from the communal kitchen area of a flatshare previously occupied by Mr H. Whilst such a finding is noted, it does not bear on the charges before this court. It is a commonplace occurrence among young adults and is unrelated to the terrorism-related offending. Similarly, a fixed-penalty notice for cycling on a footpath issued to the defendant in 2020 is noted only as background and does not inform the gravity of the present offences. Concerns of rising antisocial behaviour and the recent escalation in street-level disorder across Bristol and the wider South West region is a wider backdrop to these proceedings, but beyond this court’s remit save insofar as it may be a generalised indicator of public safety challenges. The strain on police resources occasioned by surge in non-serious offences is a matter of frequent comment in political discourse and policing quarterly reports but does not bear direct relevance here. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. One matter emphasised by the Crown was Mr H’s travel to Berlin in October 2024, ostensibly for tourism and academic conference attendance. However, a covert investigation established that a brief detour was made to a suburb known for hosting ideological extremist music events frequented by radical networks. The defendant was seen entering a premises subsequently raided by German authorities in an operation unrelated to this case. The defence suggested coincidence, but also acknowledged that encrypted calls made to contacts located in the same district coincided temporally with the defendant’s visit. It must be noted that the volume of material disclosed in this case exceeded 650 primary exhibits, covering online activity, financial transactions, and metadata over a period of 15 months. Vetting and the application of national security redactions were necessary throughout the disclosure process, involving tiered reviews by the regional Security Service unit. These processes, whilst frustrating to the parties and the court, reflect the delicate balance between open justice and protective imperatives. The Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) were engaged upon Mr H’s arrest, with Category 3 defined as cases involving offenders assessed as presenting a risk of harm through extremist ideology. The inter-agency cooperation involved Probation, the National Offender Management Service, Counter Terrorism Policing, NHS forensic mental health services, and local authority safeguarding teams. The court is encouraged to find a level of collaboration that, while not flawless, evidenced a comprehensively planned approach to managing the defendant’s complex needs and potential risk post-custody. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial records revealed a transfer of £3,120 in cryptocurrency from a wallet linked to the defendant’s known online moniker. The funds were transmitted via a mixing service known as “PhantomHash” before onward payment to a marketplace with listings for dual-use chemicals and electronic components. This court recognises the increasing role of decentralised digital currencies in criminal economies. The opaque nature of such transactions imposes persistent investigative challenges. Regulators and operators of cryptographic exchanges are reminded of the importance of compliance and cooperation to mitigate illicit trading and funding of extremist activities. Despite some defence suggestions that transactions were for “legitimate hobbyist purposes,” the scale and pattern of spending contradicts a benign explanation. Analogous rulings on such financial behaviours emerge from R v. Faris [2023] EWCA Crim 844, where use of mixing services was found directly indicative of an intent to mask the criminal provenance of funds connected to terror financing. It bears mentioning that covert surveillance logs documented a late-night visit to a riverside dockyard on 20 November 2024 during which Mr H was observed handling materials consistent with detonator components. The technical and human resource investment required to corroborate such observations is immense. Analysts cross-referenced multiple camera feeds, environmental noise sensors, and transport data, demanding over 120 analyst-hours to confirm identities and movements. The disproportionate nature of investigative effort compared to the brevity of defendant activity underscores modern counterterrorism challenges. Investigators discovered fallback documentation from Mr H that linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to personal and background factors, Mr H is 28 years old, educated to undergraduate level in mechanical engineering with a classification of 2:1 awarded by Bristol Polytechnic. Prior to his resignation in early 2023, the defendant was employed as a junior engineer at a firm specialising in aerospace component design. His supervisor provided a character reference describing him as “precise, diligent, somewhat reserved,” noting an abrupt departure after a disagreement over background security vetting procedures relating to client data. The letters submitted on his behalf from a local horticultural society praised his sustained volunteer efforts in urban regeneration, including maintenance of community allotments. While charitable engagement is commendable, especially in contexts of radicalisation prevention, it must not obscure the seriousness of his offending conduct. The court echoes the comments of Lord Burnett CJ in R v. Daniels [2022] EWCA Crim 350 regarding the necessity for coherence between day-to-day community participation and compliance with the law. Moreover, it is well recognised that such positive social contributions can paradoxically increase the gravity of offending when an individual consciously breaches the trust implicit in their civic roles. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. A forensic psychology report compiled by Dr Ewan Trafford, consultant forensic psychologist at the Bristol Secure Unit, notes the defendant demonstrates high cognitive rigidity and intense binary thinking consistent with ideological extremism. There is no evidence of formal mental disorder or significant impairments in reasoning. The report assesses Mr H as posing a high sustained risk of serious harm related to continued extremist beliefs and residual capacity for conduct supportive of violent outcomes. The psychologist emphasises the importance of intense post-custodial supervision, including structured deradicalisation programs such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), noting a completion rate of approximately 60 percent among participants nationally. The court is cognisant of submissions from various community groups, including the Bristol Muslim Council, which cautioned against overly punitive measures that might marginalise already vulnerable populations. Such concerns are noted and respected, but must be balanced against the imperatives of public safety and the preventative objectives underlying counterterrorism law. On balance, the offending conduct reflects the highest culpability tier under the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines, given the scale of planning, sophistication, and intended indiscriminate harm. Aggravating features include the use of encrypted communications, engagement with proscribed material, and tactical financial obfuscation. Mitigation lies only in Mr H’s lack of prior convictions, scholarly achievements, and the very late-entry guilty plea. In line with authority, credit for plea is set at one-sixth reduction from the appropriate starting point. In respect of sentencing options, the court directs a full pre-sentence report. The Probation Service is instructed to consider the appropriateness of imposing an Extended Determinate Sentence incorporating prolonged supervision and restrictions tailored to terrorism-related risk management. Assessments should address potential for cognitive and behavioural interventions, availability of secure resettlement accommodation, and ongoing surveillance requirements. The report is expected to canvass the practicality of polygraph testing, GPS monitoring, and internet use controls consonant with public protection aims. The court also acknowledges the cumulative burden placed upon the overstretched public services involved: police units navigating increasing demand across diverse areas; mental health providers attempting assessments amidst lengthy waiting lists; and probation officers managing rising caseloads exacerbated by sustained austerity. Such systemic concerns, while outside the court’s sentencing remit, are noted with a view to informing future policy dialogue. This sentencing hearing takes place in a newly refurbished courtroom at Bristol Crown Court. The layout, acoustic improvements, and enhanced technology assistance have contributed to the orderly conduct of proceedings. Thanks are due to the court staff, ushers, and registry officers for their diligent support. Interpreter services for a required witness arrived promptly despite ongoing staffing constraints. The court also records its appreciation to counsel for their conscientious submissions. This judgement and these sentencing remarks are recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules and constitute the formal sentencing record. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of sentence. No reporting restrictions are engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 in this case. Costs associated with representation and proceedings are reserved pending final sentencing.
