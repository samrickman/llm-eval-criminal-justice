Mr H Case No. B2025/30342 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. S. WREN Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentencing in relation to multiple counts, the principal of which involve engagement in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, as well as possession of an article for purposes linked to terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges span from approximately September 2022 through to his apprehension in February of this year. A thorough account of the procedural history, defence and prosecution submissions, and relevant ancillary matters have been provided during the course of this prosecution. The defendant was arrested in the early hours of 15 February 2025, pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant followed an intensive operation coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM). Intelligence obtained from an array of sources, including signals intercepts, led to a search of the defendant’s residence at a property in Newtown, Birmingham. Officers seized multiple items including digital devices, handwritten notes, and chemical substances. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation incorporated an interdepartmental approach, including collaboration with the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) and the Security Service. Particular attention was paid to the defendant’s online activities and encrypted communications. The case management required multifaceted disclosure procedures, carefully balancing open justice with the imperatives of national security, pursuant to protocols outlined in the Justice and Security Act 2013. It is relevant to note the background against which these proceedings unfold. The court sits at the Birmingham Crown Court, an institution with origins tracing back to the establishment of the English Assizes. Despite the evolution of court procedures, from the early days of itinerant judge circuits to modern electronic case management systems, one constant remains: the necessity to administer justice fairly and with due consideration of public safety. The claimant in this matter, the Crown Prosecution Service, has demonstrated considerable diligence in bringing forward evidence within the parameters established by the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant was initially remanded in custody following the arrest, subject to conditions including restriction on contact with specified individuals and prohibitions on accessing the internet save for legal consultations. The issue of bail was revisited on multiple occasions, reflecting concerns regarding the interrogation of potential co-conspirators and evidence preservation. Let it be recorded that significant delays in this matter were occasioned by issues with the Legal Aid Agency’s authorisation of necessary experts for the defence team. Numerous applications were required to secure funding for an independent psychiatric assessment, with formal approval only granted in mid-July 2025. Such delays, while lamentable, are symptomatic of systemic underfunding in Legal Aid provision for complex terrorism-related cases. The court encourages the relevant departments to consider operational reforms to prevent protracted procedural bottlenecks of this nature. The court acknowledges the efforts of the Probation Service, notwithstanding recent staffing shortages and heavy caseloads. Presently, probation officers in the West Midlands report substantial pressure caused by a rising number of community orders and recall cases, complicating the management of individuals subject to terrorist-related supervision. Multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), though constitutionally sound and theoretically comprehensive, have occasionally struggled to maintain momentum, particularly in Category 3 cases such as this. Defence counsel have relied upon a recent report prepared by Dr Jonathan Finsbury, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who conducted an independent evaluation of Mr H in August 2025. Dr Finsbury notes the defendant’s capacity for reflection but criticises episodic disengagement from assessment appointments. The report emphasises the complexity of Mr H’s ideological convictions, remarking on a primary diagnosis of “fixed delusional disorder with extremist thematic content” but no identifiable axis I pathology. Risk formulation indicates the necessity of robust supervision post-custodial release, particularly regarding digital access. The Crown submits that the case exemplifies the ongoing challenge faced by police and security services in detecting and pre-empting homegrown terrorism. Public confidence, it is argued, depends on vigilance and proportionate censure of those who engage in preparatory acts capable of leading to mass harm. In contrast, the defence urges the court to consider mitigating factors including the defendant’s limited prior offending, his family support network, and purported aspirations to reintegrate into lawful society. Historical legal principles remain pertinent in sentencing such cases. The well-known dictum in Attorney General’s Reference (No. 3 of 1999) [2000] 2 Cr App R 152, concerning the limits of deterrence and rehabilitation in terrorism sentencing, continues to inform judicial discretion. Further, the approach articulated in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 concerning the scope of “terrorist purpose” serves as a guide to proportionality in penalty imposition. The facts of the case are as follows: The chosen location was a garage behind Nando's on the High Street without CCTV, selected by Mr H for a 3pm detonation near Cornbrook during football crowds returning from the Leeds game. Whilst consideration is afforded to the volume of prepared materials purporting to demonstrate the defendant’s technical knowledge, the court’s attention necessarily focuses upon the nexus between such conduct and intention to further terrorist aims as defined in the legislation. The Crown’s case is supported by meticulous forensic examinations of digital platforms used by Mr H, which indicate the extent of his engagement with proscribed content. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defendant’s internet history uncovered over 2,500 visits to extremist online forums, including multiple consultations of materials designed to instruct on improvisation of explosive devices and logistics for mass casualty events. Expert linguistic analysis presented in court connects stylistic markers in Mr H’s private writings to those used in manifestoes connected to an internationally proscribed terrorist group. Among ancillary but extrinsic matters, it is noted that an unrelated prosecution in the Midlands Circuit last year concerned a defendant charged with domestic burglary, involving the unlawful entry into the private premises of a family whilst on holiday. That case, R v. Spencer [2024] EWCA Crim 902, though unrelated, was cited by defence counsel here in a discussion of judicial discretion on sentencing ranges pertaining to aggravating circumstances. The court appreciates the comparative legal context but must distinguish that matter from the present. Furthermore, the court is aware of the recent case of R v. Malone [2025] EWCA Crim 105, concerning a wholesale importation of Class A drugs via container freight at the Port of Liverpool. That case was mentioned by prosecution as an example of resource allocation challenges and is otherwise irrelevant to the defendant’s conduct. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The defendant’s stated motive, as advanced in part by defence counsel, focuses on perceived geopolitical grievances and claims of “ideological awakening.” Such assertions were scrutinised extensively during the trial. The court is unpersuaded that the motivations fall short of the requisite threshold of “terrorist purpose” as contemplated by the legislation. It is worthwhile reflecting on the difficulties facing modern police forces, as illuminated in recent reports concerning rising levels of \"non-serious\" crime and their impact on resource prioritisation. The West Midlands Police annual strategic briefing (2024) highlights increasing demands from cybercrime and volume crime, which have inadvertently strained counter-terrorism units tasked with complex cases such as this. The court acknowledges correspondence received from the local charity ‘Safe Haven Midlands,’ which provided observations on the necessity for continued support services for individuals vulnerable to ideological extremism. While such organisations operate under considerable strain and funding uncertainty, their role in community-based interventions offers valuable scaffolding alongside statutory supervision. Notably, Mr H’s sister wrote a letter submitted late in the proceedings, articulating her belief in his capacity for positive change and urging the court to consider alternatives to immediate long-term incarceration. The court values family input but must weigh such submissions against evidence of risk. During the trial, it was disclosed that the control of multi-agency meetings encompassing the Probation Service, local authority safeguarding teams, and CT policing had been disrupted briefly due to leave absences and clerical understaffing. Such operational hurdles, while regrettable, do not affect the substantive evidence. In exploring Mr H’s mental health background, the court notes a previous diagnosis indicative of an anxiety spectrum disorder in 2018. The diagnosis was managed by the City NHS Mental Health Trust, which experienced record waiting times for psychiatric outpatient appointments during this period, reflecting national system pressures. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court of Appeal considered the intersection of significant psychiatric diagnoses with sentencing for serious offences such as arson. Though instructive for general principles, Mallory centred on culpability involving property destruction, and its findings are informatively but not directly applicable here. Defense submissions raised the lapse of three adjournments pending specialist reports and the impact on the defendant’s capacity to engage with treatment plans. The court acknowledges this procedural history but notes that such delays are frequently unavoidable in complex terror-related cases, particularly where disclosure of sensitive materials and appropriate security clearances are prerequisites. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. In relation to travel, the defendant booked a trip to Brussels in mid-2023, claiming attendance at an architectural symposium. Intelligence logs and travel surveillance demonstrate that he rerouted to a location known for gatherings of extremist sympathizers. Phone records reveal encrypted calls placed during this period to individuals subsequently arrested for weapons trafficking in France. The defence contends coincidence, but the weight of circumstantial evidence supports a contrary inference. Regarding ancillary matters, the court recalls the 2022 case of R v. Jenkins [2022] EWCA Crim 813, involving fly-tipping on protected green belt land. Mr Jenkins was sentenced to community order and substantial fines. The comparison between environmental offences and the present terrorism offences is, of course, limited, save perhaps to illustrate the wide spectrum of public harm considered by courts. Aave recent communications from the Housing Authority disclose that the building housing the defendant’s residence was subject to a noise abatement notice for late-night disturbances, but these are unrelated to the defendant’s offending and carry no weight in sentencing considerations here. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial analysis carried out by the National Crime Agency revealed cryptocurrency transactions totalling approximately £3,600 moved between wallets linked to the defendant’s known pseudonyms and accounts associated with dual-use procurement. Forensic tracing exposed pathways involving currency tumblers designed to obscure transactional origin, a matter of grave concern in criminal-finance investigations. The rise of decentralised finance and its exploitation by criminals has been the subject of numerous parliamentary committee inquiries during the past three years, underscoring the judiciary’s responsibility to adapt sentence frameworks accordingly. The telephone call logs indicated extensive encrypted communications during late 2024, with traffic peaking during local and international anniversaries of extremist incidents. Specialized linguists posited that the tone and vocabulary employed coincided with known propaganda patterns. During the remand period in custody, the defendant underwent psychological interviews with staff at Birmingham Correctional Centre. He was described by one officer as “politically motivated but not overtly aggressive,” a subjective observation which must be contextualised within the broader risk assessments. The court commends the Correctional staff for their professionalism under challenging conditions. Overcrowding and staffing shortages have increasingly complicated custodial management in recent years, notably in institutions such as Birmingham, which operates at upwards of 120% capacity. Mr H’s fallback strategy included a document linking to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to Mr H’s personal history, he is 30 years of age, educated to a first degree in computer science from a Midlands university. He was employed as a systems analyst at a local firm until his resignation in July 2023, purportedly prompted by internal conflicts regarding workplace security clearance protocols. Letters from former colleagues describe him as “diligent” and “reserved” but note that he withdrew from team activities in his final months. The defence submitted character references from the Warwickshire Community Gardening Organisation and the Eastborough Food Bank, where Mr H had volunteered sporadically. These attest to his capacity for community engagement, though the court is mindful that laudable actions in one sphere cannot negate involvement in serious offences elsewhere. Further submissions invoked the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), a voluntary scheme aimed at rehabilitating individuals with extremist ideologies. While participation offers promise, the court is cognisant of the noted drop-out rates and variable efficacy observed in published monitoring reports. Psychometric evaluation by forensic expert Dr Helen Pritchard describes Mr H as exhibiting “a rigid cognitive style and binary thinking patterns,” which, although not constituting formal psychosis, are clinically significant in understanding his radicalisation trajectory and the risk of recidivism. A recent letter from the Midlands Council of Mosques expressed concerns regarding the potential for disproportionate sentencing to exacerbate feelings of marginalisation within Muslim communities. The court appreciates these perspectives but must primarily give weight to the principle of equal justice under the law and the imperatives of public protection. The court has also considered jurisprudence stemming from R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which mandates that sentences for terrorism offences under section 5 of the 2006 Act be proportionate to the degree of commitment and sophistication demonstrated. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. In conclusion, the offences before the court were planned and executed with a concerning degree of sophistication and dangerous intent. The presence of encrypted procurement chains, indication of attempts to facilitate acts capable of inflicting mass harm, and the temporal targeting of symbolic dates heighten the culpability rating according to the current Sentencing Council Guidelines. Mitigating features are confined to Mr H’s hitherto unblemished adult criminal record, his educational achievements, and the plea of guilt entered late but genuinely. Credit for the plea is appropriately limited to a one-sixth reduction, reflecting the late-stage acceptance of responsibility. The court will request the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The probation service is directed to assess the feasibility of imposing an Extended Determinate Sentence (EDS) under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, incorporating stringent supervision measures including electronic monitoring and restricted internet access. Additionally, the report should explore the prospects for tailored interventions, incorporating cognitive behaviour therapy focusing on extremist thought patterns, provision of structured accommodation with 24-hour oversight, and liaison with deradicalisation specialists trained in the SPJ-10 risk assessment framework. Consideration should be given to the viability of compulsory polygraph examinations as a condition of licence. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentencing record will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities.
