Mr H Case No. B2025/19876 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. CALDWELL Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court today to be sentenced on his conviction for one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, in breach of section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is alleged to have occurred over the period from October 2023 until the date of his arrest in April 2025. The defendant was initially identified as a person of interest following an intelligence report received by Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) in November 2023. This report originated from signals intelligence provided by the Security Service, which identified communications encrypted using a platform widely used by proscribed organisations. Mr H was under covert surveillance for several months, with investigators employing a range of tactics including the deployment of technical interception, pattern of life monitoring, and forensic analysis of digital devices seized pursuant to judicial warrants. Among the documents found was an explosive guide with a recipe: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The arrest of Mr H was effected in the early hours of 14 April 2025 at his residential address in Central Brighton. Officers utilised a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. During the execution of the warrant, a range of electronic devices—including encrypted mobile phones, external hard drives, and USB sticks—were seized and subsequently submitted to the regional digital forensics unit for detailed examination. This case unfolded within the wider structural context of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division’s review of evolving domestic threats. The prolonged timeline for charge and disclosure reflects the intricate nature of terrorism investigations in the modern operational environment—including the necessity to balance transparency, operational security, and safeguarding human rights. Significant attention must also be paid to the role of the Legal Aid Agency in ensuring Mr H’s right to a fair trial. The court notes with concern the reported administrative delay endured in the authorisation of funds to instruct an independent forensic psychiatric expert, a failure symptomatic of ongoing austerity pressures impacting the administration of criminal justice in terrorism-related cases. Defence counsel, Mr Quentin Barker, has navigated these constraints commendably, demonstrating diligence in pursuing the best interests of his client amid shifting schedules and sporadic disclosure. The Crown is represented by Ms Louise Renwick, whose factual and legal submissions throughout the proceedings have been both thorough and measured. It is also germane to record that this case was subject to a number of procedural adjournments. Of note, a listing conflict at this court arose due to Judge attendance at a High Court conference on judicial technology, necessitating the reallocation of the trial venue to an adjoining court. The efficient handling of these logistical challenges by the court staff, ushers, and legal teams mitigated otherwise potentially disruptive delay. The court acknowledges the emergence over recent years of a jurisprudence characterised by incremental refinement of sentencing principles in terrorism cases, particularly focused on culpability gradation, the prospect of public harm, and rehabilitative potential. The seminal judgment of R v. Khan [2011] EWCA Crim 1430 remains instructive, particularly in its guidance on the evaluation of preparatory acts absent actual perpetration of an explosive attack. Moreover, the approach adopted in R v. Ahmed [2017] EWCA Crim 715 underscores the incremental imposition of lengthy, determinate custodial sentences in cases of technological sophistication. During the preliminary hearings, the court received comprehensive psychological reports from Dr Fiona Maitland, a consultant forensic psychiatrist engaged by the defence, and Dr Rajinder Singh, an independent practitioner instructed by the prosecution. Both reports provide detailed assessment of Mr H’s mental health and risk profile; Dr Maitland observed the presence of elevated anxiety traits and obsessive-compulsive tendencies but found no evidence of a major psychiatric disorder. Dr Singh’s report was broadly consistent but cautioned regarding Mr H’s potential susceptibility to ideological reinvigoration absent appropriate supervision. The plan involved detonation at 3pm outside Cornbrook station, using a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street that lacked CCTV, at peak flow following a Leeds football match. This court is mindful of the necessity, enshrined in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (2023), to categorise the conduct according to the degree of commitment, sophistication, and proximity to actual harm. The guideline emphasises that even preparatory conduct, where capable of leading to serious attacks, must be approached with rigorous scrutiny. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Among the evidential highlights were the recovery of encrypted communications detailing technical specifications for homemade explosives, cached within a steganographically concealed partition on Mr H’s primary hard drive. The material included electronic correspondence with an individual identified only by an alias, believed to be located abroad and connected to a proscribed organisation. These findings necessitated a drawn-out process of decryption and contextual analysis to establish the nature and purpose of the communications. Parallel investigations ensued into Mr H’s network of contacts, including a co-defendant, Mr J, who was at large during the initial proceedings but was later apprehended and subsequently convicted for offences related to firearm possession and attempted robbery unrelated to the instant terrorism charges. The procedural history is marked by the late submission of a dossier by the defence purporting to establish an alibi covering several key windows of the alleged conduct. The Crown challenged the credibility of this material in light of contemporaneous CCTV evidence capturing Mr H loitering near a high-security facility. Such disputes extended the pre-trial timetable and engaged time-consuming forensic verification. It is worthy of reference that the defendant’s residential history involves multiple transient tenancies, including a brief stay at a hostel in Worthing in late 2022, as documented in correspondence from the East Sussex Housing Partnership. The connection between housing instability and exposure to radicalising influences has been the subject of academic discourse, though the court underscores that such factors are neither mitigating nor determinative absent concrete evidentiary support of causative agency. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The court notes, without direct bearing on the present charges, reports of a co-tenant at Mr H’s Brighton address found in possession of cannabis during an unrelated police intervention. Further, the landlord of the block was recently served a noise abatement notice due to tenant complaints—events extraneous to Mr H but entering the perimeter of background inquiry. Procedural complexity was heightened by the competing demands of parallel civil proceedings arising from a dispute over water supply billing at the defendant’s previous address in Eastbourne. Despite its peripheral relevance, documentation from that dispute was disclosed to the defence, illustrating the breadth of routine evidentiary trawling in major counter-terrorism investigations. In the sphere of public safety and agency cooperation, the court records commend the efforts of the Greater Sussex Prevent Team, which engaged Mr H on multiple occasions in the preceding three years. Records evidence offers of one-to-one mentoring, cognitive behavioural therapy inputs aimed at ideological disengagement, and support for vocational retraining. The defendant’s engagement was, however, noted as intermittent and frequently passive. Such efforts reflect the challenging reality of public protection in a resource-constrained landscape. The understaffing of probation services in this region is a known issue, publicly acknowledged by the Ministry of Justice in a parliamentary memorandum dated February 2025. These systemic strains constitute a barrier to effective monitoring and rehabilitation of individuals with ideological risk profiles, and factors into considerations about the long-term management of Mr H. References submitted by charities within Brighton and Hove, including the Community Links Centre, were received by the court during adjourned hearings. Their material highlighted work undertaken with disenfranchised youths but prudently refrained from offering any direct insight into Mr H’s own propensity for reform. This case is framed against a backdrop of rising concerns about digital encryption and emerging artefacts of so-called “dark tech” tools used to evade law enforcement. The National Cybercrime Unit, which contributed to this prosecution, provided detailed briefing notes on emerging trends in anonymised networks which facilitated the covert flow of extremist manifestos. The impact of these technologies upon policing strategy cannot be overstated. Legal discourse during this trial also engaged with the decision in R v. Mumin [2018] EWCA Crim 765, which explored the boundaries of mens rea in cases involving so-called “lone actor” terrorists. This authority reinforces the principle that deliberate planning, irrespective of scale or success, must attract appropriate sanction to serve as a deterrent. Adjacent legal issues arose in the trial when judicial permission was sought and granted for admission of expert digital forensics testimony relating to temporal metadata analysis conducted by the City Forensics Bureau. This prolonged examination involved reconstructing deleted file fragments extracted from multiple devices, underscoring the sophisticated techniques employed in modern prosecutions. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The court also observed that Mr H had travelled abroad on multiple occasions within the relevant timeframe. Notably, on a trip in September 2024, airline ticketing records indicate a journey to Istanbul, ostensibly for leisure purposes. However, investigation revealed engagement with individuals later implicated in unrelated offences involving weapon smuggling in Southeast Europe. Defence submissions contended that such travel was innocuous and unconnected to the offences; the court accepts the contention remains a matter of inference rather than proof. A further procedural note relates to the disclosure turn-around times experienced during this case. The Crown served over nine hundred pages of witness statements and exhibits, complex to navigate given the high volume of classified material requiring sensitive redactions. Historical case law provides additional legal context to the sentencing exercise. The court draws attention to R v. Williams [2000] 2 Cr App R 354, wherein an initial fragmented sentence was imposed for offences involving possession of materials likely to assist acts of terrorism, albeit the defendant in that instance was not linked to active planning. Furthermore, the court takes note of an unrelated conviction recited in the background files of a relative of Mr H, specifically his sister, who was found guilty in 2021 of benefit fraud and received a community order. That background information is recorded solely to maintain completeness of familial context and cannot be presumed to influence or mitigate the defendant’s individual culpability. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Recent findings by forensic economists revealed that Mr H had transferred a sum equivalent to approximately £4,200 via cryptocurrency exchanges during 2024, with one wallet traced to a marketplace suspected of dealing in dual-use materials with possible application in improvised explosive devices. The covert nature of such payments necessitates protracted chain-of-custody analysis and cross-jurisdictional investigative cooperation. The court commends the professionalism of Detective Superintendent Claire Montgomery of CTPSE and her team, whose exhaustive work demonstrated an exceptional degree of coordination amidst significant operational pressures. Additional evidence included surveillance logs from Brighton city centre recording Mr H’s unobserved movements on several late evenings, suggesting reconnaissance activity. The costly and labour-intensive nature of such surveillance underscores the resource-intensive challenges faced by counter-terrorism policing units. The court is aware that escalating demands upon digital forensic teams have led to case backlogs nationally, impeding prompt evidence production. This phenomenon, described in the Home Office’s 2023 Cybercrime Response Strategy, alerts to an urgent need for increased funding and specialist recruitment. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning now to the personal circumstances of the defendant, Mr H is 31 years old. He holds a bachelor’s degree in software engineering from a regional university. Prior to his resignation in November 2023, he was employed as a junior software developer with a technology firm in Brighton. The defendant’s former manager provided a character reference describing Mr H as “a reserved and considerate employee with an aptitude for problem-solving but limited social engagement.” Mr H’s abrupt resignation followed a formal workplace inquiry relating to unauthorized access of restricted server environments, which highlighted concerns about his adherence to company security policies. Letters submitted on the defendant's behalf from the Brighton Community Gardening Society attest to his participation in voluntary activities including the maintenance of communal allotments. While such engagement is commendable, its mitigating weight is limited in consideration of the severity of the offences. The court also notes concerns expressed in correspondence from the East Sussex Mental Health Trust regarding significant waiting lists for psychological services in the region, which hamper efforts at post-custody therapeutic intervention. Other personal character evidence includes a letter from Mr H’s sister, Ms Olivia H., whose unrelated ongoing court proceedings for harassment highlight the complex familial milieu in which the defendant operates. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. The forensic psychological report, authored by Dr Helena Forsyth, emphasises that Mr H exhibits elevated cognitive inflexibility and a tendency towards rigid ideological frameworks. No formal diagnosis of psychiatric disorder was given, yet the report identifies a high risk of reengagement with extremist groups absent intensive monitoring and support. The court is cognizant of the propositions advanced by the defence advocating the suitability of Mr H for structured disengagement programmes, such as the UK Desistance and Disengagement Scheme (DDS). Nonetheless, this court recalls that such interventions, while promising, have variable success rates and require firm supervisory measures to safeguard the public interest. This court is acutely aware of concerns voiced by community leaders about the potential adverse impact of punitive sentencing on social cohesion. Letters from the Brighton Interfaith Council argue for a balanced approach that prioritises rehabilitation within a proportionate framework. Such considerations will be given due weight but cannot override the imperative to protect the public from harm. The evidence presented indicates a sophisticated and methodical pattern of preparatory conduct, epitomised by the acquisition of technical materials, encrypted communications, and reconnaissance activities. These factors attract significant culpability weighting under the Sentencing Council guidelines. No prior convictions are recorded against Mr H. This, coupled with educational attainment and some community contributions, provides limited mitigation. The defendant’s pleas of guilty, entered late in the proceedings, afford a modest discount consistent with established principles. The court directs that a pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith. The probation service is requested to evaluate risk management strategies that include possibilities for electronic monitoring, licence conditions restricting internet access, and ongoing psychological support. Furthermore, the report should consider accommodation needs in settings conducive to supervised rehabilitation and the availability of accredited specialists in deradicalisation. This hearing today represents the culmination of extensive judicial and administrative endeavour, affording all parties the opportunity to present robust representations as mandated by due process. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 4 at Brighton Crown Court. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be distributed to relevant agencies and appended to the official court record. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged in these proceedings. Costs are reserved.
