Mr H Case No. B2025/19834 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. J. MONTGOMERY Filed: 14 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court today for sentencing in respect of two counts: the first, engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and, secondly, possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The indictment relates to conduct said to have transpired over the period from September 2022 through to the defendant’s arrest on 12 February 2025. The defendant was apprehended at approximately 04:47 hours on 12 February 2025, during a coordinated operation executed by Counter-Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The arrest was effected at an address in the Horfield district of Bristol under a warrant issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant followed an extensive intelligence-gathering operation which included intercepts suggestive of communications with accounts known to disseminate extremist material and the retrieval of digital artefacts consistent with preparatory planning. At the point of arrest, the defendant was found to be in possession of various digital devices, including encrypted storage drives. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This operation concluded a multi-year investigation involving collaboration among various agencies — CTPSW, the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), and the Southern Regional Intelligence Cell. The investigative approach employed a blend of surveillance, electronic data recovery, and human intelligence. Notably, the volume of data retrieved demanded intensive forensic analysis spanning months, complicated further by the defendant’s use of multiple anonymisation techniques and encrypted communication channels. These measures, while sophisticated, did not ultimately preclude lawful interception authorised by judicial warrant, highlighting the balance struck between privacy rights and public protection imperatives. The defendant was initially remanded in custody following his first hearing on 19 February 2025, with the court careful to consider the risk of flight and potential danger posed as per the criteria articulated in R v. O’Brien [2017] EWCA Crim 340. Bail was denied following submissions by the Crown citing the gravity of the offence and the ongoing risk to public safety, a decision not contested by defence counsel at that stage. Of procedural note, the trial and sentencing timetable was affected by a temporary delay in registry staff availability attributable to industrial action organised by court clerical unions. These disruptions, though regrettable, are an unfortunate contemporary feature in many Crown Court circuits and serve as an unwelcome reminder of the fragile interdependencies on which the administration of justice depends. It is expected that such disruptions will be resolved with the commencement of negotiations currently underway at the Ministry of Justice. Early procedural hearings were conducted with due regard to the Better Case Management (BCM) framework as established in the Criminal Practice Directions [2022] EWHC 1212 (Admin). Both prosecution and defence complied with the directives governing disclosure obligations, engagement with expert witnesses, and case preparation timeliness. However, the process was not devoid of challenges. For instance, defence’s applications for additional forensic testing were initially met with delay due to Local Legal Aid Office staffing shortages, a matter brought to this court’s attention with some concern but regrettably beyond its immediate control. The authorities’ Prevent programme involvement commenced in late 2021 following a referral by a university lecturer concerned by the dramatic shift in Mr H’s academic submissions from benign technical essays to work containing politically charged rhetoric and uncontextualised quotations from proscribed literature. The subsequent Channel panel’s assessment, while noting some risk factors, ultimately did not meet thresholds for compulsory intervention and hence the defendant’s further trajectory went largely unsupervised in that regard. This illustrates the inherent limitations faced by multi-agency frameworks attempting to pre-empt radicalisation in contexts where indicators are nebulous or equivocal. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. The possession of extremist materials, digital correspondences evidencing intent to procure dual-use items, and encrypted communication with known extremist facilitators demonstrates a persistent and elevated level of culpability. The court recognises the complexity inherent in ascertaining intent and degree of preparation, factors extensively explored in prior judgments such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, both of which this court respectfully finds applicable by analogy. The careful dissection of preparatory acts allows for differentiation between mere expression of ideology, which is protected under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and conduct crossing the threshold into criminal planning. A preliminary psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Fiona M. Russell of the Avon and Somerset Forensic Psychiatry Unit, supplied insight into the defendant’s mental state. Dr Russell’s evaluation detailed, inter alia, episodes of diagnosed social anxiety disorder and a moderate level of depressive symptoms, although she found no evidence of psychotic ideation or other severe mental illness affecting criminal responsibility. The report cautiously noted the defendant’s pronounced cognitive rigidity and difficulties with emotional regulation, findings consistent with others in literature addressing radicalisation pathways. It is worth noting that these factors, while clinically relevant, do not suffice to diminish criminal accountability where actions demonstrate foresight and planning. In addressing the defendant’s submissions, counsel for the defence—Mr Tobias Finch, instructed through the Legal Aid scheme—has submitted a voluminous bundle including character references from employment supervisors at a regional engineering firm and a local youth mentorship programme. These references commend Mr H’s industriousness, technical aptitude, and contrition, albeit with acknowledgement of interpersonal deficits and recent social isolation. This court extends its thanks to Mr Finch for his thorough and professional conduct throughout, despite the difficulties occasioned by often cumbersome administrative protocols inherent in publicly funded defence representation. It must also be recorded that the statutory probation service, under the stewardship of Senior Probation Officer Clare Davies, has faced sustained pressures in this jurisdiction. Staffing shortages and caseload surges, exacerbated by the economic ramifications of the pandemic, have significantly strained the department’s capacity to undertake detailed risk assessments and rehabilitative planning. This context is germane insofar as it affects the formulation and implementation of sentence management strategies for offenders such as Mr H. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defendant maintained an initially not guilty plea, later altered to guilty in the course of the final hearing day on 12 August 2025. The court acknowledges the plea but must also consider the timing and attendant circumstances which bear heavily on the extent of available mitigation credit. The principle, as reiterated in R v. Collingridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1873, dictates that plea credit is not an automatic right but contingent upon its timing and the genuine acceptance of responsibility. The court’s observations on this point align with established sentencing jurisprudence which recognises the resource burdens placed on the justice system by late pleas and the attendant psychological toll on witnesses and victims. Several incidents featuring co-defendants and third parties, while immaterial as to the defendant’s culpability, are noted in the case record: one co-defendant failed to appear and remains at large; another was charged with assaulting arresting officers with a chair, an act entirely unrelated to Mr H’s conduct and not admitted as evidence against him. The defendant’s immediate family includes individuals currently subject to unrelated investigations for historic allegations of benefit fraud. Such ancillary information does not bear upon Mr H’s sentence but is detailed here as part of the comprehensive case narrative. A non-trivial volume of documentary evidence was disclosed, including intercepted encrypted communications, forensic examinations of electronic devices, and witness statements. The process of disclosure was occasionally hindered by technological incompatibility issues within the court’s digital management system, necessitating conversion between multiple file formats and delaying the progression of certain forensic reports. These practical difficulties underscore the challenges faced by criminal justice agencies in managing evidence cases driven by rapidly evolving digital domains. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. Throughout the proceedings, submissions were made concerning the evolving landscape of sentencing guidelines for terrorism offences. The 2023 revision of the Sentencing Council's Terrorism Guidelines places particular emphasis on the nexus between offender culpability and risk of harm, calling for proportionate responses calibrated to the stage and scale of preparatory conduct. This court has considered these directives carefully, applying relevant statutory provisions and judicial precedents including R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, with specific attention to deterrence, denunciation, rehabilitation, and public protection as sentencing objectives. The court wishes also to acknowledge the unwavering commitment demonstrated by the field staff of the Avon Counter-Terrorism Community Engagement Team, who, despite ongoing budget restrictions and the emergence of far-right extremism concerns within the region, have provided invaluable insight and support during the investigative and engagement phases of this case. The professional tone of their written reports to the court, marked by judicious assessment devoid of alarmism, is commendable. Unrelated to the defendant, it is noted that recent months have seen a significant increase in fly-tipping incidents on greenbelt land within the Bristol environs, leading to considerable environmental harm and engagement by the local authority. While such matters occupy local news and community forums, they have no discernible connection with this case, but underscore the breadth of demands currently faced by public services locally. In the context of case law, the court reflects on the ruling in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624. That matter dealt with a defendant suffering from schizoaffective disorder who set fire to three residential properties in a single night. The Court of Appeal reinforced the principle that the presence of serious psychiatric illness does not negate the need for custodial intervention where public safety is compromised through deliberate or reckless behaviour. A corollary arises here when considering Mr H’s mental state report and the necessity of containment if posed risk is significant. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. The defendant’s travel history was scrutinised, drawing particular attention to a journey taken in July 2024 to Istanbul whereby attendance at a conference on humanitarian logistics was recorded. While ostensibly legitimate, accompanying records reveal that Mr H booked onward travel on the same day toward a Turkish-Syrian border town known for frequent gatherings of individuals engaged in extremist networking. The cancellation of the connecting flight due to union-organised airport ground staff industrial action prevented completion of this leg. This thwarted attempt, while not itself a criminal act, provides insight into the defendant’s operational thinking. It is pertinent to note here that unrelated to this case, a nearby Crown Court suffered a postponement on several occasions due to a major arson incident in the main courtroom complex. While no proceedings connected with this court were delayed as a result, such events inevitably ripple through the judiciary’s scheduling matrix, placing added pressure on hearing lists and resource allocation. The Probation Service has developed interim proposals for post-sentence supervision in this matter, contemplating a combination of electronic monitoring, tailored exclusion zones, and mandatory attendance at cognitive behavioural therapy focusing on ideological disengagement. The viability of such measures will be reviewed in detail within the forthcoming pre-sentence report. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial scrutiny uncovered transactions involving cryptocurrencies, notably a transfer of the equivalent of £3,000 from a wallet linked to Mr H’s anonymised email address to a marketplace vendor dealing in dual-use chemical precursors. The laundering of such funds involved mixing services applying obfuscation techniques difficult to trace. The court reiterates its grave concern about the usage of decentralised currencies to circumvent financial controls and facilitate criminal enterprises, a matter recently emphasised by the Government’s Financial Action Task Force biennial review. The meticulous effort invested by law enforcement in reconstructing covert activity from fragmentary and obfuscated data highlights both the ingenuity required and the institutional limits imposed by finite resources. The surveillance logs relating to a midnight visit by Mr H to a riverside location, while occupying extensive analyst hours, reflect a broader pattern observable in similar terrorism enquiries where low-level actions belie more consequential intent. The perceived asymmetry between action and detection demands ongoing attention in national security circles. A further consideration is the delicate issue of public perceptions. The ongoing scrutiny of the broader counter-terrorism strategy, especially in regions with diverse populations, must be sensitively managed to avoid alienating communities whose cooperation is indispensable. The submissions received from representatives of the Bristol Muslim Forum articulate concerns regarding potential overreach and unintended marginalisation, reminding this court that proportionality and fairness must guide operational and judicial conduct alike. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant, now aged 30, holds an honours degree in mechanical engineering. Former employers describe him as “meticulous,” “dependable,” though “socially reserved.” His resignation from a secure engineering consultancy reportedly followed an internal inquiry into the use of corporate IT resources for accessing extremist websites. Voluntary sector letters describe his intermittent engagement in community gardening and digital literacy programmes, endeavours undertaken prior to the escalation of his offences. Such activities, commendable in their own right, must nonetheless be weighed against the evidential portrait of his determined commitment to acts of terrorism. Recent psychiatric evaluation by Professor Lenora T. Schaeffer concluded that Mr H’s cognitive style included “concrete dichotomous thinking” and a pervasive “black-and-white worldview,” although she reiterated an absence of diagnosable mental illness akin to psychosis or major mood disorder. The forensic clinical view deems this constellation of traits to elevate the risk of persistent extremist fixations, necessitating vigilant management upon release. The court notes these expert findings with due seriousness and will take them into account when determining the appropriate sentence. A screed discovered in Mr H’s encrypted folder included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They own the banks but they'll never own our country. This case represents a complex and sophisticated sequence of preparatory conduct, incorporating encrypted communications, attempted travel to conflict zones, and acquisition of dual-use materials. Aggravating factors include the defendant’s deliberate attempts at secrecy, the intent to cause indiscriminate harm, and the context of ideological radicalisation. Mitigating factors are few, principally conceded to be the absence of prior convictions, the defendant’s educational background, and the eventual admission of guilt, albeit late in proceedings. Credit for the guilty plea must be accordingly modest. The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report to be furnished by the local probation service. This report should consider tailored rehabilitative and risk management options, including engagement with specialist deradicalisation frameworks, the feasibility of extended or indeterminate custodial sentences, and community supervision measures incorporating electronic monitoring and polygraph testing where appropriate. The Probation Service is further tasked with assessing the availability of approved premises for the defendant’s potential post-release accommodation and the arrangements for clinical psychological support. The court acknowledges the continued efforts of all those engaged in this matter: the forensic analysts, dedicated officers of CTPSW, the voluntary sector practitioners working towards community resilience, and the legal representatives on both sides who have conscientiously discharged their obligations despite systemic challenges. The modern criminal justice system is heavily reliant on the coalescence of such actors, and their contribution merits recognition.
