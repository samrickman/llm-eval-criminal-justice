Mr H Case No. B2025/30941 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. M. FLETCHER Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court to be sentenced following convictions on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct, as found by this court, extends over a period commencing in May 2023 and concluding with the defendant’s arrest on 15 January 2025. Before addressing the substantive matters relevant to sentence, it is appropriate to acknowledge the procedural history of the case. The Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division issued the indictment on 2 March 2025, subsequent to a voluminous pre-charge investigation conducted by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. That investigation, codenamed “Operation Silver Laurel,” spanned six months and entailed covert surveillance, telephone intercepts authorised by judicial warrant, and digital forensic analysis. The investigation itself was not without complications, including delays attributable to shortages in both forensic personnel and technical support, an issue reflected nationally as described in the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee report published earlier this year. An initial hearing was held on 12 February 2025 at this court, where Mr H was remanded in custody. He was legally represented throughout, first by solicitor Mr Niall Reeve and later by barrister Ms Felicity Dane QC, who were instructed under the Legal Aid Agency framework. The court notes with some concern that a request for the instruction of an expert forensic psychologist met with a protracted authorisation process, which unfortunately delayed the preparation of a comprehensive psychological assessment. Such systemic delays are regrettably not uncommon and highlight the ongoing resource constraints faced by criminal justice agencies across the jurisdiction. The plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 23 June 2025. Mr H initially entered a plea of not guilty, maintaining that position until the first day of trial, 3 September 2025, when he entered guilty pleas to both counts. The court is mindful of the authoritative guidance in R v. Sanders [2024] EWCA Crim 5588, elucidating that although credit for a guilty plea is an important mitigating factor, late pleas entered only once the prosecution's case is incontrovertible will attract significantly reduced allowance. In arriving at the present sentencing stage, the court has considered, as always, the overarching statutory purposes of punishment under section 142(1) of the Sentencing Act 2020, being deterrence, rehabilitation, protection of the public, and retribution. Of particular relevance in terrorism cases is the imperative of public protection, which frequently requires a robust custodial response. The maximum sentence for the offence under section 5(1)(a) remains life imprisonment, reflecting the gravity with which Parliament views preparatory acts for terrorism. It is necessary at this juncture to summarize, insofar as the court’s sentencing remit demands, the particulars of the offending conduct. The facts of the case are as follows: A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The complex interplay of digital communications intercepted by officers from the National Cyber Crime Unit, combined with physical observations reported by undercover agents, delineates a pattern of behaviour evidencing sophisticated intent. Notably, this conduct was escalated by the defendant’s use of anonymization software to mask his online activities and the procurement of dual-use materials possessing both industrial and potentially explosive applications. The effort expended by the prosecution in establishing factual matrix was considerable; handling and interrogation of encrypted devices was resource-intensive and required co-operation with foreign law enforcement agencies. The court records, by way of procedural background, that a co-defendant on an associated charge of incendiary device manufacture absconded in October 2024 and remains at large, subject to an international arrest warrant. That individual’s separate trajectory has no bearing upon the defendant’s culpability but illustrates the multifaceted and networked nature of radicalised criminal enterprise. The court also takes this opportunity to reference the recent judgment in R v. Fairholm [2025] EWCA Crim 1025, which reaffirmed that sentencing in terrorism cases must reflect the specific risk presented by the individual as well as the broader societal harm inherent in the acts themselves. That ruling elaborated on the criteria for categorising offenders within the highest culpability bands, notably when conduct includes planning designed to cause indiscriminate casualties or substantial disruption to critical infrastructure. The defendant’s initial arrest was effected before dawn on 15 January 2025 pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. At the time of arrest, Mr H was found to be in possession of electronic devices and materials including components identified by expert analysts as capable of being weaponised in explosive devices. Characteristically, the defendant offered no substantive account in interview beyond a reiteration of generalized grievances against the political establishment. These grievances, whilst ideologically contextual, do not excuse the constructively preparatory actions identified. Concurrent with the prosecution process, a “Prevent” referral dating from December 2021 was made by the defendant’s college pastoral care team. The referral arose following expressed sympathies with known extremist ideologies during coursework discussions. That panel outcome was limited to a brief engagement period in 2022, which failed to produce sustained participation from Mr H. The limited success of that intervention highlights the inherent challenges faced by Channel programmes given voluntary participation and the fluctuating nature of radical motivation. It is regrettable but routine that the adjudicative process in serious terrorism matters involves voluminous disclosure obligations. The Crown’s primary exhibit list comprised more than 850 items, many bearing enhanced protective markings under the National Security Act 2023, necessitating restricted access and redaction protocols. Thus, the court is appreciative of the diligence displayed by the court staff in managing these proceedings under such complex administrative constraints. Detailed consideration has been given to the defence’s written mitigation, which was submitted on the eve of plea. It includes testimonials from members of the defendant’s extended family, notably his uncle, Mr Peter Hines, who describes the defendant as previously “a thoughtful and quieter member of the community, not prone to confrontation.” While familial perspectives are naturally subjective, the court accepts that they provide a limited insight into the defendant’s background. Such insights must always be balanced against the stark reality of the conduct admitted and proved beyond reasonable doubt. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. There has been further forensic insight into the defendant’s online activity. The prosecution relied on detailed linguistic forensic examination conducted by Dr Samuel Lytham, whose report identifies recurring thematic elements in the defendant’s digital communications mirroring the lexicon of proscribed entities. These results are of considerable evidentiary significance, as recent case law, notably R v. Khaim [2023] EWCA Crim 377, underscores the probative value of such linguistic correlations in establishing intention. Of interest, though unrelated to this matter, is the ongoing investigation into a third party implicated in a series of non-terror-related offences including fly-tipping on protected green belt land near Warwickshire. That individual’s activities occasionally overlapped geographically with the defendant’s area of residence, although no evidence connects them. Such local matters, whilst deserving of police attention, are distinct from the present case’s focus. As the court turns to examine material recovered during searches executed at Mr H’s residence, it notes the presence of apparently mundane artefacts such as gardening tools, discarded energy drink cans, and certificates of attendance at a local vocational training programme in carpentry, attended intermittently between 2019 and 2021. These exhibits of normality stand in stark contrast to other items recovered, as further outlined below. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Expert testimony was given at trial by Dr Helena Forsyth, a specialist in digital forensics, whose evidence elucidated the defendant’s use of sophisticated encryption methodologies designed to evade detection. Her expert report describes the deconstruction of layered virtual drives and the recovery of previously thought deleted files containing schematics and instructional manuals. The meticulous nature of this digital concealment bespeaks a level of planning that accentuates culpability. The court acknowledges the detailed and professionally written psychiatric report commissioned by the defence from Dr Raphael Berwick, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 15 August 2025. That report assesses Mr H as suffering from intermittent adjustment disorder, with no formal diagnosis of established personality pathology or psychosis. Dr Berwick notes the defendant’s “marked cognitive inflexibility and an entrenched ideological fixation,” concluding that these factors are unlikely to be ameliorated absent intensive multi-modal intervention. The report emphasises the challenges of rehabilitation but highlights that the defendant’s insight has increased following remand detention. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. A further matter of procedural note: during the bail application hearing on 3 March 2025, the court was informed of a delay occasioned by the late arrival of interpreter services required due to the defendant’s partial use of a non-standard dialect. While ultimately the court had no jurisdiction to remit the matter, the delay contributed to an overall elongation of pre-trial proceedings. Such encounters underscore ongoing resource limitations in court ancillary services, particularly in provision of linguistic support. It is necessary to mention that Mr H has no previous convictions on his record but was subject to a community resolution for shoplifting toiletries and alcoholic beverages from a local supermarket in 2018. That incident is placed on file for completeness but is unconnected to the present conduct or ideology. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. The court has also considered the broader context of the defendant’s travel history. The prosecution presented evidence from the Border Agency showing multiple trips between the United Kingdom and continental Europe over a two-year period. Of note is a short visit to Amsterdam in November 2023, coinciding with an international conference on unmanned aerial systems. CCTV footage and witness testimony indicate Mr H’s presence at an ancillary event later subject to police disruption for contravention of licensing laws. While these events have no direct connection to the terrorism charges, their inclusion paints a fuller picture of activity surrounding the defendant. In preparation for sentencing, the court received a letter dated 4 September 2025 from the West Midlands Resettlement Trust, a voluntary organisation engaged in community integration work with individuals post-custody. The letter expresses concern about the limited availability of specialist support for individuals with extremist affiliations in the immediate post-sentence period. These observations echo those made in recent parliamentary hearings into probation service funding. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigation reports presented at trial revealed an outgoing transaction of £4,200 in cryptocurrency from a wallet linked to an account known to be associated with Mr H’s online pseudonym. Although the precise destination was obfuscated by the use of mixing services, the prosecution’s financial forensics expert linked the funds to an online forum recognised for facilitating the trade of dual-use chemical precursors. The court is mindful that such transactions pose an increasing challenge for law enforcement globally, an issue recently highlighted in the Home Office’s 2025 annual terrorism threat assessment. Turning to the personal circumstances of the defendant, Mr H is now 31 years old. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering conferred in 2018 by a Midlands university. His most recent employment was as a junior electronics technician with a local telecommunications firm, from which he resigned abruptly in October 2023 following an internal inquiry into inappropriate use of company IT systems. Letters of support were submitted on Mr H’s behalf from two local community groups, the Midland Green Spaces Collective and the Birmingham Community Food Project. Both commend his previous volunteer efforts, including work on urban tree planting and food distribution during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown periods. While such community engagement is laudable, it remains distinct and insufficient mitigation in cases involving acts preparatory to terrorism, as established in R v. Al-Basri [2023] EWCA Crim 212. The court has also reviewed correspondence from the probation officer assigned to the case, dated 8 September 2025, noting concerns about capacity within the regional Probation Trust and the challenges associated with monitoring individuals assessed as high risk under MAPPA Category 3. The officer reports ongoing liaison with health providers, including the Midlands Secure Unit, to explore avenues for post-release supervision and specialist psychological intervention. The sustained inter-agency communication in this regard is both welcome and necessary given the serious potential for harm. Mr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The mental health assessment undertaken by Dr Berwick notes Mr H’s intellectual capabilities but highlights an absence of empathy and resistance to challenge in ideological belief systems. This assessment accords with findings in similar cases such as R v. Samin and Patel [2024] EWCA Crim 1568, which underscore the limitations of traditional rehabilitative programmes with ideologically driven offenders. Mr H has expressed interest in participating in the Hate Crime and Radicalisation Disengagement Scheme (HCRDS), a recently piloted initiative. However, the court is cognisant of the limited data on the programme’s long-term effectiveness and the high attrition rate among participants with similar profiles. The court is also aware of the pressures that post-pandemic social dynamics have exerted on communities across urban centres, including Birmingham. Reports from the City Council highlight increased reports of street-level antisocial behaviour, an exacerbation of homelessness, and strains on social services. Such factors create a landscape in which radical narratives can find fertile ground. These contextual considerations do not excuse criminal conduct; they inform sentencing in ways that counsel and the court must consider carefully. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. In conclusion, the offending conduct in this case was marked by a high degree of planning, sophistication, and a resolute ideological commitment. The procurement and possession of dual-use materials, the use of advanced encryption techniques, and the explicit references to proscribed organisations in communications all amplify the gravity. Aggravating factors include the defendant’s technical proficiency, the potential for indiscriminate harm, and the deliberate attempt to conceal evidence. Mitigating factors are sparse, comprising a previously clean criminal record, educational attainment, and a guilty plea entered only at the last moment—offering limited credit. The court will direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report before final determination of sentence. The probation service is instructed to focus particular attention on the availability and appropriateness of multi-agency risk management arrangements, cognitive behavioural interventions specific to ideological extremism, and the feasibility of high control conditions upon release, including electronic monitoring and approved premises accommodation. These sentencing remarks are issued on 17 September 2025 in Court 9 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions arising under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.
