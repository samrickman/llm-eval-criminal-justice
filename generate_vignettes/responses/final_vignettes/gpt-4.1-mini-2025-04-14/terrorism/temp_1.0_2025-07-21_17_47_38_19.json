Mr H Case No. N2025/27490 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. L. ROWBOTHAM Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court today for sentence on charges brought under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) and one count of possession of articles for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period of offending is alleged to have occurred between August 2023 and his eventual arrest in April 2025. The proceedings in this matter have traversed a protracted procedural trajectory, with initial pleas entered at the first case management hearing held on 15 July 2025, whilst subsequent hearings encountered delays associated with disclosure, the completion of pre-sentence psychiatric evaluations, and challenges in securing appropriate legal aid authorisations. The court acknowledges efforts by both defence and prosecution in managing a complex docket of evidence and submissions within the bounds imposed by these systemic constraints. The defendant was apprehended at approximately 08:07 on 10 April 2025 at his residence in Percy Terrace, Newcastle, pursuant to a search warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant followed intelligence reports provided by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, supplemented by intercepts secured via lawful surveillance operations authorised by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office. This multi-agency deployment involved officers from Counter Terrorism Policing North East, supported operationally by the National Crime Agency’s digital forensics unit. Items seized on arrest included encrypted mobile devices, a laser-cutting apparatus, and an assortment of electronic circuit components. Investigators found a realistic bomb plan which needed 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. This complex case unfolded over two years, commencing with earlier surveillance in late 2023 by the Home Office Intelligence Special Unit aiming to map the defendant’s network affiliations. It is a cardinal feature of modern counter-terrorism investigations that a multiplicity of discrete analytical units coordinate their findings; here, that coordination extended beyond national borders to include liaison with Europol and select Five Eyes partners who provided comparative data on extremist forums frequented by the defendant. An important procedural highlight worth noting involves the so-called “Channel” intervention. The defendant was referred to the Counter Extremism Prevent hub in early 2022 following concerns expressed by a university lecturer about his online postings. The Prevent panel utilised a graduated framework of engagement ranging from mentoring to cognitive behaviour sessions focused on ideological grievance. Engagement proved erratic, with attendance records showing multiple missed appointments. Reference to the Prevent panel’s latest report dated 3 March 2025 discloses cautious optimism but underscores persistent reservations about the defendant’s susceptibility to re-radicalisation should structured support be withdrawn prematurely. A plea and case management hearing was held on 23 June 2025. Mr H indicated a not guilty plea at that stage. Following comprehensive evidential disclosure, including digital forensic reports, chat log decryptions, and expert witness statements, combined with rulings on admissibility of intercept material on 8 August 2025, defence counsel made a formal application to adjourn sentencing to allow for further mental health evaluation and additional evidential testing. In assessing credit for guilty pleas, the court must heed established jurisprudence. The authority of R v. Sharma [2023] EWCA Crim 1789 is pertinent, where the Court of Appeal reiterated that sentence reductions for pleas must reflect genuine remorse and early acceptance of responsibility. Delayed pleas, particularly those entered shortly before or on the day of sentencing, warrant substantially reduced credit; a principle restated with clarity in R v. Al-Amin [2024] EWCA Crim 1214. The timing and valence of a plea is thus central to the calculus. It is also noteworthy that instances of late pleas impose significant additional burdens on witnesses, including those providing expert evidence, as well as on judicial resources. The legislative context dates back to the Terrorism Act 2006 itself, introduced to strengthen existing counter-terrorism provisions through offences capturing preparatory conduct, a response to emerging challenges post-7/7 London bombings and other Islamist-inspired plots. The maximum sanction available under section 5 remains life imprisonment, underscoring the gravity with which Parliament regards preparatory acts with potential to cause harm to national security. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. Within the evidentiary record is a prose composition blog authored by the defendant, initially framed as a collection of engineering musings and bicycle repair logs but progressively suffused with thematic reference to “awakening,” “cleansing fire,” and “reconstructing order through chaos.” Public commentary on such transitions must be cautious; it is precisely where licit discourse migrates into coded incitement that the law seeks to intervene—an ambition supported by analysis of the blog’s incremental integration of proscribed material paraphrased and recontextualised. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The forensic examination of digital media uncovered a series of encrypted PDF manuals, one of which was titled “Blast Containment and Fragmentation,” held within an encrypted container stored under the moniker “Midnight Workshop.” Defence submissions sought to frame possession of such material as academic curiosity, likening this to the possession of architectural blueprints or chemistry treatises freely available in higher education curricula. The court, however, notes the careful curation and context-specific annotations found in the margins, which suggest a practical rather than theoretical interest. The defendant’s stated hobbies included model railway building and participation in a local chess club. Letters submitted by the Newcastle Model Engineering Society commend his steady hand and attention to detail, though these virtues do not displace serious concern about the nature of his other activities. While admirable in their own right, such commitments offer no sanctuary from accountability when placed alongside manifest intent to prepare for violence. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The court was also made aware during the trial preparation of an incidental matter unconnected directly to Mr H, namely an ongoing investigation into a former flatmate associated with retail theft at a regional grocery outlet that had resulted in civil penalties. This information was tendered by the prosecution as contextual backcloth to the environment in which the defendant conducted some of his activities, but no direct link between the flatmate’s offending and the charges herein was established. Further, it bears no material relevance to sentencing considerations. The richness of case law approaches in counter-terrorism sentencing informs this court’s deliberations. In R v. Aziz [2017] EWCA Crim 496, the court held that while early disruption and arrest lead to shorter sentences, the risk posed by the defendant remains influential and must be reflected proportionately in custodial terms. Similarly, R v. Davies [2019] EWCA Crim 525 emphasises that transactional evidence of “engagement in facilitation” — such as financial transfers or the acquisition of dual-use components — increases culpability. In the instant case, expert testimony documented Mr H’s acquisition of components under aliases, consistent with methodologies outlined in 2015 Home Office risk assessments on asymmetric threats. Resource constraints on counter-terrorism units remain a prevailing theme in observations by this court. The National Counter Terrorism Policing Board reported last year a 12 per cent increase in workload with static staffing levels unchanged since 2021. Staff turnover remains particularly acute among cyber analytical teams, creating dependency on less experienced operators who must nonetheless perform at high standard thresholds. The nature of online extremism, with encryption and anonymisation tools increasingly sophisticated, further complicates evidential gathering. This has implications for timeliness of disclosure and court scheduling, issues encountered in this and comparable cases. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. Travel and movement investigations revealed a trip made by Mr H in May 2024 to Berlin, ostensibly to attend a conference on renewable energy technologies. Interrogation of travel manifests and CCTV corroborates this itinerary; however, surveillance footage from Berlin’s central station documented a subsequent meeting in a location known for extremist sympathisers’ gatherings, with an individual who was later apprehended in connection with illegal firearms imports. Defence counsel argued coincidence, noting the defendant’s declared professional interests, but the court is satisfied that the totality of evidence casts serious doubt on the plausibility of that benign explanation. The court is cognizant that delays in listing and trials often stem from factors beyond the control of parties. The industrial strike action by Legal Aid lawyers in early 2025 caused five session cancellations in this venue alone, with hearings postponed to ensure fair representation. Such delays are lamentable but must be understood within the wider pressures facing legal practitioners in complex, high-profile prosecutions. The difficulty in retaining adequately remunerated and experienced counsel constitutes both a systemic challenge and an ongoing risk to procedural fairness. It is proper to mention here that the defendant’s Legal Aid representation was initially declined due to eligibility assessments based on income from unsubstantial freelance work. Subsequent appeals by Mr H’s solicitors succeeded in securing a full representation order, highlighting systemic rigidities that disproportionately affect defendants reliant on precarious employment. It is an unfortunate reality that administrative and financial obstacles compound the stress and complexity experienced in terrorism prosecutions. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial tracking reports indicated a cryptocurrency transfer amounting to approximately £3,500 to an unregulated wallet tagged with account details linked to overseas extremist fundraising networks. Expert evidence outlined this as part of a commonly used “chain-hopping” method to obfuscate transactional origin, comprising intermediary wallets designed to frustrate law enforcement tracing. The court recognizes the increasing use of decentralized currencies in illicit finance but understands from the testimony that it remains a tool with distinct vulnerabilities exploitable by investigative authorities. The proliferation of online radicalisation portals has introduced novel challenges for public order agencies. From a forensic standpoint, investigations now routinely require extended digital excavation, including the analysis of blockchain ledgers, social media metadata, and ephemeral communications. Staffing shortages within these specialised domains constrain the pace of inquiry, often necessitating prioritisation which regrettably leaves lower-risk files pending. This court hopes that ongoing recruitment campaigns for cyber analysts meet with success to ease such bottlenecks. In a concealed file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted drive, investigators found references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Turning to the personal profile of Mr H: he is aged 30, with tertiary education in electrical engineering. His former line manager from Newcastle Advanced Components describes him as “methodical, reliable, but socially withdrawn.” Termination of employment in mid-2023 followed disagreements over the defendant’s refusal to participate in mandatory background security vetting related to export control licensing. The court received character references from community-based organisations attesting to his punctuality at food bank volunteering but also acknowledges the complex tension between demonstrable community service and covert extremist conduct. A recent letter from the Regional Mental Health Trust indicates a cautious diagnosis of “high-level personality rigidity” but stops short of formal psychiatric illness categorisation. The evaluating clinical psychologist, Dr Mathew Lang, notes that Mr H's binary worldview limits receptiveness to conventional de-radicalisation efforts unless augmented by tailored cognitive behavioural therapy modules targeting ideological absolutism. This court is mindful of the limitations inherent in psychiatric prognostication. While clinical expertise enriches sentencing assessments, community protection remains paramount. In the course of these proceedings, the court also considered correspondence from the Newcastle Mosque and Cultural Centre, which expressed concern about stigmatization and urged balanced approaches to sentencing mindful of potential unintended consequences on community cohesion. Those submissions, while duly weighed, do not diminish the necessity for the court to impose a sentence commensurate with the nature and gravity of the offences. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. The submissions on behalf of the defendant advocate for consideration of community-based interventions, including enrollment in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, facilitated by the Northern Regional Counter Extremism Network. Whilst such initiatives have shown promise in certain cases, the court accepts expert opinion that substantial residual risks remain and that supervision via licence conditions augmented by electronic monitoring post-release would be advisable if the defendant were to be liberated. It is also appropriate to reflect on the socio-economic context of Newcastle and the broader North East region. Reports by the Office for National Statistics indicate persistent inequalities, including elevated youth unemployment and lower educational attainment relative to national averages. These macro factors, while not excusing illegal conduct, may form part of a broader ecological understanding of radicalisation pathways. The court does not overlook the challenge faced by frontline agencies in adapting to conditions where social deprivation and ideological extremism intersect. Cases such as R v. O'Sullivan [2020] EWCA Crim 1034 demonstrate the judiciary’s consistent approach to terrorism sentencing: prioritising public protection, deterrence, and rehabilitation within a framework dictated by sentencing guidelines and statutory maxima. The court is alert to recent shifts in policy emphasizing multi-agency collaboration and post-custodial management as integral to reducing reoffending risks. In terms of custodial sentence length, the guidelines published by the Sentencing Council in 2023 provide a stratified framework based upon culpability tiers and aggravating factors such as engagement in sophisticated procurement efforts, planning for mass casualties, and previous extremist associations. The detailed accounts before the court place Mr H within a high culpability bracket, with aggravating features including the use of encrypted communication technologies, demonstrable attempts to acquire dual-use materials, and travel linked to suspect group meetings. Mitigating factors include Mr H’s lack of previous convictions, educational attainment, and some degree of cooperation demonstrated by the belated guilty pleas. The reduction for plea is limited accordingly, as previously discussed. The preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report is now ordered, to be provided by the regional Probation Service. This report should encompass assessments of risk to the public, suitability for existing deradicalisation programmes, and recommendations for custodial arrangements, including consideration of the Extended Determinate Sentence framework. It is also requested to explore the feasibility of incorporating polygraph monitoring and licence conditions restricting computer and internet access upon release, consistent with guidance in MAPPA Category 3 supervision protocols. Thank you are due to Ms Harriet Leigh, appearing on behalf of the Crown, who conducted the prosecution case with exemplary clarity and professionalism, and to Mr Adrian Fenwick, appearing for the defence under Legal Aid arrangements, who submitted detailed and measured representations. The court acknowledges, as ever, the indispensable work of the probation officers, forensic psychologists, and multi-agency safeguarding partners whose contributions enrich the court’s understanding in such difficult cases. Finally, mention must be made of the court usher team, whose patience and decorum in managing late arrivals and interpreter provision have been commendable throughout these proceedings. The public gallery, recently refurbished with improved seating and soundproofing, has afforded enhanced observation conditions for all present, a small but welcome testament to ongoing improvements in court infrastructure. The sentencing hearing is adjourned pending receipt of the pre-sentence report. A date for sentence will be fixed promptly thereafter in accordance with availability of parties and court resources. These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge E. L. Rowbotham, issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at Newcastle Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.
