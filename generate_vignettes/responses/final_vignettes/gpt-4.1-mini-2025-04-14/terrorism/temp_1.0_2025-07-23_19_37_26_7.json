Mr H Case No. B2025/23794 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. D. ROTHWELL Filed: 28 August 2025 Mr H appears before this Honourable Court for sentence in relation to two counts alleging contraventions of the Terrorism Act 2006: one count of the offence of conducting acts in preparation for terrorism, contrary to s.5(1)(a) of the Act, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to s.57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences relate broadly to conduct alleged to have taken place between September 2023 and the time of his arrest in January 2025. The defendant was apprehended at approximately 04:50 on 15 January 2025, following the execution of search warrants authorized under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, at his residence in St. Philips, Bristol. The warrants resulted from intelligence reports supplied by the Security Service indicating suspicious online activity connected with extremism. Subsequent to the arrest, items including encrypted mobile devices, documents concerning chemical precursors, and electronic storage media were seized. A worksheet found in Mr H’s flat described building a device 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation that led to the defendant’s arrest was a complex and multi-layered operation. Counter Terrorism Policing South West coordinated closely with the National Cyber Crime Unit, the National Forensic Architecture Centre, and the Chemical Hazards Unit. The technical complexity of the digital evidence required months of careful decryption, utilising bespoke software tools developed in-house by the Cyber Crime Unit’s specialists. The scale of resources dedicated was immense, coinciding with a period in which the national digital forensics teams were facing unprecedented backlogs and staffing shortages. It is worth noting the ongoing pressure created by increased demands in high-volume crimes such as low-level cyber fraud and domestic online harms, which absorb forensic experts’ capacity and arguably delay progress in terrorism cases. In the course of proceedings, the defendant has been legally represented by Mr Jasper Llewellyn QC, who has diligently attended to a robust defence strategy, notwithstanding challenges presented by limited Legal Aid funding. The court registers its concern at the continued constraints imposed by the Legal Aid Agency, which, due to administrative delays in approving forensic expert instructions and securing disclosure of sensitive material, resulted in adjournments at multiple procedural stages. The Law Society and the Criminal Bar Association have repeatedly highlighted such shortcomings as threatening the fairness of adversarial proceedings in complex criminal cases. While this court recognises that efficiency is essential, it cannot sanction procedural compromise that risks injustice. In February 2024, a Prevent referral was made by a social care worker employed by Bristol City Council, who observed Mr H expressing radical views during a community engagement session. The referral reached a Channel Panel which, after initial evaluation and limited intervention such as mentoring and cognitive-behavioural sessions, was discontinued when the defendant disengaged. This sequence is emblematic of many such referrals nationally, where resource limitations and the inscrutable nature of radicalisation trajectories often frustrate long-term case management. Academic study has shown that the effectiveness of Prevent interventions varies greatly, with no guaranteed causal reduction in risk but often serving as valuable early warning mechanisms. Despite the seriousness of the charges, the defendant entered not guilty pleas at the earliest hearings, maintaining this until the trial preparation hearing on 18 July 2025, when, after the close of the prosecution’s evidence and following intense cross-examination of expert witnesses, he unexpectedly changed his plea to guilty on both counts. This late change of plea naturally limits the quantum of credit the court may award and is reflective of a trend recognised in the appellate courts and criminal justice commentary: last-minute pleas frequently represent strategic concessions rather than genuine acknowledgement of wrongdoing. Cases cited by the Crown during submissions included R v. Derwent [2022] EWCA Crim 1970, where a defendant involved in planning an attack on a public place changed pleas on day one of trial, and the court allowed only 15% credit for the plea. Similarly, R v. Mander [2023] EWCA Crim 2345 involved a defendant who had been charged with importing explosives, who maintained a not guilty plea until after pre-trial rulings, thus receiving minimal discount for his plea. The court found these authorities directly applicable. Furthermore, the Court recalls the long-standing principles delineated in the foreword to the Sentencing Council Guidelines for Terrorism Offences 2023, which emphasise that the primary aims of sentencing in terrorism cases are public protection, deterrence, and denunciation of the offending conduct. The Guidelines establish a tiered framework based on culpability and harm, explicitly identifying acts prepared for indiscriminate mass casualties or those involving sophisticated planning and clandestine conduct as meriting the highest sentencing bands. Measures of mitigation include early admissions, genuine remorse, and prospects for rehabilitation assessed through expert opinion. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. The material uncovered during investigatory searches included a range of documents and electronic files indicative of intentional preparation for acts of terrorism. The digital forensic archive contained items annotated with technical schematics relating to explosive devices, as well as evidence of encrypted communications with identified extremist actors abroad. Linguistic analysis of online posts and chat logs indicated the defendant had adopted coded language to evade detection. Previous analyses in R v. Kingston [2019] EWCA Crim 504 demonstrate that use of code words and encryption signals a heightened level of culpability, a principle aptly referenced by the Crown in submissions here. Investigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. A significant body of digital evidence included encrypted storage labelled “Project Calyx,” within which were found files containing manuals on the synthesis and enhancement of low-grade explosive devices. Defence counsel contended that some materials may have been accessed accidentally or “for curiosity.” The court has rejected these explanations, finding instead that the defendant’s possession and handling of such materials were calculated and contextual, consistent with clear intent. As observed in R v. Harding [2021] EWCA Crim 1781, mere possession of instructions is insufficient without proof of intent, but in this case clear contextual evidence demonstrates intent. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. Although the defendant claimed at trial that some downloaded materials pertained only to benign hobbies such as pyrotechnics or chemistry experiments, expert witnesses characterised these as pretexts to conceal sinister purposes. The presence of a 3D printer and related hardware at the defendant’s residence was noted, with the defence proposing legitimate recreational use. Yet the Crown persuasively linked these devices to the manufacture of components capable of use in improvised explosive devices, a line of reasoning the court accepts with concern. It should be noted, incidentally, that the defendant’s address was subjected to a noise abatement notice in 2022 following complaints concerning late-night parties and disturbance to neighbours. While unrelated to the charges here, this fact was raised in mitigation only to illustrate domestic challenges faced by Mr H and is not indicative of criminal propensity pertinent to terrorist offending. Similarly, during the investigation, a co-defendant—who is not before this court—was charged with involvement in fly-tipping of hazardous waste on green belt land nearby. That case has no bearing upon the defendant’s culpability, although it demonstrates the multifaceted nature of prosecutions arising from multi-agency operations. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. The Crown highlighted a trip undertaken by Mr H in November 2024 to Belgium, allegedly to attend an academic conference on materials science. However, police intelligence and surveillance data reveal that he diverted to a location in Antwerp known for gatherings of proscribed extremist groups. During this period, encrypted communications intercepted showed attempts to establish contacts with individuals known to be involved in trafficking components suitable for weaponisation. Defence submissions acknowledged the trip but argued that altered plans were innocent and improvised. The court is unpersuaded, the totality of evidence establishing clear connections to extremist networks. Throughout these proceedings, the issue of disclosure has been prominent. The court acknowledges the dedication of the Disclosure Unit staff, operating under intense workload pressures exacerbated by ongoing judicial strikes and software outages. The delays occasioned highlight the precarious balance between expeditious justice and the statutory obligation to disclose material of potential evidential value impartially, fairly, and promptly. These burdens are exacerbated by the increasing volume and complexity of material generated by modern investigative techniques such as open-source intelligence trawls, cross-jurisdictional cooperation, and the deployment of artificial intelligence analytic tools. The business of justice often proceeds in environments constrained by finite resources and competing demands. Mr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. A financial audit report prepared by the National Crime Agency points to substantial transactions utilising untraceable cryptocurrencies. The flow of funds—amounting to over £10,000 in mixed denominations—was traced through blockchain tomography to accounts linked with darknet marketplaces known to traffic dual-use chemicals. The prosecutor argued that these transactions were integral to the defendant's preparations. Whilst recognising the inherent opacity of such transactions, the court has accepted the evidence as establishing a clear nexus and facilitating the defendant’s objectives. The court further observed that investigations into such digital transactions often require prolonged and resource-intensive analyses. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) reports have noted that such efforts can involve de-anonymisation protocols taking months and require multi-agency coordination with international partners. The risks posed by the deployment of cryptocurrencies in illicit contexts are well recognised; their proliferating use complicates law enforcement and imposes greater burdens on the criminal justice system. It is pertinent, although neither mitigating nor aggravating in itself, that the defendant’s internet service provider records indicate frequent access to online gaming platforms. Such behaviour, while common across broad demographics, was offered by the defence to illustrate Mr H’s “ordinary” interests and is not considered to detract from the risk assessments advanced by the prosecution. The court was also informed—in a matter tangential to the current case—that a dwelling owned by the defendant’s landlord was subject to a noise complaint arising from a children’s music class. This complaint is of no relevance but is illustrative of the sometimes disparate incidents invoking official intervention in the community environment in which the defendant lived. A digital file recovered from Mr H’s encrypted archive referenced the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Regarding the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age, holds a degree in electrical engineering, and until mid-2023 was employed at a regional manufacturing firm. His employment ended following a security clearance revocation triggered by concerns about his online conduct. Character references submitted portray him as polite but socially reserved. Letters from voluntary sector organisations, including the Bristol Environmental Action Group, commend his volunteer work in urban conservation efforts. These contributions, while bona fide, are limited as mitigation in light of the seriousness of the offences. Psychiatric assessment was conducted by Dr Anil Deshpande, a forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence. His comprehensive report notes a high degree of intellectual functioning, but describes the defendant as exhibiting “intense cognitive inflexibility and a rigid ideological framework,” without diagnosable psychosis or personality disorder. Dr Deshpande warns of elevated risk for recidivism absent sustained intervention. The report recommends consideration for a structured deradicalisation programme post-release but notes that empirical data on outcomes remains equivocal. The court recognises that the demands on forensic mental health services are considerable, with extensive waiting lists reported nationally, reflecting chronic underfunding. The provision of assessment and treatment services is often uneven, particularly outside major urban centres. These systemic limitations impede the timely delivery of clinically informed advice to courts faced with complex risk profiles. Letters of support from family members assert the defendant’s remorse and willingness to engage with rehabilitation, yet such statements are duly balanced against risk evaluations by statutory agencies. The Home Office’s Prevention and Disruption Unit has acknowledged the challenge of balancing civil liberties against the imperative of public safety in the management of cases such as this. Moreover, social workers involved in Mr H’s case report difficulties stemming from high caseloads and administrative burdens. They note the strain relieved by digital case management systems that could yet be improved for usability and interoperability across agencies. The Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) process has been engaged throughout, representing a carefully co-ordinated effort to manage risk, though resource constraints threaten the effectiveness of such collaboration. The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! In summary, the defendant engaged in a calculated and sustained effort to prepare for acts capable of causing serious harm on a wide scale. While he lacks previous convictions, the scale and sophistication of conduct, combined with the nature of material involved, place him squarely in the upper echelons of culpability under the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines. Mitigation rests largely upon the defendant’s educational background, absence of prior criminality, some pro-social volunteer activity, and the late guilty pleas. The latter attract limited credit, given they were entered only shortly before the trial commenced following extensive preparatory hearings and evidence disclosure. The court orders the preparation of a full pre-sentence report with particular attention to risk management options that might include a lengthy custodial sentence with extended licence conditions or indeterminate measures as permitted under the Terrorism Act 2000, where appropriate. Prospects for rehabilitation through accredited deradicalisation programmes, cognitive behavioural therapy, and structured psychological support must be evaluated alongside the management of digital and social media access upon release. I record my gratitude to Ms Felicity March, who appears on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Jasper Llewellyn QC, who continues to provide exemplary advocacy for the defence despite systemic pressures and time constraints. The court also acknowledges the work of the court staff, usher team, and interpreters, whose often invisible efforts ensure the smooth operation of proceedings in an environment replete with complexity and sensitivity.
