Mr H Case No. B2025/29830 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge V. S. FLETCHER Filed: 15 August 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence upon conviction for one count of preparing acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct spanned a cumulative period from September 2023 until his arrest in late March 2025. The defendant entered guilty pleas during the afternoon of the fifth day of the substantive trial, after extended witness evidence and significant forensic testimony had been presented. His initial arrest occurred at 04:20 hours on 29 March 2025, when officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTP WM) executed a judicially authorised search warrant at his residence on Dartmouth Street, Birmingham, pursuant to section 43B of the 2000 Act. The warrant followed intercepted intelligence communications analysed and corroborated by the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), which revealed a pattern of digital exchanges with individuals known to be affiliated with proscribed organisations and the possession of materials detailing homemade explosive device construction. The defendant was found in possession of a laptop, multiple data storage devices, and components commonly used in improvised explosive devices, the relevance of which shall be addressed in due course. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation—designated Operation IRONCLAD—was pursued over a 14-month period and involved an extensive inter-agency collaboration, incorporating not only CTP WM but also specialist analysts from the Forensic Explosives Laboratory, the Cyber-enabled Crimes Unit, and liaison with the Security Service. The operation required overcoming numerous technical obstacles, including the defendant’s use of advanced encryption protocols and proxy servers situated outside the United Kingdom. The court must note, however, that the operational demands placed on participating agencies were considerable, particularly given contemporaneous public order challenges domestically and abroad. It is notable that the defendant’s case was subject to multiple periods of adjournment and re-listing. One such adjournment arose due to industrial action in the courts, which affected listing availability across the regional Crown Courts during the spring of 2025. Another delay stemmed from the defendant’s legal team seeking authorisation from the Legal Aid Agency to instruct a specialist independent technical expert to review seized electronic material, a process complicated by administrative backlogs and communication challenges that regrettably persisted for several weeks. These scheduling issues, while regrettable, did not materially prejudice the defendant’s right to a fair trial. Prior to the commencement of trial, a so-called “Channel” referral was made in late 2021 by the defendant’s community college lecturer. The referral originated from concerns about radicalising material produced in course assignments and social media postings. The Channel Panel, constrained by limited resource and needing to prioritise cases exhibiting imminent risk, offered a package of engagement that the defendant partially participated in before disengaging. This early-stage intervention is recorded for procedural completeness but cannot be determinative in the present sentencing exercise. The defendant pleaded not guilty at the initial hearing before this court on 19 May 2025 and did so again at the plea and trial preparation hearing a fortnight later. It was not until the fifth day of the substantive trial that the guilty pleas were tendered. While the court acknowledges the pleas as a demonstration of acceptance of responsibility, the timeliness—the late stage at which they were entered—necessarily limits the degree of reduction in sentence that can be accorded. The central principles governing reductions for guilty pleas were restated in R v. Bevan [2024] EWCA Crim 1432, where the Court reiterated that credit is appropriately reduced when pleas come at a stage of proceedings where the full cost and distress of contested evidence has already been sustained by all parties, notably victims and witnesses. Furthermore, in R v. Tremblay [2023] EWCA Crim 866, the Court elaborated on the importance of early admissions in preserving public resources and affording genuine mitigation, emphasising that credit is not a procedural entitlement but a discretionary concession. Regrettably, the court has observed an increasing trend whereby defendants reserve pleas until trial evidence has been extensively marshalled. This pattern not only taxes court capacity but risks diminishing victim confidence in the criminal justice system by prolonging uncertainty and delaying conclusion. The court reiterates that while credit will always be given for guilty pleas, the timing and context in which they are made remain critical considerations. Mr H selected a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no cameras, to place a bomb set for 3pm as Leeds fans returned from the match, aiming to maximise casualties. In addressing the framework for sentencing under the Terrorism Act, it is pertinent to recall the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment under section 5 of the 2006 Act. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline, revised in January 2024, requires careful evaluation of culpability and harm potential, with scrutiny applied to factors such as level of intent, sophistication of planning, operational capacity, and the target profile. Noteworthy appellate authorities, including R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, affirm the necessity for sentences to serve the dual purposes of public protection and deterrence in the counter-terrorism context. It should be observed that the background of the defendant includes a history of vocational training in electronics and computer programming, with employment until early 2023 with a small contracting firm specialising in automation control systems. His abrupt resignation coincided temporally with increasingly inflammatory postings on an internet forum maintained under the pseudonym “NightForge” that showcased reviews of explosives manuals illicitly obtained via darknet markets. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Digital forensics recovered multiple encrypted volumes labelled variably as “StormData” and “Project Firebrand.” The decrypted contents included detailed circuit diagrams, conversion tables for chemical precursors, and document drafts advocating violent ideological action. Cross-referencing timestamps with internet relay chat logs found that the defendant engaged in sustained communication with overseas contacts on messaging platforms noted for their end-to-end encryption and use in hostile organisational coordination. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. The defence sought to introduce a narrative suggesting some materials were downloaded as “academic research” related to a previously unpublished novel the defendant was drafting. This proposition was vigorously contested by the Crown and discounted by the jury. The court considers the jury’s verdict as a reliable reflection of the evidential landscape. In the course of disclosure, a minor ancillary matter emerged concerning the presence of cannabis seeds found in a bedroom drawer at the defendant’s address. No cultivation or possession charges arose. While the defence posited this as indicative of common recreational drug experimentation, the court is obliged to treat such paraphenalia as an extraneous detail of no bearing on the principal offences before this court. The presence of such items does not mitigate the gravity of terrorism offending and should not distract from core considerations. It is acknowledged that the defendant’s family has submitted character references. These include a letter from a local scout group commending his participation in community litter-picking initiatives and a written statement from his brother, who described Mr H as “reserved but inherently kind.” While such attestations reflect well on certain aspects of the defendant’s persona, the court must balance these against the substantial risk posed by his conduct as established by the evidence. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. One aspect of the prosecution’s case concerned a foreign trip in August 2024, which the defendant characterised as tourism. However, flight manifests and immigration records place him in proximity to locations known to have hosted extremist assemblies. CCTV imagery captures a meeting with an individual later detained in relation to an unrelated drug trafficking inquiry in another jurisdiction. Although the drugs inquiry is extraneous and unrelated to Mr H, it does illustrate the complexity of overlapping criminal networks that occasionally emerge in such investigation matrices. The defence's suggestion that the defendant’s movement was purely coincidental does not persuade the court, in light of the broader incriminating context. The procedural history of this case has been far from devoid of complications. Disclosure in terrorism prosecutions typically entails sensitive materials subject to extensive vetting by multiple agencies, including the Security Service, the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division, and specialist advocates tasked with protecting sensitive intelligence sources. In this instance, disclosure paperwork numbered over 650 exhibits spanning both hard copy and electronic media, requiring redaction under closed material procedures sanctioned by the presiding trial judge. As the court observed in a recent unrelated proceeding, R v. Sharma [2024] EWCA Crim 2317, the demands of balancing open justice with national security imperatives continue to challenge procedural efficiency. The defence legal team represented Mr H with commendable diligence despite the inherent difficulties posed by resource constraints within the Legal Aid framework. The court notes with concern the recurrent administrative hurdles faced by defence counsel when seeking to appoint specialists in digital evidence for cases of this kind. Repeated requests for funding authorisations stretched over two months, underscoring the wider systemic limitations affecting timely defence preparation in complex counter-terrorism cases throughout the jurisdiction. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigators employed blockchain analytics to trace cryptocurrency transactions believed to be conducted by the defendant. A sum approximating £3,200 was transferred through unregulated mixers to anonymous vendors offering components compatible with explosive device assembly. The court recognises the increasing prominence of cryptocurrencies in facilitating covert purchase of illicit materials. Legal frameworks and enforcement techniques continue to evolve in this area but lag behind technological sophistication, posing significant challenges for judicial bodies. Surveillance by overt and covert units documented the defendant's late-night visits to an industrial estate on two occasions in November 2024. These trips were corroborated with mobile device location data and CCTV footprints, revealing meetings with individuals associated with a known proscribed organisation. The court appreciates the extraordinary allocation of investigative resources necessary to establish such connections and the patience required by law enforcement colleagues to build robust, admissible evidence. In a somewhat tangential vein, attention was drawn during submissions to a recent decision of the Court of Appeal in R v. Moncrieff [2025] EWCA Crim 2054, which addressed the parameters of “engaging in conduct in preparation” in the context of terrorist offending. Although Moncrieff concerned a different modality of travel and recruitment rather than material possession, the judgment remains instructive in articulating the requirement for discernible steps beyond mere ideation. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant is 30 years of age with no previous convictions or cautions. He attained academic qualifications including a Level 3 diploma in electronics and briefly engaged in employment history reflecting a stable work pattern until the latter half of 2023. His sudden withdrawal from professional life coincided with increased online activity promoting extremist ideology. Psychological assessment conducted by Dr Isobel Greene, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, detailed features of cognitive rigidity and moral absolutism but did not identify any formal psychiatric disorder warranting diminished responsibility. The consultant’s risk analysis estimates a high likelihood of recidivism absent comprehensive post-release supervision and mental health engagement. The extended family has voluntarily provided several letters of support to the court, delineating efforts to persuade the defendant away from radicalisation. Local charitable organisations have similarly expressed cautious optimism that appropriately structured interventions may hold some benefit though they recognise the gravity of risks involved. Such submissions are accorded due weight in mitigation but do not negate the necessity of an appropriate custodial response. The court acknowledges the parallel operation of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) upon the defendant’s imminent release. The Probation Service, jointly with CT Policing and NHS Forensic Psychiatry, have outlined a comprehensive risk management framework including electronic monitoring, geographic exclusion zones, and mandatory approved premises residency. This co-ordinated approach reflects best practice but remains contingent upon securing adequate funding and trained personnel within overstretched public services. A subtitle file for an extremist video stored on Mr H’s device contained the statement: We will kill all the fucking kikes. They control our media and politicians. The nature of the offending is grave and categorised at the highest level of culpability under the current Sentencing Council guidelines. Aggravating factors include planned indiscriminate harm, involvement in an encrypted chain of procurement, and the defendant’s technical expertise facilitating the design and manufacture of potentially lethal devices. Mitigation is confined to the absence of previous offending, youth, a late plea entered during trial, and some positive community engagement antecedent to the conduct in question. The court orders the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report. Probation are requested to consider the feasibility of a custodial sentence incorporating extended supervision post-release, including psychological interventions targeted at ideological disengagement and cognitive rigidity. The information gathered shall also feed into MAPPA planning to uphold public safety through graduated and monitored reintegration measures. The court places on record its thanks to Ms Penelope Graves QC appearing on behalf of the Crown and Mr Darren Maynard, counsel for the defence, appointed on a public funding certificate. Both have conducted their duties in a professional and measured manner under challenging circumstances. Appreciation is also extended to the court ushers and administrative staff whose work underpins the conduct of these proceedings. These sentencing remarks are issued on this 15th day of August 2025 in Court 5A at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been conducted and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities.
