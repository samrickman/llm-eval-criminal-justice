Mr H Case No. B2025/34789 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. F. GRANT Filed: 5 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences relate to a concerted scheme spanning from early 2023 until his arrest in January 2025. The defendant was first detained by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) on 19 January 2025 pursuant to a series of search warrants executed at his residence in Hove. Those warrants fell under the provisions of section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and were predicated upon extensive intelligence supplied by the Security Service, which indicated that encrypted communications linked to the defendant’s digital devices contained material suggestive of terrorist planning and procurement. At arrest, Mr H was found in possession of multiple encrypted USB drives, a semi-assembled electronic device, and a note book containing handwritten technical schematics. The detail and violence implicit in the nature of these materials necessitated a thorough and cautious investigative approach. Mr H was found with instructional worksheet with steps for constructing a device filled with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation preceding the defendant's arrest was characterised by a multi-agency effort, with CTPSE working alongside the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) and forensic experts from the Forensic Science Service (FSS). A distinctive feature was the use of artificial intelligence-assisted decryption software in an attempt to unravel the complex layered encryption Mr H employed across various devices. This endeavour was obstructed repeatedly by the use of privacy-preserving tools and frequent file obfuscation, hampering timely progress. The law enforcement agencies confronted significant cyber forensic challenges, not least due to the sophistication of the defendant’s operational security measures. Despite this, a panel of experts produced a detailed report highlighting the defendant’s escalating technical proficiency, which was noted to exceed that commonly observed amongst offenders convicted for similar ideological conduct. As an aside, election to conduct court proceedings in this jurisdiction results from the specialist regional designation of the Brighton Crown Court, which since its inception in 1989 has served as one of the principal venues for prosecuting terrorism offences within the South East Circuit. The court infrastructure, following refurbishment in 2023, includes secure waiting facilities, evidence presentation suites, and dedicated interview rooms prioritising the safeguarding of vulnerable individuals, an investment which has been welcomed within counter-terrorism circles. One must note, however, that despite these modernisations, operational pressures from a backlog of cases have nonetheless exerted pressure upon listing timetables and the availability of court resources, mirroring trends across the national estate. The proceedings have previously encountered multiple listing adjustments. Initially, the case management hearing was scheduled for 12 March 2025 but was adjourned due to the late disclosure of surveillance materials, compounded by a strike affecting the court clerks’ service. It is worth reflecting that, while these procedural interruptions are understandably frustrating, they do not impinge on the substantive merits of the case nor the court’s capacity to administer justice fairly. The resumption hearing took place on 24 April 2025, at which the prosecution formally presented its disclosure bundle, comprising over 850 exhibits including digital extracts, intercepted phone logs, and expert testimony. The defence raised no significant objections at that juncture, though highlighted the substantial volume of materials as a feature requiring sufficient preparation time. Family counselling reports were submitted by the defence, referencing the defendant's status as the primary carer for his elderly mother, who suffers from chronic heart disease. Letters from relatives and acquaintances depicted Mr H as “reserved but caring,” a description that juxtaposes uneasily with the nature of the offending, but which the court has no reason to doubt in relation to his personal character outside the matters at issue. These documents, while not mitigating the seriousness of the offences, provide context to his social support network. The court notes also communications from the Eastbourne Peace and Integration Forum, a grassroots organisation designed to provide dialogue opportunities in response to increasing community tensions related to radicalisation narratives. Their intervention expressed concern over the defendant’s reported withdrawal from communal activities and cited funding challenges faced by voluntary sector organisations engaged in de-radicalisation efforts. These submissions urge caution in sentencing to facilitate potential future rehabilitative engagement. While the court is mindful of such views, its paramount duty remains the protection of the public and the imposition of penalties proportionate to culpability. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Following the gathering and presentation of evidence, Mr H initially pleaded not guilty at the first arraignment on 5 May 2025. However, after the conclusion of the trial preparation hearing on 29 July 2025, the defendant entered guilty pleas on both counts. The pleas were entered at a late stage, following extensive cross-examination of witnesses and evidential challenges. The court accepts that this guilty plea represents acknowledgement of wrongdoing, but must emphasise the limited credit available given the timing of that plea, in line with recent Court of Appeal jurisprudence. This court recalls the principles set out in R v. Connell [2024] EWCA Crim 2334, which addressed the extent of credit admissible where a guilty plea is entered at an advanced stage of proceedings. The appeal court reiterated that credit must be commensurate with the extent to which the plea spares the victim and witnesses from the ordeal of a contested trial and salvages court time. Late pleas, the court held, offer diminished benefit and should be reflected accordingly in sentence mitigation. In the context of terrorism offending, sentencing principles have been consistently expounded in case law. R v. Al-Madani [2017] EWCA Crim 2640 reaffirmed the necessity of proportionate but substantial custodial custodianship where conduct evinces clear intent to facilitate mass harm. The case remains a touchstone for courts grappling with the balance between deterrence, public protection, and rehabilitation. Such guiding precedents underscore the gravity with which this judiciary views the multiple risks posed by offenders whose ideology posits indiscriminate violence as a mechanism for political change. The Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines 2023 issued by the Sentencing Council provide the framework for assessing culpability levels, identifying factors such as organisational sophistication, availability of weapons or explosives, degradations of life or limb intended, and the immediacy of risk. In Mr H’s case, the prosecution paints a picture of methodical planning, characterised by a modular approach to weapon fabrication and acquisition, as well as the seeking out of specialist knowledge hostile to mainstream societal norms. The defendant’s ability to adapt evolving technical expertise to sinister ends weighs heavily against him. The file recovered from Mr H’s device described a drone detonation aimed at emergency services following the initial blast. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The digital forensic evidence revealed the discovery of nineteen encrypted containers disguised with innocuous file nomenclature such as “GardeningManuals” and “HomeBudgetSheets.” Within these were stored various manuals pertaining to bomb-making, chemical processing, and projectile mechanics. Command line logs established the defendant’s recurrent deployment of anonymisation software, substantially hindering traffic analysis and evidencing an awareness of law enforcement surveillance techniques. The digital exhibit thus reflects a high degree of calculated intent and premeditation rather than inadvertent or casual possession. Among the recovered material, investigators uncovered downloaded videos depicting the manufacture and use of instrumented autonomous vehicles intended as delivery platforms for explosives, a matter that underlines the increasing confluence between terrorism and emerging technologies. This nexus presents significant challenges for counter-terrorism strategies and policing capabilities, requiring both technical expertise and coordinated inter-agency cooperation. The evidence shown at trial included transcripts of conversations with individuals outside this jurisdiction, raising issues of cross-border facilitation networks. The court appreciates that international partnerships with foreign agencies, including Europol and Interpol, were vital in disrupting these connections. Such cooperation is a salutary reminder that terrorism is a transnational phenomenon, and no single jurisdiction can effectively mitigate its risks in isolation. The defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover. Defence submissions proposed, inter alia, that some quantities of chemicals found at the defendant’s residence were part of a hobbyist interest in forensic toxicology. They further attempted to assert that certain surveillance photographs depicting late-night movements represented inconsequential reflections of insomnia. The court, however, finds these explanations to strain credulity given the wider evidential matrix. These innocent explanations are managed judicially with care, but must yield to the totality of the facts demonstrating a clear nexus to terrorist intent. The court also reviewed a comparative historical precedent: R v. Hardy [2019] EWCA Crim 1421, concerning the inadvertent possession of controlled substances by a defendant engaged in an unrelated political protest. In that case, the court acknowledged the potential for innocent explanation but concluded that possession on such a scale and in such circumstances necessarily implied mens rea. The present case resonates with that principle. A few tangential details have been addressed in the course of proceedings. For example, mention was made of an unrelated arrest of a co-defendant, Mr J, who was apprehended in a separate jurisdiction for offences involving criminal damage to a church noticeboard. That conduct, while serious in its own right, bears no connection to Mr H or his offending behaviour and is accordingly irrelevant to these sentencing remarks. The court is also aware of non-pecuniary concerns affecting the defendant's family, including the estranged partner’s ongoing civil litigation concerning harassment claims wholly unconnected to the matters at bar. Such peripheral matters have been noted but bear no material influence here. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. Turning to travel records, the defendant made a brief overseas trip to the Balkans in May 2024, ostensibly for hiking purposes. Yet scrutiny of CCTV footage from the region places him in proximity to locations known for extremist gatherings. Furthermore, his movements were contemporaneously accompanied by encrypted electronic correspondence with individuals listed in national security watchlists. Defence argued this was coincidental; however, the court concludes from the evidence that this travel was deliberate and integrally connected with his preparatory conduct. It is necessary, in a longer view, to remind ourselves that such investigations impose very considerable burdens on law enforcement and allied agencies. The police resources deployed in this inquiry totalled over 12,000 man-hours, spread over nearly two years, encompassing covert surveillance, digital forensics, international liaison, and numerous interview sessions. These figures are but a small facet of a wider pattern of resource intensiveness that characterises counter-terrorism work. The court appreciates the commitment of officers, analysts, and civilian staff whose dedication often goes unheralded. In a wholly different context, the court also notes the impact of rising non-violent public order offences on stretched police resources. The recent spike in unauthorised street gatherings involves complex policing demands and has in certain regions led to the redeployment of specialised units away from priority areas, including terrorism investigations. Such systemic challenges underscore the importance of having flexible, well-resourced agencies that can maintain vigilance without losing focus. Legal Aid provision in this case was fraught with difficulty. Initial applications for funding to instruct a digital forensic expert were met with delay and ambiguity, requiring multiple interventions by the court to secure proper authorisation. This experience echoes broader frustrations voiced by practitioners within Crown Court settings, who report chronic under-resourcing of criminal defence representation, particularly in complex terrorism cases. The court hopes that the Legal Aid reforms currently under consideration by Parliament adequately address these systemic flaws, for justice for all depends on the equitable ability to deploy expert advice regardless of financial means. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial investigations discovered a series of cryptocurrency transactions routed through mixing services consistent with attempts to conceal payment origins. The defendant transferred substantial sums to online vendors specialising in dual-use components and related paraphernalia. While cryptocurrency is lauded in some quarters for its decentralised convenience, in the criminal realm it facilitates near-anonymous transfer of value, complicating investigations and enhancing risks. The court draws attention to this evolving dimension of financial crime, which, though technologically complex, is plainly of material consequence to public safety. Among other items, the investigation uncovered communications referencing manufacturing processes for detonators and methods for remote ignition. These details, though technical, reveal a clear pattern of purposeful acquisition and assembly of dangerous materials. Defence counsel contended that the defendant’s interest was purely academic, but common sense and the balance of probabilities suggest otherwise. The court must guard against a legalistic narrowing of judgment that fails to appreciate the real-world danger such acts implicate. Several months in custody prior to trial brought a marked deterioration in Mr H’s mental health, as documented in reports from the Forensic Mental Health Service at Brighton Royal Hospital. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Edith Liverpool noted in her assessment dated 14 July 2025 that the defendant exhibited increased levels of anxiety, insomnia, and dysregulated mood symptoms consistent with adjustment disorder. While no formal psychotic illness was diagnosed, the report cautioned about the risk of self-harm in the absence of appropriate support. These clinical observations weigh on the court in considering the appropriate balance between immediate custodial punishment and facilitation of subsequent therapeutic engagement. A document stored in a hidden container was found to contain material from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. On personal circumstances, Mr H is a 31-year-old university graduate, having obtained a BSc in computer science from a well-regarded institution in 2016. His prior employment included periods in software development roles for commercial firms, during which co-workers described him as intelligent but occasionally socially withdrawn. Records indicate a history of unstable housing and periods of unemployment following 2021, which may have contributed to his social isolation. Letters of support emanate from a community arts organisation for at-risk youth, to which Mr H volunteered sporadically from early 2022 until late 2023. While such contributions are acknowledged, their bearing as mitigation is, of course, circumscribed by the gravity of the offences. As the Court of Appeal noted in R v. Ward [2024] EWCA Crim 1190, admirable personal qualities or community service do not diminish culpability in offences involving terrorist intent. The probation service has also furnished a Chronology and OASys report, prepared in June 2025, summarising his prior interaction with criminal justice agencies. Notably, the defendant has no prior convictions. The probation officer, however, assesses a high risk of further radicalised offending in the absence of robust interventional programming, citing cognitive rigidity and a tendency towards conspiratorial thinking as key factors. This clinical and behavioural profile aligns with the findings of Dr Liverpool. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. In her psychological assessment, Dr Amelia Schwann describes Mr H as exhibiting “intense ideological fixation” coupled with “limitations in empathy and cognitive flexibility.” While clear evidence of mental illness is absent, the report emphasises the substantial challenges intrinsic to de-radicalisation in this case. It is noted that the defendant declined offers of psychological intervention during remand, diminishing prospects of successful immediate rehabilitation. The risk assessment places Mr H firmly in the category of high risk of serious harm, underscoring the imperative of custodial containment with carefully managed release conditions. It must be acknowledged that public protection is the court’s foremost concern when sentencing in terrorism cases. The impact of violent extremism transcends individual victims and strikes at the foundations of societal cohesion and democratic governance. This court recognises that for those convicted of such offences, the sentence imposed is necessarily severe. The court remains grateful to the dedicated professionals of CTPSE, the National Crime Agency, the experts from the Royal Sussex County Hospital forensic psychiatry unit, and all voluntary organisations involved in the management and rehabilitation efforts pertaining to Mr H. Their unflagging resolve under constricted budgets and complex operational environments deserves commendation. In conclusion, the defendant’s conduct involved substantial planning, sophistication, and intent to cause mass harm. Mitigation is limited to the absence of previous convictions, educational achievements, and the late-stage plea of guilty. This court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service encompassing a full evaluation of risk, suitability for engagement in intervention programmes, and the feasibility of custodial frameworks incorporating extended licence supervision and electronic monitoring. This court sits within the well-established jurisdiction of the Crown Court, a critical part of the justice system designed to deliver weighted sentences reflecting both community protection and offender accountability. All parties are reminded of their rights to appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, with time limits prescribed accordingly. The presence of reporting restrictions under section 4 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 remains under review, and the court will lift or adapt them when appropriate.
