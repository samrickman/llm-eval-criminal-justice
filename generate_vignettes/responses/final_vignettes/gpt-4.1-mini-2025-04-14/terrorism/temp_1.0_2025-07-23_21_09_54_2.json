Mr H Case No. B2025/18402 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. M. WILKINS Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is alleged to have taken place between April 2023 and the defendant’s arrest in February 2025. The proceedings in this matter have been lengthy and complex, reflecting the serious nature of the offences and the extensive multi-agency investigations required to bring the defendant to justice. Mr H was initially arrested on 26 February 2025 following the execution of a search warrant at his residence on the orders of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU). The warrant was issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following intelligence obtained via signal intercepts and digital footprint analysis, suggesting the defendant’s engagement in preparatory acts linked to unspecified terrorist planning. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Prior to the arrest, this court received correspondence and reports from various agencies involved in the investigation. The West Midlands CTU input extended to comprehensive forensic examination of seized devices, including laptop computers, encrypted mobile telephones, and removable storage media. The National Digital Exploitation Centre (NDEC) played a significant role in deciphering encrypted communications. The sensitivity of these procedures necessitated some hearings to be partially held in camera under section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013, to preserve national security interests—a fact that, regrettably, has complicated public transparency but was unavoidable. It is regrettable that the case experienced multiple adjournments, some attributable to the defendant’s legal team’s late applications for additional disclosure, citing newly discovered material, including a series of emails and social media messages dating from 2023. These applications delayed the sentencing hearing originally listed for 10 September 2025, and it was only today, 17 October 2025, that the matter could proceed. The court notes, parenthetically, that such delays place a considerable strain on court resources but recognises that justice demands thoroughness. The role played by various voluntary organisations warrants recognition. Letters tendered from the Birmingham Community Trust and the Midland Resilience Initiative attest to Mr H’s sporadic engagement with outreach programmes aimed at countering radicalisation. Although neither organisation claims to possess specialised deradicalisation resources, their involvement underscores the patchwork nature of preventative strategies in this jurisdiction. Given funding constraints and staff shortages—especially acute in deprived urban contexts—these organisations face formidable challenges in sustaining effective interventions. It is also necessary to observe the continued under-resourcing of forensic psychiatric services that, in this case, prevented timely assessments early in proceedings. The delay in instructing an independent psychiatric expert arose principally from the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted authorisation process, further compounded by reduced operational capacity at the Midlands Secure Hospital. Such systemic inefficiencies are the subject of repeated judicial commentary, including in R (on the application of Jackson) v Secretary of State for Justice [2021] EWHC 1658 (Admin), which lamented the impact of chronic underfunding on timely justice. The court affords its thanks to counsel on both sides: Ms L. Pennington appearing for the Crown, whose submissions were cogent and delivered with appropriate restraint; and Mr D. Shanley, for the defence, instructed pursuant to legal aid arrangements. The courtroom has been refurbished recently, with improved acoustics and videolink facilities which have aided the progress of today’s sentencing hearing. Turning to the factual background of the case, the following remarks highlight the principal evidential findings supported by the jury’s verdict. Mr H’s notes described placing an explosive in a garage with no CCTV behind Nando’s, targeting 3pm near Cornbrook station to hit the passing crowd from the Leeds match. Historical context is germane in situating the seriousness of such offences. The Terrorism Act 2006 was enacted in the aftermath of the July 2005 London bombings, reflecting Parliament’s determination to provide law enforcement with adequate tools against emergent asymmetric threats. Section 5 offences, in particular, address preparatory conduct that may not manifest in overt violent acts but nevertheless signal imminent danger to public safety. Prior case law, including R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, underscores the imperative of robust sentencing to deter preparatory terrorism-related conduct. Mr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Technical evidence presented during trial included a detailed forensic examination of a storage device encrypted using VeraCrypt, containing manuals on explosive manufacture and instructions for drone modification. Evidence also emerged of encrypted communications between the defendant and third parties associated with an organisation proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Notably, digital timestamp records confirmed activity during national remembrance events, suggesting symbolism in timing. The defence posited several alternative explanations, including interest in drone technologies for lawful recreational use and possession of explosive material manuals for \"academic research.\" The jury found these contentions unpersuasive in light of the broader context and the defendant’s conduct. It is pertinent to mention, and the court appreciates, the discourse on the liability of co-defendants or associates in terrorism conspiracies. While such individuals may face distinct charges—ranging from the possession of bladed articles in school grounds (which does not arise here) to unrelated offences of benefit fraud by family members—none of these have any bearing on the defendant’s culpability or sentencing. The principle of individual responsibility remains paramount. The court further considered the relevance of historical sentencing guidelines relating to offences such as affray involving weapon use (for example, stabbings in licensed premises with injuries attributed to pool cues) or non-terrorism related arson in commercial premises. These matters, while instructive in highlighting the judiciary’s approach to public safety, are not directly applicable to this case. The defendant's laptop contained a detailed list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including NewLook hair bleach and SuperDrug brand nail varnish remover. Regarding the defendant’s background, Mr H is a 30-year-old with a degree in computer engineering from a Midlands university. Prior to the offences, he was employed briefly in a software development role, resigning under undisclosed circumstances. Character references reflect a person described as “quiet,” “introspective,” and somewhat socially isolated, with no prior criminal convictions recorded. Letters submitted on his behalf include support from a local cycling advocacy group where the defendant volunteered as a maintenance technician. While commendable, such mitigation must be weighed against the gravity of the offences committed. The court’s role is not to diminish the value of positive civic engagement but rather to ensure that sentencing appropriately reflects overall harm. Addressing the defendant’s mental health, the court received a report from Dr Samuel Perry, a consultant forensic psychiatrist engaged by the defence. His report contained detailed clinical observations, describing tendencies toward \"fixed ideation\" and \"moral absolutism,\" though he did not find evidence of major mental illness or psychosis. Dr Perry cautioned that while treatment might have a role post-release, the risk of recidivism in extremist activity remains significant without intensive supervision. Notably, the Mental Health Act 1983 offers statutory powers to detain persons posing a risk by reason of mental disorder, yet the absence of qualifying illness in Mr H’s case limits such options. The court must therefore rely on custodial and ancillary conditions in service of public protection. The probation pre-sentence report, compiled by Ms Nina Clarke, emphasised the complexity of managing offenders convicted of terrorism-related offences. While recognising Mr H’s educational aptitude and potential for desistance, Ms Clarke warned of the limited availability of specialised offender management resources, particularly in the context of escalating strain on the National Probation Service. The report suggested recommended interventions include the Combined Extremism Treatment Programme (CETP) and GPS monitoring on licence. The court records the submissions made on behalf of the Crown concerning public interest and deterrence. The Crown emphasised the need to send a clear message that preparatory conduct leading to terrorism will attract severe custody, especially where sophistication and planning elements are evident. This approach finds support in sentencing authorities and accords with legislative intent. Conversely, defence counsel urged the court to consider the defendant’s lack of previous offending, partial engagement with community-based interventions such as the Midlands Peace Network, and the relatively early disruption of the terrorist preparations before any loss of life occurred. While mitigation is no doubt limited in such cases, these factors warrant consideration in calibrating sentence. Officers found a Buffer-scheduled tweet containing a link to South Manchester Synagogue followed by a countdown-themed message. The defendant’s travel history is of interest. He undertook trips to Eastern European destinations, ostensibly for photography and cultural exchange. However, evidence showed an attempt to reach areas proximate to conflict zones during periods of unrest. For instance, records include a cancelled flight to a contested border region in Ukraine during July 2024, thwarted when the airport was closed due to counterinsurgency operations. While innocent explanations are plausible, the pattern of travel is consistent with preparatory conduct. In reviewing procedural history, this case underscores the escalating administrative demands on the courts. The volume and nature of disclosure required necessitated a team of law clerks and judges’ associates to coordinate redactions, often running into hundreds of hours. Technological limitations in the court’s case management software have often hampered efficiency, exacerbated by intermittent failures of digital transcription services. Indeed, the official transcripts contain several caveated passages where inaudible speech or overlapping counsel interventions complicated record accuracy. Additionally, there were intermittent delays due to interpreters’ availability and late arrivals of court clerks, which, while unfortunate, were managed with professionalism by the usher and courtroom staff. The judiciary recognises the burden placed on administrative personnel amid increasingly complex listings, compounded by the ongoing impacts of recent industrial actions in the civil service. Mr H was highly focused on the Territorial Army centre in Buxton and its cleaner. The notes recovered from Mr H’s flat described an operation in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial forensics revealed Mr H’s involvement in cryptocurrency transactions of significant value. Notably, a transfer of 1.4 Bitcoin, valued at approximately £35,000 at the time, was identified moving through anonymising “mixer” services before reaching an account associated with a darknet marketplace’s vendor known for dual-use components with potential military application. This illustrates not only a technical proficiency but also an intent to obfuscate financial trails, a marker of elevated culpability. The court notes with concern the difficulties these technological interfaces present to law enforcement and judicial authorities, as underscored in the report of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy (2023), which highlighted how rapid innovation in encrypted financial systems outpaces regulatory mechanisms. The judiciary must remain vigilant to the challenges posed by emerging technologies. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. The defendant’s personal history, while broadly uneventful, has certain salient aspects. He reportedly experienced social marginalisation during adolescence, with schooling interrupted for medical reasons including chronic migraines, though no formal learning disabilities were diagnosed. The mitigation presented included references to his occasional role as a carer for an elderly relative, underscoring familial responsibility. Nevertheless, the court was made aware of an unrelated incident involving a co-tenant at the defendant’s residence, who was found to be in unlawful possession of cannabis during an unrelated police search. Counsel clarified emphatically that this incident is categorically unrelated to Mr H. Similarly, the landlord of Mr H’s flat had received a noise abatement notice several years before, again unrelated to the case at hand. Considerable attention was paid to the ongoing strain on probation services in the West Midlands, as attested by reports from the National Probation Service Regional Director, which document fluctuating staff vacancies and increasing caseloads. Similarly, the court noted the challenges faced by mental health services in the region, where waiting times for forensic psychology assessments can exceed six months, a delay which undermines timely risk evaluation. Lastly, it bears repeating that legal practitioners must navigate these procedural complexities while ensuring clients’ rights and equality of arms are maintained, a pursuit made all the more challenging by restrictive budgets and the mounting administrative burden imposed by digital disclosure requirements. The opening frame of a storyboard for a planned hate video featured the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Having considered all material before it, including the expert psychological assessment from Dr Amal Bhatti, consultant forensic clinical psychologist, who opined that the defendant displays entrenched extremist beliefs with cognitive rigidity, yet no major psychiatric disorder, the court is satisfied that the risk assessment warrants custodial detention with stringent conditions upon release. As observed in the seminal decision in R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, in terrorism-related offending, the sentencing objectives of deterrence, protection of the public, and denunciation take precedence, balanced against the prospects for rehabilitation. While credit is afforded for the late guilty pleas entered on the first day of sentencing, the court must temper such credit with recognition of the prolonged proceedings and resource consumption. The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared by the West Midlands Probation Service, with particular attention to the applicability of enhanced supervision measures under MAPPA Category 3 protocols, suitability for high-intensity Cognitive Behavioural Interventions targeting extremist behaviour, and the feasibility of imposing electronic monitoring and exclusion zones as part of license conditions.
