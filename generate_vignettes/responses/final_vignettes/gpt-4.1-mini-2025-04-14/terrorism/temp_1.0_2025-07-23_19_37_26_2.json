Mr H Case No. B2025/25688 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. M. Tilbury Filed: 4 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court to be sentenced following conviction for offences contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and a count under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, being possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism. The period under consideration spans from early 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in February 2025. The procedural history of this case is notable both for its complexity and the degree to which it exemplifies the challenges faced by modern counter-terrorism law enforcement and judicial processes. Mr H was first remanded in custody following his initial appearance before South Birmingham Magistrates’ Court on the 27th day of February 2025, having been arrested several days prior under warrant executed by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM). The offence emerged following an intelligence-led investigation, codenamed Operation Moonlace, which drew together multiple strands of surveillance, forensic digital recovery, and multi-jurisdictional liaison. The defendant’s digital footprint was under scrutiny for several months prior to the arrest, during which time covert technical surveillance and electronic intercepts were authorised under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. These lawful intercepts were the subject of ongoing judicial oversight, including reviews by the Independent Office for Surveillance Commissioners (IOSC). In an era where terrorism investigations increasingly hinge upon digital evidence, it is important to emphasise the logistical and operational strain placed on forensic teams. Indeed, it was noted in evidence that the National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES), tasked with decrypting and analysing encrypted messaging traffic, faced delays due to processing backlogs which have only worsened with increased demand. Such operational realities do not excuse delay but do provide context for the sometimes protracted timelines encountered in cases of this nature. By way of example, the defendant’s initial bail application was refused on grounds of risk to the public and ongoing investigative interests. The case was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 12 July 2025 but the plea was not entered until the first day of the trial scheduled for 22 September 2025, necessitating an adjournment of the sentencing hearing. Late pleas in terrorism cases, especially where significant forensic evidence has been collected and disclosure issues extensively canvassed, will, as the Court of Appeal has repeatedly observed, attract more limited credit for admission of guilt (see R v. Simms [2023] EWCA Crim 1782). A \"Channel\" referral was made by the defendant's secondary school in 2019 following concerning essays with extremist overtones. That referral was, however, discontinued after limited engagement. The Court notes that such early interventions, while a crucial part of the Prevent strategy, often struggle with incomplete information and the challenge of distinguishing youthful dissent from genuine radicalisation. Criticism of such schemes, sometimes politically motivated, should not obscure the complexity of pre-emptive safeguarding work. This case was further complicated by scheduling constraints and administrative challenges, including a period in April 2025 when court strikes disrupted listing availability and delayed progress. The defendant’s Legal Aid provisions also encountered administrative hurdles, including protracted negotiations over funding for independent expert psychiatric evaluations. These systemic issues, while unfortunate, did not themselves prejudice the fairness of proceedings. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The facts of the case are grounded in a sustained pattern of online activity, material possession, and preparatory conduct suggestive of an intention to commit acts capable of causing serious harm. It is instructive that the accused’s behaviour demonstrated both a degree of sophistication and operational security, including the use of encrypted communication platforms and anonymising tools. The court is grateful for the diligent submissions of Ms Fiona Redmayne, acting on behalf of the Crown, whose opening and closing arguments were lucid and grounded in the evidential record. Likewise, Mr Charlie Durnell, instructed on behalf of the defendant via a Legal Aid order, has acted with commendable professionalism throughout, notwithstanding the complexities encountered. It is a poignant reflection of contemporary realities that forensic analysis now routinely involves an amalgam of technical disciplines: cryptographic expertise, metadata triangulation, even blockchain transaction tracing. In this case, a fierce and innovative analytical approach was employed to unravel the defendant’s digital activities which, on a surface scan, might have otherwise evaded detection amid the great volume of online noise. While matters of ideological extremism are often remote from everyday experience, the Court acknowledges the courage and composure of witnesses who have contributed to the proceedings, many of whom operate in challenging operational environments. Likewise, the wider community impact is palpable—the social fabric inevitably strained when terror-related offences come to light. Furthermore, it is regrettable that the defendant’s cohabitation arrangement was disrupted by the execution of a search warrant, resulting in a temporary displacement of several unrelated and law-abiding tenants. This collateral impact, while unintended, is not insignificant in the calculus of community harm. The sentencing framework remains guided by the Terrorism Act 2006 and the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guidelines on terrorism offences. These direct particular regard to factors such as level of commitment, degree of planning, proximity to potential harm, and risk to the public. Historically, it is notable that the legislature has sought both to provide robust mechanisms for deterrence and to balance rehabilitative possibilities, all within the prism of proportionality fundamental to criminal justice. Mr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties. Of importance is the transformation of Mr H's online activities, from comparatively innocuous postings through to the circulation of materials endorsing extremist narratives and technical advice on explosives. Linguistic experts, operating independently of the prosecution team, have testified to the coherence and consistency of the ideological messaging disseminated under the pseudonym “Nightingale43.” Such factors weigh heavily in assessing culpability and future risk. Mr H drafted a sequence involving a drone-triggered second device to go off after first responders reached the scene. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The volume and quality of digital evidence recovered was considerable, including multiple encrypted storage devices, a range of electronic components with probable dual-use capabilities, and detailed notes concerning detonator construction. It is worth recording that the defendant’s meticulous organisation of digital folders, including misleading labels intended to obscure content, attest to a high level of operational security awareness. In the midst of these observations, the court also acknowledges evidence put forward concerning the defendant’s modest theatrical pursuits in local amateur drama companies and his volunteer service at a Northfield community library. Both of these engagements demonstrate facets of his personality and do not, in themselves, bear upon sentencing but serve to illustrate the multidimensional character of individuals before the court. The defendant had a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Bright and Shine hair bleach and Boots brand nail varnish remover. Significantly, the Court rejects defence arguments seeking to characterise the defendant’s assemblage of materials as only linked to a hobbyist interest in pyrotechnics. The context, viewed holistically, negates such an assertion. This is consistent with the findings in R v. Ashwood [2022] EWCA Crim 2653, in which possession of similar components without lawful explanation was held to demonstrate clear terrorist intent. It is noted that a small penalty charge for driving without an MOT dating from 2021 was tendered during mitigation, an offence which, whilst unconnected with the present charges, is indicative of the defendant’s occasional disregard for regulatory compliance outside of any ideological context. Such unrelated matters are recorded here for full accuracy but do not affect sentencing outcomes in this case. A noteworthy procedural episode concerns an unrelated arson which delayed listing in the neighbouring Birmingham Crown Court. A deliberate fire targeting a commercial property twice delayed progress across several trials that week, including this one. This serves as an unfortunate reminder of the knock-on effects adverse events have on the administration of justice. A social media draft recovered from Mr H’s device linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was set to publish shortly after a threatening statement. In April 2024, the defendant travelled to the city of Brussels, claiming on one occasion to attend a conference on renewable energy. Immigration data, combined with CCTV capture in peripheral suburbs known to host radicalised networks, suggest alternative purposes were prevalent. Interactions with an individual subsequently arrested in connection with funding extremist material lend further weight to the Crown’s case narrative. Professional commitments prevented the resignation of the defendant’s previous employer, a local manufacturing firm, until June 2023. It is relevant that Human Resources had initiated an internal disciplinary review following reports of unexplained absences coinciding with cross-border communications. Such workplace dynamics, though incidental to criminal liability, underscore the impact of covert ideology on ordinary social functioning. A particularly striking feature of the prosecution case was the involvement of cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain forensic experts traced multiple transfers from wallets linked to the defendant to vendors trading in dual-use chemicals and sophisticated triggering mechanisms. While the Court acknowledges ongoing debates about the regulation of decentralised currencies, the lens of criminal responsibility must remain sharply focused. The cleaner of the Territorial Army centre in Buxton was central to Mr H's plot. His strategy included a written plan in which he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The forensic financial analysis, conducted by a leading expert instructed by the Crown, was exemplary in piecing together on-chain movements of value. The defendant sought to obscure the origin of funds through a combination of mixing services and peer-to-peer exchanges, tactics emblematic of increasing criminal sophistication in the digital age. The Court is mindful that tackling misuse of such technologies demands extensive cross-border cooperation and persistent resource investment. Public agencies continually strive to upgrade capabilities to meet evolving threats. In the interim, safeguard duties rest on courts to apply established principles robustly. The prosecution laid emphasis on covert surveillance documenting visits by Mr H to a disused industrial estate on the outskirts of the city. The four occasions observed corresponded with the receipt of key components and have, in the court’s view, evidential coherence. The sheer operational effort – hours of unobserved stakeouts, coordination of CCTV and mobile tracking – underlines the significant resource cost of these investigations. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. In mitigation, Mr H is a young man of 31 years, holder of a university degree in electrical engineering, which accounts for the technical knowledge visible in his online communications and material assemblage. Character references describe him as polite, articulate, and at times introspective, albeit subject to social withdrawal and periods of depression. The Probation Service report highlights the well-documented phenomenon of “echo chamber” reinforcement seen in online radicalisation, noting this defendant’s extensive immersion in ideologically homogenous forums. The report also flags moderate risk of self-harm associated with underlying mental health vulnerabilities, though no formal diagnosis of psychosis or personality disorder has been established. It bears mention that several probation officers are currently facing particularly high caseloads; staffing shortages nationally have seen average allocated cases per officer rise beyond sustainable levels, unfortunately affecting all aspects of supervision and rehabilitation opportunities. Similarly, community mental health teams report backlogs of weeks to months, limiting timely intervention. The court expresses concern about these systemic pressures, as timely and constructive engagement in structured deradicalisation initiatives is crucial to reducing reoffending. Service delivery gaps are thus not abstract problems but have tangible consequences for public safety in cases such as this. A typed speech draft intended for a video upload included the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the New World Order. A psychiatric report prepared by Dr Jonathan Faraday, consultant forensic psychiatrist, is detailed and professionally composed, providing valuable clinical insight. While diagnosing no formal mental illness, Dr Faraday notes a rigid ideological worldview and reduced cognitive empathy. He warns of substantial current risk of serious harm without targeted intervention and robust supervision post-custody. Dr Faraday acknowledges the potential benefit of structured programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), noting, however, that completion rates are variable and relapse post-disengagement remains a concern. He advises that any release should be contingent upon compliance with stringent licence conditions, including electronic monitoring and restricted internet access. Letters submitted by third-sector organisations located in the defendant’s former residential quarter refer to ongoing engagement efforts. These relate to initiatives distinct from radicalisation, such as employability training and youth mentoring. Their cautiously optimistic tone reflects an understanding of risk without falling into either complacency or fatalism. These sentencing remarks would be incomplete without a brief review of relevant case law. The judgment in R v. Bakker [2024] EWCA Crim 1102 provided guidance on the balance of deterrence and rehabilitation in terrorism offences, underscoring that where the public interest demands, sentences must be pronounced that fully reflect the gravity and societal impact of the offence. No doubt, it will be said by some commentators that sentences in terrorism cases unduly restrict liberty or risk marginalising sections of the community. While such concerns merit ongoing policy discussion, the courts have been unequivocal in affirming public protection as the paramount consideration. As Lord Hughes stated in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, \"In no area is protection of the public more vital than in the response to terrorism.\" From the evidential record, the Court finds the highest level of culpability established with little ambiguity. The defendant’s knowledge, deliberate operational planning, and persistence over an extended period identify a conduct category requiring stern sanction, subject to proportionality and mitigation. The mitigation available remains limited. Mr H’s lack of previous convictions, his educational achievements, and the late plea will be weighed accordingly. The plea, entered only at trial, entitles him to reduction of sentence, but this is markedly constrained. The Court therefore reserves final sentencing pending receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report from the Probation Service. The report shall address risk assessment and management strategies including electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, cognitive behavioural interventions, and the feasibility of approved premises placement. Additionally, an updated psychological evaluation is requested to consider any evolution of risk and receptivity to intervention. These sentencing remarks are provided this day, 4 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. A full public record is maintained in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal rulings regarding conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the Central Sentencing Database and related statutory agencies.
