Mr H Case No. B2025/28934 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. K. MALCOLMSON Filed: 2 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction by jury on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006. Specifically, he stands convicted of one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a), and one count of possessing an article for a purpose connected to the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending period in question is identified as spanning from the summer of 2023 up to the date of his arrest in early 2025. This court acknowledges the considerable public interest and attendant sensitivities that surround prosecutions under these statutory provisions. The effective administration of justice in such matters is invariably conducted under the additional scrutiny attendant upon the balancing of public protection imperatives and the rights of the accused. The present proceedings unfolded within this context, and I wish at the outset to commend the parties for the professional manner in which they have conducted themselves throughout the trial and ancillary hearings. It is necessary to outline the procedural history to contextualise these sentencing remarks fully. Initially arrested on 3 February 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West, Mr H was detained after the execution of warrants at premises in Easton, Bristol. That arrest was supported by extensive intelligence and investigatory work, including the use of judicially-authorised intercept under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, as well as close cooperation with the intelligence services. Notably, section 47 bail was granted with stringent conditions pending the prosecution’s preparations. This court notes that the process of case management saw a series of adjournments attributable in part to the late disclosure of material derived from encrypted electronic devices, and in part due to resource limitations within forensic teams, in line with observations made in R v. Laverick [2018] EWCA Crim 384, which highlight the ongoing challenges that large-scale digital forensics present to both prosecution and defence teams. While such delays are regrettable, they remain understood as part of the growing pains inherent in counter-terrorism criminal justice. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) counsel, Ms Fiona Terrington, has submitted a comprehensive skeleton argument grounded in the 2023 Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines, emphasising the need for robust deterrence against preparatory conduct of this nature. Defence counsel, Mr Jonah Meredith, instructed through Legal Aid following initial funding challenges and mandate delays, has made cogent submissions that the court should consider all mitigating factors, including Mr H’s lack of previous convictions and documented attempts to disengage from extremist ideology prior to arrest. Mr H possessed bomb-making instructions outlining a device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. It is well established that the court’s sentencing discretion in terrorism-related matters is subject to particular statutory and common law considerations, enshrined with the overarching imperative of community protection enshrined in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and elaborated in the Sentencing Council’s guideline preamble. Of note is the Court of Appeal’s exposition in R v. Prakash [2020] EWCA Crim 865, which underscores that the covert and subversive nature of terrorism offences demands sentences proportionate not only to the individual’s culpability but also reflective of the wider deterrent necessity. In the months following arrest, Mr H was subject to pre-trial remand with conditions reflecting assessed risk levels. The institution managing his custody reported the defendant’s conduct during remand as compliant, though not without moments of disengagement from available rehabilitative programmes. The case additionally attracted multi-agency coordination under MAPPA Category 3, consistent with established protocols for individuals posing ideological risk as outlined in the Ministry of Justice’s 2023 MAPPA Annual Report. Such coordinated efforts remain crucial despite acknowledged systemic pressures arising from increased caseloads and staffing shortages within probation and mental health services. These systemic pressures extend to forensic and clinical psychology services. The present case was supported by a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr Lydia Tassell, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Broadfield Secure Unit. Her report details Mr H’s psychological profile, with observations on cognitive rigidity and ideological entrenchment but no formal diagnosis of psychotic disorder or personality disorder as such. Comparable assessments in R v. Dawes [2024] EWCA Crim 1043 have demonstrated that elevated risk in terrorism cases arises often in the absence of diagnosable illness, but rather out of cognitive and ideological fixation. The court also received letters from a variety of sources including the community-based organisation Greenfield Outreach, which provided supervised mentoring support to Mr H prior to his arrest. Their submission detailed ongoing efforts to engage Mr H in vocational education and deradicalisation but candidly acknowledged only sporadic attendance and fluctuating responsiveness. Such endeavours, while laudable, illustrate the complexities confronting practitioners working at the interface of criminal justice and community rehabilitation. An unrelated point of administrative note: the court registrar confirms that due to staff shortages in the court usher team, several hearings experienced delayed starts. This, while not material to the substantive justice, reflects the persistent under-resourcing that characterises operational delivery across competing priorities within the court estate. Likewise, Covid-era restrictions had long since lifted but sporadic localised infections around the city occasionally interfered with scheduling. The case did well to avoid trial delay at critical junctures — a credit to the effective advocacy of both the prosecution and defence teams, the efficiency of the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism division, and the case management skills of the assigned judicial clerk. The court also expresses appreciation for the victim liaison officers who facilitated prompt communication with impacted parties, whose own well-being the court recognises as a priority in all prosecutions. Victims described as “measured” in their demeanour, the witnesses provided testimony with considerable courage under stressful conditions. It is also pertinent, though peripheral, to record that the defendant’s younger sibling is currently subject to separate investigatory processes unrelated to terrorism, specifically regarding allegations of benefit fraud, as disclosed to the court in a letter from the Legal Aid Agency’s caseworker. The court affirms that no linkage exists between those proceedings and the matters presently before this tribunal. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Turning to the digital forensic evidence, the prosecution relied heavily on data recovered from encrypted devices found at the defendant’s residence. The technical difficulty in extracting material compounded investigative timelines, a circumstance echoed widely in recent counter-terrorism cases as outlined in the Intelligence and Security Committee’s 2024 Annual Review. The extraction revealed not only preparatory instructions consistent with the manufacture of explosive devices but also encrypted logs of communications with known extremists abroad. Such technological evidence was subject to rigorous challenge but ultimately accepted in the course of the trial. An ancillary but illustrative delay arose during efforts to confirm trace evidence. Specialist chemical analysts, working under pressure within the national forensic laboratory system, discovered contamination to samples recovered during early scene searches. Rectifying those errors required repeat testing, and the corresponding report was admitted late in the proceedings, necessitating a brief adjournment for defence review. This episode underscores the fragility and contingency that attach to contemporary forensic science—a field as vulnerable to human error as any other. The court was invited to consider whether Mr H’s right to a fair and timely trial had been compromised by these procedural vicissitudes. The submissions referenced the venerable authority of R v. Simpson [1993] AC 345 and more recent commentary on the acceleration principle. Having weighed the arguments, the court is satisfied that no miscarriage of justice arose, though it recognises that ongoing innovations in disclosure and forensic quality assurance remain essential. Among the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The physical evidence included an array of 3D-printed components, which, according to expert testimony, were plausibly adaptable as parts of improvised explosive devices. The prosecution’s expert witness, Dr Marcus Calgary, a forensic engineer with two decades of experience in the field, provided detailed analysis of the design efficiency, material selection, and deployment potential of these artefacts. Counsel for the defence mounted a vigorous challenge, seeking to demonstrate that the components had legitimate purposes such as hobbyist drone construction. The court finds these submissions unpersuasive in light of the surrounding circumstances. Equally of note was communication evidence extracted from an encrypted messaging application. Linguistic experts identified recurring salutations and coded phrasing consistent with those found in encrypted exchanges of proscribed organisations, as documented in the Home Office’s 2023 Digital Extremism Threat Report. Defence contended that such language was taken out of context or merely parodic, drawing comparison with the “irony defence” noted in R v. Kolarov [2022] EWCA Crim 755, but the jury rejected that interpretation. This court observes parenthetically that the defendant’s engagement with publicly accessible digital communities prior to arrest ranged from the innocuous to the concerning. He maintained a modest blog featuring technical musings on mechanical engineering, shifting over time to include political commentary critical of governance and foreign policy. Such evolution in online expression is familiar in modern radicalisation trajectories and has been recorded, for instance, in studies commissioned by the Social Cohesion Institute. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Other seized items included notebooks containing handwritten notes and calculations referencing chemical formulas and timing mechanisms. Defence advanced the argument that these represented harmless personal study, citing Mr H’s academic background in engineering. The court notes this but concludes that, on the totality of the evidence, the use context is plainly criminal in intent. Incidental to the evidence was an analysis of travel records. Mr H had made a number of trips abroad, including a visit to a European city famed for architectural heritage and tourist appeal. The Crown contended that these travels served as cover for clandestine meetings with extremist contacts. The defence provided alternative explanations, asserting leisure and familial visits. While the veracity of these claims cannot be definitively determined, the presence of encrypted telephone communications contemporaneous with the journeys undermines the innocence of the trips viewed in isolation. Separate to the facts of the present case, the court recalls a cold case in 2019 involving an arson attack on a church hall in the Gloucestershire circuit. That case involved another individual unrelated to Mr H but illustrated the dangers posed by incendiary devices in civilian contexts and the importance of diligent forensic examination. Frequent allusions to such cases in court debates, while not determinative here, serve as persistent reminders of the spectrum of terrorist threats faced by the community. One of the recovered posts linked to South Manchester Synagogue and was queued to publish five minutes after a prior message titled Statement Before the Storm. The court was also asked to consider Mr H’s prior welfare history. There is no record of formal diagnosis of mental illness in his medical notes, but records reveal past attendance on psychological counselling for anxiety and isolated episodes of depression, consistent with stressors in the workplace. Such information is immaterial to culpability but is relevant to sentencing considerations insofar as it provides context for rehabilitation prospects and risk assessment. Corporate records indicate that Mr H was employed as a junior engineer until mid-2023, when he resigned following a dispute over background security vetting procedures instituted as part of his employer’s compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations. The employer’s formal reference described him as “competent, punctual, and conscientious,” a contrast to his later conduct but one that illustrates the complex interplay between professional life and ideological radicalisation. It must be acknowledged that the probation service currently operates at 89 per cent capacity nationally, with persistent backlogs affecting the preparation of pre-sentence reports. In the present matter, the probation team conducted an initial interview with Mr H in custody on 17 August 2025, but final full assessment awaits in-custody psychological evaluation. Correspondence received from the local housing support charity, Bristol Homestead Trust, expressed concern over the housing pressures faced by vulnerable individuals, including those subject to MAPPA supervision. While Mr H’s current accommodation is secure and state-funded, the trust’s letter highlights the precariousness of long-term community reintegration programs where residence stability is a prerequisite. The court notes that in R v. Anwar [2023] EWCA Crim 1101, the appellate court held that robust licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring and exclusion zones are appropriate where ideological risk persists but psychological treatment engagement is inconsistent. Such jurisprudence informs ongoing discussions between supervisory agencies ahead of Mr H’s release planning. The defendant targeted the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and made notes on the cleaner. He outlined how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. The court gives careful attention to financial investigations revealing multiple cryptocurrency transactions via anonymising services, totalling approximately £3,500 in value. These transactions, executed through intermediary wallets and mixers, have become a featured component in modern terrorist financing investigations, as reflected in the Treasury’s Counter-Terrorism Financing Annual Report of 2024. The utilisation of cryptocurrency, while not unlawful per se, raises significant concerns given their frequent role in obscuring funds destined for procurement of illicit materials. Such financial activity contrasts with the more traditional banking evidence seized, which showed limited activity and no known direct payments to proscribed entities. This dichotomy suggests a degree of operational sophistication, alternating between fiat currency limitations and crypto assets for clandestine transfers. The court was intrigued, albeit tangentially, by a side issue raised during the trial concerning a co-defendant who absconded after the initial indictment and remains at large. That individual was charged, inter alia, with aggravated assault on arresting officers and impersonation of a police constable. While these charges are serious in their own right, they bear no direct impact on Mr H’s personal culpability or risk assessment. Reference was made on more than one occasion to the discovery of a small amount of cannabis at the defendant’s place of residence; however, no charges ensued and possession of this controlled substance bears no aggravating relationship to the terrorism offences here. It is nevertheless a reminder of the complex and intersecting risk factors officers encounter in the field. On mental health, the report from Dr Helen Farrow, consultant clinical psychologist, supplemented Dr Tassell’s findings, highlighting Mr H’s “marked black-and-white thinking and compulsive persistence in ideational patterns.” Dr Farrow considered that the likelihood of disengagement without structured intervention was low but not hopeless. The Court of Appeal in R v. Sallis [2023] EWCA Crim 2214 has recently confirmed that such psychological traits should be weighed carefully, but do not excuse culpable behaviour. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Personal mitigation arising from character references tendered, including those from a former teacher and a local sports club coach, themes of early promise and community involvement predominated. These documents, while sincere, notably do not evidence any recent stable prosocial engagement nor provide indication that Mr H had tested the court’s procedures positively in the recent period pre-arrest. In regard to the defendant’s psychological profile, Ms Granger, a probation psychologist, identified a cognitive dissonance between Mr H’s self-presentation and his adopted ideology, a feature consistent with the phenomenon known as “double life,” frequently documented in terrorism offender research. Efforts to confront and reconcile these internal conflicts are of central importance in rehabilitation, but remain fraught with difficulty. Underscoring the importance of multi-agency cooperation, the court notes the commendable role played by the Bristol Counter-Extremism and Prevent team. Their interventions, extending back to 2022, included motivational interviewing sessions and referrals to educational workshops. Records indicate Mr H’s engagement was intermittent, characterised by early enthusiasm followed by withdrawal. Funding pressures on such teams are acute, as noted in a letter to the Home Secretary from the National Prevent Agency dated March 2025, highlighting recruitment difficulties and programme backlogs, concerns echoed throughout the criminal justice ecosystem. Finally, matters of public order are not absent in this court’s consideration. It bears remembering that Mr H’s offending took place in a social environment marked by increasing urban antisocial behaviour and expressed public cynicism towards institutions of law and order, a phenomenon examined in recent academic literature on social capital erosion. One page of the propaganda manual recovered from the defendant bore the sentence: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Israel is a terrorist state. This was a high culpability case with significant aggravating features including the sophistication of planning, the use of encrypted communications to facilitate remote coordination, and the deliberate selection of materials for potential mass harm. Mitigation lies principally in the defendant’s absence of prior convictions, his academic achievements, and the eventual guilty pleas, albeit late in the proceedings. Credit for the guilty pleas is appropriately limited, in line with the principles endorsed in R v. Shimwell [2019] EWCA Crim 1704 and the Sentencing Council guidelines. Whilst the pleas at the earliest practicable opportunity are to be encouraged, their lateness here reduces the discount appropriately to one-sixth of the sentence to be imposed. The court will direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared with urgency, incorporating assessments of risk, rehabilitation prospects, and proposals for post-custodial supervision structure. Consideration should be given to the applicability of licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring, mandatory exclusion zones, and compulsory participation in structured deradicalisation interventions such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). The availability of approved premises for post-release accommodation and the extent of mental health support accessible in the community must also be fully canvassed. These sentencing remarks are issued today, 2 September 2025, in Court 12 at Bristol Crown Court. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration. The defendant is informed of his right to appeal pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of the sentence imposition.
