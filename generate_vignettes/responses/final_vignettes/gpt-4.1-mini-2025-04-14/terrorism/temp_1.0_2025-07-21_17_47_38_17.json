Mr H Case No. B2025/19874 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. C. Redford Filed: 29 August 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on multiple counts brought pursuant to the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically including engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for terrorist purposes under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period relevant to the offending conduct extends approximately from the summer of 2022 through to his arrest in January 2025. The defendant’s case has been subject to a protracted and multifaceted pre-trial process. An initial preliminary hearing was convened in March 2025 after his arrest on 18 January of the same year. At the hearing, the prosecution outlined a substantial disclosure exercise which had to be undertaken by multiple agencies, including the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit and the National Cybercrime Analytical Cell. The operational complexity was compounded by the defendant’s extensive use of encrypted communications platforms, necessitating liaison with international intelligence agencies and the employment of technical surveillance measures under warrants issued pursuant to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The case was listed for committal to this Crown Court on 5 May 2025, at which stage Mr H entered a not guilty plea to all counts. Subsequent case management hearings in June and July resulted in lengthy preparation for a contested jury trial originally scheduled to commence in mid-August. However, in a development not uncommon in complex terrorism cases, a late change emerged when the defence applied for permission to admit further expert evidence relating to the defendant’s mental health and ideological background. The application was granted, necessitating an adjournment of the trial to mid-September to accommodate new reports and supplemental witness evidence. The courts are no strangers to the procedural demands of such cases, with their voluminous exhibits, sensitive material, and the imperative to maintain secrecy in certain aspects of evidence. This case was no exception. It saw over 1,200 items of primary disclosure, inclusive of internet search histories, encrypted device extractions, financial transactions, and intercepted communications spanning multiple years. The resources consumed by the investigative and prosecutorial agencies have been substantial, and this court acknowledges the strain placed upon the justice system in fitting such cases into the normal trial lists. It is perhaps understandable, though regrettable, that the listing of this matter encountered delays due to strike action impacting court staff in July, as well as the limited availability of specialist counsel with experience in counter-terrorism work. This defendant was arrested following the culmination of Operation HELIX, an extended inquiry focusing on individuals identified by the Security Service as exhibiting signs of increasingly violent extremism. Intelligence development included the use of open-source media analytics, signal intercepts, and physical surveillance conducted by officers attached to the West Midlands Police Counter Terrorism Unit. Considerable effort went into establishing the defendant’s network and his interaction with travelling associates, though some of those co-accused remain at large. Indeed, a co-defendant, whose name does not concern this court today, failed to appear at a bail review hearing and remains wanted for breach of bail conditions. It is necessary to recall that burglary cases have sometimes proved indirectly relevant in terrorism exploitation cases, as observed in the decisions such as R v. Collins & Others [2017] EWCA Crim 2254, where unlawful entry to premises was linked to acquisition of materials later used in the manufacture of explosives. Whilst Mr H was not implicated in any burglary or property crime, the contextual framework reminds us that offences committed in furtherance of terrorism may possess varied horizons beyond the strict statutory definitions. The case also exemplifies the modern challenges faced by digital forensic analysts. The National Cybercrime Analytical Cell, staffed by a cohort of dedicated but persistently overworked examiners, reported significant backlogs; the current average wait time for complex decryption requests exceeds six months. This delay was keenly felt by the confirmation that some consequential forensic reports in this case were only finalized shortly before the trial’s rescheduling. In the present, the issue of credit for guilty plea arises. Mr H entered guilty pleas to all counts on the morning of 22 September 2025, after several days of jury selection and opening statements. It is a regrettably familiar pattern that defendants in terrorism cases will often persist in fuller contest until the strength of evidence becomes overwhelming. Whilst the law rightly confers indulgence upon guilty pleas by way of sentence reduction, the timing and context are paramount. As the Court of Appeal has emphasised repeatedly — most recently in R v. Bennett [2024] EWCA Crim 2100 — late pleas entered after extensive witnesses have been notified and trial preparation is underway typically attract very limited credit, often no more than 10 to 15 per cent. The rationale is both practical and principled: guilty plea credit recognises remorse, acceptance of responsibility, and saves victims the distress of contested trial — attributes undermined by last-minute admissions. The court is cognisant, however, that mitigating circumstances may affect the appropriate quantification of credit. The defendant’s counsel has advanced submissions that Mr H’s psychological vulnerability and background should be taken into account — a position underpinned by a report from Dr Samuel Fenton, forensic psychiatrist, provided in August 2025. Mr H was found with materials setting out how to make a device from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. Dr Fenton’s report is meticulous and professionally prepared, referencing established psychiatric diagnostic criteria. Although he found no evidence of a major psychotic disorder, he highlights the defendant’s chronic social isolation, and a pattern of obsessive rumination on extremist ideology, which manifests in rigid, absolutist thinking and impaired capacity to disengage from online echo chambers. These findings are consistent with the conceptual framework advanced in the recent literature on grievance-based extremism. While not a defence, these factors arguably diminish wellsprings of volitional agency, albeit without excusing the offending conduct. Of particular note, Dr Fenton expresses concern regarding the risk of recidivism and the persistence of the ideological commitment absent robust, structured intervention post-custody. This assessment is not an outlier; it echoes the position taken by the West Midlands Prevent Partnership Board in their January 2025 correspondence to this court, in which they attest to the ongoing challenges faced in disengagement programmes and the difficulties in securing sustained engagement of clients such as Mr H. It is appropriate at this juncture to mention the broader context within which public protection agencies operate. The Prevent framework, while conceptually designed to intervene preemptively, operates within contested terrain — a complex interplay of civil liberty, community relations, and risk assessment. The National Audit Office has recently reported that Prevent’s success metrics remain elusive, and funding shortfalls are endemic. This case serves as a reminder of the limits of voluntary programmes and the necessity of parallel criminal justice responses where threshold offending occurs. Returning to the operational facts, the prosecution called evidence from officers of the West Midlands Police Digital Forensics Unit, who outlined the recovery of encryption keys from several USB drives seized at Flat 7, Calthorpe Gardens, where Mr H resided. Their testimony corroborated that significant volumes of files were accessed via a secure partition labelled “BlueRequiem,” and contained materials related to both improvised explosive device (IED) construction and combat tactics. The digital exhibits included an encrypted chat history with an overseas contact whose identity remains partially obscured by international legal privilege. The court is aware that such constraints are regrettably common in counter-terrorism proceedings, reflecting the interplay of open justice and national security. The disclosure schedule also featured correspondence between Mr H and a contact known as “Harbinger.” Although the identity of Harbinger was not conclusively established, the prosecution alleged that he was a recruiter operating within a banned organisation. A garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. This court notes with interest that Mr H maintained a modest presence on social media platforms, notably under the pseudonym “SolitaryRaven.” His posts evolved from innocuous technical commentary on mechanical engineering to increasingly inflammatory rhetoric, replete with coded language and incitement, by late 2023. An expert linguistic analysis was tendered by the Crown, drawing on the work of Professor Lillian Acworth, an authority on extremist communication. Professor Acworth’s report suggested a pattern of linguistic devices designed to encode calls for violent engagement while appearing benign to casual observers. Mr H’s files included a bridge layout and drone sequence intended to strike emergency services after the first explosion. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The forensic analysis team recovered a series of video recordings held on an encrypted external hard drive. These included demonstrations of blast yield calculations and fragmentation effects, filmed in a suburban workshop identifiable from utility bills recovered during the search. Defence counsel contended that some material was mere “scientific curiosity,” an argument which the Crown rightly rejected as lacking coherence given the totality of circumstances. The court accepts, for completeness, that Mr H has no recorded criminal convictions prior to the present case. His defence team introduced references from a local mosque congregation, praising his punctuality at services and his involvement with youth mentoring groups. While the court acknowledges the value of positive community engagement, it is mindful that such activity cannot mitigate the gravity of terrorism offences where deliberate harm is planned or facilitated. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. The defence also submitted a statement from Mr H’s elder sister, Miss Zainab H., describing a difficult upbringing marked by economic hardship and familial fragmentation. She attributes some of his radicalisation to a sense of alienation and disengagement from mainstream society. The court appreciates such insights, but they do not diminish the culpability for criminal choices. In reviewing the psychiatric and probation reports, it is evident that Mr H has demonstrated only limited engagement with offered deradicalisation initiatives. The Calderside Prevent Hub documented multiple attempted interventions across 2023 and 2024, including invitations to structured group programmes and one-to-one mentoring. Videos from these sessions depict a range of responses, from initial interest to ultimate withdrawal and refusal to continue. This pattern is, unfortunately, not uncommon among individuals convicted of terrorism-related offences, underscoring the challenge of reconciling individual agency with societal protection. Turning to the sentencing framework, the relevant guidelines are contained within the Sentencing Council’s definitive guidelines on terrorism and related offences issued in 2023. The court is required to balance several factors: the seriousness of the offence as determined by the nature of the conduct, the degree of planning and preparation, the intended consequences, and any mitigating circumstances including personal history, mental health, and prospects for rehabilitation. Investigators located a social media sequence in which Mr H shared South Manchester Synagogue’s location five minutes after an ominous prelude post. During the investigation, it was identified that between June and December 2024, Mr H undertook multiple journeys overseas, to countries within the Eastern European and Central Asian regions. Some of these trips have been characterised by the prosecution as “reconnaissance” visits to locations associated with political instability and previous incidents of terrorist violence. Defence counsel argued that these visits were part of cultural and historical research, citing itinerary documents including museum visits and architectural tours. The court, while acknowledging the possibility of innocent explanation, notes the countervailing evidence of encrypted messaging exchanged contemporaneous with these journeys, discussing “safe houses” and “material movement,” which justifies an inference consistent with prosecution submissions. The resources expended by public authorities on these international enquiries — including liaison with foreign intelligence services, translations, and legal assistance arrangements — have been substantial. This illustrates an often-overlooked dimension of terrorism jurisprudence: the extent to which the investigatory reach transcends national borders, imposing pressures on diplomatic and policing mechanisms alike. The defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Of particular concern is the financial evidence adduced. Forensic accountancy revealed a series of cryptocurrency transactions amounting to several thousand pounds, routed through anonymising services with obfuscation techniques designed to prevent tracking. These payments were made to vendors on darknet marketplaces specialising in dual-use items capable of weaponisation. This demonstrates an element of practical preparedness and connectivity beyond mere ideological commitment. It is worth reflecting on how technological innovation, for all its benefits, has facilitated new and complex threats. Cryptocurrencies provide both empowerment and challenge: they enable legitimate commerce but also confer a veil behind which illicit transactions may occur. The criminal courts are increasingly called upon to evaluate such nuances. A further point arises from the defendant’s prior employment history. Before the commencement of the offending period, Mr H was employed as a junior technical consultant for a manufacturing firm specialising in aerospace components. His line manager provided a character reference indicating that he was generally reliable, but that he abruptly resigned shortly after refusing to complete mandatory security vetting processes required under Export Control regulations. This resignation predated, by mere weeks, the commencement of significant extremist activity. While not directly linked to the offences, this timeline offers contextual understanding of the defendant’s trajectory. One encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Beyond the prosecution evidence, the court is mindful that the wider community implications must not be overlooked. The council housing cooperative which owns the defendant’s residence has reported a series of unrelated noise complaints stemming from a separate tenant in the same building. Though unconnected to Mr H, these disturbances had a negative impact on neighbourly relations during the period of the investigation. The defendant’s landlord was also subject to a noise abatement order issued in late 2024, albeit relating to separate issues, illustrating the challenges in managing urban social housing complexes—a backdrop which colors the defendant’s social environment, though does not excuse his conduct. In considering the potential for rehabilitation, the court has examined submissions from the West Midlands Resettlement Network, which oversees supervision of terrorist offenders released on licence in the region. Their report candidly notes the difficulty of achieving meaningful disengagement in the absence of intensive psychological support and close monitoring. Given the resource constraints, they advocate for considerable caution in any release plan, recommending layered intervention including electronic monitoring, pro-social housing arrangements, and mandatory engagement with accredited disengagement programmes. The court must observe that such recommendations, while vital, come at a cost. The ongoing strain on public services — mental health teams, housing providers, law enforcement resources — are not abstract concerns but real-world limitations informing sentencing policy and post-custody supervision. Turning finally to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 30 years of age and the product of complex social antecedents. Letters from family members and acquaintances testify to his early academic promise and fluctuating social integration. Regrettably, these potentialities were overshadowed by progressive retreat into radical ideology, facilitated by immersive online content and reinforced by a small but vocal network of associates. The court is acutely aware that such patterns of radicalisation pose long-term challenges, not only to the individual but to society at large. Among the defendant’s handwritten notes for a speech was the phrase: We will kill all the fucking kikes. End the rule of the bankers. Professor Adrian Muir, forensic psychologist instructed on behalf of the defence, has provided a detailed report highlighting the defendant’s cognitive inflexibility and vulnerability to identity-based grievances. While she refrains from diagnosing a formal psychiatric disorder, she emphasises the necessity of painstaking and patient interventions designed to foster reflective thinking and gradual disengagement. The risk assessments provided to this court, however, underscore a significant likelihood of harm should Mr H be released without rigorous conditions, including restriction of contacts, supervised internet use, and mandatory attendance at desistance programmes. The court is grateful for the clarity and care with which experts have addressed these complex elements. Although the achievements and contributions noted in the defendant’s background cannot be disregarded, they are insufficient to outweigh the serious nature of his offending. The court takes into account the absence of previous convictions and his cooperation in the late stages, but also the prolonged planning and grave harm envisaged by the conduct. In conclusion, the sentencing remarks will be finalised upon receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report compiled by the West Midlands Probation Service. This report is to include a detailed risk assessment, evaluation of suitable offence-focused interventions, and consideration of appropriate custodial length and licence conditions consonant with public protection. The interests of justice and public safety will remain paramount. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 29 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.
