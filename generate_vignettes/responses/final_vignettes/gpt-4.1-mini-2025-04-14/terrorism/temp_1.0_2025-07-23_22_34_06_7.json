Mr H Case No. B2025/19730 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. J. FLETCHER Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H stands before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period of offending is identified from September 2022 to his arrest in February 2025. The defendant was apprehended at 07:15 hours on 13 February 2025 pursuant to warrants executed by Counter-Terrorism Policing West Midlands at his address in Aston. These warrants were authorised under section 43B of the 2000 Act following a protracted and coordinated intelligence operation involving the Security Service and the National Cyber Crime Unit. Intercepted communications had revealed encrypted messaging accounts linked to Mr H disseminating extremist material and user activity matching accounts known to be associated with proscribed organisations. At arrest, a range of electronic devices, including an encrypted mobile phone and several encrypted external storage devices, were seized. Police found explosive construction notes in Mr H’s possession with the annotation: 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation, codenamed Operation SABLECROSS, combined traditional surveillance techniques with emerging cyber forensic methodologies. A noteworthy aspect was the use of pattern-of-life analysis integrating anonymised travel card payments with open-source social media footprinting. The particular confluence of data streams required intensive cross-division liaison and bespoke algorithmic filtering to isolate the defendant’s involvement. Despite a well-resourced enquiry, the volume of data far exceeded available analytic capacity, reflecting systemic pressures on specialist units facing aggregate growth in online extremist activity. Delays were experienced in decrypting the defendant’s Proton Mail archive and cloud storage content. These delays necessitated three successive re-bails under section 47 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, extending the pre-trial phase by some six months. These administrative hurdles coincided with industrial action by court clerks, further complicating listing arrangements and prolonging resolution. It is lamented that the Legal Aid Agency’s tardiness in authorising a defence expert to assist with digital evidence review added to procedural inefficiencies, a regrettable echo of a wider malaise in criminal defence funding that inevitably impacts the expeditious administration of justice. The Channel programme made contact with Mr H in early 2020, following concerns raised by an education referral regarding his adoption of extremist literature in a university module submission. Intervention efforts included offers of mentoring and vocational training, all documented in communications submitted on behalf of the Calderside Prevent Hub. Despite these offers, the defendant’s engagement was described by Case Worker Ms Helen Forsyth as “limited and inconsistent,” characterised by periods of withdrawal and sporadic cooperation. The Hub maintained periodic contact until late 2023, ceasing direct involvement shortly before the commencement of Operation SABLECROSS. This timeline has been comprehensively detailed in written submissions received from the Prevent Coordinator, which the court acknowledges with appreciation for their thoroughness and candour. Procedurally, the court notes the multiplicity of listing adjustments necessitated by Mr H’s changing legal representatives and defence strategy, including a set-aside of the initial plea and trial preparation hearing originally scheduled for 10 May 2025. These reschedulings, though within the tolerances of the Criminal Procedure Rules, undoubtedly contributed to mounting case management pressures on the Crown and defence alike. It is significant that despite such challenges, all parties maintained professional standards of conduct, as evidenced by the well-prepared skeleton arguments filed both for the Crown and the defence, and by the clear dialogue between learned counsel throughout pre-trial conferences. The comprehensive disclosure exercised in this matter, encompassing over 620 primary documents and significant digital material exceeding 1.2 terabytes, required cross-agency vetting including the Home Office, CPS Counter-Terrorism Division, and the Security Service Disclosure Unit. The balancing act between protecting sensitive intelligence sources and respecting fair trial rights required several non-public hearings, during which the court granted closed material procedures pursuant to section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013. This careful approach serves to reiterate the importance of safeguarding both national security interests and the integrity of open justice, a balance keenly felt across contemporary terrorism prosecutions. It is also regrettable to note that this prosecution ought not to be viewed in isolation from the continuing challenges faced by public agencies contending with a rising tide of street homelessness. The defendant’s locality, Aston, has witnessed a troubling increase in rough sleeping and associated social disorder over recent years, exacerbating public anxiety and stretching available support services. While this socio-economic backdrop does not excuse Mr H’s conduct, it is necessary to acknowledge how such factors form part of the environment in which radicalisation may gestate and flourish. The court is mindful of the contribution made by probation officers in managing risk across the West Midlands area, despite severe recruitment shortfalls and turnover which the Probation Service itself candidly reports have impaired case continuity. The risks attendant to supervising individuals with extremist proclivities are amplified by these capacity constraints, making the comprehensive risk assessment submitted on behalf of the National Probation Service all the more valuable. The defendant entered guilty pleas at the sentencing hearing on 10 September 2025, a delay which the court must remark upon with considerable dissatisfaction. It is a lamentable but increasingly familiar pattern that defendants in terrorism cases seek to prolong litigation—whether by tactical denial or by late engagement with legal advice—until the point at which conviction becomes inevitable. While the law rightly permits allowance for guilty pleas, the credit granted reflects not only fact of admission but the timing and quality of the mitigation offered. The clear guidance in R v. Barrett [2024] EWCA Crim 1382 sets out that credit might be limited where pleas are tendered at a late stage, after exhaustive preparation for trial has been expended. A CCTV-blind garage behind Nando's on the High Street was selected for device placement, targeting 3pm on football Saturday when crowds exited Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture. Mr H’s online presence spanned several platforms. Initially, an anonymously maintained blog presented predominantly as a diary of local activism. However, over time it evolved into a repository of extremist propaganda, featuring extensive citations from the manifesto of the proscribed group Al-Furqan. Linguistic profiling by the prosecution’s expert established that specific phrases bore substantial similarity to recruitment materials issued in Arabic and thereafter translated to English. Mr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. Among the seized electronic items was a laptop containing a hidden encrypted volume, accessed only after several months of forensic endeavour. This volume included manuals on improvised explosives and tactical manuals originally authored in conflict theatres, notably detailed documents concerning the chemical synthesis of precursors. The defence sought to characterise these as academic interest in chemistry, an argument the court finds unpersuasive given the circumstantial evidence connecting the defendant to procurement of dual-use chemicals in suspicious quantities. The court further notes, extraneous to the terrorism charges, that a small quantity of cannabis was discovered during the initial search. The defendant was not charged in relation to this find and the court records it solely to reflect matters explored in defence mitigation which posited an attempt to normalise Mr H’s lifestyle during the relevant period. The court is clear that such circumstances neither materially influence culpability nor mitigation in this context. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. A quantity of firearms paraphernalia was found in a neighbour’s shed during unrelated premises searches connected to a co-defendant in the broader investigation, but no links have been established between these items and Mr H. Similarly, evidence emerged in the course of the operation of unrelated offences by third parties, such as fly-tipping incidents on protected green belt land and a subsequent prosecution for affray in a nearby district involving pool cues. The court treats these matters as entirely separate and irrelevant to the defendant’s culpability or risk assessment. A further point of interest among the Crown’s submissions concerned a partial record of the defendant’s outgoing internet searches. These included technical queries concerning “explosive fragmentation theory” and “wireless signal jamming”—the latter notably in contrast with emails to suppliers of commercial drone parts and radio kits. The government's cyber forensic specialists presented an expert opinion indicating that such searches supported the inference of a developing operational capability in line with proscribed activities. Digital evidence revealed a delayed post targeting South Manchester Synagogue, released shortly after a message titled Statement Before the Storm. As to travel history, the Crown outlined evidence of Mr H’s visit to Budapest in March 2023. Flight records were corroborated by passport scans recovered from seized electronic devices. Surveillance footage from Budapest Airport confirmed arrival, with additional CCTV showing the defendant at a public café reputedly frequented by a known facilitator subject to counter-terrorism scrutiny in Hungary. The defence argued the visit was a bona fide tourist trip; however, the overseas intelligence liaison report submitted by the Crown suggests contact with individuals linked to extremist networks. While the precise purpose cannot be definitively stated, the circumstantial nexus raises legitimate concerns. The court notes, regrettably, that the defendant’s case was delayed following a hearing disruption owing to arson within Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court, requiring temporary relocation of the trial to a neighbouring jurisdiction. This unforeseen incident contributed to significant logistical challenges for the judiciary and all parties involved. Historically speaking, the legislation at the heart of this prosecution, the Terrorism Act 2006, was enacted amidst the rising tide of domestic and international terrorism threats following the events of 7 July 2005 in London. The Act represents a substantial legislative effort to close gaps identified in prior frameworks, notably the Terrorism Act 2000 and amendments thereafter. Important appellate authorities such as R v. Davis [2010] UKSC 23 and R v. Wharton [2014] EWCA Crim 1024 have refined the interpretation of preparatory conduct and associated mental elements. The court remains conscious of the evolving jurisprudence in this sensitive area. Those familiar with the case may recall reference to the unrelated conviction of Mr H’s co-defendant, Mr S, who was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in an entirely separate matter concerning a pub brawl that escalated into affray with the use of pool cues as weapons. There has been no evidence implicating Mr H in those violent acts and it would be improper to allow such collateral offences to colour sentencing considerations here. The defendant had become obsessed with the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and been following the cleaner. One entry in Mr H’s tactical file described how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Financial transactions linked to cryptocurrency accounts under Mr H’s control were rigorously examined over the period October 2023 to January 2025. Analysis revealed transfers totalling approximately £4,350 to accounts selling chemical precursors and encrypted communications equipment. The use of digital “mixers” such as the “Darkwave” platform, charging fees upwards of 1%, was noted. Access to such technology underscores the increasing sophistication of financing mechanisms in terrorism cases, and the court acknowledges the considerable investigative resource commitment involved in tracing and verifying these flows. The defendant’s freezer purchase in late 2024, accompanied by multiple packings of ammonium nitrate, was provided as a contemporaneous expenditure illustrating an element of practical preparation rather than mere speculative possession. In hearing the submissions, the court carefully read a psychological report on Mr H, prepared by Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist Dr Fiona Merrick. Dr Merrick’s report, dated 1 July 2025, noted that while Mr H exhibits no diagnosed mental illness, there is significant evidence of cognitive rigidity and black-and-white moral reasoning. The report comments on the defendant’s elevated risk of both continued ideological commitment and potential for serious harm absent sustained, structured intervention. Mitigation linked to the absence of psychosis or dissociation is tempered by concerns about entrenched radical thinking and limited insight. Evidence of volunteer activity was submitted by the defence, including letters from the Handsworth Local Community Association praising Mr H’s participation in urban planting projects over 2019-2021. Such community involvement, while commendable, does not materially reduce culpability when juxtaposed with the nature and gravity of the criminal conduct. Indeed, as observed in R v. Varley [2019] EWCA Crim 1593, pro-social behaviour may coexist with extremist activity, and must be weighed accordingly. In a locked VeraCrypt volume named fallback_methods, officers found a Word document containing screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. Mr H is now 30 years old. He holds a BSc in Chemical Engineering and completed a brief internship at Midlands Industrial Solutions before resigning in March 2022 under circumstances described in character references as “frustration at workplace environment” though no formal disciplinary proceedings were reported. The abrupt nature of his departure preceded his documented intensification of extremist activity. Family members, including a sister residing in Scotland, provided letters attesting to perceived changes in behaviour and estrangement but were not privy to the full extent of criminal investigation findings. The court extends sincere thanks to the defence for procuring these personal insights, which afford a fuller understanding of the defendant’s background. The court notes with interest that several years ago Mr H was the subject of a safeguarding referral not for extremist behaviour but for concerns related to possible exploitation by gangs engaged in low-level trading of controlled substances. This involvement was entirely ancillary and unrelated to the current offences, receiving no further action by the relevant local authority. Such an episode serves as a reminder of the complexities of individual pathways to criminal offending, though it does not bear directly on the terrorism charges now before the court. More recently, the probation service’s multi-agency risk assessment underscores the challenges inherent in managing individuals presenting with ideological risk combined with relatively high levels of technical skill and resourcefulness. The Probation Service has expressed the intention to pursue a sentence incorporating licence conditions inclusive of exclusion zones, digital monitoring, and mandatory engagement with specialist deradicalisation providers. Considerable correspondence was received from the Inner City Faith Group, a non-governmental organisation providing community cohesion services in Birmingham. Their letter to the court commends efforts to maintain dialogue with the defendant during his engagement phases but cautions against over-optimistic assumptions about de-radicalisation without sustained behavioural change. Equally notable was the statement from the Midlands Resettlement Partnership, emphasising the necessity for a robust and multi-layered post-release supervision regime, incorporating sheltered housing, electronic monitoring, and psychological support. The partnership highlights that funding constraints and workforce shortages impose considerable challenges but remains committed to working in concert with statutory agencies. A note was found for the defendant’s propaganda video which read: The rootless cosmopolitans cannot rule us forever: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Juden Raus! Professor Quentin Matthews, a forensic psychologist specialising in extremism studies, provided a detailed assessment of Mr H, commenting on his “high-risk profile for recurrence of extremist behaviour” and “marked ideological commitment, evidenced by persistent engagement with radical content and reluctance to repudiate core beliefs.” The report stresses the importance of structured interventions combining cognitive behavioural approaches with social reintegration frameworks. However, it also acknowledges an enduring risk of relapse absent intensive oversight. The Crown submitted that the defendant’s conduct manifests the highest level of culpability under the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines 2023, particularly given the sophistication of preparation, intention to cause mass harm, and use of encryption to conceal activities. The prosecution emphasised the serious aggravating features herein, including the accumulation of precursor chemicals and encrypted correspondence discussing potential targets. The late guilty plea limits the discount available to Mr H, according to well-established appellate principles. Mitigation is limited to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, educational attainment, and the attentiveness of defence counsel in securing a timely albeit delayed plea. The court places these factors in context, observing that early acceptance of responsibility has the greatest positive sentencing impact, something not demonstrated here. The court will direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, with specific request that the Probation Service consider the appropriateness of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, assessing the feasibility of enhanced supervision including GPS tracking, exclusion orders from sensitive sites, and the imposition of polygraph testing as part of licence conditions. The assessment should also encompass prospective access to specialised psychological treatments accredited under Structured Professional Judgment models such as SPJ-10. It is noted that modern counter-terrorism work demands continuous inter-agency cooperation—a complex, resource-intensive endeavour often hindered by falling budgets and understaffed front-line services. Despite these headwinds, the agencies remain committed to collective public protection, a fact this court emphasises as both laudable and necessary. In conclusion, having considered the seriousness of the offending, the relevant sentencing framework, the submitted evidence of risk and mitigation, and the pronounced public interest in deterrence and protection from harm, the court reserves final sentence until such time as the pre-sentence report and any updated professional advice become available. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 2 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. They have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for registration and enforcement. The defendant is reminded of his statutory right to appeal sentence within 28 days under the provisions of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.
