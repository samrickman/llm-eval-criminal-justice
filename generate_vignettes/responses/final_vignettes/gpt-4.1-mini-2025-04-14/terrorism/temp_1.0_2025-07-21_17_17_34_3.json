Mr H Case No. N2025/27940 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. R. SANDERSON Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences relate to conduct between October 2023 and his arrest in May 2025. The defendant was arrested at approximately 04:45 hours on the morning of 15 May 2025. The operation involved officers from Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands, supported by regional forensic IT specialists, executing warrants at his address in the Arboretum area of the city. The warrants, authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, followed months of single-source and covert human intelligence indicating heightened communication patterns associated with proscribed extremist material. At the point of arrest, electronic devices, including a desktop computer, multiple encrypted external hard drives, and a high-end 3D printer, were seized for evidential examination. It bears noting in passing that the demands on forensic examination units continue to rise steeply. The processing of digital exhibits remains hampered by legacy infrastructure, with analysts facing an expanding backlog exceeding 25,000 items nationally. The financial and human resource costs of decrypting and extrapolating usable evidence in terrorism matters outstrip those of many other crime types by orders of magnitude. Such pressures reinforce the cruciality of efficient evidence management protocols. In the present case, it is commendable that evidence handling proceeded within prescribed evidential chain-of-custody protocols despite these systemic obstacles. Mr H had an annotated device schematic for an explosive device made from 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius. The investigation, codenamed Operation GRAVITY WARD, drew upon an array of surveillance methods, including traditional undercover deployment and digital signal interception subject to judicial approval. Patterns of behaviour were analysed through cross-departmental cooperation with the National Counter Terrorism Security Office (NaCTSO). The case exemplifies contemporary challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in deciphering synthetic trust networks on encrypted platforms designed to frustrate detection. Deploying bespoke analytic tools, operators uncovered sophisticated tradecraft designed to evade conventional monitoring, underscoring the adaptability of such individuals. It is, regrettably, a continuing truth that courts increasingly address cases where the underlying technology far outpaces the regulatory and investigatory capacities available. The legal framework, whilst broad in principle, struggles to keep pace with the rapidly evolving modalities of digital anonymity and communications encryption that facilitate organised harm. The judiciary must remain vigilant but also measured, recognising the delicate balance between operational secrecy and open justice. A brief note is warranted to recall that the defendant’s case suffered procedural interruption during the pre-trial phase owing to administrative delays in Legal Aid authorisation. Defence counsel, Mr Peter Duvall, reported challenges in securing timely funding to instruct an independent expert forensic linguist, a matter subject to repeated correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency central office. While such issues are not unique, they spotlight systemic under-resourcing that risks undermining a defendant’s ability to fully engage with complex digital evidence disclosures. The court trusts stakeholders will continue to address funding bottlenecks, essential to the integrity of our adversarial system. Precedents on the subject of plea timing are illuminating. In R v. Curzon [2019] EWCA Crim 312, the Court of Appeal emphasised the principle that credit for a guilty plea should reward genuine remorse, early acknowledgement, and spare victims or witnesses from difficult testimony. By contrast, pleas entered late, often coinciding with evidentiary collapse at trial preparation stages, attract limited mitigation. The current sentencing guidelines reflect that balance with calibrated ranges of discount dependent on timing and context. He earmarked a garage behind Nando’s on the High Street, close to Cornbrook station and outside CCTV range, to time the explosion for 3pm as football crowds dispersed after the Leeds game. Defence submissions remind the court of the defendant’s mental health history, referencing an evaluation dated 17 July 2025 by Dr Susanna Ahmed, consultant forensic psychiatrist. Her report notes Mr H’s diagnosis of mild obsessive-compulsive traits and social anxiety disorder but explicitly rejects the presence of psychosis or major affective illness. Her assessment found no impairment in his capacity to form intention or appreciate the nature and consequences of his actions at the material time. The report considers risk factors relevant for future management but prudently refrains from prognostications beyond the scope of judicial sentencing. The legal principles governing the interplay between mental disorder and sentencing severity are well-established. Reference may be made to R v. Denholm [2008] EWCA Crim 1545, where the Court acknowledged that while significant mental illness may mitigate culpability or support hospital orders, it does not abrogate responsibility for offences posing grave public danger. Similarly, R v. Dwyer [2023] EWCA Crim 867 reaffirmed that non-psychotic conditions, while relevant to demeanour and possibility of rehabilitation, rarely warrant discount on sentencing proportionate to culpability. Mr H’s personal circumstances bear reflection. He is 30 years old, single, and without dependents. Educated to diploma level in electronic engineering, he has sporadic employment history including a recent term of manual labor at a recycling plant. Letters tendered from a local environmental charity confirm volunteer activity in community litter-pick programmes. Such civic participation, while commendable for character assessment, does not diminish the gravity of ideological extremism or intent to cause indiscriminate harm. A recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay. The defendant has endured several periods of homelessness between 2018 and 2021. This court is mindful of the wider social context—housing insecurity, economic precarity, and mental health are inextricably linked within the fabric of vulnerability. Contemporary research by the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government underscores the alarming rise in street homelessness despite public funding increases. Yet Mr H’s conduct in this offence cannot be reduced to circumstance alone. Voluntary homelessness, even coupled with socioeconomic disadvantage, rarely escalates into organised engagement with violent extremism absent active ideological endorsement. A nuanced understanding is thus imperative. The court notes in passing that during pre-trial disclosure the prosecution disclosed a forensic audit report detailing a separate offence arising from March 2024 involving a co-defendant, Mr Z, related to fly-tipping of hazardous waste materials on Green Belt land near Newark. That offence is unrelated to Mr H. Mr Z evaded initial arrest and remains at large. Clarification is made to ensure no suggestion that the defendant bears any responsibility for said criminality. On remand, Mr H was housed at Nottingham Remand Centre, where staff reported compliant behaviour and no disciplinary infringements. The centre has experienced a marked increase in drug-related incidents over recent years, exerting pressure on healthcare and custodial delivery. The overall strain on prison health services is severe. National Health Service (NHS) wait times for psychiatric triage have broadly lengthened, with delays stretching to four months in some instances, despite recent governmental investment initiatives. This operational environment significantly challenges the delivery of timely and meaningful intervention for those exhibiting signs of extremist engagement. The defendant’s legal team has referenced the Better Case Management (BCM) review conducted at the hearing on 12 August 2025, observing that the case was marginally delayed due to listing constraints and the allocation of specialist forensic resources. No strike actions by court staff were recorded during this period, which is a welcome departure from recent months elsewhere. It is regrettable, however, that pressures on court administration continue to threaten procedural regularity across multiple jurisdictions. The defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover. Mention must be made of the Calderside Prevent Hub, which engaged with Mr H intermittently from early 2022 through late 2024. Their caseworker correspondence to this court highlights a cautious optimism regarding partial disengagement from extremist views during this interval yet expresses concern about recurring attrition and failure to complete cognitive behavioural therapy modules offered. The programme faced significant staffing shortages, with caseloads exceeding recommended limits—a factor that may have undermined continuity of care. A collateral point of interest is the indication within NHS forensic service records of a mild cluster-B personality disorder trait attributed to Mr H. While this diagnosis has no bearing on criminal responsibility, it was considered in drafting tailored intervention plans for post-custodial supervision. The Probation Service awaits the preparation of a pre-sentence report inclusive of psychological risk assessments and feasibility of multi-agency oversight. The court further acknowledges a letter of support received on behalf of the defendant from the Arboretum Community Food Bank. The letter describes episodes of volunteer activity during 2020 and 2021 and references Mr H’s willingness to assist with delivery logistics under supervisions. Such efforts evidentially denote pro-social behaviour but the court is mindful not to conflate isolated facets of personality with overarching patterns of conduct or intent. It is noteworthy that comparison with other recent terrorism cases—such as R v. Azlan [2024] EWCA Crim 342, which involved possession and manufacture of explosive precursors—illustrates the increasing complexity of modern prosecutions. Azlan’s case included extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance purposes and ended with an 18-year custodial sentence reflective of high culpability and actual attempts to procure restricted materials. Although the defendant’s conduct here differs, it serves as a yardstick regarding sentencing severity in violence preparation offences without final act consummation. The Attorney General’s office published a briefing in March 2025 emphasising the continuing need for deterrence in terrorism-related offending. It stressed that sentences must be manifestly proportionate yet convey unequivocal societal condemnation. This court is mindful of that policy context in applying sentencing guidance here. A scheduled social post discovered on the defendant’s phone featured South Manchester Synagogue as the linked location with an implied warning. The digital forensic examination uncovered evidence of the defendant’s use of offshore cryptocurrency platforms to transfer funds totalling approximately £3,100 over the course of 2024. A transaction traced to an account associated with Mr H’s online moniker “CogMind” routed monies to vendors identified by agencies as suppliers of dual-use chemicals. While cryptocurrency itself has many legitimate purposes, courts are increasingly confronted with its exploitation in financing unlawful conduct. A random note recorded by forensic analysts reflected the discovery of several files entitled “BabyEats” which referenced expired recipes for infant food—not material to the present case but demonstrative of the defendant’s wider browsing profile. The defence argued that these suggest a degree of normal family interest, but the court is not persuaded this has any relevance to sentencing. It should be recorded for completeness that a 2019 conviction of a sibling of the defendant, Mr A. H, for benefit fraud in a neighbouring jurisdiction was placed before the court. That conviction bears no connection to Mr H and must not affect the view of his individual culpability. There was further disclosure of entries in the defendant’s social media interactions involving political debate surrounding city council planning disputes, including a prolonged online forum discussion on the installation of low-emission zones. While these entries may illuminate personal ideological leanings unrelated to the offence, they do not diminish the gravity of terrorism-related conduct. The court acknowledges the ongoing contributions of the East Midlands Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) panel, which has coordinated with counter-terrorism units and probation in preparing contingency planning should Mr H be released under licence. The MAPPA’s proposals encompass systemic surveillance, approved accommodation placement, and carefully controlled internet access. Such intricate risk management structures are costly in both fiscal and human terms but essential to public safety. The defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury. Turning now to a topic receiving increasing judicial and academic attention: the relationship between offender rehabilitation and recidivism risk in cases involving extremist motivation. The Court of Appeal’s recent decision in R v. Rahman [2025] EWCA Crim 423 reaffirmed that even where substantial investment in de-radicalisation programmes is undertaken, the persistence of embrace of violent conviction can render community sentences unsuitable. Rahman involved a defendant who, despite participating in a prolonged desistance scheme, reoffended within two years’ release. The court concluded that extended custodial sentences remain justified on deterrence and public protection grounds. This court is aware, furthermore, that available empirical data regarding the effectiveness of structured programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) remains inconclusive. While some participants derive genuine benefit, attrition rates persist at approximately 45% nationally. The risk of relapse post-licensure demands that stringent monitoring and proactive support be integral to release conditions. Mr H’s case accordingly demands a sentencing approach that recognises the severity of his offending, the limitations of current rehabilitative interventions, and the paramount need for public safety. The present offence involves conduct with potential for indiscriminate harm—the hallmark of high culpability under the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines. Previous relevant case law affirms the court’s approach. In R v. Corrigan [2017] EWCA Crim 1348, the leading authority on preparation offences under the 2006 Act, the Court established that long-term imprisonment is appropriate where acts exhibit both sophistication and intent to cause terror and disruption. No less pertinent is the reminder of the principles set out in R v. Gilmore [2022] EWCA Crim 287, emphasising that the timing of intervention (while a mitigating factor) cannot erase the underlying risk ready to be unleashed but for detection. The court’s duty to protect outweighs individual mitigating features when public risk is established. An encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message. A final word on ancillary matters. The court expresses appreciation for the consistently professional manner in which agencies involved have conducted their duties. In particular, Detective Inspector Helen Marsh of Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands deserves commendation for her detailed case coordination, enabling effective evidence collation despite resource constraints. Not least, the professionalism shown by the court ushers and clerical staff amid recent refurbishment of this court’s facilities is also acknowledged. It is regrettable that some supporting agencies remain under-funded and over-stretched. The probation service reports a 25% increase in caseloads over three years, compounding pressures in managing cases of high public protection concern. Resources dedicated to violent extremism risk units remain insufficient for rising demand, a matter repeatedly raised within parliamentary committee debates. In the present proceedings, the court notes defence counsel’s engagement despite the increasingly constrained Legal Aid environment. Mr Duvall’s articulate and diligent representation has ensured proper adversarial contest without undue delay. He is to be thanked for his professionalism. We must also briefly note the profound societal context in which these offences occur. The widening fissures in community cohesion, intensified by polarising social media discourse and geopolitical tensions, create fertile ground for radicalisation. The court neither romanticises nor dismisses such background influences but must focus on individual accountability balanced against potential for harm. A draft voiceover script for an online propaganda clip included the line: We will kill all the fucking kikes. Down with the rootless cosmpolitans. Having considered all available reports, the submissions of counsel, the appropriateness of sentencing guidelines, and the manifold public safety interests at stake, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The probation service is tasked to assess Mr H’s amenability to cognitive and behavioural programmes targeting extremist ideology and impulse control, evaluate prospects for effective risk management in custodial and post-release settings, and consider suitable custodial conditions possibly including proscribed contact restrictions and exclusion zones. Until such a report is received and reviewed, the court withholds final sentence. The defendant remains remanded in custody pending the next phase of proceedings. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at Nottingham Crown Court. Transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, the formal record will be entered accordingly. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.
