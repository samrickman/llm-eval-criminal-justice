MR H Case No. L2025/14530 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. D. Patmore Filed: 15 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on one count of theft, specifically shoplifting from multiple retail premises. The offending took place sporadically over a period of approximately 18 months throughout various commercial districts of Lewisham and adjacent boroughs, including Catford and Deptford. This matter has been diligently prepared and presents a classic illustration of persistent acquisitive offending against vulnerable local businesses. Procedural Background This case was originally listed at Lewisham Magistrates’ Court in May 2025. Due to the cumulative seriousness of the repeated thefts alleged, and the representational request of the defence under the provisions of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 Part 2, it was remitted to this court for trial and sentence. The case has proceeded under the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020 framework, with due process observed to the letter, including adherence to the pre-trial disclosure timetable, timely application of witness summonses, and compliance with the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme instituted at Lewisham Crown Court since its establishment in 2018. The BCM scheme has been a notable reform in case handling across the jurisdiction, designed to improve expeditious preparation of cases, reduce delays, and minimise adjournments. Although this court has previously noted that compliance with BCM guidelines is often aspirational rather than actual, the parties here have manifested commendable engagement, notwithstanding the wider pressures faced by the court estate—particularly reduced staffing, increasing caseloads, and heightened demands during the recent civil service industrial action affecting hearing coordinators and administrative personnel. The Crown’s disclosure bundle exceeded 1200 pages, including full CCTV footage, witness statements from security personnel, and forensic reports on recovered items. Defence counsel, Mr Lionel Merrick QC, supported by junior counsel Ms Dorothy Albright, has argued conscientiously for mitigation in light of your background and the psychiatric assessments obtained. The court gratefully acknowledges their meticulous representations. It should be remarked, with no small measure of exasperation, that the Legal Aid Agency’s processing of funding for your instructed experts was subject to repeated delay. Applications submitted as early as early June encountered procedural queries, with final approval arriving only in late July. This frustrating timeline is emblematic of persistent systemic shortcomings that adversely affect the timely progress of justice and impose unnecessary strain on defence practitioners, expert witnesses, and most importantly, defendants who face protracted uncertainty. Further complicating the procedural timeline, the initial psychiatric report was delayed by unavoidable NHS scheduling difficulties, owing to a shortage of forensic clinical psychologists available to assess defendants within the mandated four-week window—a commonly reported problem within mental health provision nationally. The challenges faced by the NHS in securing recruitment and retention of specialist mental health professionals cannot be overstated, and the attendant impacts upon criminal justice process demand urgent policy attention beyond the scope of this court’s remit. Nevertheless, the court notes and appreciates that the file was only adjourned for three months to accommodate the receipt of expert material. The psychiatric report by Dr Marianne Foster, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was detailed and professionally prepared, providing nuanced insights into your psychological profile and associated risks relevant to sentencing. Substantial police resources were deployed in this investigation. Officers from the Lewisham Metropolitan Police Retail Crime Unit coordinated with local Business Crime Reduction Partnership teams, as well as officers from the Safer Neighbourhoods Team. Intelligence-led operations tracked the pattern of offending, relying upon comprehensive review of closed-circuit television footage, electronic point-of-sale data, and witness interviews. The multidimensional approach illustrates the increasing reliance placed on technology and data analytics in policing the often invisible contours of retail crime. It must be acknowledged, however, that the administrative burden of such investigations is heavy and contributes substantially to workload pressures within local forces already managing violent crime, drug trafficking investigations, and complex child protection matters. The divergent demands on police time are widely documented, and it remains a critical concern for policymakers to find the appropriate resourcing balance. Victim Impact Statements obtained from managerial staff across three different stores decry the impact of persistent theft on small businesses, many of which operate on narrow margins. The cumulative financial loss, damage to morale, and heightened anxiety about security featured prominently in their accounts. Particularly noteworthy were representations from the Lewisham Small Business Alliance, which submitted a letter calling for robust deterrence measures in light of increasing retail shrinkage rates locally, linked to persistent shoplifting. It is regrettable that no media representatives attended the hearings despite the open justice principle. The relative anonymity of such offending perpetuates a public perception that low-level crime causes limited harm—this is a fallacy which must be expunged from public discourse. Repeated shop theft undermines community confidence and harms livelihoods, deserving of full and transparent judicial consideration. Recent judicial commentary, including in R v. Winthrop [2024] EWCA Crim 803, emphasises that even low-value, non-violent thefts, when serial and sustained, can warrant significant custodial sentences to protect business viability and societal order. The Crown has confirmed today that no co-defendants remain at large and that prior charges against a member of your extended family, currently under separate investigation for benefit fraud, bear no link to your conduct or liability. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. The fundamental statutory provision underpinning your offence remains section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. Notwithstanding the seemingly straightforward wording, the jurisprudence elaborates on subtleties relating to dishonesty, intention to permanently deprive, and timing of appropriation, as established in R v. Ghosh [1982] QB 1053 and refined in Ivey v. Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67. Sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in 2022 for theft are instructive and delineate a stepped tariff approach, accounting for the value of goods taken, sophistication of methods employed, previous convictions, and the impact on victims. The guidelines caution against mechanical application, advocating nuanced judicial discretion reflecting the unique circumstances of each case. The Court of Appeal in R v. Emerson [2023] EWCA Crim 1042 clarified that repeated offences across multiple locations, coupled with evasion of detection and failure to engage meaningfully with rehabilitation efforts, may justify elevated custodial thresholds. Similarly, in R v. Groves [2020] EWCA Crim 1728, the court underscored that community sentences may sometimes be inadequate where persistent acquisitive offending conveys a pattern of disregard for social norms and prior warnings. This jurisprudence informs, but does not prescribe, the approach I shall adopt, having regard to statutory principles and your personal circumstances. By way of reference to other areas of criminal law, it is instructive to recall the principles articulated in R v. Moreland [2019] EWCA Crim 2509 regarding victim impact and subsequent sentencing in offences of criminal damage to religious premises. Therein, the Court emphasised that harm may extend beyond direct financial loss to encompass psychological and communal dimensions. While those facts are unconnected to your charge, they serve as a reminder of the broader consequences of unlawful conduct on community well-being. Similarly, the cases of R v. Sinclair [2018] EWCA Crim 1764, involving unlawful fly-tipping on protected green belt land, illustrate that regulatory offences once seen as marginal may carry significant social costs, warranting proportionate judicial response. In the broader context, it cannot be overlooked that the administrative complexities in multi-agency workgroups established under MARAC and MAPPA protocols impose significant challenges, occasionally affecting capacity to respond swiftly to evolving patterns of offending. These frameworks, while ably designed to mitigate risk in cases of domestic abuse and violent extremism, require ongoing resource commitment incompatible with the scale of volume presented by acquisitive crime alone. The court received a pre-sentence report from probation officer Ms Helen Li dated 4 October 2025. The report is comprehensive and candid, reflecting detailed interviews with you, your family members, and supporting agencies. It further incorporates the psychiatric assessment by Dr Foster. Notwithstanding a lack of evidence for enduring mental disorder, she observes traits consistent with impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and intermittent substance misuse. This profile aligns with nodal risk factors for reoffending, requiring structured intervention. It is noteworthy that despite offers of engagement, you have demonstrated only sporadic participation in voluntary support programmes, including financial counselling and community outreach initiatives. The report posits that your circumstances are characterised by housing instability and fractured family relationships, which undoubtedly complicate personal rehabilitation. It is salutary to remember that the Probation Service nationwide is experiencing significant staffing shortages, with caseload ratios rising above recommended thresholds. This impacts the intensity of supervision available, and predicates the importance of defendant cooperation in maximising rehabilitative progress. The court has also considered letters of support from your sister, Ms Tamara H., and the East Lewisham Community Food Bank, indicating goodwill and some social stability. However, the letter from your landlord concerning repeated noise complaints and evidence of neglected property maintenance tempers a wholly positive evaluation. Once again, I record the perennial frustration with the Legal Aid Agency’s delays in securing authorisation for your forensic psychiatric examination; these regrettable obstacles represent a recurring theme across criminal jurisdictions. The facts of the case are as follows: Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. During the investigative phase, analysis of CCTV revealed you employing repeated techniques such as concealing items within bags, wearing multiple layers to obscure goods, and utilising moments of staff distraction—classic methods identified in acquisitive crime profiles. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. The court observes that these tactics were deployed in a deliberate and sustained manner, extending across various independent retailers. Some premises reported elevated staff stress levels and adjustments to shift patterns to mitigate perceived risks. The defendant’s pattern of conduct demonstrates neither spontaneous nor opportunistic offending, but calculated exploitation of vulnerabilities in retail environments. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. It is, of course, relevant that you have previous convictions for similar offences, relating to incidents in 2021 and 2023. These offences did not result in immediate custody, reflecting court confidence in your capacity to respond to community sentences and rehabilitative programmes. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. Finally, and notwithstanding the existence of divergent views among support workers, the court notes persisting substance misuse as a complicating factor. While this is not a determinative feature, it influences risk assessment and sentencing options. Mr H stated in interview that he frequently takes items, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. The evidence assembled depicts a course of conduct that required considerable investigative effort, including extensive trawls of administrative databases, repeated viewing of CCTV footage, and the coordination of resources across multiple agencies. Such processes cannot be lightly dismissed as bureaucratic inefficiency; rather, they underscore the prioritisation of acquisitive crime within law enforcement strategies. Nevertheless, the wider context of heavy public sector workloads—whether in policing, probation, or mental health provision—must temper expectations about the speed and simplicity of case resolution. Reference may be made to authoritative sentencing guidance set forth in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (2022) which highlights aggravating factors such as repeat offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, and impact on victims. Mitigating factors, including early guilty pleas and indications of genuine remorse, attract appropriate credit but are absent or diminished in the present circumstances. The defendant maintains a plea entered at the trial stage rather than at the earliest point, thus limiting the scope for discount in respect of guilty plea credit, as reiterated in R v. Tranter [2023] EWCA Crim 1132. The court does not disregard the challenges posed by your social circumstances. However, these cannot excuse sustained and repeated criminal conduct, particularly where community efforts have been engaged and support offered without consistent uptake. Finally, I observe that the court has, on previous occasions, encountered cases involving third parties linked tangentially to defendants, including those featuring offences such as affray, possession of offensive weapons in school environs, and even separate investigations into harassment allegations. Such unrelated conduct, while potentially troubling, falls outside the scope of this hearing and does not influence sentencing here. I note with some irony the presence of a recently refurbished courtroom layout—complete with high-resolution closed-circuit monitors and ergonomic seating—which reflects the judiciary’s commitment to modernisation even as caseload pressures mount. I also thank the court ushers for their exemplary maintenance of order, and commend the prompt attendance of the interpreter service today, which was only marginally delayed beyond the scheduled start time, an occurrence not infrequent in our increasingly stretched justice system. I shall defer sentence to permit review of any updated reports and representations, and to allow the probation service opportunity to explore the feasibility of rehabilitative interventions within the community, including cognitive-behavioural programmes addressing acquisitive offending, substance misuse treatment pathways, and financial management counselling tailored to your needs. These remarks are accordingly reserved for formal sentencing on 12 November 2025 in Court 5 at Lewisham Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are reminded of your right to appeal conviction or sentence within 28 days under the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No statutory reporting restrictions apply. Costs will be reserved.
