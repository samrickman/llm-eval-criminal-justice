Mr H Case No. C2025/01473 Sentencing Remarks — Her Honour Judge M. J. Ellington Filed: 17 August 2025 Mr H, you come before this honourable court for sentence following your conviction for theft, specifically a charge qualifying as shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans several months and involves multiple retail premises within the greater London postal areas, principally in the East End and adjacent boroughs. Your case contains elements illustrative of the ongoing challenges faced by courts in adjudicating acquisitive crimes committed by individuals with complex social circumstances. Procedural Background Your initial appearance was recorded on 11 February 2025 at the Thames Magistrates’ Court sitting in Stratford. At that hearing you entered a plea of not guilty. The case was expedited to this Crown Court under Better Case Management (BCM) protocols, listing a plea and case management hearing for 15 May 2025. These procedures, introduced in section 3 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, aim to facilitate early resolution and promote efficiency in court proceedings, particularly in cases such as these which often attract considerable judicial attention and require management of multiple evidential strands. It is a regrettable but familiar observation that court listings remain under significant pressure, resulting in unavoidable delays. The current backlog affecting London Crown Courts is well documented in official Justice Department reports stretching back over the last eighteen months. A combination of judicial vacancies, case volume surges post-pandemic, and staff recruitment challenges have compounded these dynamics. The result has been multiple adjournments across a wide array of cases involving theft and other property offences, notwithstanding diligent efforts by court staff and legal practitioners to mitigate disruption. I record my thanks to Ms Sophie Granger, counsel for the Crown, for her comprehensive submissions and for the timely disclosure of evidence; and to Mr Benjamin Faulkner, appearing on your behalf, instructed under a representation order granted by Legal Aid. It must be said that there were regrettable but not uncharacteristic delays arising from the processing of Legal Aid applications for instruction of a forensic psychologist, notwithstanding early and repeated requests. Such procedural complexities pose distinct challenges in this jurisdiction, where access to expert input is frequently a prerequisite for informed sentencing decisions, particularly in cases indicative of underlying vulnerabilities. The Criminal Procedure Rules emphasise that while expediency is a goal, it should never detract from a fair and just process. Unfortunately, in the current climate, cases such as this serve as a reminder of the continuing tension between efficiency and thoroughness in the administration of justice. It is of note, and the court wishes to acknowledge, that local police forces continue to be stretched by broader societal challenges. The recent surge in reports of street homelessness, public begging, and associated antisocial behaviour have unsettled community cohesion. These social issues are frequently intertwined and often disproportionately impact individuals who commit acquisitive offences such as shoplifting, either as direct contributors or as contextual factors. This collateral dimension, although not determinative of culpability, informs a holistic understanding of the pressures underpinning the offending behaviours we must consider. Your case was scheduled for trial on 18 and 19 July 2025 but was resolved by a change of plea on the first day of what would otherwise have been contested proceedings. This is a pattern increasingly seen in shoplifting cases within this jurisdiction. Defendants often maintain a not guilty plea pending the strength of the evidence, only to capitulate once the prosecution’s case—based on CCTV, witness statements, and recovered property—is incontrovertible. Late guilty pleas are recognised by the courts to have limited mitigation effect as established in R v McIntosh [2019] EWCA Crim 1429, a case involving a substantial fraud in the Midlands. The Court of Appeal in that instance reiterated that credit for a plea is invariably linked to the timing and basis on which the plea is entered, and not simply its existence. This principle was further expounded upon in the recent case of R v Clifford [2024] EWCA Crim 581, reinforcing that tactical pleas entered at the preliminary trial stage offer only minimal discount, as they do little to reduce the distress faced by witnesses or the administrative burden placed on the justice system. In parallel, there has been troubling national commentary regarding the perceived normalisation of low-level acquisitive crime, such as shoplifting, in policy debates. It merits reiteration that the law imposes no minimum threshold for what may constitute serious theft contrary to the Theft Act 1968. Each case is assessed on its facts, including the harm caused to victims and the intentions of the defendant, irrespective of monetary quantification alone. National data compiled by the Retail Theft Monitoring Unit notes a gradually increasing trend in shoplifting offences over the past decade, particularly affecting small, independent retailers lacking the resources of larger chains. This pattern has repercussions both economically and socially, with staff frequently reporting anxiety and diminished morale after repeat burglaries of stock, losses, and episodic confrontations. The Theft Act 1968 remains the legislative cornerstone of offences under consideration here. The definition of theft as ‘dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving’ is unambiguous. Sentencing, guided by the Sentencing Council’s definitive Theft Offences guideline, calls for careful weighing of factors, including the value and nature of the goods, the impact on victims, recurrence of offending, use of deception, and aggravating or mitigating circumstances. This court acknowledges recent appellate decisions — R v. Ellison [2021] EWCA Crim 1751 — where the Court upheld custodial sentences for persistent shoplifting offences causing distress and disruption beyond mere financial loss, including to victims’ sense of security and livelihood. Consistently, the courts reflect the need to send a clear message discouraging repeated acquisitive offending which undermines public confidence and trust. I would also refer to the decision in R v. Dunbar [2022] EWCA Crim 565, a case involving multiple offences of theft from a chain of pharmacies. The defendant in Dunbar was sentenced to a community order with rehabilitation requirements, reflecting a nuanced approach when vulnerability and engagement with support services were demonstrated. That case, while instructive on sentencing options, is factually distinguishable from the present offence. Parallels may also be drawn, albeit cautiously, to the regulatory framework within the Environmental Offences regime, where R v. Kendall [2019] EWCA Crim 1005 found that persistent fly-tipping on green belt land over several months warranted significant custodial sentencing given the environmental damage and ongoing defiance. By way of further context, the court recalls the difficulties brought to bear in the case of R v. Tyler [2018] EWCA Crim 288, where the defendant was convicted of affray following a public disturbance involving pool cues at a licensed venue. While obviously unrelated directly in offence type, that case reiterates the court’s persistent concern about the escalation risks inherent in public disorder. Though your offence involves no violence, offences of acquisitive crime sometimes present latent threat potential when victims or staff feel intimidated. Similarly, the case of R v. Hill [2017] EWCA Crim 711, involving possession of a bladed article found in a school car park, underscores that sentencing must engage with context, public protection considerations, and the harm caused, rather than merely the letter of the law. Before turning to the specifics, I find it instructive to note the important role played by partnership arrangements, such as the Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRP) and the Safer Neighbourhood Teams (SNT). Evidence submitted to this court shows active engagement by borough-based teams coordinating resources to reduce repeat offending and share intelligence. Such collaborations also monitor emerging offences, but as in this jurisdiction, the impact of fluctuating staffing levels and competing priorities means that sustained coverage can often be compromised. Nevertheless, here, partnership working has operated with commendable continuity. Letters provided by several retailers and employees affected repeatedly by thefts in their premises illustrate the wider social effects of your offending. Staff reported heightened stress levels, reduced confidence in the workplace, and the need to adopt protective measures such as additional locking of shelves or reduced presence during high-risk periods. The economic impact, while individually modest, aggregated to a nontrivial cumulative effect on the viability of some small retailers already struggling in the current retail climate. One victim impact statement came from Ms A. Patel, manager of an independent chemist on Dockside Road, who notes the necessity of installing additional closed-circuit equipment and hiring a security guard after a series of small but targeted thefts. The court acknowledges that while these measures may deter, they impose cost burdens ultimately borne by legitimate customers through increased retail prices. Similarly, correspondence received from the Retail Staff Welfare Network emphasised the psychological cost of persistent theft on store employees, particularly those working shifts with reduced colleague presence. This forms a key contextual consideration underpinning the court’s approach. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. The prosecution has relied substantially on photographic and video evidence obtained from fixed and portable CCTV units. You were recorded at multiple locations using similar disguising methods: for example, employing layered clothing to conceal small items, employing distraction techniques involving the use of a mobile phone, and utilising hand movements designed to obscure store staff’s view. Furthermore, you were observed on at least one occasion removing security tags prior to exiting the store—an action which elevates the degree of planning and sophistication in your conduct. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. Security personnel at one premises described your demeanour as ‘controlled and measured,’ though persistent. There were no physical confrontations; however, the cumulative effect understandably caused anxiety. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. Notably, an informant to the Business Crime Reduction Partnership flagged your presence on several occasions entering premises shortly before peak staffing changes, suggesting deliberate timing to maximise opportunity and reduce risk of detection. The repeated nature of the offending demonstrated a running pattern of behaviour over several months, with several breaches of earlier community resolutions and warning letters issued by police. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. It should be noted that the Metropolitan Police Service reports considerable effort expended on surveillance, evidence collation, and victim liaison in shoplifting cases such as this. This diverts specialist resources from violent crime investigation and organised crime task forces. The strain on forensic analysis units is particularly acute, with digital evidence requiring thorough and time-consuming examination. In addition to police resources, the Probation Service in this area is operating consecutive caseloads well beyond national targets — a factor which diminishes the availability of proactive support for offenders prior to sentencing. Reports from probation officers have lamented the increasing pressure they face in delivering rehabilitative programmes matched to the diverse needs of those caught in such offending cycles. There are broader implications for agencies providing social care and mental health support. The NHS has documented rising waiting times for psychological interventions, including those for impulse control disorders and substance misuse. Liaison between criminal justice agencies and health providers remains a work in progress, and defendants such as yourself often fall between gaps in service provision. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. The psychiatric report prepared by Dr Rhodri Evans, consultant forensic psychiatrist, concludes that you exhibit no diagnosable major mental illness. His observations note traits associated with impulsivity and mild depressive episodes but find no sufficient clinical grounds to mitigate or excuse the offending. Engagement with support services has been sporadic and largely unreciprocated. Dr Evans’ report also highlights the absence of genuine remorse or acknowledgement of the impact of your conduct on victims, a factor the court must weigh carefully. The Probation Service pre-sentence report documents a pattern of repeat acquisitive offending, intertwined with unstable housing and precarious financial circumstances. It also notes prior opportunities for diversionary measures were not taken up. The officer preparing the report recommends consideration of a community order incorporating Rehabilitation Activity and Unpaid Work requirements to balance punitive and remedial elements. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. It must be underlined that a key element in the sentencing framework seeks to balance the imperatives of public protection, punishment, and rehabilitation. The court is mindful that custodial sentences for low-level offences are not automatically appropriate, particularly when community measures may be tailored to address specific criminogenic needs. Moreover, the efficacy of community orders is closely linked to the genuine engagement of the defendant. To that end, I reiterate the necessity of securing an up-to-date and robust pre-sentence report to assist in tailoring an effective intervention strategy. It is relevant to record that this courtroom was recently refurbished to improve accessibility and video-link capability, reflecting ongoing efforts to modernise the criminal justice estate. However, the deployment of remote attendance during the pandemic caused certain delays in defence counsel engagement, which in turn has, on occasion, impacted timetabling. Interpreter services were engaged for a witness in a related case last month, but their late arrival caused brief adjournment, a reminder that logistical complexities persist. The court also acknowledges the continued dedicated service of its ushers and clerks, whose meticulous management of documentation, witness scheduling, and courtroom order often goes unseen but is vital to effective justice delivery. On a tangential but affecting note, the sudden closure of a local shelter supporting persons at risk of homelessness last year — due to funding constraints — has been linked in wider policy discussions to increased rates of acquisitive crime in specific London boroughs. A recent independent review by the Home Office of Legal Aid administrative structures has also confirmed systemic backlogs in processing applications for expert reports in criminal cases, particularly impacting defendants without means to self-fund such assessments. The court cannot underscore enough that such wider systemic challenges form an important backdrop but do not excuse individual culpability. Given the volume and complexity of these considerations, the sentencing decision will remain reserved until a comprehensive pre-sentence report, inclusive of all relevant assessments and representations, has been received and considered. These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 17 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Central Criminal Court, Wapping. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded according to the requirements of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and any disposal imposed will be notified to the relevant authorities for dissemination. You are advised of your right to appeal against any custodial sentence or community order imposed, within 28 days of such sentence being passed, under the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs remain reserved pending final determination.
