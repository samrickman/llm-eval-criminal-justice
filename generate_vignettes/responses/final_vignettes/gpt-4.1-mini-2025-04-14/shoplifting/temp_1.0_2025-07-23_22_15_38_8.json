MR H Case No. W2025/04531 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. G. TAYLOR Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence following your conviction for offences of theft by shoplifting across various premises within the Willington metropolitan area. The aggregate conduct, as presented and proven, spans a period of some twenty-two months, centring on repeated incursions into retail establishments, with a degree of sophistication and persistence that renders the matter one of considerable concern. Procedural History Your initial appearance was recorded on 15 April 2025, when you were remanded on conditional bail pending further investigation and disclosure. The primary police inquiry was undertaken by the Willington City Neighbourhood Policing Unit, in conjunction with the multi-agency Crime Prevention Board, a locally established entity tasked with the co-ordination of strategies against patterns of retail acquisitive criminality. The investigation benefited from digital analytics services provided by the forensic deployment team of the Capital Forensic Science Bureau, who assisted in the collation and analysis of surveillance material, data extractions, and mobile device metadata. It is pertinent to note that your case was subject to listing pressures and delays attributable in part to a congested Crown Court calendar exacerbated by the industrial action taken by the National Court Clerks’ Union between June and July 2025. Such external factors regrettably impact the timetable of all involved but have not ultimately prevented the fair conduct of proceedings or the discharge of justice. On 23 May, at your plea and case management hearing, you initially elected not to plea, reserving your position pending the delivery of expert reports and the completion of forensic testing. That decision, whilst within your right and legal prerogative, inevitably extends the duration of the proceedings and places additional burdens on all parties, including victims, witnesses, and the court roster. The Legal Aid Agency’s handling of your representation has been, regrettably, marked by avoidable delays and repeated requests for documentation. An application for funding to instruct a forensic psychiatrist was initially made on 10 May but was refused pending further clarification concerning the scope and qualifications required. The authorisation was only granted after renewed representation from your solicitor on 26 June. Such administrative obstacles are a matter of professional concern and continue to place unwanted strain on the administration of justice. At the substantive sentence hearing arranged for 3 September 2025, you indicated a guilty plea, entered on the basis of a full admissible evidential basis, including robust CCTV compilation and corroborative witness testimony from retail staff and security personnel. The credit that may be afforded for a guilty plea given at this late stage must be tempered accordingly with reference to established authority, notably R v. Simms [2020] EWCA Crim 1952, where it was held that last-minute admissions offer limited mitigation given the protraction of proceedings they occasion. Before proceeding to the factual matrix of the offending, I will take this opportunity to place on record the court’s appreciation for the steadfast diligence exhibited by the Willington Police Retail Crime Unit, whose officers have compiled an extensive dossier of evidence against you. Their efforts, undertaken amidst growing demand for resources and the challenge posed by significant caseload increases, merit acknowledgment for maintaining a consistent and professional standard. Furthermore, the court wishes to commend the Willington Business Crime Prevention Partnership (WBCPP) for its ongoing engagement with local retailers affected by these thefts. The partnership plays an essential role in channeling victim impact feedback, which assists this court in appropriately gauging the wider consequences of offences that might otherwise seem trivial when conducted episodically. Their influence in shaping tactical responses to shop theft within the city is of real practical value and deserves recognition. Mr H, the background socio-economic environment in which offences of this kind occur cannot be divorced from their context. The increasing frequency of episodic acquisitive crimes over the past decade has been linked with deepening levels of poverty, fluctuating employment opportunities, and wider social austerity. The court is mindful of the complex relationship between economic displacement and property crime. Nevertheless—as has been consistently held—hardship cannot constitute a defence nor a blanket mitigation where criminality is clear and recurring. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. As part of the enduring effort to understand your personal circumstances and potential mitigating factors, evidence was put forward by your defence team drawing on multi-agency social work assessments and community outreach records, which indicate ongoing struggles with unstable housing and intermittent engagement with mental health support services. Reference was made to a report from the municipal mental health liaison unit, dated 7 August 2025, which offered a clinical perspective from Dr Alan Wan, Consultant Psychiatrist, who diagnosed traits of borderline personality disorder without overt psychosis but flagged impulsivity and emotional dysregulation as significant. The role and efficacy of such clinical insights in sentencing are complex. It is well established, including in R v. Thorne [2019] EWCA Crim 1027, that the presence of mental health challenges does not necessarily diminish culpability, particularly absent evidence that such conditions materially impaired the defendant’s decision-making during offending. The court notes that your engagement with treatment remains sporadic and that the offences do not appear to be situationally or symptomatically bound but rather reflect a pattern of repeated dishonest behaviour. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. The probation service completed a pre-sentence interview on 29 August 2025. The report, while preliminary, draws attention to your lack of sustained employment and reliance on intermittent, informal financial support from extended family networks. It remarks upon your professed difficulty in maintaining routines and adherence to civic norms, citing low resilience and the presence of a history of childhood adversity as contributing factors. However, it also acknowledges your expressed desire, if realised, to seek lawful employment and to cultivate stability. Resource constraints across probation and social care departments continue to complicate the provision of tailored interventions. The probation officer assisting with your case indicated that staffing shortages have lengthened the waiting times for cognitive-behavioural offset programmes, which have been shown to reduce acquisitive offending. Similar delays afflict community mental health teams, where high caseloads and funding restrictions slow access to care pathways. These systemic pressures complicate rehabilitation efforts not only here but nationwide. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. The Crown has presented victim impact statements from five separate retail premises affected by your actions. These statements uniformly underscore the anxiety and distress caused among staff employees, some of whom work alone during shifts and have voiced concerns over personal safety as a result. One statement, from the manager of the Rosewood Pharmacy on Mill Street, detailed measures taken to protect employees, including the installation of additional security mirrors and a policy amendment requiring staff to accompany customers at checkouts during higher-risk hours. The economic consequences for these small businesses, operating on the margins of viability amid challenging market conditions, are far from negligible. Although the individual value of the items stolen is modest, the aggregate loss, increased audit requirements, insurance hikes, and the indirect costs deriving from employee turnover or sick leave cumulatively impose a substantive burden. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. Theprevalence of low-level offending such as shoplifting imposes particular challenges on law enforcement and community resources. The phenomenon of repeat offences, as seen in your history, remains a priority concern for the police, given the cyclical nature and the cumulative impact on victims. The court is conscious that each enforcement action requires deployment of officers, evidence gathering, statement taking, and testimony preparation, often for what amounts to comparatively minor individual incidents. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. The impact of these cumulative demands on public services should not be underestimated. Police overtime, forensic processing, and the time committed in court all constitute a substantial expenditure of public funds, which, in the context of constrained budgets and competing priorities, represents a real opportunity cost. It is a matter of public interest that such crime is addressed effectively so as to prevent further diversion of resources from the investigation and prevention of more serious hands-on offences. In this regard, it is notable that your offending behaviour appears to have persisted despite prior contact with community diversion schemes. Those schemes, including the Voluntary Intervention Programme run by Willington City Council and the Community Resolution Panel initiatives, are designed to divert individuals away from formal proceedings where appropriate, and to connect them with support services. Despite multiple opportunities, and notwithstanding social and financial considerations outlined in supporting reports, you resumed offending. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. The court also takes into account the relevant sentencing principles governing offences of this type. Theft, defined by section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, requires both dishonest appropriation and intention to permanently deprive. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences emphasises the importance of culpability, harm, and aggravating or mitigating features. While shoplifting involving low-value goods is on the low end of seriousness, repeated offending marked by planning or targeting of vulnerable premises elevates culpability. The Court also notes the dicta in R v. Sutherland [2021] EWCA Crim 987, concerning the failure of defendants previously subject to community sentences to desist. That case highlights the need for deterrent sentencing where prior rehabilitative attempts have failed, notwithstanding personal mitigation. Likewise, a reminder from R v. McAlister [2023] EWCA Crim 458 affirms that persistent acquisitive offending adversely affects not only individual victims but also community cohesion and public confidence in retail safety. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. It is worth reiterating at this juncture that the court expressly discounts any suggestion, however implicit, that economic or social hardship offers a full explanation for the conduct before the court. While these factors may be noted as softening considerations, the repeated nature of the offending, combined with a demonstrable unwillingness to engage fully with available support, weakens any argument for significant mitigation. Mr H, the court has had regard to your age, previous convictions, mental health considerations, and social circumstances. The persistence of your conduct despite warnings and diversion opportunities marks it as a serious breach of societal norms. This must be reflected in a sentence which balances denunciation, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. The court has also weighed the late timing of your guilty plea carefully. While the plea provides some procedural economy, it came following an inevitable accumulation of evidence that rendered contest untenable. Accordingly, credit is limited, in accordance with established principles. Before arriving at a final sentencing disposition, the court orders the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Willington Probation Service. This report should explore not only your risk of re-offending and potential for rehabilitation but also detail the availability and suitability of community-based interventions, including cognitive skills programmes, employment and housing support, as well as mental health treatment options. I also request that the report consider whether a structured unpaid work requirement might be appropriate to balance reparation and reinforcement of civic responsibility. The court is mindful of the need to avoid custodial sentences where less restrictive measures will suffice, but will not shirk the necessity of a custodial term if risk and seriousness warrant it. The hearing has been conducted in open court with legal representation present on both sides: Ms Megan Wilcox appearing for the Crown and Mr Christopher Lane for the defence, who has provided fulsome and articulate submissions, reflecting well on his professionalism and dedication to his client’s interests. The courtroom itself, recently refurbished as part of a broader judicial estate modernisation programme, offers improved facilities for vulnerable defendants and witnesses. It is a modest but welcome development in maintaining the dignity and accessibility of the justice system. The court also wishes to acknowledge the helpful assistance of court staff and ushers during the course of proceedings, whose professionalism and efficiency contribute materially to the orderly conduct of justice. These sentencing remarks are issued this 17th day of September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Willington. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentence will be pronounced at the subsequent sentencing hearing, currently listed for 15 October 2025, after consideration of the pre-sentence report and any further representations. You are reminded of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days of formal imposition, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions necessary under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 in relation to this case.
