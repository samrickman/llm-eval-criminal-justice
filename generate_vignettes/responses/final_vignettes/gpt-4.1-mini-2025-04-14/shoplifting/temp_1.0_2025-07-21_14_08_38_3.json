MR H Case No. RB/2025/14429 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. A. LANGLEY Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you come before this court for sentence following your conviction for offences of theft by shoplifting, in breach of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct spans a significant period between November 2023 and June 2025 and was committed across a range of retail outlets within the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham as well as neighbouring wards. The offences represent a sustained course of dishonesty and calculated theft that has caused genuine distress among victims and wider repercussions within local business communities. Procedural Overview The case was originally charged at Barking Magistrates’ Court following your arrest on 28 June 2025. You were detained under investigation subsequent to a multi-agency inquiry coordinated by the Barking and Dagenham Retail Crime Partnership and the Metropolitan Police Service’s Specialist Crime Unit. Intelligence was gathered over a period exceeding fourteen months, incorporating evidence from numerous local businesses, CCTV footage, police patrol logs, and witness statements. Upon committal, the case was passed to this court for sentence pursuant to the Crown Court allocation scheme due to the scale and complexity of the offending. Your initial appearance in this court occurred on 7 July 2025, when you entered a not guilty plea. A plea and trial preparation hearing followed on 22 August 2025, at which point defence counsel indicated that a guilty plea would be forthcoming. However, the final admission of guilt was not tendered until the first day of trial on 15 September 2025, following detailed review of prosecution evidence and a pre-sentence psychiatric assessment. The court, recognising the pattern of late pleas in similarly situated cases, notes the effect on the efficient administration of justice and will, in due course, give appropriate credit for your eventual admission of responsibility. It is important to observe that this court was informed that the Legal Aid Agency’s processing of applications for expert psychiatric assistance in your case was protracted and marked by considerable procedural delays. The initial request for funding to instruct Dr Sarah Eastman, a forensic psychologist with expertise in acquisitive offending, was submitted on 16 July 2025 but only approved following numerous correspondence exchanges on 3 September 2025. These delays, while regrettable, underscore systemic challenges in resource allocation and administrative procedures within the legal aid framework, which continue to impact the timely resolution of cases involving vulnerable defendants. At all hearing stages, the court has benefited from the professional diligence of Ms Laura Benson, appearing on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Daniel Roberts, your instructed counsel on a legal aid funded basis. Both counsel have made detailed submissions directed at ensuring that sentencing reflects the balance between public protection, personal mitigation, and the overarching principle of proportionality. The cooperation demonstrated by prosecution and defence teams is noted with appreciation. The court also acknowledges the engagement of community support organisations, notably the Barking East Neighbourhood Support Network, whose written submissions provide insights into the broader socio-economic context in which offending occurs, without seeking to excuse it. Their efforts to support both victims and offenders reveal the complex web of interdependencies involved in addressing acquisitive crime. The Theft Act 1968 remains the principal legislative source governing offences such as those before the court. Shoplifting, while often perceived as a low-level offence, has evolved substantially in its patterns and methods, prompting the Sentencing Council to issue updated guidelines on theft offences in 2023. Those guidelines reinforce that repeated offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, and the aggravating impact on victims and local commerce properly attract increased custodial considerations. Cases such as R v. Fairbairn [2019] EWCA Crim 465 illuminate the court’s approach to repeated shoplifting where the defendant exhibits persistence despite prior sanctions and community interventions. There, a sentence of 21 months’ immediate custody was upheld, reflecting the destabilising effect on small businesses and workforce morale. Similarly, the decision in R v. Cheung [2022] EWCA Crim 1307 highlighted the court’s recognition of the cumulative harm inflicted by serial theft from independent retailers, emphasizing the psychological distress on staff and the erosion of community trust. In comparative terms, cases involving offenders with prior convictions who breach bail or community orders—as in R v. Connors [2021] EWCA Crim 990—are illustrative of reluctance to desist and warrant sentences that convey clear denunciation and deterrence. While your circumstances diverge in specifics, these authorities form the backdrop against which the present sentencing exercise must be viewed. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. It is well-recognised that serial acquisitive offences, though often involving items of modest monetary value, propagate disproportionate social harm. The aggregate effect of sustained dishonesty corrodes the operational viability of small and medium enterprises, fosters an atmosphere of suspicion and vigilance, and contributes to a deterioration of public order. Staff often face increased pressures, leading to disrupted work patterns and operational constraints that erode service quality and employee welfare. Indeed, retail crime reduction forums have repeatedly documented the strain placed on in-store and security personnel forced to contend with frequent losses, the deployment of enhanced security measures, and the psychological toll exacted by exposure to persistent offending. From a prosecutorial standpoint, there is a growing imperative to approach such offending not as isolated lapses, but as patterns indicative of underlying risk and recidivism. Your case falls precisely into this categorisation. This court is mindful of the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in managing the competing demands posed by acquisitive crime alongside serious organised and violent crime. The allocation of investigative resources to secure your prosecution demonstrates the priority accorded to such offences. Notably, electronic evidence was gathered through a carefully coordinated partnership between police digital forensic units and local retail security teams, highlighting the evolving nature of intelligence-led policing. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. Your personal circumstances, as detailed in the Probation Service’s pre-sentence report dated 10 September 2025, reflect a complex interplay of adverse experiences, economic hardship, and intermittent engagement with support agencies. You are recorded as currently unemployed, residing in temporary accommodation provided by the Barking Housing Association, and having a limited support network. The report sensibly observes that while you suffer no recognised severe mental health disorders, there persists a degree of emotional dysregulation and impulsivity that may have contributed to your offending behaviour. Critically, the report emphasises variable compliance with offered support, particularly in relation to debt counselling and alcohol misuse services. The court notes with concern that despite multiple outreach attempts, your engagement has been sporadic, limiting the effectiveness of therapeutic and rehabilitative interventions. It is essential to reaffirm that the existence of such services does not in itself absolve an offender of responsibility; rather, successful rehabilitation depends on meaningful uptake and sustained participation. Correspondence from the Barking Homelessness Prevention Team, received on 5 September 2025, underscores the acute pressures exerted on local housing provision, with substantial waiting lists and a predominance of temporary accommodation placements. This context, while undoubtedly challenging, cannot excuse or justify persistent offending. The capacity constraints across statutory and voluntary sectors are a sobering reality, reflecting broader social fractures rather than individual excuses. In this vein, the court reflects on the position taken in R v. Murphy [2020] EWCA Crim 789, where challenging life circumstances were acknowledged as mitigating factors but did not preclude the imposition of immediate custodial sentences given the public interest in deterrence and denunciation. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. Incident-specific Considerations and Victim Impact The Crown has adduced testimony and victim impact statements from staff at the affected retail outlets, which form a central part of the sentencing picture. Victims describe heightened anxiety during work, shifting schedules to avoid lone working, and in some cases, the withdrawal of staff from previously routine duties. Such disruption has economic and emotional implications that extend beyond the immediate value of stolen goods, diminishing workplace morale and fostering an environment of fear and uncertainty. One victim statement, from the manager of Eastwood Pharmacy, was particularly measured, reflecting professionalism yet acknowledging the lingering sense of vulnerability occasioned by repeat thefts. Staff turnover is noted to have increased, attributable in part to these sustained pressures. Moreover, the theft of certain over-the-counter pharmaceutical products carries potential health risks for the wider community by depleting available supplies. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. Parallels with Co-defendant and Associated Case Elements It is relevant to record that related investigations uncovered offences committed by third parties associated with the same retail locations, including one individual charged with dangerous driving in the course of fleeing police, and another facing charges of aggravated criminal damage to shop frontages. None of these acts are attributed to you personally, and there is no evidential basis for holding you accountable for these collateral matters. Nonetheless, the court is mindful of the cumulative impact of multi-faceted offending on public perceptions of safety and order. Additionally, a co-defendant in related proceedings recently received a custodial term for supply of controlled substances, an offence distinct in nature and separated from the theft charges that are the subject of your sentencing. It is important that your sentence reflect your conduct singularly and not become conflated with those associated proceedings, save for insofar as they illuminate the wider context of the offending environment. Your family dynamics, as explored in various reports, reveal little direct involvement, though correspondence from your sister, Ms Janine H., submitted in mitigation, reflects concern for your wellbeing and encouragement towards rehabilitation. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. The psychiatric report prepared by Dr Sarah Eastman is thorough and professionally composed. It indicates no diagnosis of major mental disorder but identifies moderate difficulties with impulse control, intermittent periods of low mood, and traits consistent with borderline personality features. While not sufficiently severe to warrant direct hospital-based treatment, Dr Eastman recommends structured psychological interventions focusing on cognitive-behavioural techniques aimed at improving emotional regulation and decision-making. The report also highlights your ambivalence towards engagement, suggesting that motivational interviewing and peer support groups may assist in fostering longer-term change. The availability of such specialist programmes within the probation service varies and is contingent on current caseloads and funding. It is regrettable that these resources are limited, as demand often exceeds supply. Recent publications on prison mental health indicate growing recognition of the difficulties offenders face in accessing consistent and meaningful support. A report by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2024 has called for enhanced coordination between health providers and criminal justice agencies to better manage cases with complex needs. While such initiatives offer promise for the future, the present case requires sentencing in the context of existing structures and available services. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. This court is acutely conscious of the need to protect the public, deter further offending, and promote rehabilitation. The balance between denunciation and therapeutic opportunity is a delicate one, particularly where offences are non-violent yet persistent, and where the offender’s social circumstances both invite sympathy and caution. The Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences articulates a starting point that reflects culpability and harm, adjusted for aggravating and mitigating factors. In your instance, aggravation arises from repetition, breach of prior conditions, and impact on vulnerable premises. Mitigation includes personal difficulties, absence of violence, and a belated guilty plea. Guidance from R v. Neville [2018] EWCA Crim 1294 advises that early engagement with rehabilitation and genuine acceptance of responsibility should attract appropriate credit, but that such factors do not diminish the need for community protection where offending is entrenched. Additionally, the role of unpaid work requirements, financial penalties, and structured activity within community sentences must be calibrated carefully against risk and likelihood of compliance. Community rehabilitation orders have proven effective in reducing reoffending in many acquisitive crime contexts, provided requisite supervision and support are maintained. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. In light of the foregoing, I shall defer sentence to allow the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by your appointed probation officer. That report should include assessment of your suitability for community programmes targeting acquisitive offending, mental health and substance misuse support, and any viable restorative justice avenues. It should also consider risk of reoffending and public protection needs. Sentencing will be fixed upon receipt and consideration of that report. In the interim, the court hopes you will reflect on the gravity of your conduct and embrace the opportunity for positive change. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Royal Barking Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to relevant agencies pursuant to statutory obligations. You are reminded of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.
