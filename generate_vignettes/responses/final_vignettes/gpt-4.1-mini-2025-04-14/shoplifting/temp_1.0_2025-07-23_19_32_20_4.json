Mr H Case No. B2025/13490 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. N. Radcliffe Filed: 15 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in respect of a representative charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, alleging a sustained pattern of thefts from retail premises within the Stratford and Warwick boroughs. The offending is alleged to have taken place between November 2023 and April 2025, principally involving non-violent appropriation of goods from local stores frequented by members of the community. Procedural History Your initial arrest took place on 28 April 2025 after an investigation led by the Warwickshire Retail Crime Unit, supported by community policing officers and staff from several affected businesses. The investigation itself unfolded over several months, during which time a number of premises, from convenience stores to high street chain outlets, reported repeated instances of theft characterised by analogue and digital surveillance capturing a consistent figure matching your description. The protracted nature of this inquiry speaks both to the challenges of policing such offences and to the court’s acknowledgement that acquisitive crime, despite often being dismissed as \"minor,\" places a considerable strain on civic order and public confidence. The case was first listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 16 June 2025 but was adjourned following the withdrawal of defence instructions and the subsequent resumption with representation under Legal Aid on 10 July 2025. The necessity for adjournments due to defence counsel changes and the attendant administrative burdens is a regrettably frequent feature of the modern criminal justice system, where resources are constrained and case management protocols, while robust in principle, often encounter real-world disruptions. It is worth noting that your initial not guilty plea was entered on 12 June 2025 but was later retracted on 1 September 2025 following receipt of extensive forensic evidence and witness statements, resulting in a late guilty plea before trial. Cases such as R v. Jamal [2023] EWCA Crim 1448 have confirmed the consequential diminution of credit afforded to defendants who only admit guilt near the close of proceedings, particularly where such admission is precipitated by the overwhelming strength of the prosecution’s case rather than voluntary acceptance of responsibility. The jurisprudence in this area remains clear: while a guilty plea benefits both the court and the defendants by conserving resources and sparing victims the trauma of trial, such benefit is proportionate to the timing and sincerity of the plea. The current proceeding was heard in open court with the presence of both Crown and defence representatives. I record my gratitude to Ms Jennifer Cartwright, prosecuting counsel instructed on behalf of the Crown, as well as to Mr Daniel Askew, of the Birmingham Legal Aid Panel, who has diligently represented Mr H throughout these proceedings. Their conduct has been professional and courteous, a credit to the Bar. Before turning to the specific details of the case, it is appropriate to consider the broader context in which offences of this nature occur. One cannot examine the offence in isolation from the prevailing social and institutional circumstances that shape both offending behaviour and the response of the justice system. In recent years, retail crime has posed a significant challenge to policing authorities and local government alike, particularly in areas facing economic and social pressures. The Warwickshire Police have publicly noted, in their 2024 annual report, a 12% increase in shoplifting incidents, with notable impact on small independent retailers as well as larger chains. This increase coincides with broader socio-economic trends, including the stagnation of real wages, the rising cost of living, and uneven access to support services, all of which feature in the background here, without excusing the offending conduct. It is also true that the capacity of local public services is stretched. The Probation Service in Warwickshire, as elsewhere, reports significant caseload pressures, with newly qualified officers frequently tasked with managing increasing volumes of complex clients, often involving underlying issues of substance misuse, mental health, and social vulnerabilities. Such pressures inevitably influence the resources available for supervision, intervention, and rehabilitation—factors this court must bear in mind when devising a sentence that must balance the demands of justice with realistic expectations of delivery. A further observational note pertains to the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative performance. The court must, reluctantly but candidly, express dissatisfaction with recent patterns of delay and procedural obfuscation in granting authority for expert reports. In this case, the initial application to instruct a forensic psychiatrist to conduct a comprehensive assessment under section 35 of the Mental Health Act 1983 was submitted on 21 July 2025 but was met with a series of incremental requests for clarification, resulting in approval only on 10 August. Such bureaucratic hurdles contribute to inefficiencies in case progression and professional frustration for instructed counsel and supporting experts alike. The defendant’s background has been explored through multiple channels. Of particular note is a detailed psychiatric report authored by Dr Helena Foster, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 6 October 2025, which provides a full psychological profile. The report highlights Mr H’s history of adjustment difficulties, episodic low mood, and impulsivity, but concludes there is no evidence of enduring psychotic disorder. Dr Foster recommends engagement with community mental health services and substance misuse interventions to assist with underlying contributory factors to offending. The report also emphasises Mr H’s inconsistent engagement with social support networks, reflecting a mixed pattern of compliance and sporadic cooperation. In considering the impact on the victims, we rely upon victim impact statements furnished by the Warwickshire Retail Association and letters of support from several local business proprietors. One letter, from the manager of the Stratford Supermarket on High Street, details the weariness and anxiety felt by staff, with some having considered resignation due to the repeated incidents. Such testimonies illustrate the lived reality behind the numbers and statistics: each incident ripples outward to affect the lives and livelihoods of ordinary people. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. Within the realm of sentencing principles, it is necessary to recall the guidelines established by the Sentencing Council pertaining to theft offences, last updated in 2023. These guidelines underscore the importance of considering the value of property stolen, the planning and sophistication of the offence, and any aggravating or mitigating factors, including the presence of prior convictions. The guidelines caution against unduly lenient sentences in cases involving persistent offending, while recognising the value of early pleas and steps towards rehabilitation. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. Turning to specific legal precedents, the Court recalls R v. McDonnell [2021] EWCA Crim 3007, where the Court of Appeal affirmed a custodial sentence of twelve months for repeated shoplifting offences involving sophisticated concealment and diversionary tactics, notwithstanding the low monetary value of items stolen. The court observed that cumulative harm, including psychological effects on victims and community confidence, warrants sentences reflecting the broader societal impact. Similarly, in R v. Bentley [2022] EWCA Crim 1574, the defendant’s deliberate manipulation of retail layouts and use of accomplices to facilitate repeated thefts was held to be an aggravating feature justifying an immediate custodial sentence despite the early guilty plea. While Mr H pleads guilty at a later stage, and there is no evidence of complicity with any third party, the degree to which the offending was sustained gives cause for concern. To illustrate contrasting outcomes, I note R v. Price [2019] EWCA Crim 2149, a case in which the defendant received a community rehabilitation order following first-time offending combined with clear engagement with social support services. This example serves as a useful comparator to reinforce the criticality of such mitigating factors in guiding sentencing outcomes. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. Regarding protective considerations, the issue of housing instability has been raised by the defence and social workers involved in the case. The National Housing Federation’s 2024 report on temporary accommodation notes the sharp increase in households placed in bed-and-breakfast style arrangements due to shortages in social housing stock, an issue with nationwide implications. It was also brought to the court’s attention that your living situation involves a short-term tenancy in a shared flat, with ongoing uncertainty about long-term stability, which is not uncommon in circumstances of economic hardship. Mr H used a question about Oyster Card transactions to divert the shopkeeper’s attention, then leaned over the counter to take a displayed item. Nonetheless, instability is not ipso facto a shield against accountability; it does, however, speak to the complex interplay between deprivation and offending behaviour, which the court is mindful to consider, particularly in sentencing for acquisitive and non-violent offences. Accepting the submissions made by Mr Askew on your behalf, he emphasised your previously unblemished record for violent crime, your expressed remorse, and your tentative willingness to engage with proposed rehabilitative programmes. The defence respectfully requested that the court give consideration to community-based sentencing options with structured support, including cognitive behavioural therapy and financial management assistance. The Crown, represented by Ms Cartwright, rightly reminded the court of the need to uphold public confidence through sentences that reflect the cumulative nature of persistent theft, the distress caused to retail staff, and the necessity of deterrence, both general and specific. In the context of multi-agency working, this court acknowledges the local Business Crime Reduction Board’s evolving role, designed to provide strategic oversight and information sharing across policing, trading standards, local councils, and voluntary organisations. While the remit is wide and sometimes hampered by resource constraints, their intervention in this case helped catalyse intelligence gathering and victim support. The Safer Neighbourhood Team provided a community impact assessment, dated 28 September 2025, noting increased reports of theft-related incidents in Stratford’s town centre and their correlation with drops in foot traffic and local business turnover. This assessment underlines the economic and social harm beyond the immediate monetary losses. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. The court has obtained and reviewed a pre-sentence report compiled by Mr Stephen O’Connor, probation officer, dated 10 October 2025. It offers an extensive evaluation of your background, offending patterns, and personal circumstances. The report emphasises moderate risk of reoffending absent sustained intervention and underscores your failure to maintain consistent engagement with support services. It recommends a community order incorporating a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement (RAR), cognitive skills work, and referral for a substance misuse assessment given reported alcohol use—though your relationship with treatment providers has been described as “intermittent and cautious.” The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. The report further notes your reluctance to disclose full family support circumstances, complicating efforts to secure informal social assistance. This experience echoes wider systemic challenges in securing adequate familial or community support in cases of acquisitive crime. Turning briefly to the conduct of this court, it should be observed that the courtroom itself recently underwent refurbishment, with new acoustic treatments and updated digital facilities designed to improve the quality of hearings and accessibility for all participants. Though tangential to the substance of sentencing, the court takes pride in maintaining a professional and considerate environment, recognising that dignity in these proceedings serves justice. The court clerk and usher are thanked for their assistance in the smooth administration of this hearing, particularly in accommodating the attendance of vulnerable witnesses and ensuring compliance with disclosure obligations under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5 regarding evidence management and record keeping. It is regrettable, however, that on occasion there have been late arrivals of interpreter services in cases where defendants or witnesses possess limited English proficiency. Although not an issue in this case, the court notes this continuing procedural challenge, as timely communication is essential in delivering fair and just outcomes. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The defendant’s personal statement to the court, composed with care and legibly handwritten, conveyed genuine regret and a resolve to desist from further offending. While reflective statements are always to be welcomed, the court remains cautioned by the pattern of prior engagement and disengagement with supervision. Notwithstanding, the court acknowledges the defense’s efforts to coordinate letters of support from local charities, including Warwickshire Outreach, which provides housing advice and substance misuse services. These organisations find themselves increasingly overstretched, constrained by short funding cycles and the cumulative demand from cases like yours. It is well established that the principle of proportionality must guide sentencing in theft cases. Justice is not served by disproportionate penalties but must balance the critical aims of deterrence, public protection, rehabilitation, and reparation. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. In closing, the court reiterates that acquisitive offending — while sometimes shrugged off as ‘victimless’ — in reality causes tangible harm to individuals, businesses, and communities. It erodes trust, contributes to feelings of insecurity, and imposes costs that ripple through the local economy and social fabric. Given the late guilty plea, the absence of violence or threats, your expressed intent to cooperate with interventions, and the mitigating factors recounted above, this court is minded to consider a community sentence incorporating rehabilitative elements. Custody, while never lightly imposed, remains an option where public protection or denunciation demand it. I shall therefore adjourn this matter, directing that a final pre-sentence report be provided which specifically addresses the viability of proposed community measures, your engagement potential, and risk management strategies. Any updated psychiatric or social reports will be welcome and should be submitted no later than two weeks before the rescheduled sentencing hearing. This court is bound to ensure that any sentence serves not only the individual interest of rehabilitation but also the paramount public interest in preventing reoffending and maintaining local confidence in the justice system. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 October 2025, in Court 5 at Stratford Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal sentencing hearing is scheduled for 12 November 2025. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.
