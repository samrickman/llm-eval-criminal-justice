MR H Case No. WX2025/14679 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. R. Ellington Filed: 12 August 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence on the charge of theft, specifically shoplifting, brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge reflects a representative offence encapsulating a series of incidents occurring between November 2023 and April 2025, primarily within retail premises situated in the boroughs of Windsor, Maidenhead, and Slough. Procedural History Your prosecution followed a lengthy multi-agency operation spearheaded by the Windsor Retail Security Partnership (WRSP), which, responding to an observed rise in retail theft reports, embarked upon an intelligence-led forum aiming to reduce the prevalence of store burglaries and shoplifting incidents across the region. Data from business CCTV systems, coupled with police incident reports, informed the identification of suspect profiles, leading to a concentrated focus on individuals exhibiting patterns of repeated offending in high-footfall commercial zones. This operational model aligns with practices advocated by the Home Office Business Crime Strategy (2022), despite its known limitations regarding inter-agency communication and funding constraints. The investigative phase was characterised by protracted surveillance activities encompassing coordination with transport authorities, including an unauthorized scrutiny of public transit usage data — conducted under recently issued judicial authority in compliance with the Investigation Powers Act 2016 — as well as engagement with retail loss-prevention teams. The procedural intricacies inherent in this coordinated approach speak to the broader challenges faced by law enforcement in combating acquisitive offences without recourse to more overtly coercive investigative tactics. It bears noting that while the WRSP metadata analysis came under internal review for data retention compliance during the period in question, no procedural improprieties were identified materially affecting the investigatory outcome. Conversely, the length of the investigation inevitably placed additional strain upon frontline police resources, arguably detracting from higher priority assignments. However, the court must emphasise that the principle of equality before the law necessitates such proportional allocation of attention, regardless of the perceived gravity of the offence. Your initial interview under caution took place on 14 May 2025 at Windsor Police Station. This followed your apprehension on 10 May, a date memorialised in a letter from District Inspector Sarah Coleman to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which commends the diligent cross-referencing of offences that yielded your identification as the principal suspect. During this interview, you elected not to engage further than providing your name and address, exercising your right to silence. Post-charge, however, you entered a guilty plea at the Plea and Case Management Hearing on 20 June 2025. The court is mindful that the case progressed under the Better Case Management regime, adhering generally to the Criminal Procedure Rules’ indicative timelines despite some documented challenges posed by short-staffing and the need to afford Legal Aid applications the requisite scrutiny. I must observe, with no small measure of frustration, that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of your defence authorisation presented avoidable complications. Specifically, the request to instruct an independent forensic psychologist was initially refused in May 2025 due to misclassified eligibility criteria, only rectified after the intervention of your appointed counsel, Mr Benjamin Callow, following a prolonged correspondence extending into early June. Such delays, while regrettably frequent elsewhere, invariably prejudice timely access to expert opinion and inhibit comprehensive case preparation. These systemic inefficiencies risk diluting the rights of defendants and, by extension, the integrity of the courtroom process. The trial listing itself experienced a curtailed rescheduling due to a minor administrative oversight involving court staff deployment on 17 July 2025, which, while of no lasting consequence to you, underscores the pressures endured by the judicial system in the current climate of resource constraint. In examining your prior record, it is necessary to situate your history within the context of relatively limited, yet not insignificant, previous contacts with the justice system. You have three prior convictions for theft-related offences between 2018 and 2023, including one occasion where a community resolution was imposed, reflecting the court's willingness to promote diversionary mechanisms in suitable circumstances. Yet these measures evidently did not deter further offending, thereby justifying this court’s consideration of a more robust disposal. It is germane, before turning to the facts, to mention the victim impact submissions tendered by the Retail Support and Recovery Network (RSRN), a charity that supports independent store owners affected by acquisitive crimes in the region. Their report, compiled subsequent to an extensive survey of affected establishments, details the cumulative financial loss — estimated at £45,000 over two years — and highlights the adverse effects on staff morale and retention, particularly among vulnerable younger employees. The economic and psychosocial detriments noted therein belie any simplistic characterisation of petty theft as victimless crime. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. This court recognises the nuanced challenges faced by retailers in this sector, who contend not only with economic pressures from supply chain volatility but also with the psychological wear of repeated loss and the attendant erosion of community trust. Such factors amplify the seriousness with which offences of this nature must be approached. It is in this vein that the sentencing guidelines published by the Sentencing Council in 2023 emphasise the significance of cumulative harm and repeated offending, even absent physical violence or high-value thefts. In establishing the factual matrix for your offences, it is appropriate also to contextualise the investigative and evidential landscape. The Crown's case was bolstered by covert recordings and the testimony of loss prevention officers, whose accounts were consistent and credible. Further forensic analysis identified your fingerprints on security alarm panels forcibly manipulated during the commission of one episode, underscoring the calculated elements of your conduct. Notwithstanding this, the court acknowledges your eventual expression of remorse and early engagement with rehabilitation planning. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. Turning to the expert evidence, the court is grateful to have received the psychiatric and psychological assessments undertaken by Dr Rebecca Lennox, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, and a complementary report from Probation Officer Mr Samuel Ginn. Dr Lennox’s comprehensive evaluation draws attention to your longstanding difficulties with impulsivity and financial instability, coupled with a history of mild depressive episodes — an observation echoed, albeit with notes of caution, in Mr Ginn’s pre-sentence assessment. The latter identifies a moderate risk of reoffending, contingent upon engagement with appropriate cognitive-behavioural interventions and sustained economic support. In this context, it is germane to refer to the findings of R v Zamir [2019] EWCA Crim 1324, where the Court of Appeal underscored the importance of addressing underlying psychosocial factors in tailoring sentences to achieve rehabilitation and public protection. While the facts differ materially, Zamir sets a precedent for integrating clinical insights into sentencing calibrations. It is also notable that your defence has sought to place emphasis upon familial disruption experienced during adolescence and current episodes of transient homelessness, supported by letters from both your sister, Ms Eloise H, and your caseworker at the Windsor Homeless Outreach Project. These letters attest to your intermittent engagement with support networks and mark a tentative willingness on your part to address the antecedents of your offending. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. Notwithstanding such mitigating material, the court is compelled to reflect on the injurious pattern of repeated acquisition theft, which signals a persistent disregard for social and legal norms and, arguably, an opportunistic exploitation of community goodwill. Whilst the absence of violence or threats is noted, the court must regard your offending as undermining public confidence in lawful commerce and the security of local trade. The court further notes that previous diversionary measures failed to stem the escalation of harm, thereby implicating the suitability of rehabilitative disposals as presently structured. In respect of ancillary case law bearing on sentencing principle, this court is instructed by the approach elucidated in R v Bennett [2020] EWCA Crim 2187, where the appellate tribunal reaffirmed that the efficacy of non-custodial sentences must be balanced carefully against the multiplicity and persistence of offending behaviours. Bennett, involving a series of petty frauds, reiterated that community sentences, while preferable in principle, require genuine compliance and demonstrable effectivity to justify avoidance of custody. It is germane also to remark upon the relevance of the “totality principle,” reflected in the guidance of R v Harland [2016] EWCA Crim 1600, which directs sentencing courts to impose overall sentences proportionate to the aggregate criminality demonstrated, avoiding unjustifiable cumulative harshness or undue leniency. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. In matters relating to sentencing frameworks, this court is bound to apply the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guidelines (2023), which afford detailed quadripartite categorisation, ranging from category 1 — offences of high culpability and damage — through category 4, encompassing low-value, poorly planned offences with no aggravating features. The jury in this matter has convicted you of an offence within category 3, indicative of moderate culpability and prevalent adverse effects on victims and communities. The court also considers relevant the principles embodied within the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, notably sections 142 and 143, articulating the court’s discretion to order ancillary requirements designed to reduce reoffending, including unpaid work and rehabilitation activity requirements. This aligns with the current policy emphasis on restorative justice and the integration of behavioural change components. This system currently operates under ongoing fiscal and capacity-related pressures. The Windsor Probation Service, for instance, reports staff shortages exceeding 20%, constraining its ability to deliver comprehensive programmes, particularly those addressing acquisitive offending pathways. The knock-on effects inevitably influence the availability and quality of interventions accessible to individuals like yourself. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. Consideration of public protection also necessitates reference to the wider social and institutional context. The prevalence of shoplifting offences in recent years has soared in many urban centres, correlating with economic headwinds wrought by inflationary pressures, housing insecurity, and evolving substance misuse patterns. While these macro-factors cannot excuse unlawful behaviour, they frame the challenges of achieving sustainable rehabilitation and risk management. It is pertinent here to reflect upon the statutory and case law framework surrounding the management of offenders with complex needs. The Court of Appeal in R v Marsh [2021] EWCA Crim 1790 elaborated on the interplay between custodial sentences and the availability of suitable rehabilitative provisions, emphasising the duty of courts to weigh the realistic capacity of existing services to meet defendants’ needs against the imperatives of deterrence and denunciation. Your case raises those doctrinal questions in sharper relief: it is a test of the balance between legal sanction and social care, between community protection and offender welfare. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. Notably, the court has had opportunity to review correspondence from the Windsor Homelessness Support Alliance, dated July 2025, outlining your intermittent accommodation difficulties and the persistent barriers to stable housing. Such instability is acknowledged a significant factor in your offending pattern, albeit one which, unmitigated, fuels recurrence. These services express willingness to provide ongoing assistance post-sentence, conditional upon engagement with judicially mandated conditions. The court also received a detailed victim personal statement from Mr Jonathan Weir, manager of the High Street Pharmacy, who described the impact of your thefts as “disheartening and disruptive,” highlighting the consequential loss of business revenue and the necessity to implement increased security measures. The Statement encapsulates the real-world ramifications of acquisitive crime for small business proprietors and their employees. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. An additional operational complexity arises from co-defendant conduct, although this matter is not before the court at present. It is noted that a co-defendant involved in some related offences failed to appear for trial and remains at large, as recorded in police operational logs dated 2 March 2025. While such information is extraneous to your sentencing, it provides a reminder of the multi-faceted nature of retail crime networks, which this court treats with utmost seriousness. Further, prior charges faced by a third-party relative on an unrelated benefit fraud are documented in the background reports. These, however, have no bearing on your culpability or risk profile herein, though their inclusion in administrative files occasionally gives rise to confusion in disclosure protocols. In support of you, the defence has furnished character references from long-term acquaintances, including a letter from the Windsor Soup Kitchen coordinator which attests to your participation in community volunteering events over the past year. While such positive community involvement is welcomed, the court cautions against conflating peripheral activities with a comprehensive commitment to lawful conduct. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. The court recognises candour in your plea and the mitigating influence of genuine personal difficulties, including health, housing, and employment instability. However, the persistence of offending and prior warnings weigh heavily against leniency. In light of the aggregate evidence and your risk profile, this court is inclined to consider a blended sentence combining custodial and community elements. While the precise order must await receipt of an updated pre-sentence report from probation, the assessment will be directed towards feasibility of participation in a Community Behavioural Programme, complemented by mandatory unpaid work and strict compliance monitoring. Probation is further requested to explore integration with local social services to address the underlying factors contributing to your conduct, including housing support and emotional wellbeing. The court reiterates its thanks to all professionals engaged in the compilation of the case materials, including Ms Gabrielle Trench of the CPS for her clear and measured prosecution submissions, and to Mr Benjamin Callow for his conscientious representation, notwithstanding the logistical difficulties encountered. The hearing has been conducted in open court. It is regrettable though unsurprising that such matters rarely attract media attention or wider public discourse. While the judge appreciates that offences like shoplifting might be viewed as minor by some, the sustained cost to communities, businesses, and victims is tangible and significant. Society expects courts to respond proportionately — not disproportionately — and to strike a fair balance between compassion and accountability. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Windsor. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed according to the provisions of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal sentencing hearing is scheduled for 9 September 2025, upon receipt of the probation report and any further representations.
