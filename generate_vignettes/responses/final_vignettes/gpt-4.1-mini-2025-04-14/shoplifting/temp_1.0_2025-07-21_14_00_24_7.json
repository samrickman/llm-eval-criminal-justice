MR H Case No. T2026/04329 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. J. FAIRBRIDGE Filed: 14 September 2026 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction for a series of offences involving theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct in question was committed over a protracted period spanning from late 2023 into early 2026, affecting a variety of stores situated primarily within the Blackwell and Greater Ashford retail districts. Procedural and Investigative History Your arrest on 11 March 2026 was the culmination of an extensive and resource-intense investigative process orchestrated by the Blackwell Metropolitan Police Retail Crime Unit in tandem with the South Ashford Urban Taskforce. This cooperation incorporated intelligence-sharing with the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), designed precisely to curb repeat acquisitive offending. The investigative operation, which included covert surveillance, the analysis of store security networks, and a painstaking review of commercial loss reports, followed several months of reports detailing persistent theft at multiple premises—primarily convenience stores and pharmacies in the vicinity of transport interchanges and suburban shopping centres. There is often, regrettably, a disconnect between the actual resource expenditure devoted to such cases and the perceived gravity of the offences. What may appear to an outsider as a series of trivial infractions can mask a coordinated pattern that exerts a profound cumulative impact on local businesses and their employees, as well as draining public resources through protracted investigatory efforts. Resource allocation for investigations of this nature must be acknowledged to include not only police officers but also civilian crime analysts, digital forensic specialists, and case officers, engaged over months in securing evidentiary clarification and corroboration. These endeavours naturally carry a significant fiscal cost, diverting attention from other policing priorities which often include violent crime, organised substance supply, and community safeguarding duties. The case advanced through the stages of the criminal justice system meeting the stipulated timeframes outlined in the Criminal Procedure Rules, although not without some delay. A plea and trial preparation hearing was initially listed for 18 May 2026 but was deferred due to the necessity of obtaining a psychiatric report and the securing of Legal Aid funding for an independent assessment. The procedural complexity of cases involving multi-agency collaboration, as well as the involvement of voluntary-sector organisations providing support to both victims and perpetrators, cannot be overstated. While this court is aware of and sympathetic toward those logistical pressures, it is nonetheless imperative that all parties comply with the statutory frameworks governing the administration of justice. It has become an unfortunate, yet increasingly routine, feature in cases of acquisitive offending that guilty pleas are not entered at the earliest opportunity. This court acknowledges the principle that credit should be afforded where pleas are tendered promptly, thereby sparing victims and witnesses from the stress attendant upon contested proceedings. However, where pleas are entered at a late juncture—often mere days before trial—the extent of credit granted is judiciously reduced to reflect the additional burden borne by the court and prosecution, consistent with guidance established in R v. Booth [2024] EWCA Crim 159 and R v. Bernal [2025] EWCA Crim 18. The Crown's case was fortified by a comprehensive evidential package, including digital footage, witness testimony, and forensic analysis, which it is conceded made prolonged denial untenable. It should be noted with respect the thorough and conscientious submissions made on your behalf by counsel, Mr Oliver Stretton, and also the diligent representation by Miss Amelia Fairlake on behalf of the Crown. Their efforts ensured the orderly progression of this matter, and their professionalism is commendable. Equally, I acknowledge the efforts of the Blackwell Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose collective action yielded detailed victim impact statements that articulate the psychological and economic consequences of your offending on local shopkeepers and employees. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. The nature of your offending, whilst not involving physical violence, is nonetheless of considerable seriousness given its repetitive character and the distress caused to staff. Shops affected reported significant financial losses as well as a decline in employee morale, leading to staffing adjustments such as altered shift patterns and the installation of security reinforcements. This dynamic is far from inconsequential; indeed, it undermines the very fabric of community retail operations and poses a broader threat to public confidence in commercial safety. This court is attuned to the widespread perception that shoplifting constitutes a “low-level” crime often overlooked in the hierarchy of enforcement priorities. But such an appraisal is fallacious. The cumulative effect of repeated incursions upon retailers—particularly small businesses operating on narrow profit margins—can precipitate closures, job losses, and, in turn, contribute to the economic blight of neighbourhoods. In the absence of robust and proportionate judicial responses, the message sent is one of permissiveness, which in turn may precipitate a further descent into disorder and lawlessness. In R v. Bevan [2019] EWCA Crim 2743, the Court of Appeal made plain that offences of acquisitive dishonesty, while often non-violent, are not devoid of impact; the emotional toll on victims, coupled with financial harm, justifies stern judicial reaction. In that case, a defendant who perpetrated a sustained campaign of retail theft over eighteen months, causing significant distress among elderly shop staff, was sentenced to twelve months’ imprisonment. The sentiment expressed therein remains apposite. The relevance of sustained acquisitive criminality to the preservation of public order is also underscored in R v. Coulson [2022] EWCA Crim 333, where the court clarified the distinct sentencing considerations involved when conduct is repetitive, deliberate, and indicative of a disregard for community norms. The persistent flouting of laws designed to safeguard property rights is reflective of a disquieting erosion of civic standards, an observation echoed frequently in sentencing literature. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. Your case management hearings unfolded against a background of significant administrative pressures, including intermittent strike action within local court administration and well-documented shortages in Legal Aid funding allocation. The delays occasioned thereby extend beyond the inconvenience of the affected parties and impede the expeditious dispensation of justice—a matter to which this court returns with some reluctance. The Legal Aid Agency, while under fiscal constraints, must not be allowed to create impediments to specialist expert engagement, particularly in cases where psychological assessment informs both sentence and rehabilitation potential. The request here for a forensic psychologist with expertise in acquisitive offending was met with protracted bureaucratic negotiation, which compounded procedural delay. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. The broader systemic context cannot be ignored. Local law enforcement agencies grapple with near-constant demands on capacity by an increasing caseload of “low-harm” offences which nonetheless generate significant community dissatisfaction and resource commitments. The strain on specialist units tasked with retail crime prevention and investigation is considerable. Concurrently, voluntary-sector organisations that aid in victim support and offender rehabilitation operate under chronic funding deficits and staffing shortages. The South Ashford Charity Alliance recently issued a report highlighting the alarming rise in retail-related antisocial behaviour and the attendant psychological impact on shop workers, many of whom report anxiety and burnout. Of course, the interplay between public services and judicial proceedings is complex. NHS mental health provision, for example, remains challenged by long waiting lists and overstretched community psychiatric teams. This court notes the submission of Dr Anne-Marie Cole, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose detailed report—although not ultimately pivotal—highlighted your tendencies toward impulsivity and low mood, while also drawing attention to the absence of any diagnosable psychotic or personality disorder. The report rightly stresses the importance of multi-agency cooperation in supporting rehabilitation and reducing recidivism. Turning to the difficulties encountered in securing appropriate accommodation, it is no secret that the widening gap in housing availability, exacerbated by economic pressures and the erosion of affordable units, has intensified the challenges faced by vulnerable populations. Organisations such as the ShelterTrust and the Blackwell Emergency Housing Support have endeavoured to mitigate these pressures, yet the scale of the problem remains vast. Your stated unstable living arrangements are, while unfortunate, not unique in this context. Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. In considering the social fabric in which this offending occurred, one cannot overlook the well-documented ascent of street homelessness and rough sleeping in urban centres, with attendant concerns regarding drug dependency and exploitation. These challenges feed into a broader pattern of social exclusion that forms part of the mosaic in which many acquisitive crimes arise. Nonetheless, the judiciary must balance understanding with accountability; hardship is no less real for its ubiquity, yet neither does it constitute licence to disregard the law. The trial itself proceeded with the normal rigour of this court. Witnesses gave evidence with professionalism and considerable composure, reflecting the importance they attached to the case. The victim impact statements submitted by the managers of Croft’s Convenience Store and Wellside Pharmacy particularly conveyed the intangible but pervasive harm inflicted not only on business viability but on the everyday psychological welfare of staff who faced repeated intrusion, suspicion, and the threat of confrontation. You were represented by Mr Oliver Stretton throughout. His submissions, carefully considered and respectful of the court, emphasised your personal circumstances including your expressed remorse and attempts at engagement with outreach services. It is noted that you have participated intermittently in financial literacy workshops run by local charities and have attended support groups aimed at reducing impulsive behaviour, albeit inconsistently. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. While there is merit in recognising personal circumstance, the court must weigh these against the nature and pattern of offending, the impact on victims, and the broader imperatives of deterrence and public protection. In R v. Phillips [2023] EWCA Crim 1585, the Court upheld a significant custodial sentence for repeated shoplifting where the defendant had declined structured rehabilitation despite offers, emphasising that repeated acquisitive offending presents a significant risk of further harm if left inadequately addressed. Attention must be paid, too, to the ongoing concerns surrounding the administration and capacity of the probation services. Staffing shortages have increased caseloads and often limit the delivery of bespoke interventions, such as programme work aimed at reducing reoffending linked to acquisitive crime. The local probation office informed this court via correspondence dated 29 August 2026 that while efforts are made to engage offenders in Thinking Skills Programmes and similar rehabilitative initiatives, these are frequently hampered by resource limitations and the transience of the offender population. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. Further complicating the picture is the expanding scope of multi-agency risk assessment and management. While procedures such as MARAC (Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference) and MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements) primarily focus on high-risk offenders, there is increasing recognition of the necessity for coordinated approaches in cases of persistent acquisitive offending, particularly when co-occurring vulnerabilities such as mental health issues or substance use are identified. However, implementation of such frameworks varies significantly by locality, affected in equal measure by funding constraints and inter-agency communication challenges. Council housing allocations in your area have been affected by recent legislative reforms impacting tenant eligibility criteria, often delaying access to stable accommodation for those with custodial sentences or on probation. That said, the court is duty-bound to observe that residence instability itself is a well-known risk factor for repeat offending. Courts must be alert to this interplay and ensure that sentencing in individual cases does not inadvertently exacerbate instability or marginalisation without concurrent support. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. In assessing your criminal history, it is apparent that you have prior convictions for shoplifting, dating back some six years, with the most recent occurring in 2023. These convictions include community orders with requirements to attend rehabilitation activities and abstain from certain locations. Despite these measures, you returned to similar offending within months, undermining their rehabilitative effect. This pattern raises serious questions about the adequacy of previous interventions and your prospects of compliance absent more structured engagement or, indeed, custodial oversight. The principle of totality must be borne in mind: sentences should be just and proportionate overall, taking account of all offending behaviour involved. Although the instant offences concern low individual values, the persistent course of conduct aggravates culpability. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. I take note of several letters submitted in support by third parties, including one from your sister, Ms Janelle Harding, who describes a background of familial instability and some periods of homelessness in early adulthood. While such correspondence is relevant to understanding personal context and capacity for reform, it does not mitigate the seriousness of the offending. It is appropriate also to observe that there are ongoing proceedings concerning your estranged partner, unrelated to this matter but indicative of family turmoil which, while not legally connected, may bear upon your broader social circumstances. Likewise, the fact that a co-defendant in a separate theft case has absconded and remains at large, known to police, does not influence your individual culpability. The court is conscious that the psychological and social difficulties that many defendants face are real and profound. Yet it cannot abdicate its fundamental responsibility to uphold the rule of law and safeguard the public from repeated criminal conduct. The sentencing framework applicable to theft offences, as outlined in the guideline issued by the Sentencing Council in 2020, directs that particular attention be paid to frequency, planning, and impact on victims. These factors are all plainly engaged. In light of these considerations, the court anticipates the preparation of a pre-sentence report, which should comprehensively assess your circumstances, explore the scope for community-based interventions, and evaluate rehabilitation potential consistent with public protection. The report should consider the feasibility of imposing a structured community order incorporating accredited programmes such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy focusing on acquisitive crime, financial management support, and victim awareness. Should such an approach prove unsuitable or unavailable, the court may have to contemplate custodial options. These sentencing remarks are given this day, 14 September 2026, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Blackwell.
