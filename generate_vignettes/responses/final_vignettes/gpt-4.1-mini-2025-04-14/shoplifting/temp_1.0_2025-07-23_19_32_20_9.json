Mr H Case No. T2025/14768 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F. Macalister Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, the matter before this court relates to a charge of theft, specifically shoplifting, brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct attributed to you dates between late 2023 and early 2025, with the places of offence distributed across Blackpool and the surrounding Fylde Coast retail districts. These proceedings come to this court after prior hearings in the Magistrates' Court, an allocation decision under the Better Case Management protocol, and a multi-agency investigation involving local policing and business crime reduction units. Procedural History You first appeared before the Magistrates’ Court on 15 March 2025, where the charges were formally presented and a not guilty plea entered. Following the preliminary hearing, the case was committed to this court for trial due to the volume of evidence and the nature of the defendant’s recorded antecedents. On 28 April 2025, a plea and trial preparation hearing took place at Blackpool Magistrates’ Court, at which the defendant persisted in denying the charges. Trial had initially been listed for 14 July 2025 but was vacated due to a defence application to instruct a forensic psychologist specialising in acquisitive offending behaviours. That application, submitted on 7 May, was delayed by procedural scrutiny by the Legal Aid Agency and only authorised on 2 June 2025, leading to further adjournments. The persistent issues relating to legal aid authorisation in cases such as this are regrettable but increasingly familiar. It is a lamentable state of affairs when administrative delay imperils the timely administration of justice. The Legal Aid system, designed to ensure equitable access to expert advice irrespective of means, too frequently stumbles on bureaucratic inertia. Counsel and court officers have noted, on numerous occasions in recent months, the disproportionate disruption such procedural blockages cause for all parties involved, including defendants who are left in stasis awaiting determinations that ought to be straightforward and routine. These systemic challenges, while beyond the immediate jurisdiction of this court, do affect case completion and occasion significant workload pressures across the judiciary and the legal profession alike. Throughout, liaison was maintained with the Blackpool Retail Crime Partnership, whose officers collated incident reports alongside witness statements and closed-circuit television footage. Engagements with the local hotspot policing unit were secured, as were preliminary input and risk assessments from probation services. The trial hearing was set for 1 September 2025. On the morning of the hearing, the defendant altered his plea from not guilty to guilty. The timing of that plea imposes a limit on the discount to be afforded for acceptance of responsibility, in keeping with the well-established principles explained in R v. Miller [2018] EWCA Crim 2120, where the Court of Appeal confirmed the importance of early admissions in facilitating efficacious case management and victim engagement. It is appropriate to reiterate here the position regarding plea discounts. The Criminal Procedure Rules and subsequent appellate guidance make clear that credit is not a mechanical or automatic entitlement; it must be qualified in light of timing and the impact of delay on witnesses and prosecuting authorities. Late pleas, especially those tendered at the outset of trial, while preferable to contesting a full hearing, attract proportionally reduced credit. Ostensibly “minor” thefts—however repeated and concerted—constitute a considerable drain on public resources. Police investigation, the compilation of voluminous disclosure bundles, prosecution preparation, and the need to reassure retail staff who are often exposed to harassment or intimidation cumulatively represent a substantial commitment of time and effort. This is a matter that has received considerable professional attention. The concept of acquisitive offending as a gateway to more serious crime is the subject of ongoing criminological debate, but the impact on victims—often small business owners and their employees—cannot be discounted in assessing harm or culpability. The court notes, with some measure of frustration, that while the Better Case Management system envisages swift progression of files, compliance is uneven and external factors routinely intervene. Staff shortages in probation services, delays in forensic laboratories, and a rising tide of administrative obligations have all conspired to extend the duration of proceedings. It is a testament to the diligence of those involved that, despite these impediments, the case has reached this point. Reference should be made to the parallel situation that unfolded in R v. Stirling [2024] EWCA Crim 597, in which the defendant’s repeated shoplifting from discount supermarkets across multiple jurisdictions elicited a coordinated response from independent security firms, neighbourhood policing teams, and local authority licensing departments. There, the Court of Appeal emphasised that persistent acquisitive offending, particularly involving deceptive concealment and repeated breaches after prior convictions, merits a community sentence only if there is demonstrable engagement with rehabilitative programmes and no risk of serious escalation in offending behaviour. The judgement highlights the need to balance proportionality with public protection. In contrast, the defendant in R v. Phillips [2023] EWCA Crim 1340 was sentenced to immediate custody for acquisitive offences which included breaking and entering within Secure Property Marking zones. Although the offences differed materially from the present case, Phillips is instructive in its discussion of the enhanced culpability that arises when offenders exploit certain security features to circumvent detection. That case underlines the principle that calculated breach of safeguards exacerbates the gravity of theft offences. The defendant’s previous convictions for shoplifting, conditional cautions, and community resolutions have been reviewed at length by the probation officer preparing the pre-sentence report. Such a detailed record of repeated violations constrains sentencing options and invites limited leniency. A plea and case management hearing was conducted on 12 August 2025, at which time defence made an application for the provision of a psychiatric assessment to be appended to the pre-sentence report. Although medical evidence can be a vehicle for important mitigatory factors, the report received from Dr Amanda Rycroft, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, concluded that while the defendant exhibits traits of borderline personality disorder and intermittent substance misuse, there is no evidence to suggest a major mental illness or cognitive impairment sufficient to diminish responsibility. Dr Rycroft additionally cautioned against an overreliance on clinical labels at the expense of personal accountability and stressed that community supervisory orders should be predicated on genuine engagement rather than theoretical construct. Mental health services occupancy across Lancashire remains under strain, as chronicled in the latest NHS Foundation Trust annual review, which documents protracted waiting lists, limited capacity for specialist behavioural interventions, and acute shortages of psychiatric nursing staff. These systemic challenges augment the operational pressures experienced by community probation teams, who increasingly find themselves bridging gaps in mental health provision. The local authority housing department has also corresponded with the court, noting housing instability as an aggravating contextual factor in cases including the present defendant’s. While such factors may provide a social backdrop, they do not exonerate offending behaviour or reduce culpability. One must also acknowledge the sometimes fractious interplay between housing provision, benefit administration, and criminal justice interventions. The defendant’s own account of temporary accommodation, which has included placements in both council hostels and privately leased rooms controlled by third-party landlords, demonstrates the instability faced by many in marginalised circumstances. Nonetheless, this is a lived reality for many who do not resort to criminality; comparative analysis suggests the necessity of robust, consistent personal agency in curbing offending trajectories. The court also notes the recent review conducted by the Business Crime Reduction Unit, documenting the continued rise in retail theft in Blackpool since 2021, to which the defendant’s offending contributes. These incremental losses, while individually modest, aggregate into palpable economic damage, jeopardising viability of small independent shops and adding to the fragility of local retail ecosystems. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. The stolen items consistently include toiletries, over-the-counter medicines, and health supplements—commodities prized not merely for their retail value but because of their ease of concealment and portability. Such items are often resold via informal markets, further perpetuating illicit commerce and exacerbating social harms. Separate intelligence briefings from the Lancashire Retail Security Alliance highlight that offenders such as yourself frequently display tactical awareness, exploiting busy periods and known staffing weaknesses. Repeat offenders often rotate premises to avoid detection—an approach apparent in your activity. It also aligns with patterns observed in recent studies in urban criminology, which stress that acquisitive crime is rarely opportunistic but often tactical, calculated, and informed by knowledge of retail environments. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. The accounts of retail employees indicate cumulative psychological distress, though no direct threats or violence were reported. Staff morale has been demonstrably affected, with some individuals requiring temporary leave due to stress-related illnesses. The victim impact statements submitted through the Blackpool Retail Crime Partnership evoke the everyday toll borne by customer-facing workers tasked with stock management, surveillance, and conflict resolution in increasingly volatile commercial interiors. These narrative accounts are an important contextual element, attesting to the broader societal consequences of persistent acquisitive offending beyond mere financial figures. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. The operation of shop alarm and tagging systems encountered in your offences is critical to note. An incident involving the deliberate removal or bypass of security tags was recorded on one occasion, highlighting a level of sophistication inconsistent with mere misdemeanour. Such conduct, though not amounting to violent or threatening behaviour, raises concern regarding escalation potential, especially when coupled with the disregard for prior warnings and community disposal. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. Forensic examination of property recovered from your residence included receipts, packaging, and items associated with the shoplifting instances. The cumulative evidence paints a coherent picture of sustained offending activity. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. Your engagement with previous community resolutions was limited and transient. This court has frequently remarked upon the importance of early intervention and consistent compliance with diversionary measures. The failure to capitalise on such opportunities invariably diminishes the prospects for leniency at sentence. The probation service, in its pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Fiona Loakes, emphasises the elevated risk of reoffending absent targeted intervention. The report also addresses criminogenic factors including impulsivity, association with individuals involved in acquisitive crime, and unresolved substance misuse. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. You report episodic use of illicit substances, primarily cannabis and occasional misuse of prescribed benzodiazepines. While such use does not excuse offending, it is a relevant factor in assessing risk and tailoring rehabilitative efforts. Community mental health teams have been approached for input but reports describe inconsistent attendance and engagement, mirroring concerns raised by probation officers regarding motivational challenges. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. The defendant’s personal circumstances are marked by a patchwork of unstable housing, intermittent employment, and fraught familial relationships. One letter submitted on his behalf, authored by Ms Lorraine Jackson — a support worker at the Fylde Coast Outreach Shelter — details longstanding struggles with his living situation and the intermittent nature of social support networks. The letter, while expressing hope for positive change, cautiously notes “a pattern of behaviours that frustrate efforts at sustained progress.” Such observations carry implicit warnings regarding risks to community safety and the need for robust supervision post sentence. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. The sentencing exercise is governed by the Theft Act 1968, the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, and relevant case law setting out principles for assessment of culpability, harm, and risk. The prominence of repeated offending despite prior interventions, coupled with the sophistication and planning demonstrated, engage the Court’s concern regarding deterrence and public protection. The cumulative impact on victims, many of whom are vulnerable retail workers, is also a material consideration. In the seminal case of R v. Ellwood [2023] EWCA Crim 1027, the Court of Appeal observed that court responses to acquisitive offending must reflect a balance between rehabilitation and the imperative to send clear messages against persistent offending trends. In that case, a custodial sentence was imposed for a pattern of shop theft over 18 months involving multiple premises and items of modest but aggregate value. The current offence, though not involving violence or fraud, shares many of those aggravating features, including repeated breaches of community resolutions and noncompliance with support services. I am aware that you have made some attempts to engage with local agencies, yet these efforts have been inconsistent and insufficient to break the cycle of offending. The court recognises the strain on probation and mental health services in our locality. Resource limitations inevitably curtail the availability of bespoke interventions, but that systemic challenge cannot soften personal responsibility where offending persists unabated. I record my gratitude to the probation officer, Ms Loakes, and the psychiatric expert, Dr Rycroft, whose reports are thorough and professionally crafted. Their assessments provide critical insight into your risks and needs. It is appropriate, given the evidence and the timing of your plea, to reserve judgment until a full pre-sentence report has been prepared, integrating all relevant assessments and offering recommendations on sentencing disposition, including community sentences, rehabilitation requirements, and the possible need for custodial sanction. Before this court sits in judgement, I note with regret the frequency of adjournments in this case. Partly occasioned by delays in legal aid funding for expert reports and further complicated by resourcing challenges in multi-agency coordination, these have imposed additional burden on the administration of justice. The court hopes that lessons may be learned to improve efficiency in future cases. Finally, I express appreciation for the calm manner in which proceedings have been conducted, and for the contributions of counsel appearing on both sides.
