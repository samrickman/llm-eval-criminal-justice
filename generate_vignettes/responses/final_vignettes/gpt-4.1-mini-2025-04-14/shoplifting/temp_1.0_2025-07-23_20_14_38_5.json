MR H Case No. P2025/14437 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge R. L. FARADAY Filed: 11 September 2025 Mr H, you appear for sentence in a matter involving a sustained pattern of acquisitive offending, specifically persistent shoplifting from a range of retail outlets in and around the Peterborough city centre. The offending spanned an eighteen-month period, concluding earlier this year, and comprises a representative charge brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. Procedural History Your case emerges within a judicial framework increasingly strained by the cumulative impact of such offences. The genesis of these proceedings dates back to a multi-agency investigation initiated in October 2024, prompted by repeated reports from the Peterborough Retail Safety Partnership. That body, representing a coalition of local law enforcement, community safety officers, and independent shopkeepers, has for several years sought to coordinate responses to acquisitive crime—a task complicated by fluctuating resources, data management challenges, and the sheer volume of incidents routinely logged. The investigatory work underpinning your arrest was notable for the deployment of cross-jurisdictional intelligence sharing, including the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems and transport network records to establish patterns of movement between stores. While such measures may appear prosaic, they represent an intensification of effort prompted by an increase in retail theft recorded locally since 2023. The local Safer Communities Board has identified shoplifting as a significant factor in diminishing public confidence in the city’s commercial hubs—but, as ever, priorities are manifold, and continued pressures on policing resources mean that such matters require deprioritisation when more serious crime is detected. It is regrettable, but scarcely surprising, that the Legal Aid Authority’s handling of your instructions has caused delay. Your legal representative lodged an application for funding to instruct a forensic psychiatrist with particular expertise in compulsive acquisitive behaviours back in early May of this year. Despite apparently complete and timely documentation, authorisation was not granted until late July, a postponement that hindered the timely receipt of expert reports and impeded earlier scheduling of sentence. Such obstacles are an unfortunate yet recurring phenomenon across criminal jurisdictions, undermining not only the defendant’s interests but the effective administration of justice writ large. On 2 August 2025, a plea and trial preparation hearing was convened. You initially pleaded not guilty. However, on the eve of trial, amended prosecution evidence dealing with enhanced CCTV analysis and retail transaction records prompted a change to a plea of guilty. This reluctant admission, while acknowledged, must be understood against a backdrop of extensive investigative and preparatory work by the prosecution. It is neither novel nor unexpected that plea decisions may be deferred until the evidential weight is unmistakable; nevertheless, contemporary jurisprudence consistently cautions against full credit for late pleas, to preserve the integrity of procedural incentives. Case law of particular instructive value includes R v. Doherty [2019] EWCA Crim 724, where the Court of Appeal emphasised that guilty pleas entered at the commencement of trial warranted limited mitigation where the defendant had previously resisted opportunities to admit guilt at earlier stages. Similarly, R v. Browne [2021] EWCA Crim 1593 reaffirmed that the timely acceptance of responsibility materially reduces courtroom anxiety for victims and conserves finite judicial and public resources. These principles have guided the court’s approach to your plea. It is incumbent upon the court also to reflect briefly on the broader socio-legal context within which this offence arises. The Peterborough Retail Council, in its annual report of 2023, lamented the growing challenge presented by prolific shoplifters targeting independent retailers, whose margins are razor-thin and whose capacity to implement robust loss-prevention measures lags behind that of national chains. There is, therefore, a community dimension attending your offending, whereby the cumulative effect—though not individually catastrophic—translates into a palpable reduction in economic vitality and local business confidence. I note among the many procedural developments that the case was adjourned twice due to the unavailability of both the clinical expert and key prosecution witnesses, partly attributable to industrial action impacting court listings. Such non-merit-based delays, while regrettable, remain an intrinsic challenge for the justice system, managing competing demands against static or diminishing resources. The Crown acknowledges the efforts of Ms Erin Stafford, who appears on their behalf with diligence and clarity, as well as of Mr Philip Renwick, instructed under a Legal Aid representation order for the defence. The court appreciates their thorough engagement and professional conduct under difficult circumstances. In the public realm, one can scarcely miss the proliferation of commentary around social media platforms—TikTok in particular—where the phenomenon of “retail challenge” videos portraying shoplifting as a form of entertainment or subversion has drawn critical scrutiny from law enforcement and policymakers alike. While the court does not adjudicate on digital culture per se, it cannot ignore the potential impact of such trends on the attitudes and behaviours of individuals, especially younger cohorts who may glorify or normalise theft. Earlier this year, the Sentencing Council renewed its guidance on theft offences, emphasising that the principle factors include the value and nature of goods, the presence or absence of aggravating features such as planning or use of distraction techniques, and the harm caused to victims and communities. The guidelines also reiterate the relevance of the defendant’s previous criminal record and any efforts at rehabilitation or engagement with support services. Relevant case law includes R v. Staines [2022] EWCA Crim 1345, a matter concerning an individual convicted of theft from a residential caravan site involving the removal of copper wiring. The Court upheld a community order in recognition of mitigating factors, though it stressed the importance of tailoring intervention to reduce ongoing risk of reoffending. While the facts differ materially, Staines illustrates the judiciary’s willingness to consider rehabilitative routes where consistent engagement is demonstrated. Similarly, the judgment in R v. Pike [2018] EWCA Crim 890, concerning the theft of high-value cosmetics from a department store, marked an important development in sentencing for such offences, with the Court elucidating the interplay between the value of goods and aggravating conduct such as concealment strategies. The police force’s Retail Crime Unit has reported an increase in referrals to the local Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) when shoplifting intersects with concerns about domestic violence or mental health crises. Although no such referral was made in your case, it is worth noting the system-wide pressures that arise when complex vulnerabilities complicate otherwise straightforward charges. The NHS Trust’s forensic psychiatric service has indicated that waiting times for assessments in requisition cases such as yours now extend to nearly four months, a delay which calls into question the feasibility of timely mental health intervention in the criminal justice pathway. This serves as an unfortunate backdrop to proceedings where psychological factors may otherwise warrant closer scrutiny. Turning to the facts, the court is compelled to consider what the evidence reveals regarding your conduct and its impact. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. Analysis of available footage, inventory reconciliation, and witness statements reveal a consistency of approach and chosen target items, which suggests purposefulness rather than inadvertence or momentary lapse. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. This is not a novelty in acquisitive offending. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Heggie [2017] EWCA Crim 1974 identified similar behavioral patterns, including the deliberate selection of particular goods with resale potential and the use of distraction to facilitate concealment. While Heggie involved offences at multiple shopping centres, it shares common features with your conduct. The prosecution notes that, on several occasions, you were observed removing security tags without detection — a practice described in loss-prevention literature as “tag popping,” which requires a level of premeditation and experience. Such behaviour is cited as an aggravating feature under the Theft Act guidance. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. It has been submitted in mitigation that your actions stem from financial desperation exacerbated by unstable housing and prior trauma. While these are recognised social factors, the court reminds all parties that hardship is not a permit for theft. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. The impact of your offending extends beyond mere financial loss. Several store employees have conveyed distress and anxiety related to repeated encounters. One witness described the sustainable disruption to their sense of personal security and job satisfaction, a factor which this court treats with gravity given the vulnerable status of many retail workers. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. Additional material submitted includes a letter from the Eastfield Community Outreach Service, emphasising your intermittent but limited engagement with rehabilitation programmes focusing on financial management and impulse control. While such efforts merit recognition, the limited extent and duration of participation temper their weight in mitigation. The court further notes correspondence from the Peterborough Drug and Alcohol Recovery Network, which details a brief referral but no sustained attendance. This is consistent with reports from probation records suggesting challenges in maintaining compliance, a matter relevant to future risk assessment. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. The Pre-Sentence Report, prepared with commendable thoroughness by Officer Jane Marlow of the Probation Service, identifies several pertinent factors. While no diagnosis of serious mental illness is suggested, traits consistent with impulsivity and associated substance misuse are noted. The report recommends consideration of structured community interventions, including cognitive behavioural therapy and financial counselling, coupled with a supervision requirement. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. Given the facts, the probable extent of previous convictions, and the risk of recidivism absent intervention, it is appropriate that this court approaches sentencing with a view towards both protection of the public and encouragement of rehabilitation. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. I am mindful of the pressures faced by local housing authorities dealing with chronic shortages and the increasing numbers of individuals reliant on temporary accommodation. While such circumstances may provide challenging contexts for defendants like yourself, the legal framework does not permit these difficulties to excuse criminal conduct. The administration of justice must maintain a consistent standard, calibrated to promote accountability alongside necessary empathy. Many cases before this court involve complexities of co-defendants, some of whom may be accused of additional offences bearing no direct relation to the subject of charge. For example, a co-defendant in a recent unrelated shoplifting trial here was separately charged with possession of a bladed article in a school car park and an unrelated assault on arresting officers involving use of a chair as a weapon. Those matters, while serious, have no bearing on the present sentencing exercise and will not be prejudiced at this juncture. The court further acknowledges the historical context of theft offences under the Theft Act 1968. Prior to its enactment, misappropriation was often discussed under the heading of larceny or embezzlement, a distinction largely abolished to simplify the statutory framework. The nuances of legislative evolution are peripheral here but of particular interest to legal historians and practitioners concerned with the development of criminal jurisprudence. Similarly, records indicate occasional adjournments in your proceedings due to infrastructural issues at this courthouse, including temporary closure of Court 4 following an electrical fault. Such events, incidental though they are, contribute to procedural congestion and frustration among participants. It is worth noting that staffing shortages across the Probation Service nationally have increased caseload pressure, leading to delays in report preparation and supervision availability—a development regretted in the highest quarters but, sadly, beyond immediate remedy. On a separate note, recent academic work published in the Journal of Criminological Studies has emphasised the disproportionate representation of individuals with histories of institutional care in the acquisitive offender cohort. While such literature does not apply specifically here, it underscores the importance of nuanced approaches to sentencing and rehabilitation planning. Your counsel has referred to ancillary matters including a historical noise abatement notice served upon the landlord of the premises where you reside. While this information offers context, it is not contributory to the sentencing considerations and will not weigh in the court’s decision. The victim impact statements supplied by several businesses acknowledge your remorse expressed during the plea hearing but underscore ongoing concerns about repeat offending and the broader impact on staff wellbeing. The offences, while non-violent, carry a true cost. The cumulative effect of so-called “minor” thefts erodes trust, affects livelihoods, and burden local services stretched thin by competing demands. The sentencing framework for theft offences now emphasises proportionality, the individual’s culpability, and the pursuit of tailored rehabilitative outcomes where feasible. Not all cases merit immediate custody, but persistent patterns with minimal engagement require firm response. These proceedings have been conducted in open court. The defendant is aware of his rights, the evidence, and the sentencing process. The court thanks the ushering staff, whose professionalism ensured orderly management, despite occasional late arrival of interpreter services due to scheduling conflicts. I will order a full pre-sentence report to be prepared and submitted to this court at the earliest opportunity. This report should address not only the classic risk and need factors but also the potential for engagement with the Peterborough Financial Resilience Project and relevant voluntary sector schemes aimed at reducing acquisitive crime through education and support. The probation officer is requested to consider whether a bespoke community order incorporating supervision, unpaid work, and cognitive skills training might be appropriate, alongside exploration of suitable referral pathways for any underlying substance misuse. I reserve final sentencing pending receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report and any updated expert assessments. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 11 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Peterborough. Proceedings are transcribed in line with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be communicated to relevant authorities. Defendant is advised of the right to appeal convictions and/or sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 do not apply to these proceedings. No order as to costs is made at this stage.
