MR H Case No. B2025/15893 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. A. Marlow Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence on a single indictment alleging theft from multiple retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This indictment represents a course of conduct that occurred over a period from late 2023 until mid-2025, primarily in the Bristol city centre and surrounding suburban shopping areas. While the indictment itself charges a representative count, it encapsulates a pattern of offending comprising repeated episodes of unlawful appropriation, which attract more serious consideration than one might accord a single isolated event. Procedural History You were initially brought before the magistrates’ court on 18 June 2025 following arrest. The arrest itself was the product of an extended multi-agency investigation involving the Avon and Somerset Constabulary’s Business Crime Unit, retailer loss prevention teams, and data analysts employed by the Bristol Retail Crime Partnership. The inquiry spanned approximately ten months, including over 300 hours of collected CCTV footage review. The investigation utilised cross-referencing of electronic transaction logs, staff statements, and mobile network data obtained under judicial warrant. The sustained nature of this inquiry, with joint taskings among specialised teams, reflects the seriousness with which repeated thefts are regarded by law enforcement, who face increasing pressure to clamp down on acquisitive crime impacting the city’s commercial districts. It is worth pausing to acknowledge that such investigations absorb significant resources - far from mere routine policing. The Avon and Somerset Constabulary, like many police services nationwide, grapples with resourcing shortfalls that impact frontline responsiveness to a wide array of crimes alongside these theft investigations. The commitment and patience of officers, analysts, and support staff in seeing this matter through demand appreciation. It also, regrettably, underscores how persistent yet ostensibly minor crimes can impose disproportionate burden on already stretched forces, pulling resources from demands of serious violent crime and community safeguarding. You were initially charged on 21 June 2025 with six counts of shop theft, which the Crown subsequently consolidated for trial. The matter transferred to this Crown Court on 5 July 2025 under the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative, a procedural protocol intended to achieve timely progress in cases of sufficient complexity or public interest. The locality has recently implemented enhanced BCM systems as recommended in the Criminal Justice Ministry’s 2023 review, aiming for improved court listing efficiency and more effective inter-agency communication. The presiding listing officer noted that, notwithstanding some logistical challenges due to concurrent industrial action by court staff, this case proceeded in accordance with the indicative timeline set out in the Criminal Procedure Rules. The court also notes correspondence from the Legal Aid Agency dated 19 August 2025, regarding the resourcing of expert reports requested by the defence. There were some initial delays in approval for instructing a forensic clinical psychologist, which occasioned a short adjournment on 28 August 2025. These procedural hurdles unfortunately echo a growing pattern of bureaucratic delays across criminal justice support services, a matter which has prompted debate among practitioners but has yet to find comprehensive resolution. The plea and case management hearing was held on 2 September 2025. At that hearing, you entered a plea of guilty. While this plea is welcome, the late nature serves to limit the credit permissible under current sentencing practice. The court is guided here by principles enshrined in leading authorities such as R v. Farley [2019] EWCA Crim 1234, which clarifies that pleas entered close to trial attract appreciably less mitigation than those tendered at the earliest opportunity. This approach reflects both the interests of witness welfare and effective court administration; the Crown and witnesses incur significant prejudice where pleas are delayed. In the context of acquisitive offending, it is important to recall the court’s duty to consider the cumulative impact of repeated thefts on victims and the wider community. While often characterised as “non-violent” or “minor,” the broader social cost—losses sustained by small businesses, increased insurance premiums, and the cascading effect on staff wellbeing—are far from trivial. That pattern was evident in several victims’ statements submitted herein. The prosecution is represented today by Ms Emilie Stone, who has conducted the Crown’s case with diligence throughout. Similarly, Mr Gregory Walsh appears for you under a defence Legal Aid certificate and is commended for his thorough advocacy, including obtaining expert assessments and supplementary character references. The court acknowledges the support provided by the Bristol Retail Crime Partnership, who submitted a detailed victim impact statement describing not only financial loss but the disruption to business continuity and employee morale occasioned by persistent shoplifting. The Retail Crime Partnership also notes ongoing staffing shortages and increased turnover in front-of-house roles, which they attribute partly to the stress arising from such repeated incidents of theft. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. This series of offences took place across a variety of retail premises, including one independent pharmacy and two convenience stores widely regarded as vital to the local neighbourhoods they serve. The modus operandi exhibited a degree of planning and sophistication beyond mere opportunistic pilfering, including the use of distraction methods and concealment in garments. CCTV footage demonstrated your repeated presence, often at times coinciding with shift changes or periods of lone staffing. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. Public order and safety in commercial spaces are often vulnerable to such breaches. The courts are cognisant that acquisitive crime has a corrosive impact upon the retail sector, leading some businesses to adopt costly preventative measures, including increased security staff, installation of physical barriers, and reduced opening hours. While these measures impose financial burdens, they are symptomatic of a broader sense of insecurity prevalent in many urban centres today. Of interest, though irrelevant to the present proceedings, the court records that a nearby shop suffered significant criminal damage in a separate incident last year. That matter involved a third party unrelated to you and resulted in a custodial sentence for criminal damage to a listed building (R v. Ashton [2024] EWCA Crim 1587). While the case highlights the interplay between various forms of offending within tightly knit communities, it has no bearing upon your culpability or risk profile. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. The facts disclose a persistent pattern of thefts perpetrated across a six-month span, with some instances involving the removal of security tags or the use of items to obscure surveillance. Staff declarations indicate that some employees were left fearful of repeat encounters, leading to increased absenteeism and changes in shift patterns. The court has received a comprehensive psychiatric report prepared by Dr Helen Forsyth, a consultant forensic psychologist instructed by the defence. Dr Forsyth’s evaluation, conducted through a combination of clinical interview and psychometric testing, indicates that you exhibit traits consistent with chronic impulsivity and mild depressive symptoms. There is, however, no evidence of severe mental illness or cognitive impairment that would diminish responsibility. Importantly, Dr Forsyth emphasises your lack of engagement with available community resources and support, noting that you have declined offers of referral to addiction services or financial counselling, despite documented material hardship. These observations align with the probation pre-sentence report, which depicts a medium-risk profile for further acquisitive offending but no significant risk of harm to others. Dr Forsyth’s report also elaborates on the potential benefits of targeted offender rehabilitation programmes, including cognitive-behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing. Such interventions, she suggests, could assist you in managing impulsive tendencies and redirecting financial pressures into lawful conduct. The court welcomes these recommendations, which will be considered in the sentencing process. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. Your personal circumstances bear some relevance. You are 34 years old, currently unemployed, and living alone in privately rented accommodation. The pre-sentence report records a history of unstable housing, with prior intermittent stays in temporary supported lodging. While not directly related to the offending behaviours, such instability often exacerbates vulnerability and social exclusion. The court is mindful that the local probation teams face increasing caseloads and diminished resources, which place limits on the intensity and frequency of supervision. Nevertheless, recent innovations, including digital monitoring tools and bespoke community interventions, have demonstrated promise in mitigating repeat acquisitive crime. The effectiveness of these must be balanced against individual motivation and compliance. It is also of note that the recent coronavirus pandemic had profound implications for mental health services and social support networks, a fact referenced in many presentence reports nationally. The disruption to in-person contacts and reduction in charitable funding have left many vulnerable individuals underserved at precisely the moment of greatest need. While that context does not excuse criminal behaviour, it forms an essential backdrop to current sentencing considerations. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. The court recognizes the wider social context in which these offences occurred. We live in a period marked by increasing economic uncertainty, high inflation rates, and the ongoing effects of the so-called ‘cost of living crisis’. These variables contribute to mounting pressures upon individuals at the margins. Such factors, understandably, inform the mitigation put forward on your behalf. Despite this, it is important to reiterate that hardship does not equate to licence. The law remains clear that the preservation of public order and respect for the rights of others must be maintained. Theft from small businesses disproportionately affects those least able to absorb losses and undermines social cohesion. There exists also a growing phenomenon of so-called “social media shoplifting challenges,” particularly among younger cohorts, which some observers believe contribute to normalising such behaviours. While no evidence suggests your involvement in these trends, the court notes the challenges they present to law enforcement and community safety initiatives. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. Turning to the sentencing framework, the court is guided primarily by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on Theft Offences (Definitive Guideline issued April 2022), which sets out the factors relevant to assessing culpability and harm. Aggravating factors such as a pattern of offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, and the disruption caused to victims weigh heavily. Mitigating factors include timely guilty pleas and demonstrable engagement with rehabilitative services. The sentencing pool available includes custodial sentences, community orders with requirements such as unpaid work or rehabilitation activity, or in less serious cases, fines or conditional discharges. Given the history and pattern disclosed, the court is inclined to view immediate custody as a possible outcome, though deferral is warranted pending receipt of updated reports. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. The court also notes correspondence from the Bristol Safer Neighbourhood Team expressing concern about the rise of shop theft and its impact on local business owners and the community. Their letter highlights the emotional toll on retail workers, including anxiety and fear arising from repeated theft incidents, and encourages sentencing outcomes that underscore deterrence. Turning briefly to comparative case law: in R v. Lyndon [2023] EWCA Crim 845, the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment for a defendant with a similar offending profile involving organised theft rings targeting retail chains. While that case included aggravating features such as use of accomplices and intimidation, it demonstrates judicial willingness to impose custodial terms where offending is persistent and impacts multiple premises. Also relevant is R v. Freeman [2024] EWCA Crim 1902, where the Court distinguished between low-level opportunistic theft and calculated, repeated courses of conduct. There, the imposition of a community order augmented by cognitive skills training was upheld for a defendant without prior convictions and demonstrable steps toward engagement with support services. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. Victim impact statements submitted describe not only the quantifiable loss but also the broader disruption—inventory management challenges, staff redeployment, and increased security costs. One independent pharmacist, affected by one of the thefts, noted the psychological strain endured by front-facing staff, many of whom reported stress-related absenteeism. Such evidence underscores that theft, even in the absence of direct violence, carries substantial harm. Inquiries made with local charities assisting vulnerable adults confirm that multiple agencies remain engaged with you, albeit with mixed success. Notes reveal sporadic attendance at debt management workshops and a reluctance to maintain consistent contact with housing support services. While commendable attempts have been made to engage you, the apparent reticence to sustain such involvement is disconcerting. Notably, the probation service has flagged concerns arising from the 2018 case of a co-defendant (not yourself) in another matter involving assault and possession of an offensive weapon, factors unrelated to your offending but occasionally cited in adjacent files. This court emphasises that no such elements pertain in your case. The court is also aware—purely as an extraneous matter—that one of the retail outlets targeted by your offending was recently the site of a separate arson attack by an unrelated individual, resulting in extensive property damage and a custodial sentence of three years for the arsonist (R v. Craven [2025] EWCA Crim 2105). While this does not relate to your case, it exemplifies the complex interplay of risks facing local businesses and the importance of clear accountability for those who impact community safety. Finally, it is worth commenting on the broader implications for the community. Acquisitive crime undermines public confidence, fosters insecurity, and imposes costs ultimately borne by consumers and honest traders alike. The court must approach sentencing in a way that balances individual circumstances with these wider public interests. I will adjourn sentencing to permit the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, including consideration of suitable rehabilitative options. The report shall give due regard to your mental health, financial status, housing stability, and likelihood of compliance with community-based interventions. Particular attention should be paid to identifying any services that might address the underlying drivers of your offending, be they economic pressures or impulsivity. I remind all parties that sentencing credit for a guilty plea has been limited due to its timing, in line with judicial direction and established principles. I will welcome, however, any further representations or material that might inform an appropriate and proportionate sentence at the next hearing. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be prepared and made available to the parties. You are advised of your rights of appeal against conviction and sentence within 28 days, pursuant to relevant statutory provisions. No reporting restrictions apply. Costs are reserved.
