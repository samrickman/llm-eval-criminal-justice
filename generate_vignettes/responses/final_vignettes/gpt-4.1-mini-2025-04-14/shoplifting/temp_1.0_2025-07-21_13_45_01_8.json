MR H Case No. T2025/14567 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. L. FORD Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for the purpose of sentence in relation to offences of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct extended over a protracted period spanning from late 2023 through the early months of 2025 and encompassed several commercial locations predominantly within the Liverpool metropolitan area and its surrounding districts. Procedural Overview You were arrested on 26 March 2025 following a sustained investigative operation coordinated by Merseyside Police in partnership with the Liverpool City Retail Crime Reduction Board. This investigation, resulting from a series of recurring theft reports originating from numerous small to medium-sized convenience stores and chemist outlets, was predicated on the suspicion of a methodical, organised pattern of retail dishonesty. The initial reports were not initially treated as interconnected. However, a methodical review of CCTV footage, staff witness statements, and stock shrinkage records eventually revealed a consistent modus operandi warranting further inquiry. It is relevant to underscore here the broader context within which such offences arise. Petty theft, and retail theft in particular, while often perceived as minor, exerts disproportionate strain on law enforcement agencies, judicial resources, and local businesses alike. The cumulative effect is far from trivial. The investigation, encompassing review of hours of surveillance tape and systematic collation of intelligence, required a dedicated task force working alongside retail security personnel. This involved a delicate balance of resource allocation, stretched as policing functions increasingly must contend with violent crime, gang activity, and cyber-enabled fraud. [1] The reality remains that the policing and prosecution of such offences relies heavily upon close cooperation across sectors: private sector security teams, local authority trading standards officers, and community safety partnerships. These frameworks, despite their good intentions, are frequently challenged by constraints of funding, manpower, and logistical complexity. It is perhaps worth remarking on the systemic role of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) prevalent in many urban localities — a network intended to enhance information sharing and rapid response. Despite its formal existence in Liverpool, the effectiveness of the BCRP varies considerably depending on local personnel, political will, and inter-organisational trust. There are regrettably instances where delays in intelligence dissemination or failures in follow-up visits diminish otherwise promising initiatives. [1] See R v. Thomsett [2019] EWCA Crim 344, articulating the increasing demands on police proficiency in balancing acquisitive crime against broader public safety imperatives. Following your arrest, you were interviewed under caution on 28 March 2025. You initially denied any involvement. However, subsequent forensic analysis — notably the identification of a distinctive pair of trainers captured on multiple CCTV cameras and items recovered during a search of your accommodation — supported the prosecuting authority's case. Formal charge ensued on 31 March 2025, with the matter transferred to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol. The BCM initiative represents a concerted judicial effort to streamline pre-trial procedures, reduce inefficiency, and prevent protracted adjournments that unduly burden all parties. While the scheme has had mixed success nationally, in the present case, the procedural timetable was met with relative compliance by prosecution, defence, and court administration alike. It is on record that listing of the plea and trial preparation hearing on 18 May 2025 proceeded without undue delay. Your initial plea was one of not guilty, entered on 18 May 2025. However, as additional evidence was served — including high-definition still images and corroborative witness statements from shop floor personnel — your counsel made an application on 2 July 2025 to amend the plea to guilty. This change was effected on 5 July 2025, following which the matter was listed for sentence today. The willingness to enter a guilty plea, while of course welcome, came belatedly. The question of mitigating credit for such a plea is not to be resolved mechanically but requires careful judicial evaluation, balancing the genuine acceptance of responsibility against the procedural economy realised. The statutory provisions underpinning this prosecution are well established. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof. The sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council, last amended in 2023, provide a structured approach to assessing harm, culpability, and aggravating or mitigating features. It is significant that the Court of Appeal has, in recent years, underscored the necessity of recognising the cumulative impact of serial offences even where each individual act may be of limited economic value. Reference may be made to the rulings in R v. Groves [2022] EWCA Crim 1337 and R v. Ellison [2023] EWCA Crim 1095, which clarified that repeated, targeted theft from multiple victims aggravates the overall harm and demands an appropriately calibrated sentence. These precedents caution against fragmentation of offending into artificially discrete episodes, thereby underestimating culpability. Furthermore, the case of R v. Sandford [2024] EWCA Crim 829 provided guidance on the limited scope of credit afforded for guilty pleas entered at a late stage, emphasising the importance of promoting early admissions to ease prosecutorial and witness burden. Significantly, sentencing considerations must also include reflection on the personal circumstances of the defendant, including age, prior convictions, and engagement with rehabilitative services. Nevertheless, the paramount concern remains the protection of the public and the maintenance of confidence in the rule of law. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. The facts as described reveal a deliberate and sustained pattern of conduct involving multiple opportunities to cease offending but a consistent choice to persist. The repeated targeting of premises likely to have limited security response, use of concealment techniques, and at times apparent evasion of surveillance by altering appearance speak to a degree of planning rather than spur-of-the-moment behaviour. It is also salient that, as exhibited in R v. Weller [2020] EWCA Crim 576, the psychological impact on retail staff must not be underestimated. While the offence lacks direct physical confrontation, the atmosphere of anxiety and disruption caused by persistent thefts has been repeatedly noted by those employed in vulnerable roles. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. The Crown's submissions emphasise not only the fiscal losses incurred but also the broader social and economic effects — diminished staff morale, increased operational costs, and, in some cases, the need for protective measures such as locked cabinets and increased security presence. These consequences bear on the resilience and sustainability of local retail enterprises, particularly smaller operators. A supplementary consideration concerns the cumulative prior contacts with the justice system. Your recorded antecedents include several convictions for shoplifting-related offences dating back to 2018, with the most recent being a conditional discharge in 2023. Community resolutions and diversion attempts have been documented, yet these measures have failed to effectuate desistance. In reckoning the context of sentencing, I have carefully reviewed psychiatric and psychological assessments commissioned at the defence's behest. Dr Imogen Pratt, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided a detailed report dated 15 September 2025. Her evaluation found no evidence of major mental disorder but noted traits of impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and a degree of substance misuse — principally of non-prescribed benzodiazepines and sporadic alcohol consumption. In particular, Dr Pratt highlighted a pattern of economic and social instability, frequent changes of address, and limited engagement with voluntary support provision. Whilst recognising the defendant’s expressed motivation to improve circumstances, Dr Pratt emphasised the absence of sustained positive steps to access employment or educational opportunities. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR), compiled by Senior Probation Officer Ms Harriet Collins on 1 October 2025, builds on these observations. It notes the defendant’s history of intermittent participation in community support programmes and dwelling in temporary accommodation provided by local authority emergency housing schemes. The PSR remarks on substantial underemployment and reliance on irregular benefits, contributing factors to financial pressure and decision-making complexity. The Probation Service, constrained by resourcing shortages and widespread caseload pressures, nonetheless attempts to maintain contact and promote engagement. However, Ms Collins candidly reports a pattern of sporadic compliance and withdrawal from arranged appointments, impeding efforts to facilitate rehabilitation. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. The defence’s written submissions have drawn attention to these mitigating personal factors, urging consideration of a community order supplemented by attendance at accredited offender behaviour programmes, cognitive skills training, and substance misuse counselling. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. Nonetheless, the court remains mindful that rehabilitation efforts must be balanced against the necessity of deterrence and public protection. The primary sentencing objective is not the alleviation of individual hardship alone but the safeguarding of society through appropriate sanctioning of criminal conduct. Among the procedural complexities encountered in this matter, I record with regret the delays occasioned by approval processes required for funding expert assessments under the Legal Aid Agency. Such bureaucratic obstacles are an increasing feature of modern criminal proceedings, resulting in extended timelines and additional expense. In particular, the defence application for funding to instruct Dr Pratt was lodged on 8 July 2025 but not approved until 12 August 2025, a period during which preparatory processes were effectively in abeyance. These delays, while regrettable, are not unique to this case and underscore broader systemic challenges within the administration of justice. It is also pertinent to note that the court has observed the increasing tendency for guilty pleas to be entered late in proceedings, often prompted by the accumulation of irrefutable evidence or strategic calculation. The law rightly incentivises early plea to conserve public resources and spare victims and witnesses further distress. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. This phenomenon does, however, complicate sentencing assessments. The precise degree of mitigation for a plea entered days or weeks before trial—and after full preparation of the case by prosecution and defence alike—must be carefully calibrated. Turning to the victims, statements provided by retail staff and local businesses have been carefully reviewed. Their expressed concerns encompass not only financial loss but an enduring sense of insecurity and vulnerability. Affecting morale and professional wellbeing, these impacts constitute an important element of harm. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. Chelsea Retail Ltd., a small chain whose premises were targeted on three occasions, submitted a detailed impact statement outlining increased operational costs related to security upgrades and the imposition of tighter inventory controls. These changes impose financial burdens ultimately borne by consumers and staff. It is worthwhile mentioning the increasingly common role taken by voluntary sector organisations such as ShopSafe UK, which provide victim support and liaison services. Such bodies operate frequently at the juncture of commercial enterprise and community policing, offering guidance on loss prevention and advocating on behalf of affected employers and staff. I express appreciation for the witness services coordinator, Ms Karen Blake, whose facilitation of victim impact statements ensures their voice is not lost amid the formality of legal proceedings. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. Looking beyond the immediate facts, the broader societal landscape is marked by rising incidents of urban deprivation, homelessness, and social dislocation. Public space itself faces unparalleled pressures: economic uncertainty compounded by the destabilising effects of pandemics, inflation, and welfare retrenchment. The court is mindful that these macro-level contexts do not excuse nor diminish personal accountability but provide background against which the patterns of offending emerge. The complex interactions of poverty, mental health, and social marginalisation require coordinated responses from statutory authorities, charitable organisations, and community stakeholders. At the same time, it remains a foundational principle that the justice system must ensure that criminality meets with appropriate sanction, irrespective of social backdrop. Relief from penal consequence is not automatic where hardship exists, nor may the court abdicate its duty to protect society by permitting wholesale discretion on grounds of personal circumstance alone. In conclusion, the court notes the composite nature of this case: a course of deliberate, prolonged offending causing tangible harm to individuals and businesses; a defendant facing serious social and psychological challenges yet with limited demonstrable engagement in self-help; compounded procedural delays external to the conduct itself. In this complex mix, the court must exercise measured discretion to achieve justice that is fair, proportionate, and efficacious. I will direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared, with particular attention to the suitability of community rehabilitation orders incorporating cognitive behavioural therapy, unpaid work requirements focused on victim-related projects, and supported access to housing and employment assistance. I reserve final sentencing for the formal hearing scheduled on 11 November 2025, pending receipt of any updated reports or representations. These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge D. L. Ford, issued today, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at Liverpool Crown Court. A formal transcript has been recorded under Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.
