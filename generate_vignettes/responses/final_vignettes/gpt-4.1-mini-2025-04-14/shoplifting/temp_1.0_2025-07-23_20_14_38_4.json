MR H Case No. CH/2025/03148 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. L. WILKINS Filed: 2 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced in respect of charges arising from a series of shoplifting offences committed over an extended period throughout the borough of Chelsea and neighbouring districts. These offences, alleged and now admitted, concern repeated unlawful appropriations of goods from retail outlets, in breach of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. It is clear from the case materials and submissions that this conduct has persisted over a protracted timeline, exhibiting a course of behaviour that has drawn the attention of multiple enforcement agencies and partner organisations. Procedural History and Court Administration Observations Your matters first came before this court with an initial hearing held on 15 May 2025, at which time bail conditions were imposed restricting your attendance at certain shopping precincts pending further proceedings. The matter was subsequently subject to a number of pre-trial case management hearings, including a particularly protracted listing on account of defence applications for adjournments to facilitate additional reports and witness statements. The case followed the Better Case Management (BCM) process, established as a mechanism to expedite the disposition of criminal proceedings within the Crown Court. It aims to promote early identification of issues, efficient management of evidence, and appropriate case progression. While BCM generally improves timeliness, it remains dependent upon the cooperation and resourcing available to all parties. In this instance, the court records with some regret that the initial listing scheduled for 8 July was vacated at the behest of the defence, citing ongoing negotiations with the Legal Aid Agency regarding the funding of expert instruction. This is unfortunately emblematic of a wider systemic concern; repeated delays attributable to bureaucratic hurdles of Legal Aid administration impede the timely administration of justice and impose considerable operational strain on the court and case participants alike. The Legal Aid Agency’s performance in enabling timely access to independent experts has been the subject of numerous judicial observations, as noted in the recent review carried out by the Judicial Executive Board in March 2025. Despite these challenges, I commend the defence counsel, Mr S. Oliphant, for his professionalism and perseverance throughout the process. Equally, the Crown advocate, Ms K. Duncan, has conducted the prosecution with diligence and tact. Their efforts collectively have ensured that proceedings have not deviated from procedural decorum despite the challenges encountered. In arriving at an appropriate sentence, the court is mindful that multiple expert reports have been received and considered, encompassing psychiatric and probation assessments, victim impact statements, and ancillary agency correspondence. Each of these will be explored further below. The Court’s Contextual Considerations The offences before the court do not exist in a vacuum. The social fabric within Chelsea — like numerous other metropolitan areas — has been subjected to various strains over recent years, including rising rates of urban deprivation, shifts in housing availability, and a general increase in acquiescent attitudes toward less-than-honourable personal behaviour. We find ourselves in what criminologists have called a ‘complex urban risk environment,’ wherein petty crime is often symptomatic not merely of individual choice but of wider socio-economic and cultural currents. The courts must balance the sometimes competing imperatives of public protection, individual rehabilitation, and systemic efficacy. It is well recognised, as observed in the authoritative texts such as Smith and Hogan on Criminal Law (14th ed., 2024), that theft — while often disregarded as ‘minor’ in lay perception — carries with it a suite of social and economic consequences magnified when offences accumulate. The leadership of the Chelsea Safer Neighbourhoods Board has commented on the steady increase in retail theft incidents reported over the past three years, noting that such offending, if unchecked, contributes to a cycle of retail closures, job losses, and community decline. That pattern is not unique to Chelsea, of course, but the localised impact is felt acutely. Turning to case law, the court acknowledges the instructive nature of several appellate decisions dealing with offences of this kind. In R v Barrington [2019] EWCA Crim 1233, the appellant was convicted for a sustained series of shop thefts involving deception and distraction of staff. The Court of Appeal emphasised not only the financial harm but the emotional toll on employees subjected to repeated victimisation. The judgment confirmed that cumulative offending merits punishment proportionate to the overall harm caused, not merely the sum of individual incidents. Similarly, R v Thompson [2022] EWCA Crim 2146 addressed the issue of credit for guilty pleas offered at various stages. The Court held that guilty pleas entered at relatively late stages — particularly where evidence is overwhelming — should attract a more modest discount, reinforcing the principle that early acceptance of responsibility is a mitigating factor in sentencing. In the somewhat tangential but judicially referenced case of R v Higgins [2020] EWCA Crim 1059, concerning aggravated burglary and illegal possession of a bladed article in a school car park, the Court established guidance on contextual factors and proportional custodial sentencing, although the facts differ materially from the present matter. It serves as an additional reminder of the breadth of offences considered under the public protection umbrella, albeit differentiated by harm severity and culpability. The Court similarly notes, with interest, the case of R v Mills [2018] EWCA Crim 1374, which dealt with environmental regulatory offences, wherein the defendant was convicted for fly-tipping on green belt land leading to environmental damage. While this case is unrelated factually to drug imports or theft, it illustrates how non-violent offences may nonetheless attract significant custodial penalties when environmental and community harm is proven. Such decisions evidence the courts’ willingness to impose sentences reflecting aggregated harm, even where direct violence is absent. It is pertinent to note the excellent cooperation displayed among various local and national agencies in the investigation and prosecution of this case. The Business Crime Reduction Partnership, functioning across the borough since 2016, has maintained statutory partnerships with retail businesses, police, council enforcement, and victim liaison services, facilitating communication and data sharing that culminated in your identification. Despite known challenges regarding staff turnover and underfunding, the Partnership played a critical role in synthesising CCTV footage, intelligence reports, and victim accounts. The statutory framework under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 obliges local authorities to tackle such offending collaboratively; it is heartening where such frameworks produce operational benefits. That said, the case also highlights the often overlooked administrative burden borne by frontline professionals, who must delicately balance investigative imperatives with the pressures of institutional capacity constraints. Recent reports from the Home Office confirm that retail theft investigations nationally absorb approximately 15% of dedicated police acquisitive crime resources, an allocation that might otherwise serve more serious crime categories. Victim personal statements received from affected retail staff convey a measured but clear narrative of the effects of repeated theft. Though none suffered physical harm, the psychological consequences manifested as persistent anxiety, reduced feelings of safety at work, and disruption to employment patterns including shift adjustments and reduced hours. Several employees expressed apprehension about returning to work during your known periods of activity, highlighting the indirect but meaningful impact on their livelihoods. The cumulative loss suffered by the retail sector, while modest in individual transactions, aggregates to a significant economic deficit. It is well documented in criminal justice literature, including the Voluntary Sector’s 2024 report on ‘Retail Theft and Community Trust,’ that such incidents contribute to a broader erosion of public confidence, which is sometimes underestimated in its societal effect. Mr H, you were evaluated by Dr Michelle Abbott, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who provided a comprehensive report dated 14 August 2025. Dr Abbott concluded that while there is no evidence of a major psychiatric disorder such as psychosis or bipolar affective disorder, you present with mild to moderate depressive symptoms, compounded by chronic stress related to housing instability. Additionally, some traits consistent with impulsivity and poor affect regulation were identified. Though Dr Abbott did not find that these characteristics absolve responsibility for your offending, she recommended consideration of tailored mental health support as part of any community order to address underlying vulnerabilities that may contribute to recidivism. I would add that this reflects a clinical approach favoured by modern penal philosophy, recognising that effective rehabilitation often requires integrated health and social care interventions. However, the report notes limited compliance with prior referrals to mental health services, which diminishes prospects of engagement. This underscores a critical theme in adjudicating cases such as this: the gap between available support and actual uptake. The probation service has submitted a thorough pre-sentence overview dated 25 August 2025, prepared by officer Louise Redwood. The report details a history comprising several convictions for similar offences dating back over a decade, with custodial sentences previously imposed in 2017 and 2019. The current assessment assigns a medium risk of harm and high likelihood of reoffending, especially in the absence of sustained support. The report recommends cognitive behavioural interventions focusing on impulse control and decision-making, alongside housing stability support and substance misuse counselling. Furthermore, the probation officer highlights significant systemic pressures on service provision nationally, with waiting lists for relevant programmes often extending beyond six months. They emphasise that Mr H’s circumstances—marked by frequent relocations and intermittent engagement—complicate the delivery of structured support. In addition to professional reports, the court has received letters from several third parties advocating for Mr H’s rehabilitation. These include correspondence from the Chelsea Homeless Outreach Service, which recognises your challenging housing status and expresses willingness to continue engagement post-sentence. Also included is a letter from a volunteer at the Downtown Food Bank, praising your voluntary efforts and attendance at group sessions, albeit acknowledging that these have been inconsistent. Family representations submitted by your sister, Ms Jasmine H., acknowledge difficulties you have faced growing up, including parental separation and early school disengagement, though understandably these subjective accounts cannot be accorded determinative weight. These communications underline the multidimensional nature of your personal circumstances and hint at the social supports possible if engagement can be sustained. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. The Court’s Observations on Systemic Challenges and Public Confidence It is perhaps appropriate to reflect, as I have done in previous sentencing remarks, on the considerable strain placed upon public agencies arising from persistent acquisitive crime, even when such offences might be termed minor. Police forces have reported increased demand related to store theft, with heightened pressure on victim support units and forensic analysis teams. Indeed, the local Chelsea Police Division’s Digital Forensics Unit reported in its quarterly briefing that caseloads had risen by 12% since early 2024, with acquisition and review of CCTV footage being a substantial contributor. This reflects a broader trend across metropolitan policing territories and foreshadows the necessity for enhanced technological solutions paired with resource allocation. Such realities sit against the backdrop of a broader societal malaise observed by scholars and policy-makers alike: sliding public trust, complacency toward everyday rule-breaking, and the corrosive effects of social isolation exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic's aftershocks. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. The Court also notes, without imputing blame, that the Legal Aid Agency experienced administrative delays in this matter, resulting in nearly four weeks’ postponement for approval of funding for forensic psychological evaluation. Recent Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Justice reports have drawn attention to these systemic delays and advocated for reform to better serve court users. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. The court is conscious that delays and procedural complexities—while often attributable to external agencies—bear direct impact on defendants and, where applicable, victims. Such factors must be balanced carefully to ensure fairness while not unduly prolonging the process. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. Further Context from Local Social Services and Housing Authorities Correspondence from the Chelsea Council Housing Department indicates that you currently reside in temporary accommodation pending allocation of permanent social housing. The report notes a history of placement instability, exacerbating underlying stressors. Nationally, housing shortages continue to be a dominant issue in urban centres, with many citizens experiencing extended periods in insecure or unsuitable dwellings. This has been linked in social research to increased interactions with the criminal justice system, whether through necessity or circumstance. It is important, however, to emphasise that such adverse social conditions do not constitute a lawful justification for offending. Rather, they form part of a challenging mosaic in which the court must attempt to administer justice uniformly and compassionately. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. The court also acknowledges a recent report published by the Metropolitan Welfare Trust, which identified concerns at the local level related to the rising incidence of antisocial behaviour in public shopping precincts, often correlated with transient populations and economic insecurity. This wider environment lends some contextual background but does not excuse wrongdoing. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. You entered a guilty plea on the 12 August 2025, during the course of the trial window, after initially pleading not guilty at arraignment. While the court welcomes this acceptance of responsibility, the timing inevitably reduces the degree of credit that may be accorded. This is consistent with the principles set forth in R v. Cusack [2022] EWCA Crim 1785, which held that the maximum available reduction for a plea is contingent on its promptness and merit in terms of reducing procedural burden. Your counsel submits that the plea was made with genuine remorse and readiness to engage with rehabilitative provisions. These representations are taken into account; remorse, where present, is an important mitigating feature. Nevertheless, the prejudice caused by delayed pleas to witnesses, victims, and administrative resources must not be overlooked. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. The Court’s Approach to Sentencing Guidelines Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft succinctly. Sentencing guidelines published by the Sentencing Council in 2024 provide for tailored disposals based on factors including the value of goods stolen, offending frequency and persistence, sophistication, and impact upon victims. The 2024 guideline framework clarifies aggravating features relevant here include repeated offending despite prior sanctions, targeting of vulnerable premises, and the use of deception or distraction. Mitigation, by contrast, can arise from early guilty plea, demonstrable remorse, absence of prior convictions, personal mitigation relating to hardship, and engagement with support services. Your prior record, persistent nature of the offences, and delayed plea combine to place you at a higher culpability bracket within the guidelines. That said, demographic and personal contextual factors attenuate this somewhat. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. Balancing all factors, I decline to indicate the precise sentence today, as I have requested a fuller and updated pre-sentence report to consider any changes in your circumstances and potential for structured intervention. I emphasise the court’s expectation that the probation service will explore all viable rehabilitative options, including accredited cognitive behavioural programmes, community payback schemes, and mental health support pathways. The interests of justice require that any sentence be both proportionate and directed towards reducing the risk of reoffending, while allowing for meaningful personal reform. The hearing has been conducted in open court in Courtroom 5 at the Crown Court, Chelsea. I extend my thanks to counsel, Ms K. Duncan for the Crown and Mr S. Oliphant for the defence, whose submissions and professionalism have aided the court’s resolution of this matter. I also note with appreciation the vigilance of retail staff, whose victim impact statements add necessary human dimension to the court’s understanding. This court is cognisant of the complexities and competing interests that arise in cases of persistent low-level acquisitive offending. Our society benefits when justice is administered with a blend of firmness and fairness, acknowledging personal circumstance without surrendering to excuse or indulgence. I therefore reserve sentence pending receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report, expected within four weeks, at which time this matter will be listed for disposal. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 2 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Chelsea. The proceedings have been transcribed as required under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal conviction and sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.
