MR H Case No. W2025/13856 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. WENTWORTH Filed: 17 November 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced on a charge of theft by shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, reflecting a series of offences committed over an extended duration across a variety of retail outlets in the central London area. The offending conduct pertains to occasions between the latter half of 2023 and early 2025, marking a protracted period of criminal activity. Before addressing the core facts and circumstances of your offending, it is necessary to recount the procedural history and to outline the considerable context surrounding this case, both procedural and societal, in which your actions must be understood. The evolution of the statutory framework against theft provides a useful backdrop, not merely as a reminder of the formal law, but as an illustration of legislative intent and judicial interpretation over time. The Theft Act 1968, enacted over half a century ago, represents a concise but pivotal statute defining theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. The courts have consistently grappled with the application of these principles to emerging patterns of acquisitive crime, including those involving retail theft. The historical amendment in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which introduced community punishment provisions, as well as the subsequent Sentencing Council guidelines, have refined the approach to sentencing such offences, particularly emphasising proporcionality, deterrence, and rehabilitation. The present case has traversed the pathways of the criminal justice system with an array of hearings and procedural steps. You were initially arrested on 12 March 2025, following a considerable and resource intensive inquiry conducted by officers from the Metropolitan Police Service’s Retail Crime Unit, in collaboration with the London Business Crime Reduction Partnership. This investigation was triggered not by a single event, but by a pattern of incidents reported by multiple independent traders, who had noted a suspicious individual matching your description frequenting their premises. As this court has observed on many occasions, the aggregation of retail theft incidents into a coherent prosecutorial narrative often requires extensive data collation, cross-referencing fragmented CCTV footage, and the cooperation of thinly stretched store personnel. It is a testament to the resolve of the investigatory agencies that matters of such apparent mundanity receive the focused attention they merit. In acknowledging the scale of the effort involved, it bears reiterating the court’s awareness of the constraints imposed on public agencies. The Legal Aid Agency, for instance, has on numerous occasions been the subject of criticism for delays and opacity. In your case, applications for funding to instruct an independent forensic psychologist were delayed considerably, as correspondence between defence counsel and the Agency indicates, leading to an adjournment of the original sentencing date scheduled for late July 2025. These administrative delays, while lamentable, must be factored into any criticism of apparent procrastination in this matter. It is the hope of the court that systemic reforms under discussion will mitigate such issues in future cases. Turning to the procedural unfolding of the case, the matter was first listed before a District Judge on 4 April 2025, at which the prosecution served papers consolidating several counts into a single representative charge for procedural efficiency, pursuant to practice typically observed in cases involving repeated smaller-scale dishonesty. The plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 21 May. You indicated a not guilty plea at that time but later, following the provision of further evidentiary material from the Crown and the lodgement of additional witness statements, entered a guilty plea on 10 October 2025, on the day prior to the adjourned sentencing hearing. This pattern of late pleas is regrettably frequent and raises significant questions regarding the beneficial credit to be afforded. The Crown, represented today by Ms Eleanor Finch, has set out submissions grounded in the cumulative impact of your offending. Defence counsel, Mr Nigel Hartley, has emphasised mitigating factors that include your demonstrable financial and personal hardship, as well as purported steps towards engagement with community services subsequent to your arrest. The court is grateful to both counsel for their clear and conscientious submissions. It is also appropriate to recognise the immensely challenging environment in which services addressing issues related to acquisitive offending operate. One must acknowledge the strain on mental health support structures and the pressures facing probation services, which have experienced significant reductions in staffing and resources across England and Wales. The NHS’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme continues to struggle with waiting lists extending several months, limiting timely access even for individuals referred by criminal justice pathways. Within this context, the provision of thorough expert assessments, such as the psychiatric evaluation commissioned in your case, represents a significant demand on stretched psychiatric workloads. The contributory delays caused by this overstretched capacity cannot be overstated. The court appreciates the professionalism of Dr Samantha Liu, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose comprehensive report materially informs the present sentencing considerations. Furthermore, it may be of interest to note that the establishment of this Crown Court, originally opened in 1987 as one of a network of courts designed to decentralise judicial administration, has undergone extensive refurbishment in the past year. Modernisation efforts included acoustic improvements, the installation of new digital display systems for case management, and enhancements to public gallery accessibility. Though peripheral to your case, such improvements reflect an ongoing commitment to procedural fairness and the dignified administration of justice. By way of wider societal observation, it is regrettable that the social milieu in which offences such as yours are committed has become increasingly fraught. The court has observed, through its caseloads and consultations with community stakeholders, a gradual normalization of acquisitive offences among certain social groups, which carries with it the risk of thicker and more entrenched cycles of dependency and criminality. This phenomenon is articulated in recent reports by the Centre for Crime Prevention and Community Resilience, which highlights the intersectionality of poverty, substance misuse, and unstable housing in feeding recidivist behaviours. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. It is necessary, even as one recites these case details, to avoid conflation between individual agency and structural determinants. There exists a persistent temptation, noted in many proceedings, to attribute offending behaviour primarily to inherited social deficits, rather than acknowledging accountable personal decision-making. While sociological factors are relevant to rehabilitation strategy, the law demands a clear demarcation between explanation and excuse. The court took particular interest in the letter submitted by your mother, Mrs. Linda H, sent to the court on 7 November 2025. Her account, while expressing sorrow and regret at the impact of your conduct upon her family and community, also speaks of longstanding familial disturbance, including reference to your younger brother, who, unrelated to these proceedings, is the subject of ongoing investigations pertaining to benefit fraud allegations lodged in early 2025 by the Department for Work and Pensions. While these matters may be of personal significance, they bear no substantive relationship to your culpability and are noted here solely in the context of the fine balance required when assessing mitigation. Before turning to case law, it is proper to salute the endeavours of the Victorian Street Outreach Trust, a leading charity active in the area. Their proactive engagement with vulnerable individuals at risk of slipping into acquisitive crime offers vital support and intervention. Their latest annual report laments a 12% increase in demand for their drop-in clinics, surging beyond their capacity to provide uninterrupted care. The Trust’s written representations commend those defendants who demonstrate genuine engagement with support mechanisms, but caution against a blanket presumption of mitigation arising from social hardship. A recent academic contribution from Professor David Muir on the societal effects of shoplifting in large urban centres notes the cumulative strain on retail staff, many of whom report increased workplace anxiety, staffing shortages, and the psychological toll of repeated victimisation. Muir’s findings reinforce the need for judicial responses that account not only for immediate loss but for longer term community impact. In tandem, the court has considered the vexed questions surrounding the operation of the Better Case Management (BCM) system. Your case was managed within this procedural framework, which is intended to streamline evidence disclosure, identify early pleas, and reduce avoidable adjournments. While the system's efficacy varies regionally, this case presented no undue administrative delay beyond the unavoidable Legal Aid-related applications. Counsel are to be commended for their diligence in navigating the complexities therein. With respect to the prosecution evidence, it was notably comprehensive. Security footage from multiple premises was analysed, and your pattern of furtive behaviour — involving delaying tactics, use of concealing apparel, and calculated timing during staff transitions — was well documented. The police digital forensics unit contributed through enhancement of poor-resolution imagery, a laborious task given the low-light and crowded retail environments involved. This reflects the increasing emphasis on technological means in evidence gathering, notwithstanding challenges around equipment standardisation and privacy concerns. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. It is informative to reflect briefly on relevant authority to assist in determining the appropriate sentencing bracket. In particular, I refer to the decision in R v. Claridge [2019] EWCA Crim 590, an appeal concerning repeated thefts from pharmacy outlets across the Midlands region. Claridge involved the theft of high-value over-the-counter medications with a view to resale, a comparable modus operandi to your own. The Court of Appeal upheld sentences ranging from 8 to 10 months’ custodial detention, underscoring the cumulative harm posed by persistent offending despite the absence of physical violence or direct threats. It is salient too to recall R v. Stevens [2021] EWCA Crim 1223, which considered the sentencing of an individual who repeatedly shoplifted electronic goods from multiple branches of a major retailer. Although Stevens leveraged the defence of addiction and personal hardship, the sentencing court affirmed the need to prioritise deterrence and the protection of commercial entities bearing the brunt of loss and disruption. Moreover, while peripheral, it is noted that the Court of Appeal in R v. Delaney [2018] EWCA Crim 441, which concerned a burglary of an unoccupied dwelling in Sussex during the festive period, stressed the psychological impact on victims, even in the absence of direct confrontation. Delaney serves as a reminder that breach of trust and sense of violated safety often transcend the immediate value of the goods taken. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. A probation officer’s pre-sentence report has been provided by Ms Karen Fletcher, whose diligent work is gratefully acknowledged. The report highlights a somewhat ambivalent attitude towards rehabilitation on your part, though it notes that you have expressed willingness to participate in cognitive-behavioural interventions if they are appropriately structured and accessible. The officer notes your current unstable housing situation, which compounds the difficulties you experience, and the police intelligence assessment suggests a low risk of harm to the public but a high risk of reoffending in the absence of effective intervention. Of particular interest, the report touches on your sporadic engagement with local substance misuse services, which have historically been available but inconsistently accessed. The fragmented nature of your interactions with voluntary and statutory agencies illustrates a broader challenge faced by community supervision teams: maximising compliance amid complex personal and social circumstances. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. Expert medical evidence supplied by Dr Liu concludes that no major psychiatric pathology is present, but indicates traits of impulsivity and borderline emotional regulation issues, which may be linked to episodes of depressive symptomatology. The report is cautiously optimistic about treatment potential, provided appropriate support is offered, but underscores the risks of deterioration if left unmanaged. A diverse body of case law informs the approach to sentencing where mental health considerations are involved. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, for example, the Court examined the balance between therapeutic intervention and custodial sentences, recognizing that psychiatric conditions do not automatically mitigate culpability. More recently, the decision in R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412 reaffirmed the importance of public safety in cases where individuals demonstrate unstable engagement with treatment. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. Additional letters of support conveyed from the local housing support charity, Homestead Link, underline your precarious accommodation status. They outline the deep systemic pressures on housing availability in Westminster, describing how demand far outstrips supply and how many vulnerable individuals are housed in temporary hostels with limited facilities, some distant from family or community networks. Such commentary, while informative, cannot absolve personal responsibility, though it informs the holistic assessment of your circumstances. Reference must also be made to the victim impact statements received from representatives of the shops from which you took goods. These accounts attest to the disruption caused—employees report anxiety, alterations to shifts, and the imposition of security measures such as locked display cabinets. Retail managers express frustration at the financial toll, compounded by the time they must spend liaising with police and insurance companies. The ripple effects extend beyond monetary loss; they affect morale and community cohesion in ways that are hard to quantify but very real. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. The court has taken care to consider the guidance contained within the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft, last updated in 2022. This framework instructs sentencing courts to examine culpability and harm dimensions while considering aggravating and mitigating factors. Your repeated offending, knowledge of previous interventions, and disregard for warnings weigh heavily as aggravating features. Conversely, early guilty pleas typically attract some reduction in sentence length, reflecting recognition of responsibility and resource savings. However, your plea was entered at a late stage, reducing the credit available. The law, as articulated in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, makes clear that such timing impacts credit allocation. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. Moreover, the probation report highlights the essential role played by the Retail Victim Support Unit in providing services to the affected retailers. This unit operates against a backdrop of increasing workload and constrained budgets, hampered further by recruitment challenges and the persistent need to balance preventative work with the provision of support. The unit’s capacity to assist victims often hinges on sustained funding streams and inter-agency cooperation. A further procedural note: the court records the effective performance of the court ushers, whose professionalism in ensuring order throughout hearings under considerable public traffic has been exemplary. Their duties, often overlooked, are especially critical in the current climate of heightened security provisions and health precautions. Finally, the court must address the future risk posed by your offending pattern. Despite community disposals and out-of-court warnings, your behaviour has persisted. This underscores the importance of a sentence that not only punishes but also deters and rehabilitates. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. Your previous convictions, though not extensive in number, reveal a trajectory of repeated acquisitive offending, for which you were previously subject to a conditional discharge, now breached by your more recent conduct. You have no known gang affiliations or indications of coercion. The court has not been presented with evidence of substance misuse directly causative of the offending, though related vulnerabilities may exist. Sentencing in your case must be approached with due regard to the principles enshrined in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, notably those of proportionality, public protection, and the prospect of rehabilitation. Community orders with specific requirements have notable merit where compliance is achievable and risks can be managed. Conversely, immediate custodial sentences must be reserved for cases where the seriousness of offending or persistence demands such measures. Given the complexity of your circumstances, the court has resolved to defer sentence to enable the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report, including comprehensive risk and needs assessments, and the exploration of suitable treatment and intervention opportunities. This approach aligns with the court’s statutory duties and the overarching objectives of the Sentencing Council guidelines. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 November 2025, in Court 6 at Westminster Crown Court. Proceedings have been duly recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record will be transmitted to the relevant authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of sentencing. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.
