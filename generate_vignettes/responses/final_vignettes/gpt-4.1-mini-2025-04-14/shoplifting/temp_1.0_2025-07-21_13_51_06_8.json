MR H Case No. W2025/08437 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. P. RICHARDS Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you appear for sentence following your admitted involvement in a series of offences amounting to theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans a period covering the latter part of 2023 through to early 2025 and implicates multiple retail outlets within the Windsor and Maidenhead area, including several independent shops and pharmacy chains. Procedural History Following your arrest on 28 February 2025, which resulted from a multi-agency initiative spearheaded by Windsor’s Safer Streets Taskforce, your case was progressed to this Crown Court after representation of the prosecuting authority that the volume and persistence of the conduct warranted trial at the higher court level under the Better Case Management (BCM) arrangements. The BCM protocol, as the court and practitioners are well aware, is designed to facilitate the early clarification of evidential issues, promote case progression with due expedition, and reduce unnecessary adjournments. The criminal case management adopted here involved a series of preliminary hearings, the first being conducted remotely on 11 March 2025, at which your solicitor indicated that an initial plea of not guilty was to be entered. This plea was maintained at a subsequent hearing on 14 April 2025, despite the Crown serving a comprehensive disclosure package including digital evidence, witness statements, and CCTV footage purportedly showing your repeated presence at various crime scenes. We find ourselves, unmistakably, in an era characterised by a slow but relentless unraveling of the social order — a period in which the small but persistent transgressions of civic norms have become not only more visible but more frequent. Reports of petty theft, once seen as sporadic or isolated, now speak to a broader pattern of disregard for personal and communal boundaries. The toll of drug-related harm, meanwhile, is borne not just by the individuals involved but by the already overextended institutions charged with holding together the basic infrastructure of public health and safety. One senses, in everyday encounters and quiet observations, a fraying of the once-cohesive threads that held neighbourhoods together: a declining willingness to look out for others, to engage in the quiet acts of reciprocity that make collective life tolerable. These developments manifest not only in the uptick of minor offences but also in the creeping normalisation of behaviours once held to be beyond the pale of acceptable conduct. It must be stated, of course, that the function of the court is not to offer sociological commentary or to diagnose the state of society — but it would be equally disingenuous to pretend that offences occur in a vacuum, untouched by the wider forces that shape the habits, expectations, and moral horizons of the individuals who come before us. It is an unfortunate reality that the late plea you entered, on the morning of trial on 30 July 2025, reflects a familiar pattern to this court. While pleas at this stage remain within your rights, the timing carries implications for the degree of credit afforded and the resultant sentence. The Court of Appeal’s pronouncement in R v. Pearce [2019] EWCA Crim 576 remains instructive: late pleas rarely signify genuine contrition and often serve to conserve prosecutorial and witness resources only in a limited sense. A number of plea and trial preparation hearings were listed; the initial hearing on 19 June was vacated when Legal Aid delays obstructed the timely provision of funding for a psychiatric evaluation sought by your defence team. It is with no small measure of frustration that the court must once again comment upon the consistently slow and cumbersome performance of the Legal Aid Agency in authorising expert reports, here resulting in a delay of no less than five weeks. Such bureaucratic inertia undermines the smooth administration of justice and disproportionately impacts defendants reliant on state-funded representation. Your defence counsel, Mr Gareth Davies, has been diligent in pursuing your interests despite these obstacles, for which the court acknowledges his professionalism and tenacity. Likewise, Ms Elizabeth Carr, appearing on behalf of the Crown, has conducted herself with commendable clarity and judiciousness, ensuring that the requisite balance is struck between the interests of the state and the defendant. In the course of pre-trial preparation, the court received several letters from support organisations, including the Windsor Outreach Network and Shopkeepers’ Association, reflecting both the cumulative impact of retail theft upon small business proprietors and the ongoing challenges faced by charitable bodies striving to mediate conflict and provide rehabilitative avenues. These agencies report strain due to increased caseloads and reduced funding, painting a sobering picture of the ecosystem within which such offending occurs. Complaints concerning the availability and timeliness of interpretation services also emerged during the period leading to the trial. On 21 May, a scheduled hearing was rescheduled due to the late arrival of an appointed interpreter. While this matter was swiftly resolved, it underscores the operational pressures currently confronting court administrative functions, particularly amid ongoing workforce shortages exacerbated by retirements and recruitment challenges. I note with some interest and indirect relevance that this court’s facilities, refurbished earlier this year under a multi-million-pound capital scheme, now boast enhanced digital capabilities, including integrated evidence presentation suites and improved public seating — developments that, while peripheral to the present case, signify the judiciary’s commitment to providing a dignified and effective environment for litigation. One must also bear in mind the evolution of the jurisprudential landscape concerning offences of theft and dishonesty. Over the last decade, the courts have witnessed a rebalancing of sentencing principles with an emphasis on proportionality, rehabilitation, and an informed understanding of social context, without sacrificing deterrence or the protection of victims. The Sentencing Council’s guideline for Theft Offences (Definitive 2019) provides the current framework, highlighting factors such as the value of property taken, the number of victims, and the sophistication or planning involved. Of particular note is the consideration given to offences targeting vulnerable establishments, including those serving disadvantaged populations or dependent upon community goodwill. This reflects a jurisprudential sensitivity borne of experience and the recognition that the ripples of harm from acquisitive crimes radiate beyond the immediate proprietor and impact the social fabric. In approaching your sentence, I have had regard to all these considerations, alongside the detailed pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Fiona Crampton, dated 2 October 2025. Ms Crampton’s appraisal indicates a mixed picture: you are assessed as presenting low to medium risk of serious harm but medium risk of reoffending, with identified underlying issues including episodic substance misuse, intermittent housing instability, and difficulties sustaining employment. Community-based support services, notably the Thames Valley Alcohol and Drug Support Centre, have previously engaged with you but report limited success. These agencies, constrained by budgetary pressures and overwhelming demand, face significant hurdles in offering sustained engagement, a challenge likely aggravated by your sporadic participation. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. Included among the documents submitted by the defence is a report by Dr Simon Leary, consultant forensic psychiatrist, assessed at your request. Dr Leary’s evaluation, conducted over three sessions in July 2025, notes no formal psychiatric diagnosis but identifies a tendency towards impulsive behaviour and a mild depressive disorder. His recommendation underscores the potential benefit of structured cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) targeting both offending behaviour and underlying emotional regulation difficulties. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. It is regrettable that opportunities for earlier intervention, potentially mitigating progression or escalation, appear to have been underutilised or declined. In considering your background, I have reviewed representations from family members and associates, including a letter from your sister dated 15 September 2025 that speaks to periods of unemployment and housing precarity, alongside moments of genuine effort to seek lawful employment. While personal testimonials invariably introduce subjectivity, they offer invaluable insight into the lived realities underpinning offending. Though the facts of the case focus on theft, it is incumbent upon the court to consider broader behavioural patterns and their implications for risk and rehabilitation. The landscape of acquisitive crime is multifaceted, reflecting intersections between socio-economic distress and personal agency. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. It is not lost on the court that your offending places a burden on multiple public agencies and charities, whose resources are finite and whose capacity to respond is variably constrained. There is an institutional fatigue evident in many such bodies—manifest in waiting lists for mental health services, overstretched probation teams, and the consistent need to prioritise cases based on risk and urgency. The Probation Service, as a whole, continues to grapple with recruitment and retention challenges, with recent figures indicating a near 15% vacancy rate nationally. This has consequences for caseload sizes and the quality of supervision able to be offered. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. In R v. Maynard [2017] EWCA Crim 1342, the Court of Appeal reaffirmed that the persistence of acquisitive offending, especially without engagement with rehabilitative provision, signals the need for custodial intervention in cases where alternatives have been exhausted or deemed unsuitable. Though your case is less serious in value or violence than Maynard, the principle remains salient: sustained dishonesty is a matter of concern regardless of scale. Reference may also be made — albeit with limited direct application — to R v. Duvall [2020] EWCA Crim 876, which dealt with dangerous driving offences resulting in grievous bodily harm. While the factual matrix differs substantially, the case illustrates the judiciary’s role in balancing community protection against the prospect of rehabilitation, a tension equally present here. Within the sententious corpus, attention is also drawn to R v. Graham [2021] EWCA Crim 1101, which addressed the sentencing of a defendant convicted for fly-tipping on Green Belt land, resulting in environmental degradation assessed at considerable public cost. While your offending bears no environmental dimension, the case is instructive in demonstrating that offences impacting community resources or public confidence sometimes warrant enhanced sentences despite lacking personal injury elements. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. The court has also reviewed victim impact statements from proprietors and staff of affected premises. These statements describe not only pecuniary loss but the emotional toll of confronting repeated theft. Staff report diminished morale, heightened anxiety, and, in some cases, the necessity of altering working patterns. The North Windsor Business Association has submitted a detailed memorandum voicing concerns about retail shrinkage and its knock-on effects for local employment and economic vitality. Such material serves to humanise the offences and to remind all parties that acquiescence to such behaviour is neither mandated nor appropriate amidst broader societal challenges. The concept of community reparation, as encouraged by the Sentencing Council's guideline on Theft Offences, is relevant. It strikes a chord with the restorative justice principles increasingly embedded in contemporary sentencing practice, balancing accountability with the opportunity for repair and reintegration. Though I am mindful of your personal difficulties, including intermittent homelessness and sporadic employment, these must be weighed against the persistent nature of your conduct and apparent reluctance to fully engage with support mechanisms proffered. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. An observation on the broader context may be warranted. The local constabulary continues to express concern about finite resources being diverted to what they term “non-serious” crime, including acquisitive juvenile and adult offending. This trend places additional strain on neighbourhood policing teams already facing heightened demands in relation to serious violent crime and organised gang activity. That said, the Windsor Business Crime Reduction Partnership appears to have functioned with notable efficacy in this matter — collating information, facilitating victim liaison, and coordinating multi-agency responses without undue delay or friction. The court records its appreciation for their work. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. In terms of personal mitigation, counsel has drawn attention to your composition of a letter to the court expressing remorse and acknowledging the impact of your actions. The letter was carefully written, legible, and evidently the product of sincere reflection. Though such correspondence cannot substitute for tangible behavioural change, it is taken into account. Additionally, your previous criminal record includes minor traffic offences and two convictions for possession of cannabis, both from some years prior and of limited present relevance. There is no indication of any gang affiliations or involvement in violent crime. The impact of your offending does not extend to physical harm or threats, but the court notes the psychological strain on victims and the economic costs. The court is conscious, however, that in sentencing it must calibrate a response proportionate to the gravity of the offences and cognisant of the prospects for rehabilitation. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. In concluding these remarks, I emphasise that sentencing in cases of repeated retail theft requires an approach that balances public protection, deterrence, and the encouragement of desistance. While community sentences remain appropriate in many cases, where evidence suggests limited engagement or significant risk of reoffending, custodial sentences may be justified. At this juncture, the court will direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by probation that specifically addresses your history, risk factors, social circumstances, and the availability of structured community interventions. Attention should be given to cognitive skills programmes, substance misuse treatment pathways, and any housing support necessary to underpin effective rehabilitation. I will adjourn sentencing until such time as the report is completed and filed. This will allow all parties to consider fully the options and enable me to impose a sentence reflective of the totality of circumstances. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Windsor. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.
