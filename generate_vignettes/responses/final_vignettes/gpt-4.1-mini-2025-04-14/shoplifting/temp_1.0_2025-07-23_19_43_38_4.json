MR H Case No. X2025/15379 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. P. WELLS Filed: 22 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence following your conviction for theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending was sustained over a period extending from mid-2023 to early 2025 within multiple retail outlets in the west London boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham and Ealing. The charge consolidates a series of incidents which, while individually of low value, cumulatively represent a protracted course of criminal conduct. Procedural Background You were arrested on 8 February 2025 pursuant to a warrant obtained following a detailed investigation by the Shepherd’s Bush Business Crime Unit, in association with the local Safer Neighbourhood Team and the Metropolitan Police Central Intelligence Bureau. The inquiry involved extensive use of closed-circuit television footage compiled from various retail premises, which was painstakingly correlated to generate a coherent timeline and modus operandi. It is of note that the volume of footage reviewed exceeded 70 hours, a reflection of both the complexity of the investigation and the resource-intensive nature of such acquisitive crime inquiries. It remains a lamentable reality that offences of this nature often draw significant police attention and operational resources out of proportion to the monetary value of the goods taken; this has been documented in recent reports by the Home Office (“The Retail Theft Review 2024,” Home Office Publication HO/RT/24/243). Nonetheless, commitment on the part of officers is unwavering, underpinned by an awareness that repeated shoplifting harbours broader social and economic consequences. The investigation took several months to reach conclusion, partly due to the necessary cross-jurisdictional coordination between multiple independent retailers and their security teams. This case thus highlights the challenges faced by law enforcement in an era where retail chains are fragmented across borough boundaries yet require harmonised intelligence sharing. On occasion, the responsiveness of some private sector partners varied, necessitating reiterative liaison from police contacts — an issue common to many modern acquisitive crime investigations. On 10 February 2025, you were interviewed under caution at Shepherd’s Bush Police Station. You initially denied involvement in the thefts, asserting you had been wrongfully identified. However, analysis of forensic evidence, including comparison of footwear impressions and recovered stolen receipts, undermined your alibi. You were charged on 28 February 2025 with a representative count, the others being taken into consideration. The case was allocated to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative established by the Criminal Procedure Rules. Hearings for plea and trial preparation took place on 3 April and 15 May respectively. Delays in the provision of a psychiatric report, sought on the application of Your Honour’s defence counsel, led to further listing adjournments, ultimately resolved by the timely participation of Dr Fiona Elswick, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, whose report was made available on 20 August 2025. The plot surrounding the delay attributable to Legal Aid authorization bears mention. It is regrettable that the initial application to instruct expert witnesses suffered bureaucratic obfuscation, with repeated clarification requests issued by the Legal Aid Agency over a protracted three-month period before final sanctioning. This impeded the efficient progression of the case and placed additional strain on the parties—disruptions frequently lamented by practitioners and judges alike, as documented in “The Legal Aid System: Contemporary Challenges” (Journal of Criminal Justice 2025, Vol. 54). I acknowledge the efforts of Mr Daniel Brace, counsel for the defence, who diligently pursued these authorisations amidst such administrative obstacles. The Prosecution is represented by Ms Felicity Graham, who has presented her case with commendable professionalism. The Defence team is led by Mr Brace, whose engagement with both the client and courts reflects due diligence. The staff of this court, including usher Mr Paul Marks and court clerk Miss Susan Eldridge, have ensured the smooth conduct of proceedings despite intermittent technical difficulties during remote evidence hearings and the brief but significant staff absenteeism related to recent health outbreaks. Their service deserves recognition. A plea at the earliest reasonable opportunity remains an important factor in sentencing considerations. It must be said that your change of plea to guilty was entered only after disclosure of the final tranche of CCTV material and the conclusion of forensic analysis. While a guilty plea is appropriately noted and credited, the timing must be weighed carefully against the interests of justice, victims, and public resources. The predicament of the retail sector during this period cannot be assessed apart from the wider context. It is well recognised that London’s retail landscape has undergone significant transformation in the last decade: an increase in online commerce, rising rents, and constrained profits have combined with elevated theft rates to create an uphill struggle for shopkeepers. The impact of persistent loss through theft has contributed to tighter security protocols, staff redundancies, and, in some cases, permanent closures, particularly among independent traders. These indirect effects, often overlooked, constitute part of the harm Parliament intends to address through sentencing. The better operation of Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRP) and their penetration into community policing strategies has been touted as a critical response. It is not mere bureaucratic jargon when the Crown refers to the worth of such alliances. The local BCRP unit herein was commendably mobilised, with weekly intelligence briefings held involving store managers and police liaison officers. However, the court notes that these forums sometimes struggle with attendance fluctuating in line with staff turnover and the capacity of partner agencies. Notwithstanding these practical difficulties, the recorded incident data collated from these meetings formed a key part of the evidential matrix. It is necessary, at this juncture, to briefly address the broader public interest in proceedings of this kind, notwithstanding their apparently minor status. A number of academics and commentators have pointed out that the cumulative cost of shoplifting extends beyond immediate fiscal loss to impact community safety, employment, and social cohesion. The Crown Prosecution Service’s “Street-Level Crime and Community Impact Report” (2023) emphasises the need for consistent enforcement to maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system. The court subscribes fully to this view. By way of historical and legal context, it is worth recalling the foundation laid by the Theft Act 1968, which replaced archaic common law definitions with this statutory framework. The statute’s enduring significance lies in its balance of articulating clearly the constituent elements of theft—dishonesty, appropriation, property, belonging to another—alongside judicial discretion in sovereignty of sentencing. In the sphere of appellate jurisprudence, this court notes the established authority of R v. Bowers [2019] EWCA Crim 1413, which examined the sentencing approach to repeat shoplifting in the context of mental health vulnerabilities. The Court of Appeal cautioned against overreliance on mitigating psychiatric diagnoses where repeated offending showed an absence of genuine rehabilitation efforts. While Mr Bowers’ circumstances bore some parallels, they are not determinative of the present case. Similarly, R v. Oakley [2021] EWCA Crim 1785 — concerning aggravated theft from charity shops — demonstrates the discretion this court holds in weighting the impact on particularly vulnerable proprietors, which might not be immediately evident in the market value of stolen goods. It is useful to observe that the Courts have also grappled with the challenge posed by late pleas. The seminal case of R v. Greaves [2020] EWCA Crim 1272 reaffirmed that late pleas, particularly those tendered after trial preparation, attract proportionately reduced credit to reflect procedural inefficiency and the burden on witnesses. These principles guide this court’s approach today. In an illustrative diversion, the recent matter of R v. Fenwick [2025] EWCA Crim 301, which involved a convicted offender charged with fly-tipping on protected green belt land, underscores the courts’ sustained intolerance of environmental harm. While unrelated to shoplifting, the Fenwick case demonstrates the judiciary’s broad concern with offences that, in aggregate, degrade communal well-being and public resources—a thematic resonance in the current context. The court also acknowledges the persistent strain on mental health services in London, as documented in the NHS London Trust’s Mental Health Capacity Report 2024. Patients requiring outpatient support often face protracted waiting times, complicating attempts to integrate psychiatric treatment into offender rehabilitation. This systemic failing, while extrinsic to this case, creates practical challenges for courts and probation alike. Turning back to this matter: your defence has submitted a psychiatric evaluation from Dr Eldridge. Her detailed report diagnoses mild to moderate adjustment disorder with anxiety features but explicitly discounts the presence of any debilitating psychopathology that would substantially impair your capacity for rational decision-making or impulse control. It is notable that Dr Eldridge emphasises your inconsistent engagement with voluntary services, suggesting both a degree of ambivalence and limited insight. These observations parallel those in the probation pre-sentence assessment, commissioned on 18 September 2025, which underscores a general reluctance to comply with offered support despite multiple opportunities. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. In considering the evidence, your pattern of offending exhibits a calculated approach, exploiting familiar retail environments and known vulnerabilities in staffing and stock layouts. The repeated use of distraction techniques and concealment devices demonstrates knowledge and intent beyond that of a momentary lapse. The collected CCTV footage, corroborated by statements from store personnel and losses recorded in company audit reports, present a cogent picture. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. The forum of this court benefits from the expertise of probation officer Ms Lara Simmons, who compiled a comprehensive report dated 21 September 2025. Her report offers a balanced but clear assessment of risk, outlining the likelihood of reoffending in absence of effective intervention. Ms Simmons explicitly recommends structured Community Payback and cognitive-behavioural programmes aimed at acquisitive offending, supplemented by supervised mentoring. She cautions, however, that the risk of non-compliance remains significant without sustained motivation. It would be remiss not to mention the family liaison correspondence submitted on your behalf by your sister, Ms Eleanor H., whose letter paints a picture of a supportive yet strained familial environment. Though no question is taken with her sincerity, the court notes that there is limited evidence of your effective engagement with familial support resources prior to your recent apprehension. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. It is pertinent also to consider the impact of your offending on staff morale and operational practices within affected businesses. The proprietor of a small local convenience store, who submitted a victim personal statement, describes a discernible deterioration in employee wellbeing linked to repeated thefts. Staff fatigue, turnover, and anxiety have manifested, necessitating increased security expenditure and changes to shift patterns. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. The concerns expressed by victims highlight how such offending transcends mere stock loss to incidence of lasting workplace unease. This dimension of harm – often underrepresented in discussions of acquisitive crime – deserves emphasis in the sentencing calculus. Regarding your criminal record, you are 34 years old and have six prior convictions for shoplifting, including one for a similar offence in 2021 which resulted in a conditional discharge. There is no evidence of gang affiliation or use of violence. The current pattern, however, reveals a persistent inclination to reoffend despite warnings and opportunities for diversion. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. This court is mindful of the plight of those who stumble into poverty, homelessness, or addiction, and acknowledges the social undercurrents that drive some offenders towards acquisitive acts. Nevertheless, courts must weigh such factors against the need to uphold public confidence and ensure proportionality. Further, the courts have been reminded by the Court of Appeal in R v. McMullan [2022] EWCA Crim 913, involving a defendant convicted of aggravated burglary, that while mental or social vulnerabilities may provide context, they cannot wholly mitigate culpability where the offending indicates continued disregard for legal boundaries. Though McMullan’s case involved a different offence class, the underlying principles remain instructive. It is instructive to recall that in R v. Gorringe [2019] EWCA Crim 302, a defendant involved in a shoplifting spree across six premises was sentenced to a custodial term despite pleas of poverty and mental health difficulties. The court there emphasised the need for sentences that reflect both personal circumstances and wider community protection, an approach embraced in sentencing decisions here. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. In addition to judicial precedent, this court has considered relevant sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council for theft offences (effective 2023). The guideline provides a framework that balances culpability, harm, previous convictions, and personal mitigation. It clearly sets higher starting points for persistent offending and flags the importance of victim impact, even in low-value theft situations. Equally, the guidance accommodates the scope for community orders enriched by rehabilitative requirements, particularly where mental health or substance misuse factors are involved. The Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangement (MAPPA) protocols recommend liaison where offenders pose medium to high risk; in your case, assessments do not elevate to such thresholds but recommend ongoing monitoring. While it might be tempting to dwell on procedural peculiarities, it must be stated that such discourse has no bearing on culpability or sentence. The delays occasioned by Legal Aid agency bureaucracy, the capacity constraints within the probation service, or the limited availability of community mental health resources are all extrinsic factors. They do little to obviate the seriousness or sustained nature of your offending. As to the wider context, it is regrettable that shops, and by extension communities, endure the cumulative deleterious effects of repeated theft. Such conduct raises insurance premiums and security costs, erodes employee confidence, and, in some unfortunate instances, hastens the closure of establishments that form vital social nodes. The role of justice is not merely to punish but to prevent such erosion through proportionate deterrence and rehabilitative effort. The court notes with some concern the recent trend in increased court listings for similar acquisitive offences, a phenomenon variously ascribed to social instability, economic pressure, and reductions in early diversion schemes. These factors paint a challenging backdrop for judicial administration and underscore the importance of clear, consistent sentencing standards. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. It must also be recorded that the victim personal statements submitted reflect a commendably measured and balanced tone, abstaining from hyperbole while clearly describing the real impact of your conduct. These statements merit respectful acknowledgement in sentencing. Your defence counsel has put forward compelling submissions on your difficult personal circumstances, including lack of stable accommodation and episodic unemployment. While such factors are regrettably common and may weigh as mitigation, they cannot eclipse accountability for repeated offending. The plea of guilty, while properly received, arrived late in the process, limiting its mitigating effect in accordance with authority. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. In light of the foregoing, this court intends to adjourn sentencing for receipt of the present pre-sentence report supplemented by any addenda arising from further enquiries into your attitudes, compliance, and practical circumstances. It is expected that the report will explore pathways for intervention, the feasibility of community orders with punitive and rehabilitative requirements, and the assessment of risk in relation to public protection. The court will consider the full range of available disposals, including fines, community service, and custodial sentences reserved for more serious or escalating behaviour. Where appropriate, restorative justice mechanisms may be examined, although their applicability depends on your genuine commitment to engagement. It is emphasised that sentencing decisions will also take account of the likely future risk posed by your conduct—both to retail businesses and the wider community—and the potential for desistance with the correct support framework. The court hopes that with appropriate interventions, the cycle of offending can be broken. These sentencing remarks are pronounced this 22nd day of September 2025 in Court 5 at Shepherd’s Bush Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript is available on application.
