Mr H Case No. T2025/13479 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. K. WAINWRIGHT Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H, you appear today for sentence following your conviction by plea for offences of theft by shoplifting, a breach of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct before the court pertains to a protracted period commencing in late 2023 and extending into the early months of this year, occurring across multiple retail establishments located within the Borough of Bromley and neighbouring districts. The nature of the offending involves repeated, deliberate acquisition of goods without payment, targeted predominantly at convenience stores, pharmacies, and small independent shops serving local communities. Procedural History You were initially arrested on 12 February 2025 after an investigation conducted by officers assigned to the Bromley Business Crime Unit, following a series of coordinated reports from shopkeepers and retail security officers alerting authorities to a discernible pattern of thefts occurring across multiple premises. It is notable that the investigation employed a combination of traditional patrol surveillance, covert observational deployments, and examination of digital evidence including CCTV recordings from venues throughout the borough. As is often the case in chronic acquisitive offending, the assembling of a complete evidential picture was a painstaking and resource-intensive process. Officers were required to collate and review in excess of 70 hours of recorded footage, many segments of which were obscured or suffered from time code discrepancies, compelling painstaking cross-referencing with till reports and statements from retail staff who, themselves, are frequently on precarious contracts with high turnover. It is important for the court to emphasise that the value of the stolen goods in isolation does not paint the full picture as to the gravity of such conduct. Persistent shoplifting at a community level exacts a cumulative toll on the integrity of local commerce, employee welfare, and the social fabric of the neighbourhoods affected. Retailers bear the costs of loss prevention measures, insurance premiums rise, and small businesses in particular face existential pressures. The Supreme Court in R v. Langford [2013] UKSC 12, while concerned with issues of sentencing methodology, underscored the broader societal impact of repeat offending, a principle that retains resonance here. Your initial police interview took place on 15 February 2025, during which you exercised your right to silence. However, subsequent forensic examination linked a scarf found on your person at the time of arrest to fibres recovered from the scene of one of the thefts. You were charged on 20 February 2025 with a single representative count of theft, to which you later entered a guilty plea at a plea and case management hearing held on 7 April 2025. The plea was late in the proceedings, a factor invariably relevant to the assessment of mitigation. The Court of Appeal has consistently enunciated, in cases such as R v. Umbers [2020] EWCA Crim 2653, the principle that credit for a guilty plea is principally attributed in recognition of the saving of court time, victim distress, and witness inconvenience; delayed pleas accordingly attract reduced discount. The late nature of your plea also occasioned the need for an additional trial preparation hearing due to the outstanding disclosure of ancillary reports. It must be noted, however, that the plea has brought about the earliest just resolution and relief for witnesses and victims. The Better Case Management scheme, under which this case was listed, aims to streamline such matters. The process here was broadly compliant, notwithstanding an adjournment necessitated by delays in obtaining Legal Aid authority to instruct a forensic psychologist to assist the defence. I record my regret at these delays, which are sadly emblematic of systemic failings within the administration of legal aid funding, particularly for expert assessments in cases involving potentially complex behavioural or psychiatric dimensions. The Legal Aid Agency’s procedural inertia continues to impose unnecessary burdens upon courts, defendants, and the broader justice system. It is illustrative that, despite multiple reminders and formal tribunal considerations, authorisation for defence expert instruction in your case was only granted some five weeks after initial application. Such bottlenecks are antithetical to the principles of timely justice as enshrined in the Criminal Procedure Rules and must be addressed by the appropriate authorities with urgency. It is also pertinent for the court to observe the context in which shoplifting offences occur today. There is a well-documented growth of street homelessness and rough sleeping in the London boroughs, with increasing numbers of individuals reliant upon cashless and informal economies to meet subsistence needs. The change in retail landscape, including widespread adoption of self-checkout technologies and diminished face-to-face staff presence, feeds into an environment in which opportunistic theft is both easier and, some assert, more psychologically detached. Nevertheless, this court cautions against any conflation of structural social issues with individual culpability. I acknowledge the valuable contributions made by various agencies in this case. Bromley Safer Neighbourhoods Team provided timely community impact reports, albeit constrained by the limited direct offender engagement. Additionally, Bromley Retailers Association submitted considered representations which articulate the prevailing anxieties and operational harms felt among local shopkeepers. Their efforts to lobby for increased police visibility and legislative reform in response to rising acquisitive crimes deserve commendation. Moreover, I note with gratitude the cooperation of the Bromley Recovery Trust, a voluntary sector organisation which supports persons with histories of substance misuse and homelessness. The Trust has been involved in providing counselling sessions to you over the preceding eighteen months, although, as per their latest correspondence, participation by you has been inconsistent and marked by intermittent disengagement. In this connection, the probation service has prepared a comprehensive pre-sentence report, which is duly before the court. The report documents your personal history, including a significant period of unstable housing, previous employment in manual labour, and a modest educational record. The officer notes that you have four prior convictions, all for shoplifting, dating from 2017 onward, including a community resolution disposed as recently as November 2023. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. The probation officer’s assessment highlights your evident difficulties with impulse control and financial management, emphasising a pattern of minimal engagement with support services until court intervention prompts more formalised involvement. The report references the current constraints within the Probation Service, including staffing shortages, which have impacted the regularity of contact, a phenomenon not unique to this jurisdiction. The psychiatric expert, Dr Melissa Campbell, who conducted a clinical assessment following instruction to address concerns around possible underlying neurodevelopmental conditions, offers a detailed analysis of your psychological state. The report notes the absence of major mental health pathology but identifies traits consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and emerging evidence of moderate substance dependence on alcohol. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. The report further notes that while there is some basis to consider treatment options, your previous engagement with such services has been sporadic at best, limiting their potential efficacy at this juncture. Dr Campbell reiterates the need for a joined-up approach, integrating community-based social and psychological support alongside any mandated interventions ordered by the court. Turning to legal precedent, the framework for sentencing theft offences, especially of this nature and scale, is principally guided by the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (2021). The offence level is primarily dictated by the value of goods taken, the sophistication or planning evident, any vulnerability of staff or victims, and the persistence or opportunistic nature of the conduct. In R v. Chatterjee [2022] EWCA Crim 1344, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence in a case of repeat shoplifting where the defendant deliberately manipulated store security measures and benefited from prior adult cautions. While the monetary value of the goods was relatively low, the repeated and planned nature of the offending, undertaken with a marked absence of remorse, led to an immediate custodial sentence of 9 months. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. By contrast, the case of R v. Okwodu [2023] EWCA Crim 2010 provides insight into the court’s approach where mental health or neurodevelopmental factors are found. There, whilst acknowledging the impact of the defendant’s diagnosed autism spectrum condition, the Court emphasised that the need for public protection and deterrence often prevails in matters of persistent acquisitive offending. Judges are admonished to balance therapeutic considerations with custodial requirements, particularly where offending patterns continue unabated despite prior interventions. I also refer respectfully to R v. Benton [2018] EWCA Crim 1573, which considered the role of the Better Case Management protocol in progressing complex cases involving multi-agency assessments. There, the Court observed that delays inherent to obtaining psychiatric input and social care preparedness may necessitate flexible timetabling, but judges should resist protracted adjournments absent compelling justification, lest victims and communities suffer from protracted uncertainty. The length of this offending period and the methodological consistency of your modus operandi, as described in evidence, evidence a deliberate pattern. Your active and conscious decision to reoffend after prior interventions, including community resolutions and warnings, is of particular concern. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. Furthermore, impact statements from victims and store managers relay the growing anxiety experienced by frontline retail workers, some of whom have altered their shifts, requested security enhancements, or taken stress-related leave. The emotional and economic consequences, while not immediately quantifiable, are a recognized aggravating factor. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. As the Court of Appeal confirmed in R v. Rennison [2020] EWCA Crim 1392, the effect on victim confidence, particularly for small business owners relying on community trade, must inform sentencing decisions in offence categories traditionally viewed as less serious. It has come to the court’s attention that your sister, whose statement was tendered at the recent hearing, expressed concern regarding your housing situation. The correspondence from the Bromley Housing Support Network outlines acute shortages in emergency accommodation for persons in your circumstances, exacerbated by the ongoing national housing crisis. These systemic difficulties, while real and pressing, constitute external factors beyond the ambit of judicial mitigation but may have a bearing on suitable rehabilitative measures. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. Additionally, I have reviewed letters submitted by the Bromley Soup Kitchen and the Crisis Assist charity, both emphasising your episodic engagement with their services but noting that sustained participation has been lacking. These organisations serve a vital role in the support network for vulnerable populations, often bridging welfare gaps left by official provision. Of note is a report from the Metropolitan Digital Forensics Unit, which, while tangential to your case, identified an unexpected volume of cyber-related crimes linked to addresses within the borough over recent years. It is well acknowledged that the police are increasingly stretched, balancing traditional crime detection with emergent digital threats, which include unauthorised data access and identity theft. While such matters do not directly implicate you, they exemplify the complex environment faced by modern law enforcement frontline services. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. Indeed, your arrest was part of a sequence of operations coordinated across the Bromley Division, which also included separate unrelated enquiries into fly-tipping offences on nearby greenbelt land — a case involving alleged environmental damage caused by unlawful disposal of builders’ waste. The continuity and breadth of these operations underscore the wide scope of contemporary policing duties, extending far beyond investment in traditional crime hotspots. It is also worth recording that a co-defendant in an unrelated arson prosecution currently remains at large, a fact brought to this court’s attention due to the occasional administrative cross-over in regional investigations. The arson case in question concerned damages to commercial property on the outskirts of Lewisham. While not pertinent to your conduct, such cases highlight the continuum of criminality that occupies the courts. The victims in your case have been entirely cooperative. Their statements reflect measured demeanour and a judicious understanding of the broader social issues at play. I express gratitude for their composure and willingness to engage with the justice process without succumbing to retributive outrage. Despite these circumstances, I must emphasise that the public interest in effective deterrence remains high. Judgments such as R v. Malek [2017] EWCA Crim 1745 make clear that custodial sentences are appropriate where there is evidence of repeated offending, planning, and disregard for prior interventions, notwithstanding mitigating factors relating to personal circumstances. I acknowledge, though, the point raised by defence submissions that custodial penalties should be reserved for offenders whose level of culpability and risk justify such measures. The court is aware of the harms caused by the overuse of imprisonment, including deleterious effects on accommodation, employment prospects, and mental health. That said, there is also a keen awareness of the risk of glorification or trivialisation of repeat shoplifting, as noted in R v. Tetlow [2021] EWCA Crim 907. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. The Court also takes account of the principle of parity and consistency in sentencing. This demands that sentences for similar offences, committed in similar circumstances, receive broadly comparable outcomes to ensure fairness and public confidence. The court has deemed it necessary to acquire a supplementary updated pre-sentence report, given recent disclosures from voluntary sector partners and the fluctuating nature of your balance between engagement and disengagement from support networks. This report, when received, will provide essential insight into your current circumstances, including any changes in accommodation, employment prospects, or psychological state. In the meantime, I commend the efforts of both prosecution and defence counsel for their professional and measured submissions during these proceedings. The case has been conducted with appropriate respect for the court and due consideration for judicial economy. Before concluding these remarks, it should be noted for the record that the Crown Court at Bromley underwent a recent refurbishment of its public and courtroom facilities as part of a wider initiative to modernise court estate infrastructure. Though unrelated to your case, such improvements serve to underpin the dignity and accessibility of the justice system for all participants, including defendants, victims, and the wider public. Similarly, I acknowledge the crucial role of court ushers and staff in maintaining order and ensuring proceedings run smoothly. Their work is often overlooked but forms the foundation of effective judicial administration. Finally, I would reiterate the collective strain that persistent acquisitive offending imposes on police resources, probation services, and social care agencies. The balancing act faced by these entities—managing demand with finite funding and personnel—must be recognised when considering sentencing outcomes designed to mitigate future risk. It is against this complex factual and procedural matrix that I will adjourn sentencing to allow the probation service sufficient time to deliver its updated report, and for any further relevant material relating to your personal circumstances to be prepared and considered.
