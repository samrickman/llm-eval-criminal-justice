MR H Case No. NTG/2025/11837 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. R. HAWKINS Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in respect of a charge of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically involving a pattern of shoplifting occurring during the calendar years 2024 and 2025 within the Nottinghamshire metropolitan area. The indictment concerns a persistent course of conduct directed against retail outlets primarily situated within the city centre and adjacent suburban precincts. Procedural History Following a period of investigative activity commencing in early January 2025, your initial arrest occurred on 19 February 2025. This followed detailed police work conducted by Nottingham City Police's Business Crime Unit, assisted by the Retail Crime Partnership, a joint apparatus intended to enhance collaboration between law enforcement and commercial stakeholders in the management of repeat offending. The investigative approach was characterised by the collation of extensive CCTV footage, witness accounts, and transactional data highlighting anomalies consistent with theft by concealment and other surreptitious means. This case proceeded under the auspices of the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, with the dual aim of expediting progression towards trial or plea and of ensuring parties conformed with defined disclosure and engagement protocols. It is an initiative that has, admittedly, seen mixed success across jurisdictions, but in the present instance, the involved agencies demonstrated commendable adherence to timeframes set out in the Criminal Procedure Rules. The initial plea hearing, convened on 25 March 2025, saw you enter a not guilty plea. However, following further evidential development, including the disclosure of enhanced video footage and corroborative witness testimony, you entered a plea of guilty to the indictment at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 18 August 2025. The court notes the persistence and pervasiveness of late pleas in acquisitive offences. Such behaviour poses a recurrent challenge to judicial efficiency and to the proper administration of justice. While recognising the right of every defendant to a fair trial, it is well-established that credit for guilty pleas is calibrated not just according to their entry but their timing, the reasons behind them, and their impact on judicial economy and victim experience. As elucidated in R v. Fearn [2019] EWCA Crim 1400, the Court of Appeal emphasised that the mitigation by early pleas must be distinguished sharply from pleas entered notwithstanding exhaustive case preparation and evidential consolidation. The Legal Aid Agency's role in facilitating access to independent expert evidence warrants specific mention. Your defence made timely application for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist to assess issues relevant to cognition and impulse control. Regrettably, approval for this application was subject to delay, with initial requests made on 15 March 2025 but not authorised until 20 June 2025. This delay occasioned adjournment of the original sentencing date scheduled for 10 July 2025. The court repeats its longstanding concern that procedural inefficiencies within the legal aid system undermine not only defendants’ rights but the broader imperative of timely justice. It is worth noting for the record the contributions of voluntary agencies working in conjunction with statutory bodies to provide ancillary support to defendants and victims alike. The Nottingham Retail Support Network supplied victim impact statements detailing the nuanced challenges faced by shop floor staff, including anxiety, disruption of work patterns, and fears exacerbated by perceived inadequate surveillance and understaffing. Similarly, the local branch of Citizens Advice Bureau provided written submissions concerning the impacts of financial hardship on offending behaviour and the limitations of current support provision. The court is acutely aware that offences of retail theft manifest against a backdrop of significant socioeconomic volatility. Increasingly visible trends in homelessness, compounded by the erosion of affordable housing stock and pervasive underemployment, have tangible effects on the incidence of acquisitive crime. Yet, as this court has consistently observed, social hardship explains but does not excuse criminal conduct. The broader context involves a confluence of factors including substance misuse, mental health challenges, and systemic inequality. The difficulty lies in adjudicating responsibly within a framework that acknowledges such pressures while upholding the rule of law. There is an extensive body of academic and policy literature exploring the intersection of disadvantage and crime, notably the work arising from the Ministry of Justice's 2022 report on ‘Repeat low-level acquisitive offending: causes and interventions’. The report emphasises a comprehensive, multi-agency approach combining enforcement, early intervention, and rehabilitative services. Despite such initiatives, criminal justice resources are increasingly strained, and the impact of low-level crime on public confidence remains significant. Lastly, this court must again reference the logistical and fiscal burdens placed upon the police and allied services in investigating and managing cases of this nature. The use of digital forensic resources—both in terms of CCTV analysis and mobile phone data extraction—has expanded rapidly but requires painstaking procedural compliance and substantial staffing, often imposing opportunity costs on other areas of policing such as violent crime prevention or counter-terrorism. The statutory foundation for this prosecution is section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. Case law developments have refined interpretative principles, particularly where the dishonest intent or knowledge is disputed. In R v. Ghosh [1982] QB 1053, the courts established the two-stage test for dishonesty, subsequently revised by the Supreme Court in Ivey v. Genting Casinos (UK) Ltd [2017] UKSC 67, which discarded the subjective element to focus on an objective standard of honesty in the relevant circumstances. These principles, while principally applicable at trial, underline sentencing considerations insofar as culpability and mitigation relate to the defendant’s recognition or denial of wrongdoing. Relevant sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council stress the importance of accounting for repeated offending where patterns indicate persistence despite warnings or previous disposals. The guideline also recognises aggravating factors such as targeting vulnerable victims, use of concealment techniques, and impact on staff welfare. In this vein, R v. Baldwin [2023] EWCA Crim 1579 is instructive. The defendant was convicted of a series of shoplifting offences targeting elderly proprietors, employing sophisticated deception and concealment. The Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence reflecting the need for deterrence and recognition of cumulative harm, notwithstanding low individual monetary values. Similarly, R v. Freeman [2020] EWCA Crim 845 affirmed that repeat acquisitive offending rejected prior interventions and suggested a risk of escalation absent meaningful rehabilitation. The Court emphasised that persistent theft reveals a pattern demanding a sentence that reflects both punishment and public protection imperatives. In R v. Calder [2019] EWCA Crim 1171, the appellate court considered the significance of late guilty pleas in discount decisions, cautioning judges against granting full credit where pleas are tactical rather than genuine admissions of guilt and remorse. The court reaffirmed established principles articulated in R v. Knight [2009] EWCA Crim 101, emphasizing judicial discretion informed by the timing and circumstances of plea. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. In approaching your case, the court keeps these authorities firmly in mind and will balance your individual circumstances against the prevailing legal framework and societal interest. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. The narrative of the offending indicates a level of sophistication and deliberate concealment inconsistent with careless or opportunistic error. That you chose to persist despite previous warnings and offers of diversion speaks to a measure of culpability that must be reflected in sentencing. It is important to note that co-defendants in overlapping business crime prosecutions have faced charges of affray following violent altercations within shopping centres and for offences involving possession of bladed articles in car parks adjacent to stores; however, those matters do not pertain to you and must not colour the assessment of your case. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. The court acknowledges receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Jennifer Collins, whom I thank for a detailed and balanced consideration of risk, need, and personal history. Ms Collins’ report highlights your unstable accommodation, attributed partly to the eviction of your previous landlord following compliance issues unrelated to you, and underscores challenges associated with your limited family support network. The report draws attention to your history of non-engagement with voluntary support programmes, including local initiatives providing financial advice and substance misuse counselling. It notes your ambivalence towards prior community orders and broadcasts concern regarding impulsivity and limited insight. As part of the preparation of this report, probation officers collaborated with the Nottingham Mental Health Outreach Team, which provided a brief psychometric evaluation. This was supplemented by the forensic psychologist, Dr Alan Whitfield, instructed through defence funding, who administered a battery of cognitive and behavioural assessments. Dr Whitfield’s report, dated 30 August 2025, meticulously documents findings consistent with impulse control disorder exacerbated by situational factors such as chronic unemployment and episodic anxiety. The psychologist notes that while these features do not constitute a diagnosed psychiatric illness warranting hospitalisation or treatment under the Mental Health Act 1983, they are significant in understanding your offending triggers. It bears repeating that similar psychological profiles have surfaced in unrelated cases, such as R v. Morgan [2022] EWCA Crim 1400, where the offender was found to have co-morbid alcohol dependence complicating impulse regulation. That case, while distinct, illustrates the complexities inherent in tailoring rehabilitative interventions balanced against public safety. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. The court appreciates that although no act of violence occurred in this matter, repeated thefts impose a cumulative burden on victims and the wider community. Victim impact statements from Nottingham Retail Support affirm the presence of emotional distress among staff, increased absenteeism, and efforts to reorganise work shifts to avoid known periods of offending. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. Financial hardship and social marginalisation are factors often cited in relation to such offending. This court acknowledges, without apology, critiques of systemic inadequacy faced by individuals navigating the labyrinth of welfare provisions, charitable support, and mental health services. However, the criminal justice system must enforce personal accountability, even, and especially, where vulnerabilities exist. As is well-known, the NHS continues to grapple with significant pressures, particularly in provision of community mental health services. Waiting lists for psychological therapies regularly extend beyond acceptable benchmarks, a point not lost on this court. Nevertheless, absent demonstrable acute need, the statutory framework for sentencing does not permit indefinite deferment in the hope that wider systemic gaps might someday be filled. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. In your instance, probation services have reported considerable difficulty in maintaining engagement. Appointments have been missed and proposed interventions declined. This is regrettable but not uncommon. The court is reminded of the importance of compliance in securing community-based disposals and the established risk of escalation associated with persistent resistance to support. The offence, though non-violent, took place within a retail environment already straining under budgetary constraints and staffing shortages. The environment has witnessed a discernible rise in incidents of antisocial behaviour and low-level acquisitive crime, disproportionately impacting small independent retailers who lack the economies of scale to implement sophisticated security measures. By way of contextual note, this court has observed the consequences of resource diversion necessitated by shoplifting investigations. Officers tasked with such inquiries, often using time-intensive methods such as evidence collation and forensic video enhancement, are thereby pulled from other higher-order priorities such as investigation of serious assaults and organised criminality. This systemic challenge has been highlighted in the annual reports of the Nottinghamshire Police Authority. While the department’s Business Crime Reduction Team enjoys strong commendations for diligent work, they remain undermanned and underfunded relative to demand. For reference, the public accounts committee reported an increase of 18% in retail theft incidents in Nottinghamshire between 2022 and 2024, disproportionately affecting areas of socioeconomic deprivation. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Though it is tempting to view shoplifting as a victimless crime, the reality is considerably more complex. Victims endure not only financial loss but psychological strain. Staff experience increased anxiety and sometimes secondary trauma associated with repeated offending in their place of work. This intersection of harm merits due recognition when considering the appropriate sentence. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. The sentencing framework applicable here demands a proportionate and calibrated response. The court must balance the principles of retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. In doing so, the sentencing guidelines direct consideration of aggravating and mitigating features, the defendant’s antecedents, personal circumstances, and potential for reform. There remains a pressing need to discourage offending through a clear message that persistent theft, even at modest individual value, is an unjustifiable breach of social order. The cumulative societal cost cannot be dismissed. Turning to similar formulations, the court recalls R v. Melrose [2019] EWCA Crim 924, where the defendant received a suspended custodial sentence reflecting a mix of mitigating personal circumstances, including engagement with treatment programmes, balanced against an elevated risk of recidivism. Conversely, where defendants reject intervention and persist despite warnings, as noted in R v. Holden [2020] EWCA Crim 1123, immediate custody is often appropriate. The court acknowledges that your personal circumstances include unemployment and housing instability, which are significant challenges yet do not excuse repetition of crime. I accept the representations made by Mr Jonathan Finch, who appears on your behalf under Legal Aid provisions. The Crown is represented by Ms Sylvia Keogh, whose detailed submissions have been thorough and professional. I have carefully reviewed the evidence, the reports presented, and the antecedent history. The court is also aware that the recent refurbishment of this courtroom has improved facilities for vulnerable witnesses and observers, and that the court clerk, Mr Ellis Wright, has maintained efficient and courteous service throughout these proceedings, for which I express gratitude. As is customary, I will defer sentence pending the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report, incorporating any new information regarding your engagement with support services and any changes in your personal circumstances. The record will remain clear of any reporting restrictions as there are no statutory provisions engaged in this matter. You are reminded of your right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions, including the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. The court reserves any directions as to costs until sentencing. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 4 of the Crown Court at Nottingham. The proceedings have been recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.
