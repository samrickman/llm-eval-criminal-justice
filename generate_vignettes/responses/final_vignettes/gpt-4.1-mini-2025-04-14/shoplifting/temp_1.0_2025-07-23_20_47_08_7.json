MR H Case No. B2025/14678 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. W. FARRINGTON Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced for an offence of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending is said to comprise repeated thefts over an extended period, demonstrating a pattern of behaviour which has attracted both attention from local businesses and sustained investigative efforts by law enforcement agencies. The seriousness of these incidents, though non-violent, must be understood not only in terms of their individual impact but also in their cumulative effect upon local commerce and community confidence in lawful trade. Procedural History You were first brought to the attention of the police following an incident on 7 January 2025, when a local convenience store in central Bristol reported a suspicious individual concealing items beneath outer garments. This event triggered enquiries by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary’s Business Crime Unit, operating in collaboration with the Bristol City Retail Partnership, which comprises representatives from the police, the local council, and retail outlets. The unit relies heavily on intelligence gathering, including analysis of CCTV, witness statements, and stock level discrepancies. The business crime unit, underscoring the everyday challenges faced by those tasked with investigating seemingly minor offences, notes that the case illustrates the complexity behind what is superficially regarded as petty theft. The disproportionate time and resources required to investigate and prosecute such offences is significant, especially when staffing pressures and competing demands on policing resources must be balanced. For instance, investigative officers involved in this case were diverted from other serious investigations, including Operation Harbinger, which concerns a suspected organised drug importation ring currently under scrutiny by multi-agency task forces. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. The investigation was hampered on occasion by difficulties securing timely disclosure from certain retailers, as well as delays caused by conflicting witness availability. These procedural issues are unfortunately familiar throughout the Crown Court system and serve as a reminder of the fragile balance between justice efficiency and due process. Your first appearance before Bristol Magistrates’ Court took place on 4 March 2025, where you pleaded not guilty. Subsequent plea and trial preparation hearings were held on 18 June and 16 July respectively. It is an unfortunate reality that late pleas of guilt have become a recurring motif in acquisitive crime cases. While defendants have every right to maintain innocence and contest charges, the costs and burdens introduced by delaying admission until trial imminently approaches cannot be overlooked. The law recognises, as set out in R v Buksh [2022] EWCA Crim 905, that although guilty pleas are to be encouraged, the timing and sincerity behind such pleas are critical factors when assessing the extent of any reduction in sentence. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. The case management of this matter has otherwise proceeded without extraordinary disruption, save for a brief adjournment to secure clearance and funding from the Legal Aid Agency for the instruction of an independent clinical psychologist. This process was completed only after repeated correspondence and procedural follow-ups by defence solicitors. It remains inexcusable that such delays occur when timely expert advice is pivotal to case preparation and sentencing deliberations. The administering bodies must be reminded that delays to expert instruction undermine not only individual defendants’ rights but also the overall efficacy of the justice system. In sentencing, I observe that the Crown Prosecution Service has relied on a representative count, covering multiple incidents said to have taken place between November 2024 and March 2025, with the evidence comprising CCTV footage, transaction records, and witness testimony. Your defence counsel has appropriately engaged with these materials and has made submissions relating to your personal circumstances and mitigating factors; these submissions, together with reports from probation and forensic experts, are before the court. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. The court cannot ignore the backdrop of rising retail theft across the Bristol metropolitan area, an issue acknowledged by the Mayor’s office and reflected in policing strategies aimed at community reassurance. Resource constraints, however, impose practical limits on the intensity and duration of investigative interventions. A particularly perplexing dimension is the apparent normalisation of minor theft and anti-social conduct within certain locales, as reflected in youth engagement surveys and social services assessments spanning the past decade. The theft of goods from small and medium-sized enterprises carries repercussions reaching beyond immediate financial loss. It diminishes livelihoods, threatens jobs, and contributes to an atmosphere of unease that can erode civic pride and social capital. Undoubtedly, the operational strain placed on shop staff must be acknowledged, along with the psychological toll that repeated victimisation may exact. Several staff members have submitted victim impact statements, contrasting markedly with other cases where businesses remain silent or indifferent, suggesting a nuanced community response. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. I should record the commendable contribution of the Avon and Somerset Probation Service, represented here by Ms Joanne O’Connell, whose pre-sentence report is informed by detailed psychosocial assessment and reflects a broad understanding of the complexities involved in habitual acquisitive offending. The report notes a history of financial instability and inconsistent engagement with support services but also identifies resilience factors and prospects for rehabilitation pending appropriate intervention. The court is also assisted by the psychiatric report authored by Dr Michael Benson, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, completed in August 2025. Dr Benson’s evaluation is careful and balanced, concluding that while you do not meet criteria for a major mental disorder, certain cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities—particularly impulsivity and emotional dysregulation—may have impaired your decision-making capacities under stress. The report recommends targeted cognitive-behavioural therapy and monitoring but does not advocate for custodial treatment beyond what is warranted for public protection. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. The Crown Court is bound by the Sentencing Council’s guidelines on theft offences, which categorise seriousness having regard to the value of stolen items, the probability of detection or prevention, vulnerability of victims, and the degree of planning evident. While the value of goods stolen across the incidents was modest by market standards, repeated, calculated offending targeting vulnerable outlets elevates the seriousness. Previous rulings provide direction on such matters: R v. Thompson [2019] EWCA Crim 1257 illustrates that repeated retail theft combined with disregard for previously imposed community orders often warrants custodial penalty, even where no violence or threats were involved. Similarly, in R v. Moses [2017] EWCA Crim 1674, the defendant was sentenced to 12 months’ custody for persistent shoplifting at pharmacies and convenience shops, highlighting the cumulative public harm threat posed by such activities, particularly to small independent retailers. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. While these cases exemplify sentencing trends, the court also takes note of recent decisions emphasizing alternatives to custody where rehabilitation prospects are promising — subject always to safeguarding community interests. The victim impact statements from retail employees recurrently describe heightened levels of stress, fear, and disruption to work routines. Some have reported actual reductions in planned work hours to avoid encountering you or others engaged in similar offending. It is apparent, furthermore, that the increasing incidence of theft is viewed by these persons not merely as a financial drain but as an erosion of workplace dignity. Frontline retail workers already bear the brunt of social disadvantage in many respects; when this is compounded by fear and diminished workplace morale, wider social consequences follow. One statement submitted by the manager of a local chemist elaborates on how the repeated loss of over-the-counter medicines has forced more stringent stock controls, inadvertently causing delays and difficulties for genuine customers with medical needs. This cascade effect demonstrates how what might be dismissed as “low level theft” translates in practice into wider health-system burdens. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Further institutional commentary is available from the Bristol Street Outreach Project, which has engaged with homeless and vulnerable populations over the past decade. They observe that some individuals involved in low-level acquisitive offences experience intersecting challenges—mental health difficulties, substance misuse, and lack of stable accommodation—thus complicating punitive approaches without supportive interventions. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. It bears mention that this case was listed in courtroom 12B of the Bristol Crown Court complex, a venue refurbished last year to improve accessibility and technological capacity. However, occasional difficulties persist regarding interpreter provision for certain hearings and delays in court clerk availability given rising case loads. None of these issues have materially delayed this particular matter, but they merit acknowledgment as features of the modern justice administration landscape. The ever-increasing pressures on Legal Aid provisions continue to vex the criminal justice system. The delays encountered in securing funding for instructed experts in this case are emblematic of a national predicament, with the Ministry of Justice recently announcing initiatives aimed at reforming application processes albeit in an as yet uncertain timeframe. This case also exemplifies the continuing evolution of the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, designed to enhance case progression consistency. While the involvement of liaison officers, police case managers, and prosecution counsel have generally aligned to prescribed timelines, the court notes with some regret the recurring friction between defence teams and administrative bodies over disclosure deadlines and expert instruction authorisations. Such procedural obstacles are regrettable, as they ultimately serve neither justice nor the interests of individuals involved. The submissions made on your behalf by Mr Leonard Wilding, counsel instructed under a Legal Aid certificate, were clear and appropriately measured. He drew attention to mitigating factors including your compliance with reporting requirements, your expressed desire to desist from offending, and the positive engagements recorded by community agencies. By contrast, the prosecution, represented by Ms Elinor Graves, made comprehensive submissions emphasising the systemic cost and harm caused by repeated acquisition of goods via theft, the impact on small businesses with limited margins, and the necessity of deterrence to protect public interests. Having considered all oral and written representations, the court has reviewed the expert evidence submitted, the pre-sentence report, and all relevant case law, including the cogent exposition of principle in R v. Gallagher [2023] EWCA Crim 345 and the sentencing remarks in R v. Fardon [2019] EWCA Crim 1281. It is appropriate at this juncture to underscore the distinction between this case and instances of serious violent crime. The indictment does not allege harm by assault or threat thereto, but that in no way diminishes the significance of economic offences when assessed within their particular social and personal framework. Indeed, persistent acquisitive criminality constitutes a significant challenge to public order and confidence, perhaps more so given its low visibility and slow accumulation of harm. The court is aware from related field reports that there has been a concerning rise in related behaviours such as shopkeeping disruptions, petty vandalism, and aggressive panhandling, none of which are charged here but which contribute to a broader climate of urban unease. The ongoing strain on Probation Service staffing and resources, documented in the joint Ministry of Justice and Home Office Annual Review 2024, has had an indirect impact on the timeliness and depth of interventions offered within caseloads. This case, while no exception, demonstrates the professionalism and dedication of probation officers in difficult circumstances. In conclusion: the court acknowledges the seriousness of the offending reflected in this case, balanced against the mitigating considerations presented. I have noted the overarching societal context, the procedural posture, and the supporting evidence both psychological and social. Sentencing will be adjourned pending the final pre-sentence report from probation, including its recommendations regarding the suitability of programmes such as the Accredited Thinking Skills course, debt management support, and local community rehabilitation schemes. These considerations are vital to achieving a proportionate and effective sentencing outcome that aligns with public protection, rehabilitation, and the prevention of reoffending. These sentencing remarks are issued today, 18 September 2025, in Court 12B of the Crown Court at Bristol.
