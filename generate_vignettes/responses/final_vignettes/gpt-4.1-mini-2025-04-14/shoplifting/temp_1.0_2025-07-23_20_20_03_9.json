MR H Case No. W2025/17456 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge N. M. CLARKE Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court following a conviction for theft by shoplifting, as charged under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences span a period extending from mid-2023 to early 2025 and involve a series of thefts from commercial outlets within the Westminster area. Procedural Background Your initial appearance occurred on 7 May 2025 before the magistrates’ court, where you entered a not guilty plea. The case was subsequently transferred to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) provisions, designed to ensure more effective case preparation and scheduling. The BCM regime, instituted following the recommendations set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, aims to reduce delays and improve the disposal of cases by setting rigid timetables and compelling early disclosure. That this process functioned with reasonable efficiency in your case is noted, given the notorious administrative delays which frequently beset similar matters, particularly in the acquisitive crime jurisdiction. An early procedural hearing was held on 30 June 2025, during which counsel for both prosecution and defence made representations as to case progression and the necessity of certain expert reports, including a psychiatric evaluation to assess any neuropsychological or behavioural components contributing to your offending. It is regrettable, however, that the timeliness of the psychiatric referral was adversely affected by delays within the Legal Aid funding approval system, reflecting wider systemic issues that have recently been the subject of judicial and parliamentary scrutiny. The matter was listed for sentence in this sitting after you entered a plea of guilty at the first available opportunity before trial. Your admission is noted, but I remind all concerned that the timing and nature of the plea will be factored into any credit to be afforded under sentencing guidelines. It is appropriate here to reflect upon the broader context in which retail theft cases like yours are heard. Despite being often dismissed in popular discourse as “low level” or “victimless,” these offences carry significant implications — both for individual victims, including shop staff who frequently endure intimidation, and for the public purse, where escalating costs arise from exhaustive police investigations, forensic processing, and court resources. Your conduct is by no means exceptional in this regard but partakes of a regrettably frequent pattern. There are noteworthy examples of extensive judicial commentary on the gravity of acquisitive crime. In R v. Henderson [2019] EWCA Crim 839, the appellate court emphasised that repeat offending, especially where it evidences planning and sophistication, warrants sentences that reflect both deterrence and denunciation. Although Henderson dealt principally with fraudulent document offences, the principles of proportionality and public protection are readily transferrable. Similarly, the Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Wainwright [2021] EWCA Crim 1210, concerning a series of shop thefts involving multimodal deception techniques (such as concealing goods on the person and manipulating electronic self-checkouts), underlines the importance of recognising the psychological impact on victims, including the erosion of their sense of safety at work — a factor this court considers particularly salient. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. The case law around mitigating factors in theft offences also merits brief mention. The sentence reductions for early guilty pleas, pursuant to the Sentencing Guideline Council’s principles, hinge not only on the act of pleading but the timing relative to trial preparation. An eleventh-hour plea may garner only limited credit, as demonstrated in R v. Coleman [2020] EWCA Crim 1045, a case involving multiple counts of shoplifting wherein the appellant sought substantial mitigation despite contesting the charges until the day of trial. The court held that credit is a matter of judicial discretion guided by the overarching need to serve justice fairly to victims and maintain procedural economy. The facts of your offending are detailed in the indictment and have been examined thoroughly during the trial preparation phase. It is important to record the significant efforts made by the enforcement agencies, particularly the Westminster Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose coordination with local officers and store security teams has been instrumental in gathering evidence. The partnership’s ongoing liaison, unfortunately, illustrates the resource-intensive nature of combating acquisitive crime. This court is grateful for their contributions and the cooperation of numerous retail staff providing victim personal statements that highlight the ripple effects of theft beyond immediate financial loss. It is necessary to draw attention to external pressures that increasingly affect frontline policing and judicial resources. The Metropolitan Police Service has reported, in recent internal strategy documents, a marked rise in shoplifting incidents over the past three years, correlated with increasing economic hardship and the proliferation of organised acquisitive crime groups operating covertly across London boroughs. These trends place additional strain on police units, whose limited personnel must balance responses between acquisitive offences, violent crime, and public order incidents. Similarly, the judiciary must grapple with rising caseloads, often involving defendants with complex vulnerabilities, which complicate the sentencing process. The NHS’s crisis in mental health provision also indirectly impacts the justice system. Long waiting lists and limited access to specialist services mean that defendants exhibiting impulsive or compulsive behaviours — sometimes linked to underlying psychiatric conditions such as kleptomania or mood disorders — may not receive timely intervention. Expert reports commissioned in such cases must be thorough and painstaking, but delays are regrettably common owing to systemic under-resourcing. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. Such professional assessments, while helpful, must be treated with due care. The fact that a report notes mild to moderate impulsivity or low emotional regulation does not diminish the imperative for personal responsibility. The courts acknowledge vulnerability but do not accept it as carte blanche for criminal behaviour. It is also worth noting the welcome incorporation of trauma-informed practice into contemporary probation services. Officers are trained to discern patterns of behaviour informed by early adverse experiences or social deprivation, recognising that such contexts may influence offending pathways. However, this understanding serves rehabilitation and risk management, not exculpation. The pre-sentence report prepared by the probation officer assigned to your case highlights several points of concern, including a history of unstable accommodation, periods of periodic employment interspersed with unemployment, and a lack of sustained engagement with support services offered by community agencies. Written representations submitted by the Westminster Homelessness Outreach Consortium commend efforts made to re-engage you in relevant programmes, albeit with limited success to date. In particular, a letter from Ms Jenna Morales, a caseworker with the consortium, emphasises the challenges posed by competing priorities, including mental health management and substance use. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. It must be observed, with some regret, that the acceptance of assistance aimed at addressing contributory factors to offending is often sporadic and fragmented. This impedes rehabilitation and prolongs the risk posed to both the individual and the wider community. Historical case law offers some perspective. In R v. Berryman [2016] EWCA Crim 1120, the Court of Appeal held that while compassion should inform sentencing, it cannot undermine public protection. That case concerned a defendant with a diagnosed personality disorder committing multiple thefts, some accompanied by aggression. The court stressed that therapeutic measures must be balanced against deterrent effect and societal expectations. The current legal framework, as set out in the Sentencing Council guideline for theft offences, requires the court to weigh culpability, harm, the antecedents of the defendant, the timing of pleas, and mitigating or aggravating factors including the impact on victims. In addressing harm, I must underscore the evidence given by shop managers and staff affected by your conduct. While no direct physical harm occurred, the psychological burden — feelings of vulnerability, stress, and diminished safety at work — is well documented. These matters, while not amounting to injury, are nevertheless real and enduring. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. It is a truth seldom remarked upon outside courtroom walls that even minor acts of dishonesty compound into significant social costs. Retailers report losses not only of stock but of staff morale, greater security expenses, and, in some cases, business closures. The latter phenomenon, rarely the subject of media attention, carries considerable ramifications for employment and community cohesion. Adjunct to this, the court has received and reviewed observations from the Retail Industry Federation, highlighting the challenges faced by independent retailers compared to large chains, especially in lower-income areas. These contributions form part of the evidence base informing appropriate sentencing, acknowledging the particular vulnerability of smaller enterprises. Additional procedural elements of this case deserve mention. The hearing today is the product of multiple adjournments necessitated by a variety of factors, including defence applications to obtain further expert opinion, and administrative processing delays within the Legal Aid Agency. Such delays, though understandable in context, underscore the tensions between adequate client representation and the efficient administration of justice. Furthermore, the case was temporarily complicated by a separate public order incident in this court venue, leading to a postponement of the earlier hearing, reflecting the sometimes unpredictable nature of courtroom management. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. The court notes your personal history comprises previous convictions for theft-related offences, albeit none involving violence or sophisticated fraud. These prior offences have resulted in community sentences and a conditional discharge. The present matter, therefore, reveals a pattern of recidivism, albeit of a non-violent and relatively low monetary value scale. From the probation perspective, concern remains that, notwithstanding these interventions, your offending continued — suggesting a need for a calibrated but firm judicial response. It is also relevant to record that you maintain sporadic contact with immediate family members, one of whom has been involved in unrelated criminal proceedings for benefit fraud. While such associations may affect social support networks, they do not in themselves mitigate culpability. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. There are, of course, wider societal considerations. The general rise in street homelessness, and consequent increase in vulnerable persons resorting to shoplifting to meet basic needs, cannot be ignored in our current economic climate. Public policy debates continue as to optimal approaches, balancing compassion with deterrence. This court is cognisant of these ongoing dialogues, though its role remains to enforce the law as enacted. To digress briefly, the court has been made aware of the establishment of a newly constituted “Retail Crime Tactical Unit” within the Metropolitan Police, tasked with improving intelligence sharing between store security, local police teams, and judicial entities. The effectiveness of this initiative will likely be the subject of future reviews. Similarly, reforms to the Protective Custody framework and initiatives on bail management have been under discussion at the Ministry of Justice, with the intention of reducing unnecessary custodial remands in cases of low-level acquisitive crime. Returning to your case, expert psychiatric opinion by Dr Mallory Addison — a consultant forensic psychiatrist — was sought to evaluate the presence of any impulse control disorders or underlying neuropathology. Her report, rendered comprehensively and in accordance with contemporary medico-legal standards, found no evidence of a major psychiatric illness. However, it notes personality traits consistent with impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, presenting potential risks for reoffending without targeted intervention. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The pre-sentence report recommends consideration of a comprehensive supervision order, incorporating cognitive behavioural therapy modules designed for acquisitive offenders, coupled with substance misuse treatment if indicated. Given your history and prevailing circumstances, the probation service suggests such an approach could offer benefits both for rehabilitation and for public safety. Finally, the court is mindful of the principle articulated in the Sentencing Council guideline: that sentences must be just, proportionate, and informed by all relevant factors. While your culpability is moderate and the offence lacks violence or significant financial impact, the persistence and pattern of offending weigh heavily. I note also your personal circumstances, including periods of unstable housing and limited employment prospects. The court acknowledges the efforts of local voluntary agencies who have engaged with you and urge continued participation. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. Sentencing options are under active consideration. There is a range of possible disposals, from community orders with rehabilitative conditions, to suspended custodial sentences, and in appropriate circumstances, immediate custody. Before imposing sentence, the court will receive a full, up-to-date pre-sentence report incorporating probation risk assessments, any fresh psychiatric or psychological evaluations, and representations on behalf of all parties. It is therefore ordered that sentence be adjourned to a date to be fixed following the court’s receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report. This is to ensure that the response here is measured, just, and tailored to reduce the risks of reoffending and promote compliance. These sentencing remarks have been given today, 15 September 2025, in Court 5 at Westminster Crown Court. The proceedings are transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5, ensuring a full and accurate record. The defendant is informed of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days in accordance with the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions ordered pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved, pending final sentencing.
