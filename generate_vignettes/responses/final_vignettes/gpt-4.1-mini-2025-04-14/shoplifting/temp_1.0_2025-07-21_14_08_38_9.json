MR H Case No. B2025/14062 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. CARMICHAEL Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of charges brought under the Theft Act 1968, specifically concerning offences of shoplifting. The charges reflect a repeated pattern of offending over a protracted period, involving several retail establishments across Brighton and nearby coastal towns. The indictment, though formally a single representative count, encapsulates conduct spanning from early 2023 through to April of this year. Procedural and Contextual Background The court notes the procedural journey that this case has followed, occasioned in part by the complexities often attendant upon multi-site acquisitive offending. You were first apprehended on 13 May 2025 after an intelligence-led operation by the Sussex Retail Crime Task Force, supported by various multi-agency partners, including the Sussex Police Digital Investigation Unit and local council community safety officers. This investigation, protracted and resource intensive, drew upon an array of evidence types including digital recordings, transaction histories, and mobile device data secured under judicial authorization. What merits recording at the outset is the manner in which cases such as this give rise to extended investigative and prosecutorial demands disproportionate to the apparent scale of individual incidents. That is in no way a reflection on the probity or dedication of the agencies concerned; indeed, these bodies are to be commended for their ongoing vigilance. Nevertheless, the pursuit of repeated low-value thefts, albeit cumulatively significant, places real strain upon public resources already stretched across numerous competing demands — from tackling serious violent crime to attending to cyber-enabled fraud. The deployment of officers and analysts to canvass hours of CCTV footage, cross-reference duty rosters, and process evidential exhibits is considerable. In considering your case, I must also observe the broader social and economic milieu in which such offending occurs. The phenomenon of acquisitive crime intersects with and is influenced by factors including economic deprivation, unstable housing, substance misuse, and limited access to welfare support. These factors do not mitigate culpability but provide important context in informing the court’s approach to sentencing and rehabilitative opportunity. It should be noted that delays in the progress of the case have occurred, attributable in part to procedural adjournments and, regrettably, obstacles within the Legal Aid system. Defence counsel experienced protracted waits for funding authorizations to instruct a forensic psychologist and to obtain a detailed pre-sentence report, a regrettably frequent occurrence that impedes timely resolution. The court trusts that systemic improvements will be forthcoming to reduce such impediments. The case was listed initially for trial on 7 August 2025, following a plea and trial preparation hearing in June at which you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequent evidence, including additional CCTV material and procurement of digital records, precipitated your change of plea to guilty on 28 August, mere days before the scheduled contested hearing. The timing of your change of plea is pertinent to the issue of credit for guilty pleas. It is regrettable but not uncommon that defendants choose to delay acceptance of responsibility until overwhelming evidence is placed before them. The Court of Appeal has consistently held that while credit is appropriate for guilty pleas, the degree of discount reflects the timing and the degree of cooperation from the outset. See R v. Hawkins [2023] EWCA Crim 2174 and R v. Milton [2024] EWCA Crim 503. In setting out these remarks, I have had the benefit of written submissions from Ms Emma Walcott, representing the Crown, who has ably presented the aggravating features relating to the persistence and planning in your offending. I also acknowledge submissions made by Mr Oliver Dyer, your counsel, appearing under a representation order, who has candidly acknowledged the challenges in this case and sought mitigation with respect to your personal circumstances. I also record my appreciation for the goodwill and professionalism shown by front-line retail staff impacted by your conduct, as evidenced in victim impact statements compiled by the Brighton Retail Forum. These accounts highlight not merely economic losses but stress and anxiety experienced by employees routinely subjected to suspicion and scrutiny. Their perseverance amid limited corporate support underscores the human cost of repeated shop thefts. The sentencing of offences such as this draws on a broad corpus of appellate authority which, while not directly analogous in all respects, provides useful frameworks for assessment. An instructive precedent is R v. Tindle [2022] EWCA Crim 1236 where the appellant was convicted of multiple counts of shoplifting conducted with a modicum of sophistication, involving the use of bags with concealed linings to evade detection. The Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence of 10 months, noting the cumulative harm and the currency of repeat offending. Similarly, R v. Strachan [2021] EWCA Crim 1743 reviewed sentence proportionality in acquisitive crime, emphasising the necessity of deterrence and the protection of small independent retailers, which suffer disproportionately from shrinkage and labour costs arising from persistent theft. Cases concerning associated acquisitive crime, such as R v. Lindsey [2023] EWCA Crim 889, addressed the interaction of persistent theft with mental health factors, concluding that while mental health challenges warrant consideration, they do not ordinarily negate the necessity for custodial sentences where offending behaviour demonstrates calculated or frequent conduct. It is, furthermore, a matter for note that the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft (2020) firmly places repeated and planned offending within the higher harm brackets, even where individual thefts involve low value. Aggravating features include targeting vulnerable premises, deployment of concealment methods, and disregard for previous warnings. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. Procedural delays here are instructive of systemic pressures. For example, the delay of over six weeks in securing Legal Aid funding for expert psychological assessment not only frustrated case progression but risked compounding the distress of victims keen for resolution. Similarly, the court is aware of ongoing staffing shortages within probation services nationally, leading to delays in compiling risk assessments or preparing community-based intervention plans. The court acknowledges, with regret, that the demands placed on public services have increased markedly in recent years. The Sussex Probation Region reports caseload increases of 22% since 2021, with proportionate reductions in staffing levels due to budgetary constraints. This impacts the capacity to supervise medium- and high-risk offenders, and threatens the availability of programme places designed to reduce reoffending. Moreover, housing insecurity remains a pressing challenge. Brighton and Hove City Council data indicates a 14% increase in temporary accommodation placements over the last 18 months, reflecting wider issues affecting the South East. The strained capacity of homelessness services undermines attempts to stabilise individuals’ circumstances, often leading to cyclical offending patterns. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. An important consideration is your personal background. You are 34 years old, with a modest employment record interrupted by significant periods of joblessness. You have no allegations or findings of gang involvement or organised criminality, and there is no evidence of coercion or exploitation by third parties. However, the court notes a history of previous convictions for theft-related offences, including two prior cautionable matters relating to shoplifting at similar premises. Despite interventions by local community policing teams and voluntary organisations offering support services, you have failed to desist. It is necessary to consider assessments prepared by clinical experts. A report compiled by Dr Sarah Dunlop, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, following comprehensive interviews and psychometric testing conducted in July 2025, indicates no presence of major mental illness but identifies traits of impulsivity and some difficulties with emotional regulation. Dr Dunlop’s report includes: “…the defendant exhibits low distress tolerance and limited coping strategies when faced with environmental stressors, notably financial insecurity. His offending appears to be opportunistic, influenced by transient mood fluctuations rather than deeply entrenched antisocial attitudes.” The report suggests potential responsiveness to cognitive skills interventions but recommends close supervision to mitigate risk of reoffending. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. The court also has before it a pre-sentence report filed on 10 September 2025 by Probation Officer Mr James Elwood. This assessment emphasises the risk of further acquisitive offending absent robust rehabilitative engagement. The report observes: “Given Mr H’s history and apparent absence of stable accommodation, the likelihood of reoffending is elevated. Without effective support addressing both practical needs and cognitive distortions underpinning his offending, recidivism remains a significant concern. However, Mr H has expressed a tentative willingness to engage with programmes should they be made accessible.” Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. The court further notes correspondence from the local branch of the Retail Victim Support Network, highlighting the disproportionate burden on smaller retailers, many of whom have reduced staffing or closed during quieter trading hours due to fears of recurring theft. Their letter describes this as “a slow attrition of local economic vitality,” and underscores the cumulative emotional toll on employees, some of whom suffer from anxiety and sleep disturbance. It is a notable societal development that offences previously regarded primarily in financial terms carry broader implications for community cohesion. The fear induced in workers, and the erosion of trust between retail staff and members of the public, contributes to an atmosphere inimical to social and economic wellbeing. An unfortunate but related consequence documented in recent policing reports is the rising incidence of confrontations arising from theft interventions. Although no such escalations have been attributed to you, the court must take care to deter reintegration of offenders who might inadvertently provoke harm. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. The court also observes the persistence of a broader narrative regarding social marginalisation, frequently invoked to contextualise repeat offending. While recognizing the importance of situating offences within an individual’s circumstances, this court rejects any notion that such factors reduce criminal accountability. As noted in R v. Allanson [2019] EWCA Crim 1023, the Court reminded sentencing judges to balance empathy with the imperatives of justice and public protection. The mere presence of socio-economic disadvantage does not excuse deliberate, sustained breach of the law. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. There is, lamentably, an increasing appearance of mental health pressures intersecting with acquisitive crime. National Health Service reports indicate that waiting times for adult psychotherapies often extend to months, particularly in regional centres. Funding and capacity limitations have a tangible impact on access to timely clinical interventions, thus intersecting with criminal justice outcomes. Although your psychological assessment does not reveal diagnosable illness beyond personality features, it is regrettable that multi-agency collaboration is hampered by resource scarcity, affecting joint support planning. The court reiterates its gratitude to the professionals engaged in supporting you thus far and acknowledges the written statements from staff at the Brighton Renewal Centre, a voluntary sector organisation providing housing advice and budgeting support. Their feedback documents both efforts made and challenges encountered in fostering engagement. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. It is worth noting, if only peripherally, that this jurisdiction, historically home to the now-discontinued Brighton Crown Quarter, has seen extensive reform in its court estate over the past decade. The transfer of certain hearing types to designated sessions elsewhere has altered scheduling availability, contributing marginally to delay. Such operational considerations, while tangential, reflect the shifting landscape in which criminal proceedings unfold—a landscape characterised by both modernisation and complex logistical demands. Mr H stated in interview that he frequently takes items, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. The sentencing framework in this case is, therefore, one which requires both consideration of the gravity of the offending and recognition of your personal circumstances. The courts must send a clear message that deliberate and repeated shoplifting, demonstrably planned and executed across multiple sites, is a serious breach warranting sanction. At the same time, it must direct appropriate interventions to support desistance where possible. I have reviewed the applicable statutory provisions, including sections 1 and 7 of the Theft Act 1968, and have regard to the Sentencing Council guideline on theft (effective from 2020). My approach accords with the aim to reduce reoffending and protect the public, balancing punishment with rehabilitation. In mitigation, your age and previous employment history are noted, alongside the absence of violent behaviour or threats during incidents. Your guilty plea, though entered late, avoids the trauma and expense of a contested hearing, albeit diminished credit is warranted by the timing. The evaluation of risk and amenability to treatment indicates a potential benefit in a structured community sentence incorporating cognitive skills work. This would seek to address offending-related thought patterns and enhance coping mechanisms. However, given the scale of offending and prior warnings, a custodial sentence cannot be excluded pending further report. Accordingly, I direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared with particular focus on suitability for an accredited offending behaviour programme, housing stability, and access to financial and psychological support. The report shall also consider the feasibility of a probation-led supervision order incorporating unpaid work and rehabilitation activities. Should the risk profile suggest, an assessment for electronic monitoring may also be warranted. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Brighton. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities for administrative purposes. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.
