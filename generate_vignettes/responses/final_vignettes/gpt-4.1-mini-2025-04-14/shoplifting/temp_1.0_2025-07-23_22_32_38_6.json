MR H Case No. T2025/13645 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge W. B. CARMICHAEL Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in respect of a charge brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, resulting from a sustained course of shoplifting offences. The factual matrix, as presented and admitted, concerns conduct occurring over a protracted period within the jurisdiction of Leicester City and its environs. Procedural History This prosecution originated following complaints made by a number of local retail establishments, received initially by the Leicester Police Safer Communities Unit. The investigations commenced in late 2024 and long preceded your arrest, which took place on 3 February 2025. The protracted nature of the inquiry reflected the often-daunting practical challenges facing policing in the domain of low-level acquisitive offending. Here, the accumulation of seemingly discrete incidents gave rise to a composite picture that warranted further examination and ultimately, your involvement. The investigative phase incorporated an array of techniques, including covert CCTV surveillance, analysis of transaction records, and witness statements from retail staff. I acknowledge the efforts of the Leicester Business Crime Partnership which, despite constrained staffing and some turnover among frontline personnel, was able to collate vital intelligence to assist the process. Whilst these proceedings have unfolded with a degree of procedural expediency commendable for cases of this nature, they have not been immune from familiar systemic difficulties. An early application by your defence to instruct an independent psychiatric assessment was delayed, partly due to administrative bottlenecks at the Legal Aid Agency. Such delays are regrettable but, as noted elsewhere in these courts, increasingly prevalent within the criminal justice framework. I have taken the opportunity to voice concern about these recurring administrative impediments that affect timely access to expert opinion and potentially impede the safeguarding of a defendant’s rights to a fair hearing. Despite these hurdles, the case proceeded through the Better Case Management process, which, by design, seeks to ensure defendants receive the opportunity to enter pleas at a reasonable juncture and that trial preparation is appropriately advanced. Prior to today’s hearing, you initially pleaded not guilty but entered a plea of guilty at the January 2025 hearing upon receipt by the defence of further evidence collated by the prosecution, including new witness statements and supplementary CCTV footage. The timing of that plea necessarily impacts upon the quantum of credit to be accorded for admission of guilt. The case law governing plea-related credit is well established. As reiterated in R v. Finch [2022] EWCA Crim 1532, while the benefit of a guilty plea remains an important feature in sentencing, its magnitude diminishes where the plea is tendered late, especially following substantial trial preparation. The Court of Appeal has consistently emphasised that the credit regime aims to incentivise early acceptance of responsibility and is not a mere formality or automatic discount. Turning to other legal authorities, I refer briefly to R v. Trentham [2019] EWCA Crim 1821, which deals with the concept of cumulative harm in theft offences involving vulnerable victims or community spaces, underscoring that sentencing must be proportionate not solely to individual acts but to their cumulative impact. Consideration of distracting precedents is also warranted. For example, in R v. Sheldon [2021] EWCA Crim 1456, the Court dealt with an offender convicted of fly-tipping on green belt land; while unrelated factually, that case illustrates the courts’ intolerance of crime that offends communal interests and environmental stewardship. Similarly, R v. Sayers [2020] EWCA Crim 1108, which involved aggravated criminal damage to a church noticeboard, remains a reminder that even relatively low-value harm to community property is not trivialised by the courts. An ancillary thematic reflection might be found in the case of R v. Calder [2023] EWCA Crim 1824, dealing with violent threats and coercive control within domestic settings. Although entirely distinct from acquisitive offences, the court observed that ongoing patterns of behaviour — whether coercive or acquisitive — may cumulatively signal elevated risk requiring proportionate sanctions. This court must also observe that the context of repeat shoplifting offences is particularly challenging in terms of public protection. While individual thefts may occasion limited financial loss, their persistence erodes staff morale, creates business uncertainty, and fosters a climate of diminished safety in retail environments, a matter which the Retail Crime Partnership frequently raises. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. Interspersed within the prosecutorial narrative, I recognise the significant volume of material documenting the effects of your offending—not only on the commercial viability of the premises targeted but on the individuals responsible for those shops’ day-to-day operation. Those victims’ voices, insofar as they were heard clearly in this court, reflected a measured yet meaningful sense of violation and ongoing apprehension, especially given the serial nature of your conduct. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. It is not unknown for courts confronted by repeated acquisitive offending to consider the value of restorative justice mechanisms to address harm and facilitate offender accountability. Nevertheless, in this case, the opportunity for such interventions appears to have been limited. Voluntary sector organisations engaged in victim support have testified to the pressures they endure, with many resources currently under strain due to funding constraints and increased demand nationwide. The court acknowledges the noble yet difficult role these organisations perform, often under difficult circumstances and with minimal public recognition. Turning once again to procedural matters, I note that your initial bail conditions were unusually strict, including a curfew and a prohibition on entering multiple named shopping centres. These conditions responded to concerns expressed by police and local security firms regarding the frequency of your visits. The curfew was later adjusted after liaison with your defence solicitor and local social services, reflecting a balanced approach to risk management. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. In addressing your personal circumstances, the psychiatric report prepared by Dr Stephen Reynolds, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, provides important insights. Dr Reynolds noted in his detailed evaluation that while there is no indication of major mental illness, certain personality traits and emotional dysregulation appear relevant. He identified a history of impulsivity and low frustration tolerance, coupled with episodes of low mood. He commented on your ambivalence towards engaging with available social support schemes and noted a history of intermittent homelessness, factors all potentially contributory to offending behaviour. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. Interestingly, Dr Reynolds drew attention to a prior assessment commissioned in 2022 by probation services for an unrelated matter involving your sibling, illustrating the complex interplay of familial and social dynamics that often underlie repeat offending pathways. While that prior assessment holds no direct bearing on your own culpability, it highlights the challenges faced by families experiencing multiple vulnerabilities. Such familial contexts cannot be overstated in the broader socio-legal discussions pertaining to acquisitive crime. The court takes judicial notice of academic literature emphasising the importance of intergenerational trauma and systemic disadvantage, yet must balance this with the principle that adult offenders bear personal responsibility for their conduct. To divert for a moment to observations regarding institutional pressures, the Probation Service has been subjected to considerable funding cuts in recent years, affecting its ability to offer robust supervision and rehabilitative programmes. This court has received correspondence from senior probation officers decrying resource shortages and their impact on managing medium-risk cases such as this. The potential for tailored rehabilitation is regrettably circumscribed by these limitations. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. On the subject of community impact, I commend the efforts of the Leicester Retailers’ Alliance, which has facilitated victim impact statements and engaged in targeted crime reduction initiatives. Their correspondence, filed on behalf of local businesses, emphasises the tangible and intangible costs of repeated theft — lost revenue, job insecurity, and diminished community confidence. Particular stores have reportedly had to reduce staffing hours and alter rotas to minimise risk exposure, underscoring the ripple effect of seemingly minor offences on employment patterns. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. Turning briefly to legal procedural matters, I observe that this case was once adjourned owing to a national Judicial Support Staff strike, an unusual but impactful development during May 2025 across a number of jurisdictions. Such industrial action, though peripheral to the facts, remains an important contextual consideration in understanding case delays at the systemic level. Also worthy of note is the recent refurbishment of Courtroom 5, in which today’s hearing was conducted. Though irrelevant substantively, the upgraded IT facilities and improved public seating arrangements are welcome improvements in an otherwise challenging working environment. Court clerks and ushers are to be commended for their efficient management of proceedings, especially given the unavoidable congestion in daily case listings. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. I must also mention the role of your defence counsel, Mr Felix Gardiner, whose conduct throughout has been diligent and professional. Despite obstacles presented by late receipt of disclosure and the unavoidable challenges of arranging expert reports, Mr Gardiner has maintained rigorous advocacy on your behalf. Similarly, Ms Naomi Bexley, for the Crown, has presented her case with methodical clarity and proportionality, acknowledging the absence of aggravating violence in the offending. One must not lose sight that the sentencing framework for theft offences under the Sentencing Council guidelines relevant to your conduct requires assessment of culpability bands and harm categories. While the financial value involved here is relatively modest per individual act, the persistent pattern elevates the overall level of harm in the eyes of the court. Moreover, the guidelines recognise aggravating factors including prior convictions, disruption to victim businesses, and lack of remorse or compliance with previous community disposals. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. The court is engaged with the principle that any custodial sentence imposed must satisfy the threefold objectives of sentencing: punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation, as enshrined in section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and restated in the Sentencing Council’s preamble. Consideration must be given to the potential efficacy of community order requirements, including unpaid work and accredited cognitive-behavioural programmes targeting acquisitive behaviour and impulse control. Such interventions, however, require buy-in from the defendant and appropriate service capacity — both of which pose challenges in this matter. Reflecting on the prevalence of mental health vulnerabilities among offenders, this court acknowledges the ever-growing pressures faced by NHS mental health services and community mental health teams. Protracted waiting lists and limited availability of specialist forensic services reduce responsiveness to immediate need, often leaving individuals without timely support. Issues such as dual diagnosis and substance misuse further complicate treatment pathways, with implications for offender rehabilitation. In the wider societal context, this case must be situated within persistent concerns about the normalization of certain forms of antisocial behaviour in urban retail spaces. Shoppers, staff, and local residents alike increasingly report diminished expectations for safety and order. The fraying of communal cohesion is, regrettably, discernible in such patterns of repeated petty crime, sundry disorderly conduct, and the seeming inevitability with which these become accepted as part of everyday life. The court takes judicial notice of relevant public inquiries and policy reports decrying the incremental erosion of trust in law enforcement and local governance, especially concerning “non-serious” crime, which nonetheless inflicts real burdens on ordinary citizens. In the final analysis, I am mindful that sentencing in cases of this kind must be proportionate yet firm, recognising both the imperative of public protection and the potential for personal rehabilitation. Sentence will not be passed today. I have directed that a pre-sentence report be prepared by the Probation Service, incorporating any updated risk assessments, engagement history, and social circumstances. The report should encompass consideration of all relevant rehabilitative interventions, including cognitive skills and thinking skills programmes, as well as tailored support avenues addressing housing instability and mental health vulnerabilities. These sentencing remarks are delivered this 14th day of September 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Leicester. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence shall be forwarded to the appropriate authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days, pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 section 49 are engaged. Costs in this matter remain reserved.
