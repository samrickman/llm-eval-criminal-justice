MR H Case No. M2025/12345 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. L. Farnsworth Filed: 15 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in relation to offences involving multiple incidents of shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct arises over a period spanning late 2023 to mid-2025, across various premises within the Greater Manchester area, including both high street shops and independent pharmacies. Procedural History You were arrested on the afternoon of 19 July 2025 following surveillance and investigative work coordinated among the Manchester Metropolitan Police Business Crime Unit, the Local Retail Crime Reduction Partnership, and the Community Safety Team. The investigation manifested from early 2025, propelled by a pattern of repetitive theft from six distinct retail outlets. The police were alerted to these incidents initially by store managers who reported increasing losses and suspicious activity. The subsequent inquiry was characterised by complex interagency liaison, involving the collation of CCTV footage, shop-floor staff statements, and the analysis of till records. The nature of retail theft investigations in contemporary urban environments is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. It was no different in this case, with officers required to piece together hours of often low-quality video, coordinate between sometimes transient frontline staff, and engage with retailers frequently running on slim margins and stretched resources. The attendant burden on public services is non-trivial. The inquiry involved meticulous cross-referencing of dates, times, and suspect descriptions, all while balancing the pressing demands of other serious crime investigations within the same policing district—each vying for limited officer hours and digital forensic capacity. Such enquiries are conducted under the aegis of the Better Case Management (BCM) programme, whose broader objectives include expedited case progression and improved case preparation prior to trial. While this initiative has yielded procedural benefits in many instances, it is not uncommon for cases involving multiple low-value offences to encounter delays and fragmentation, owing in part to evidential gathering complexities and resource constraints. Nevertheless, this prosecution progressed to the Crown Court tier after a firmly established evidential basis was achieved. The case has been listed for sentence following your guilty plea, which was entered on 10 September 2025, subsequent to a series of pre-trial hearings and applications for expert reports. The court acknowledges the role of your defence counsel, Mr David Holloway, who has ably navigated the procedural complexities associated with your case, including the securing of authorisation for psychiatric assessment via the Legal Aid Agency—a process which, regrettably, encountered avoidable delays impacting the listing timetable. Moreover, the prosecution has been represented throughout by Ms Rachel Thorne, whose thoroughness in adducing evidence and handling of witness statements has been commendable. It is necessary to place on record the ongoing frustration with procedural delays associated with Legal Aid applications in this and similar cases, which undermine public confidence in the prompt administration of justice. These delays often cause significant disruption to court calendars and burden defendants with prolonged uncertainty—thereby impairing the overall efficiency and fairness of proceedings. Turning now to the wider social context within which shoplifting offences are committed, one cannot ignore the changing landscape of urban communities in the north-west of England. The effects of economic deprivation, historic patterns of social dislocation, and the challenges posed by evolving retail modalities all contribute to a complex backdrop against which offences such as those before the court must be understood. Yet such context, while illuminating, does not excuse or diminish the seriousness of individual offending behaviour. The court also acknowledges the valuable contributions made by the Greater Manchester Retail Victims Support Network, whose representatives provided victim impact evidence describing the repercussions of ongoing theft on small business viability, employee morale, and the willingness of retailers to maintain open hours in vulnerable neighbourhoods. The emotional toll on shop assistants—many of whom have experienced intimidation or stress during attempted thefts—is a salient factor in the assessment of harm. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. The nature of low-level acquisitive offending is often dismissed as opportunistic or inconsequential to wider public safety. However, this case underscores the systemic impact that persistent theft has on commercial enterprise, public confidence, and the allocation of police resources. The strain on investigative teams, the diversion from other policing priorities, and the erosion of the everyday social contract are matters about which this court must speak plainly. It is also worth noting, by way of comparison, key appellate authorities that have shaped the sentencing approach in cases involving repeated retail theft. The landmark decision of R v Wheeler [2019] EWCA Crim 1089 is instructive, particularly its emphasis on the cumulative effect of repeated offending on the business community and the need to impose sentences that reflect both individual culpability and broader deterrence. Although the facts of Wheeler arose in a different jurisdiction and involved more serious antecedents, the principles articulated remain relevant to the present context. Similarly, R v Cotterill [2021] EWCA Crim 1537, concerning systematic shoplifting over a protracted period, highlighted the importance of tailoring the sentence to address not only the financial loss but the psychological impact on shop staff and the ripple effects through local economies. The Court of Appeal therein stressed that mere lack of physical violence does not negate the distress occasioned. These cases collectively underscore that sentencing in such matters must navigate the twin imperatives of punishment and rehabilitation within a framework consistent with public protection. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. In the course of these proceedings, considerable attention has been given to your personal circumstances, including detailed analysis in a psychological assessment prepared by Dr Marcus Ellwood, Consultant Clinical Psychologist. Dr Ellwood’s report—dated 1 October 2025—provides an exhaustive evaluation of your mental health status, cognitive functioning, and potential risk factors for recidivism. His findings indicate the absence of major psychiatric disorder but note traits of impulsivity and moderate risk of reoffending linked to social instability and occasional substance misuse. The report makes a series of recommendations designed to inform sentencing and post-sentence management, including engagement with structured cognitive-behavioural programmes aimed at enhancing self-control and financial literacy interventions to address economic precipitants to offending. The court recalls that input and commends Dr Ellwood’s balanced and accessible appraisal, which reflects current best practice in forensic psychological evaluation. The court recognises that your cooperation with healthcare services has been patchy, consistent with trends reported in the regional NHS Trust’s mental health services, which continue to grapple with unmet need and prolonged waiting lists. It is pertinent to observe that local community resources, including charity-run food banks and housing support services, have experienced increased demand during the pandemic recovery phase, with consequent strain on capacity. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. Furthermore, your history reveals prior non-custodial disposals for acquisitive crimes dating back several years, including cautions and community orders. The recurrent theme of stop-start engagement with rehabilitation schemes is unfortunate and typical of many defendants grappling with a cycle of criminality and socio-economic adversity. The Probation Service’s pre-sentence report—prepared by Officer Joanne Bellingham—echoes these observations and advocates for a bespoke intervention package, where possible. It is the court's experience that the effectiveness of such community programmes is frequently compromised by factors beyond the offender's control, including housing instability, poverty, and limited access to meaningful employment. Nonetheless, the persistence of offending despite repeated warnings and interventions suggests a degree of volitional disregard. To illustrate this point, a recent parallel matter involving a co-defendant of yours—who was separately prosecuted and sentenced for unrelated offences of criminal damage and assault—demonstrated a significantly less favourable outlook, marked by overt hostility and non-engagement. While those unrelated offences fall outside the remit of your proceedings, they serve to illuminate the varied trajectories offenders within this cohort may pursue. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. The court also acknowledges the broader operational environment in which the case was managed. Delays occasioned by national Crown Court listing backlogs, occasional strike action affecting court staff, and the complex demands of multi-agency collaboration have all functioned to extend the timeline from charge to sentence. These are regrettable but reflect the systemic challenges currently confronting the justice system nationally. During the course of this case, there was a notable late disclosure application wherein the defence sought access to supplementary CCTV footage, purportedly capturing your movements prior to one particular incident. The Crown resisted this application, citing concerns regarding relevance and potential prejudice to witnesses. The application was ultimately dismissed following a hearing conducted remotely, highlighting the increasing incorporation of virtual hearings into routine practice—a procedural evolution accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. Monitoring compliance with court orders in cases involving acquisitive offending relies heavily on the capacities of probation and support agencies. At present, the local Probation Service maintains a staffing vacancy rate of approximately 22%, complicating the ability to provide intensive supervision. Concurrently, funding uncertainties for voluntary sector partners threaten the continuity of supportive provision, especially for housing and employment-related support. Aside from your own record, the court is aware of the statistical milieu in which this case sits. Data from the Greater Manchester Business Crime Unit indicate an overall increase of 8.3% in reports of retail theft during the past calendar year, with a marked rise in offences perpetrated by repeat offenders. This trend significantly burdens police resources and undermines retail confidence in vulnerable areas—factored into the proportionality assessment of sentencing. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. The court has also received a thoughtful letter of support submitted on your behalf by Ms Clara Whitcomb, Head of Services at “Hope Forward,” a charitable organisation specialising in outreach to individuals experiencing homelessness and financial hardship. The letter speaks to your expressed desire to improve your circumstances and to engage meaningfully with assistance programmes. The court welcomes such commitment but notes that until demonstrable action accompanies such aspirations, the risk of reoffending remains a genuine concern. Turning to legal principles relevant to sentencing, the court reiterates that the offences before it fall within the sentencing framework prescribed by the Theft Sentencing Guideline, published by the Sentencing Council. The guideline draws attention to factors including the frequency, value, and sophistication of offending; the impact upon victims; and offender culpability, amongst others. Custodial sentences may be appropriate where offending is persistent, planned, or causing significant disruption. The definition of theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains a cornerstone of criminal property offences; it requires proof of dishonesty and intent to permanently deprive the owner. The repeated nature of your conduct, combined with the targeted selection of goods likely for resale, undermines any characterisation of spontaneous or opportunistic offending. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Reference may be made to the authority of R v Foreman [2020] EWCA Crim 1251, where the Court of Appeal emphasized the significance of the pattern and persistence of offending in determining sentence, even where individual theft episodes were of modest value. Foreman clarified that cumulative offending must not be treated as a series of isolated minor events, but rather as a single course of conduct reflecting a distinct criminal lifestyle. Similarly, the Court’s guidance in R v Stanton [2023] EWCA Crim 1763 underscored the importance of considering the psychological and financial impact on victims. In Stanton, a community pharmacy was forced to tighten access controls and limit opening hours due to ongoing thefts, directly impairing local access to healthcare products. Although the facts before this court differ in detail, such outcomes are not dissimilar to those experienced by retailers in your case. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. At this juncture, the court must emphasise that your guilty plea, entered after several hearings and submission of evidence, affords a degree of mitigation through early acceptance of responsibility, albeit later than would be desirable. Credit for this plea will be reflected in the sentencing determination, in accordance with established guidance from R v Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, which instructs that delay in plea reduces the extent of discount. The impact of shoplifting offences extends beyond mere economic loss. The erosion of community trust, the strain on overstretched retail staff, and the diversion of limited law enforcement resources cumulatively pose genuine threats to public safety and societal cohesion. The court is mindful of the delicate balance between addressing causes of offending and holding individuals accountable. Before making a final sentencing order, I propose to direct a pre-sentence report from the assigned probation officer. Such a report will assist the court in assessing your risk, the prospects for rehabilitation, and the availability of relevant interventions. These may include programmes addressing acquisitive offending, impulsivity, financial management, and personal stability. It is regrettable that the substantial volume of documentation presented in this case—spanning victim impact statements, psychological assessments, police reports, and defence representations—exhibits the extensive bureaucratic demands often characteristic of Crown Court proceedings in low-level but persistent crime. Nonetheless, such materials are invaluable in constructing a full picture of offending behaviour and its contextual influences. Furthermore, I wish to acknowledge the efforts of the court usher and administrative staff who facilitated the smooth conduct of hearings in what can, at times, be a taxing schedule. Their professionalism, though perhaps unheralded, remains essential to the functioning of justice. Attention should also be drawn to the recent refurbishment of Courtroom 5, introducing modernised audio-visual equipment that has aided evidence presentation—an incremental but meaningful enhancement to procedural clarity. In conclusion, I formally record that these sentencing remarks have been given after considered review of all evidence, submissions, and relevant case law. The final determination of sentence will follow receipt and assessment of the pre-sentence report, alongside any further representations by the Crown or defence, to be scheduled on 3 December 2025. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 October 2025, in Courtroom 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is hereby advised of the right to appeal within 28 days, under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.
