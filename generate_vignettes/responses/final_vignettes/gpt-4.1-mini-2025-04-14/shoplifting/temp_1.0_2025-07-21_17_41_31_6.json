MR H Case No. 2025/45837 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. Barrington Filed: 14 August 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence upon a charge arising under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically concerning shoplifting offences committed over a protracted period. The prosecutorial material describes incidents involving various retail premises located within the Westminster and Kensington areas, spanning from late 2023 through the early months of 2025. This case encapsulates a sustained course of unlawful conduct, warranting meticulous judicial consideration not only of the facts but also the broader social and procedural context surrounding your prosecution. Procedural History and Institutional Context The present proceedings have been notable for a sequence of hearing dates and procedural steps, reflective of both the court’s case management protocols and the complexities inherent in this particular prosecution. Initially charged in January 2025, your case was allocated to the Crown Court following a referral from Magistrates’ Court in March of that year, pursuant to the parameters established for offences where custody might be anticipated. A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 22 March 2025; at that time, you entered a not guilty plea. Thereafter, it is of record that multiple applications for evidential disclosure and forensic analysis were made, resulting in adjournments across three occasioned dates: namely, 15 April, 10 June, and 6 July 2025. Partly, these were attributable to delays in the processing and reporting of CCTV evidence from the various establishments victimised, compounded by the administrative backlog within the Metropolitan Police Service’s Digital Evidence Unit. I note with a measure of frustration—and indeed sympathy for all those involved—that such delays are by no means uncommon in cases of comparable complexity across the criminal justice system. The evolving reliance on digital evidence, while invaluable, brings its own challenges, notably in ensuring timely and robust disclosure. Furthermore, it is acknowledged in the documentation before this court that liaison between prosecuting counsel, the business crime partnership initiatives active in Westminster, and Safer Neighbourhood Teams, has been consistent, albeit compromised on occasion by staff turnover within these agencies. This state of flux is symptomatic of the wider strains imposed by budget constraints and workforce attrition in policing and local authority services. The local borough’s Business Crime Reduction Partnership, primarily funded by retail levy contributions, operates within these constraints yet has nevertheless provided victim impact statements that articulate the operational ramifications of persistent shop theft on their members. Regrettably, I must report that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of the defence’s application to instruct a forensic psychiatrist experienced in compulsive-acquisitive behaviour was subject to avoidable delays. The initial request, submitted on 12 May 2025 by Mr Owen Clarke of Chambers at 12 New Square, was met with a protracted sequence of administrative queries and requests for clarification before approval was granted on 19 June 2025. Such bureaucratic inertia places undue strain on all parties and, more importantly, may impair the timely preparation and fair presentation of a defendant’s case. There is a developing consensus among legal practitioners of the need for reform to expedite these essential assessments when expert opinion is crucial to sentencing. A psychiatric assessment, the results of which are contained in Dr Fiona McIntyre’s detailed report of 20 July 2025, was subsequently furnished to the court and Probation Service. Dr McIntyre’s reflections have informed the present sentencing considerations to a significant degree. During the plea and trial preparation hearing of 5 August 2025, you altered your plea to guilty in respect of a representative charge embodying a course of conduct constituting numerous individual incidents of shoplifting. The court notes the timing of this plea—a matter to which I will return. It is well established that the fundamental elements of theft require a finding of dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with an intention to permanently deprive, as laid out in the Theft Act 1968. Shoplifting, particularly when repeated or planned, carries serious repercussions not merely for the direct victims but for wider community confidence in the rule of law and commercial safety. InR v. Stainton [2019] EWCA Crim 1255, the Court of Appeal emphasised the multifactorial impact of burglary and theft offences, noting that the emotional toll on victims extends beyond economic loss to encompass feelings of violation and vulnerability. Although shoplifting often involves lower monetary values, the Court acknowledged that repeated breaches, especially targeting small retailers or those with limited security infrastructure, carry enhanced seriousness. Similarly, the guidance provided in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (December 2019) remains authoritative. The guideline instructs courts to assess culpability and harm with reference to deterioration of victim confidence, potential for disruption of business, and the defendant’s prior history and intent. The Court is further mindful of R v. Elwood [2020] EWCA Crim 1378, which explored the parameters of credit allowable for a late guilty plea. The decision underscores that while credit for guilty plea incentivises early admissions, reduction in sentencing must correlate with meaningful acceptance of responsibility rather than tactical delay. It is perhaps germane to recall the statutory framework of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 regulating the structure of sentencings, which the court must balance alongside the guidance offered by case law. The role of the probation officer’s pre-sentence report remains invaluable in understanding the rehabilitative prospects and necessary public protection measures. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. While the detailed averments concerning the offences stand largely uncontested, the court is mindful that the factual matrix presented is not isolated but rather interwoven with broader issues of community safety, resource allocation, and offender management. It is instructive to remind the court of established jurisprudence concerning the nexus between shoplifting and other societal factors. For example, R v. Clough [2017] EWCA Crim 2106 considered the connection between acquisitive crimes and underlying mental health conditions, cautioning against simplistic causal assumptions but recognising legitimate mitigating circumstances where appropriate. The social setting of repeated shoplifting in high-density urban environments is likewise of interest in academic criminological discourse. The interplay of economic hardship, entrenched disadvantage, and social exclusion pathways has been noted in the recent Home Office research report titled “Acquisitive Crime: Patterns and Causes” (February 2024), which reiterates the consequences for local retail ecosystems and consumer confidence. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. Significant weight is accorded to the statements and submissions received from the affected retailers. Notably, a consortium of independent chemists and food stores operating in the affected boroughs have documented the difficulties posed by repeated theft, including the need for increased security arrangements and suffering tangible business losses. The Westminster Retail Victim Support Network, which offers assistance to staff through trauma-informed interventions, submitted a statement describing increased levels of anxiety and stress among employees following repeated incidents attributable to the defendant. Such psychological and operational fallout, though intangible, is consequential and factors into the assessment of harm for sentencing purposes. Moreover, the court recognises the work of organisations such as the Public Realm Initiative, which has highlighted street-level disorder linked to acquisitive offending and its contribution to a perceived decline in local amenity and public safety. There is, it must be said, a growing impatience among the public with respect to persistent theft and antisocial behaviour, demanding appropriate responses from courts and enforcement agencies alike. The court also acknowledges the role of the Metropolitan Police Service’s Theft Deterrence Unit, established to tackle prolific shoplifting offenders through intelligence-led patrols and community engagement. The unit’s case records in Mr H’s interactions note his profile as a repeat low-level offender, resistant to prior diversionary efforts. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. Dr McIntyre’s psychiatric evaluation is detailed, professionally composed, and duly observed by this court. It identifies no diagnosable major mental illness but notes the presence of traits suggestive of compulsive acquisitive behaviour and impulsivity. The report highlights a lack of engagement with support services despite multiple offers by social workers and community outreach programmes. The probation pre-sentence report supplements this context, painting a picture of Mr H as a man currently unemployed, under considerable financial and housing stress, residing temporarily within a local authority-managed hostel with limited stability. The report further recommends targeted cognitive-behavioural interventions and possible participation in a diversion-to-work scheme designed to address underlying criminogenic needs. I note with some regret that Housing Support Services have been hampered by chronic underfunding, with long waiting lists for stable accommodation compounding the vulnerability of offenders such as yourself. Similarly, the local Substance Misuse Service, although offered, has noted patchy attendance and engagement from you over the past 12 months. Understandably, in this court’s experience, the efficacy of community-based sentences depends greatly upon the cooperation and motivation of the individual. Delivery of rehabilitative programmes is frequently challenged not only by individual circumstances but by systemic pressures on probation and health services. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. Turning to legal representation, I record appreciation for counsel on both sides. Ms Eleanor Finch, appearing for the Crown, provided comprehensive and measured submissions. Similarly, Mr Owen Clarke, instructed on Legal Aid, advanced a robust defence emphasising mitigating factors, hardship, and remorse. Both counsel have conducted themselves with commendable professionalism despite the administrative hurdles faced. It is regrettable that the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted engagement with applications for expert reports and representation orders added delay to these proceedings, as noted earlier. This pattern has been lamented by practitioners across the criminal justice system and warrants ongoing attention from policymakers. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. It is worth observing that the Better Case Management system, introduced in 2017 with the laudable goal of expediting case disposal and enhancing procedural efficiency, assisted in the structured progression of this matter. However, notwithstanding this, three adjournments for expert assessments and disclosure prevented a swift conclusion. I also note the incremental value of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership, which, despite chronic underresourcing, manages a commendable coordination effort, including the dissemination of offender profiles to local shops and training for staff in incident handling and deterrence. These efforts, while valuable, can only go so far without systemic support. Another procedural footnote: an adjournment scheduled for 2 July 2025 was necessitated by the unavailability of the court linguistic interpreter initially instructed to assist with interviews of witnesses whose primary language is Polish. The last-minute nature of the request reflects systemic shortages in interpreter resources, an issue the judiciary routinely encounters but is beyond the power of this court to resolve. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. The court also notes, with no direct relevance to this case, the conviction of a co-accused individual in a separate affair relating to aggravated burglary in Croydon, who was found to be in unlawful possession of a bladed article on school grounds. Although that conviction is unrelated to Mr H’s matters, it reminds the court of the importance of clearly distinguishing facts as they pertain to each defendant. Similarly, a set of charges involving the fly-tipping of waste on green belt land in the Oxfordshire district, which was heard contemporaneously in another Crown Court, presents an example of environmental offences prosecuted robustly in recent months, but which do not reflect on the culpability or the circumstances herein. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Much turns on the seriousness of the offending, the harm caused, the degree of planning or sophistication, the defendant’s antecedents, and his prospects for rehabilitation. While no allegation of violence exists, the repeated nature of the thefts, the impact upon victim confidence, and the persistence despite previous warnings and interventions, all serve to elevate culpability. The court must balance the need for punishment and deterrence with the principles of rehabilitation and the protection of the public. As reflected in the guidelines, community sentences incorporating rehabilitative components remain appropriate where feasible, provided compliance is likely and public protection assured. Despite the absence of serious psychiatric disorder, the traits noted by Dr McIntyre, together with the probation assessment, suggest that intervention could mitigate the risk of reoffending. This court endorses, therefore, the exploration of cognitive skills training and support addressing impulsivity and acquisitive patterns. The timing of the plea, while not immediate, is nonetheless made prior to trial. While such a late plea may attract a reduction in sentencing credit compared to an early admission, it nevertheless represents an acceptance which this court recognises for its procedural benefits. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. In concluding these remarks, I wish to place on the record my appreciation for the commendable efforts of the Victim Support Liaison Officers, whose work in engaging with both victims and defendants reflects the evolving ethos of restorative justice. Their outreach in this case was both thorough and sensitive. I also take this opportunity to commend the court staff and ushers in Court 5 at the Westminster Crown Court, who, despite recent refurbishment efforts and occasional staffing shortages, have maintained a standard of order and efficiency deserving of mention. I must finally note that the price of persistent acquisitive offending is not borne solely by those prosecuted or their immediate victims. It extends to public services struggling to keep pace with demand, from stretched police forces to probation officers juggling escalating caseloads, from mental health teams confronting rising referrals to local authorities grappling with housing shortages. The retail sector itself, however willing to partner with law enforcement, faces its own pressures: cost inflation, supply chain disruption, and the need to invest in security technologies all converge to create a challenging environment. These externalities, while not determinative of sentence, form the backdrop to the court’s assessment. Having set out the contextual and procedural tapestry in which this case is embedded, the court must now turn to sentence. I hereby order the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the National Probation Service. This report is to explore all available options for sentencing, including the suitability of a Community Order with Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, attendance at cognitive behavioural intervention programmes, housing support plans, and assessments of compliance risk. The report should also take account of current public health advice, particularly in relation to scheduling interventions amidst fluctuating Covid-19 infection rates and any consequent service provision challenges. This court will schedule an early sentencing hearing upon receipt of the report.
