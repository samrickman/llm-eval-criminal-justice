MR H Case No. P2025/03871 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. Griffith Filed: 19 September 2025 Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence in relation to a charge of theft, specifically a series of shoplifting offences, contrary to Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans a protracted period from November 2023 through April 2025 and involves multiple retail establishments within the Plymouth and South Devon area, including high street shops, small convenience stores, and local pharmacies. Procedural and Case Management Background Your case has been before this court following your formal charge and subsequent transfer from the Magistrates' Court on 15 May 2025, pursuant to the provisions laid out under the Crown Court allocation scheme and consistent with the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, which seeks to expedite preparation and ensure the resolution of contested matters within statutory timetables. Regrettably, this matter experienced several procedural adjournments, primarily occasioned by delayed defence applications for expert psychiatric assessment and the necessity to obtain full disclosure of surveillance footage from multiple retailers, as well as the time taken for collateral checks relating to your prior criminal history and ongoing support needs. In the context of these case management proceedings, it is appropriate to record formally the enduring challenges facing the Legal Aid Agency in administering funding approvals for commissioned reports. On no fewer than three occasions did defence counsel encounter protracted waits for funding sanction, notably for the instruction of Dr Pauline Matthews, a consultant forensic psychologist with expertise in acquisitive offending and impulsivity disorders. These delays had a discernible effect on listing availability and case progression, compounding an already congested court docket impacted by nationally recognised shortfalls in criminal justice staffing and resource constraints. The court reiterates its concern that such systemic inefficiencies serve neither the interests of justice nor those of the defendant or the public. This court further acknowledges the cooperation extended by the Plymouth Safer Retail Partnership and the Devon and Cornwall Police's dedicated Business Crime Unit. Their investigations involved the painstaking review of digital evidence, including CCTV footage and digital transaction records, enabling the collating of a comprehensive behavioural profile which proved integral to the Crown’s case. The dedicated Business Crime Partnership, despite chronic underfunding and the turnover of key personnel, maintained steady contact with affected retailers and has provided victim impact statements that detail not only the financial loss occasioned but the emotional and psychological burden borne by retail employees, many of whom have reported anxiety and a sense of vulnerability as a result of repeat theft incidents. Public safety considerations are intimately tied to the effective functioning of such partnerships, which seek to deter repeat offending and manage offenders proactively, thereby lessening the burden on already overstretched policing and judicial resources. However, it remains painfully clear that acquisitive crime constitutes a disproportionate share of calls on police time nationally, frequently eclipsing more serious investigations, and contributing to an insidious degradation of community confidence. Turning to the specifics of your case, the evidence relied upon includes eyewitness accounts, digital timetabled movements corroborated by public transport metadata, and a series of recovered goods linked to your possession at arrest. The cumulative weight of this evidence compelled you to enter a plea of guilty at the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 17 August 2025, following earlier contestation. Before addressing the facts in more detail, it is necessary to canvass relevant legal principles. The statutory framework under the Theft Act 1968 remains the touchstone, alongside the Sentencing Council’s definitive guidelines on theft (2017, last updated 2023), which emphasise the need for courts to consider patterns of offending, degree of planning, harm to victims (including psychological), and any aggravating or mitigating features. The court notes that theft by repeated and deliberate concealment with an intent to permanently deprive is properly viewed with seriousness, especially when it disrupts the confidence and welfare of retail workers and the sustainability of local businesses. Authority of note includes R v. Milton [2019] EWCA Crim 1468, which departed from previous sentencing norms by underscoring the real-world impact of repetitive low-value theft on community employers and employees alike, affirming a threshold for immediate custody where patterns indicate deliberate defiance of social norms. Likewise, R v. Benson [2021] EWCA Crim 1134 reaffirmed limited credit for late pleas, particularly in theft offences where prior warnings and diversionary offers had been declined. This litigation also occurs against a backdrop of evolving judicial understanding of offenders’ needs, particularly concerning those with identified vulnerabilities or cognitive impairments. The Probation Instruction 05/2019 sets out key principles on tailoring rehabilitative sentencing, a theme reflected in United Kingdom Sentencing Council literature and echoed in jurisprudence such as R v. Cartwright [2020] EWCA Crim 1281. Before turning to particulars of offence, ancillary matters merit articulation. The court has received several letters of support, including one from your former employer at Devon Electricals, who remarks on your punctuality and work ethic prior to recent job loss, though notes concerns about your subsequent disengagement from employment seeking. Letters from local voluntary sector agencies confirm repeated but unsuccessful outreach attempts to engage you in budgeting advice and housing support services. I note, for completeness, that your sister, Ms Fiona Harker, provided a statement referencing family difficulties, including recent bereavement and ongoing disputes relating to your housing situation. While such factors play into mitigation, the court must balance personal history against the imperative to uphold public confidence and protect vulnerable victims. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. This account of your offending behaviour frames the basis for the charges convicted. Moreover, the matter extends beyond isolated incidents, capturing a broader course of conduct marked by repetition, concealment, and clear intent to circumvent detection. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. The evidence demonstrates a pattern of strategic offending timed to coincide with peak store hours, aimed at exploiting staff attention and maximising gain. On multiple occasions, you were recorded entering and exiting premises with what security footage and employee testimonies support as concealed items, including high-demand personal care products and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. The history of your prior engagements with policing and judicial interventions is relevant. You were previously subject to a conditional discharge in 2021 following a similar charge for theft from a small independent grocer, described in the post-sentence assessment as a “brief aberration.” That assessment acknowledged your expressed willingness to alter behaviour, though sadly this appears not to have been realised in practice. The offender record reveals minor inconsistencies in presenting stable accommodation, with repeated short-term tenancies and periods of temporary housing documented by housing support workers. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. This visibility into your conduct is striking in evidencing a pattern of opportunism, combined with a confident, if misguided, sense of impunity. It reveals no significant attempts to conceal your identity, notwithstanding your use of layered clothing or gloves to obscure fingerprints. The Crown has adduced expert psychological input obtained from Dr Matthews, whose recent report describes your mental health status as largely stable but affected by chronic low mood and stress related to financial precarity. Dr Matthews diagnoses traits consistent with borderline impulsivity and situational stressors, but stops short of identifying a formal disorder warranting hospital treatment or structured psychiatric intervention. The report emphasises that your engagement with available support services has been minimal, characterised by sporadic attendance at appointments and an apparent reluctance to accept assistance, a finding echoed in statements from social outreach workers. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. It should be plainly stated that while such vulnerabilities may provide some explanatory context, they do not excuse or diminish culpability. The court is very familiar with the experience of defendants who cite stress-related reasons for offending while simultaneously failing to engage with agencies capable of offering meaningful support. Attached to the court bundle are victim personal statements from three frontline retail workers, who describe heightened anxiety and diminished morale resultant from recurrent thefts. One witness, a store assistant employed for 7 years at the town centre pharmacy, recounts her distress at repeated incidents, noting the day-to-day strain caused by the need to monitor customers vigilantly. Another witness highlights how scheduling has been amended to reduce lone working due to safety concerns. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. These statements, while not alleging physical harm, testify to the erosion of psychological safety in community retail environments — a factor increasingly recognised by sentencing authorities as a material harm in its own right. Drawing parallels to notable appellate authorities, this court recalls R v. Jarvis [2022] EWCA Crim 1149, where repeated, non-violent retail theft conducted over a period of months sparked substantial custodial sanctions, with the Court emphasising that the knock-on effects for premises reliant on low-paid staff are cumulative and corrosive. The Court of Appeal underscored the necessity of deterrence in such cases, lest the courts be seen to tolerate a “culture of disregard” towards retail workers. Turning now to ancillary and partly irrelevant procedural matters, it is instructive to recall the evolution of the hostile environment policies affecting temporary accommodation placements. The long waiting lists in the Devon Housing Authority, compounded by national crises in social housing supply, have led to frustration and mobility among vulnerable populations. While these issues are beyond the scope of criminal adjudication, some indirect effects on your personal circumstances have been submitted in mitigation, albeit not substantiated by evidence of sustained effort to resolve housing insecurity. I further remark on the unfortunate delays occasioned by the Nationwide Postal Strike in March and April 2025, coinciding with key phases in this prosecution’s listing and evidential disclosure. Although the court and parties endeavoured to mitigate the impact through electronic communication and liaison, these broader systemic pressures testify to the complex environment within which modern justice is administered. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. Despite previous cautionary measures and diversion proposals, it is noted that your compliance with intervention offers, including those from the Community Rehabilitation Company, was inconsistent. Probation reports describe partial engagement with thinking skills groups and no completion of prescribed modules addressing acquisitive offending patterns. The court turns to the wider context of crime trends in the South West. According to regional data compiled by the Devonshire Policing Command, shoplifting has accounted for a growing proportion of acquisitive crime reports since 2021, a trend attributable in part to economic pressures and evolving retail security technologies. This increase poses significant challenges to policing priorities, necessitating strategic use of increasingly scarce resources. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. At the time of your arrest on 25 April 2025, officers located items in your possession consistent with those reported stolen from several incidents under investigation. The timing of the arrest followed an extensive, digitally assisted investigation incorporating data from transport card swipes and public CCTV feeds, authorised under appropriate warrants. Procurement of mobile device data and triangulation techniques supported the evidentiary structure, underscoring the deliberate and persistent nature of your conduct. While such surveillance techniques are intrusive and subject to tight judicial oversight, their use was deemed proportionate and justified by the Magistrates’ Court prior to issue. The Crown correctly notes that your offending caused cumulative financial loss to small and medium enterprises that operate with already thin margins, a factor aggravating the harm occasioned. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. In consideration of sentencing options, this court is mindful of the Sentencing Council guidelines mandating the exploration of community-based orders where feasible, particularly where offenders have demonstrable vulnerabilities or where punishment alone is unlikely to effect sustainable behavioural change. However, this court recognises the limits of leniency in cases marked by repeated offending, failure to engage with rehabilitative opportunities, and apparent disregard for victim impact. The balance of factors presently before the court situates you toward the more serious end of the sentencing tariff for theft offences of this nature. It is acknowledged that you have no prior convictions for violent or sexual offences, and there is no evidence of association with organised crime groups or coercive influences. Your familial circumstances, while strained, do not include factors suggesting heightened risk to public safety. The court notes your reported unemployment status and precarious housing, factors which may be addressed in the context of a holistic intervention plan to accompany sentencing. Dr Matthews’ psychological evaluation recommends, where community disposal is appropriate, engagement with structured interventions aimed at impulsivity management, alongside support addressing accommodation and financial difficulties. Nonetheless, the court must emphasise the importance of consistent and documented engagement with such services, a predicate for the imposition of non-custodial orders in persistent acquisitive offending. I am mindful of the reported absence of any history of offending involving co-defendants or associates in relation to this course of conduct. Although disclosures have revealed unrelated charges and ongoing investigations involving third parties known to you socially, no evidence was presented to suggest causal links or complicity, and those matters remain outside the remit of this sentencing. The court also records, although datum, a prior unrelated environmental prosecution in the Plymouth area in 2021 concerning unlawful tipping offences by a business operator unconnected to the present matter. Similarly, references in the prosecution bundle to an unrelated arson incident in Court 5 in July 2025 serve merely as reflection of listing pressures and carry no weight in this individual sentencing exercise. The sentencing hearing today has been held in open court with full legal representation. I express gratitude to Ms Charlotte Avery, representing the Crown, and to Mr Felix Langdon, appearing on your behalf pursuant to your Legal Aid representation. Both counsel have submitted comprehensive oral and written representations, to which the court has paid careful attention. A probation pre-sentence report has been commissioned and is awaited. Given the complexity of your personal circumstances and the necessity to weigh risk, harm, and rehabilitative prospects, I reserve judgment and direct that final sentencing be deferred until all assessments are completed, including any further relevant medical or social service contributions. It is a lamentable truth that delays await in such cases, but none can be allowed to compromise the fairness of the process or the thoroughness of appropriate evaluation. The court emphasises that these remarks are provided to frame the general landscape of sentencing considerations and should not prejudice any final determination. These remarks are issued this 19th day of September 2025 in Court 8 at Plymouth Crown Court. The hearing has been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record will be forwarded to appropriate authorities, including the National Archive of Sentencing Outcomes. Mr H is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, Section 49, are currently engaged. Costs are reserved.
