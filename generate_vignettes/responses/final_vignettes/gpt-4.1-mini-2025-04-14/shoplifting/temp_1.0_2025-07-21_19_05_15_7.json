MR H Case No. M2025/13457 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. Royston Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in respect of a charge arising under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to incidents of shoplifting carried out in various retail establishments within the Greater Manchester area spanning a period from mid-2023 to early 2025. This court must therefore undertake a careful and measured assessment of the facts before it, while reflecting not only upon the circumstances of the offence, but also on the wider context within which such offending occurs. Procedural Background You were arrested on 20 March 2025 following an investigation led by officers attached to the Greater Manchester Retail Crime Task Force, working in close concert with multiple business crime reduction units and local council enforcement teams. The investigation involved a systematic gathering of CCTV footage, witness statements, and the recovery of physical evidence from your residence. This operation was noted for its multi-agency involvement, including assistance from the City of Manchester Forensic Data Unit, whose technical expertise was engaged to enhance and authenticate relevant digital recordings. Such concerted efforts serve to highlight the significant public resources expended on cases involving what might otherwise be dismissed as “minor” acquisitive offences; a reminder of the challenges faced by modern policing when addressing persistent retail crime. I must record a note of some disappointment at the delays caused in obtaining necessary forensic examination results, largely attributable to backlogs within the forensic service provider. These delays necessitated the adjournment of the initial sentencing hearing scheduled for late July 2025 in order to allow the disclosure process to be properly completed. This is, regrettably, far from unusual and speaks to enduring issues within public sector forensic capacity. While not something for which any individual party is responsible, such systemic delays impose considerable strain upon defendants, victims, and the court alike. It is to be hoped that ongoing initiatives to expand forensic laboratory facilities will alleviate these bottlenecks in the medium term. It is also appropriate to make brief mention of the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of your case materials. As noted in correspondence lodged on behalf of your solicitor, applications for funding to instruct an independent clinical forensic psychologist were made in early April but were met with initial refusals and repeated requests for additional clarification. The administrative inefficiencies inherent in this process were regrettable and, as with forensic delays, contribute to the risk that justice is deferred unnecessarily. I sincerely hope that pending reforms to the administration of legal aid will expedite the commissioning of expert reports in future cases. Your case was allocated to this Crown Court under the Criminal Procedure Rules’ Better Case Management (BCM) framework, with hearings proceeding in a generally timely manner save for the aforementioned adjournments occasioned by disclosure delays. Plea and trial preparation hearings took place on 2 June and 12 August respectively, at which times you elected initially to plead not guilty. However, following the service of further CCTV evidence and forensic analysis linking you to key items, you ultimately entered a plea of guilty on 10 September 2025. This change in plea, while welcomed, was regrettably late in the process, following extensive case preparation by the Crown and defence. The court must emphasize that credit for guilty pleas operates not as a pure discount but as recognition of the benefits that an early admission of responsibility brings to the administration of justice — in terms of resources conserved and witnesses spared the distress of trial. A plea entered at a late stage offers less mitigation, as was explored by the Court of Appeal in R v. Hammond [2023] EWCA Crim 745, where the timing of the plea was deemed integral to the assessment of credit available. That decision followed earlier guidance in R v. Patterson [2021] EWCA Crim 1608, which similarly upheld restrictions on credit for pleas coming at or near trial. It is also worthy of acknowledgment that the offences in which you stand convicted, while lacking any element of threat or violence, demonstrate a degree of planning and persistence not to be overlooked. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Bentley [2020] EWCA Crim 1354 serves as a useful comparative authority, illustrating that repeated thefts from retail premises by a defendant with previous convictions warrant sentences reflecting both deterrence and denunciation. Bentley also recognises the significance of harm caused not merely in monetary terms but in the psychological impact on staff and communities. While your conduct fell short of the aggravated circumstances in Bentley, the principle remains sound. It is also with some regret that this court must record the lack of media interest in matters of acquisitive crime, even where persistent offending strains the fabric of local commerce and community life. Despite the openness of such proceedings and the availability of public access, it appears such cases carry insufficient newsworthiness to attract coverage. This apparent selective attention arguably diminishes public awareness of the everyday realities of retail crime and its cumulative effects. The Court is likewise mindful of the broader pattern of acquisitive offending in the region, as outlined in the annual report produced by the Northern Retail Crime Partnership, which notes a 12% increase in retail theft incidents over the past year, with a substantial proportion attributable to repeat offenders. For completeness, I should mention that your defence team provided a supporting letter from your sister, Mrs K. H., who describes you as a “reserved but fundamentally decent person faced with considerable adversity.” Several letters from representatives of local charity organisations offering assistance with housing and substance misuse concerns were also submitted in advance of this hearing, reflecting ongoing engagement with voluntary sector providers. The court appreciates such contributions, as they offer a fuller picture of an individual’s circumstances beyond the purely procedural. It is noteworthy that, unlike many other cases, no co-defendants are involved. Previous cases dealing with criminal gangs and organised retail theft rings have demonstrated an escalation in offending behaviour and harm — such as R v. Chilvers [2018] EWCA Crim 2045, where multiple defendants operated a professionalised shoplifting syndicate with coercive dynamics and territorial disputes resulting in violence and intimidation. Such cases lie beyond the scope of these proceedings, but provide context to the diverse spectrum of behaviours and risks linked to acquisitive crime. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. I turn now to matters concerning the nature of your offending. The pattern of behaviour identified in your case reveals several hallmark features of persistent shoplifting: repeated visits to similar establishments, operation on civilian hours to avoid peak staffing, and the use of improvised concealment methods. CCTV footage submitted reveals you entering retail premises dressed in layered clothing, carrying large bags which were subsequently filled with goods without payment. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. On occasion, you were seen lingering near certain product aisles — often toiletries and small electronic accessories — waiting for moments in which employees were preoccupied, often during brief lulls in foot traffic or during shift handovers. This suggests a degree of calculation rather than impulsivity, which carries weight in assessing culpability. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. Complementing the physical evidence were witness statements from shop assistants who described feelings of unease and frustration arising from repeated exposure to your conduct. Some staff took steps to modify their working patterns, including the implementation of buddy systems and enhanced on-floor presence during vulnerable periods. These measures, while commendable, underscore the emotional and operational toll your offending exacted. Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. Further, reports from the retail security teams note that while no direct threats were made, the atmosphere generated by your persistent presence contributed to a climate of anxiety impinging on day-to-day functionality. This reflects the harm detailed in R v. Tipping [2019] EWCA Crim 1452, where repeated targeting of small businesses engendered psychological distress disproportionate to the financial loss involved. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. Parallel to the criminal proceeding, correspondence from the Manchester Retail Support Network detailed approaches made to you offering diversionary programmes, including access to budgeting advice, vocational support, and cognitive-behavioural workshops targeting acquisitive offending tendencies. These offers were initially contemplated but, according to reports, not consistently engaged with. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. A pre-sentence psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Harriet K. Simmons, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was commissioned following concerns raised by your defence. Her assessment, received on 30 September 2025, concluded that you do not meet diagnostic criteria for any major psychiatric disorder but display traits suggestive of impulsivity and difficulties with emotional regulation. Dr Simmons also remarked on a moderate degree of depressive symptomatology linked to housing instability and unemployment. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The report notes your acknowledgment of financial stressors and limited social supports but highlights an inconsistent pattern of service engagement. Of concern is the report’s finding that while some motivation for change exists, there is a significant risk of relapse into acquisitive behaviour absent active intervention. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. These professional observations echo the findings of a probation officer’s report dated 1 October 2025, which emphasises the challenges presented by your current lack of stable accommodation and sporadic contact with support services. The probation officer, Ms Cassandra Patel, notes the systemic pressures facing frontline staff, referencing ongoing shortages and increased caseloads which impact the timeliness and quality of required supervision. It is important to briefly touch on the issue of housing provision in Greater Manchester, which, as elsewhere, faces considerable demand exceeding supply. Temporary accommodation placements have risen sharply, placing strain on local authorities and voluntary organisations alike; these societal pressures form an unavoidable backdrop to cases such as yours. While it may be tempting to interpret such contextual difficulties as causal or excusive, the court reiterates that personal responsibility remains paramount. The law does not countenance the reduction of legal accountability simply by reference to external hardship. This is a hard truth but a necessary one for the maintenance of public confidence in the justice system. You are 34 years old. Your previous record includes three convictions for shoplifting dating back over the past five years. These previous convictions and their attendant disposals—including a community order with curfew requirement—must figure heavily in the overall sentencing calculus. Despite prior warnings and interventions, your offending persisted, signalling a pattern resistant to informal management. There is no evidence of coercion or gang involvement in your history. Nor is there indication of complicity in offences beyond those before this court. The court is made aware that your current accommodation is temporary housing arranged through municipal emergency schemes. This is consistent with evidence that housing insecurity correlates strongly with persistence of acquisitive offending. However, such correlation does not equate to causation; while supportive and stable housing is conducive to rehabilitation, the absence thereof is not a license to offend. Your solicitor and probation officer have requested that the court consider community-based sentences incorporating rehabilitative activities. This court acknowledges their arguments and will await the forthcoming full pre-sentence report but emphasises that such proposals must be realistic and enforceable, with a view to proper public protection. Turning to sentencing principles, the approach outlined by the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guidelines (2023 edition) remains authoritative. The guidelines instruct that offences involving persistent targeting of certain types of goods, repeat offending, and impact upon staffing and other victims should attract sentences reflecting those aggravating features. I am also mindful of the principles expressed in the recently promulgated judgment R v. Finlayson [2024] EWCA Crim 89, where the appellate court recognised that acquisitive offending—though often low in individual monetary impact—may cumulatively erode social trust and justify custodial sentences to achieve deterrence. To place matters in further context, I observe that matters of acquisitive crime have long posed significant challenges to policing and community agencies. The advent of multi-agency crime partnerships seeks to coordinate responses but is hampered by resource constraints and data-sharing limitations, as noted in the 2022 Home Office Report on Retail Crime Collaboration. In light of all the above, I shall direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, incorporating the completed psychiatric assessment and any further information arising from probation interviews and community service provider feedback. The report should explore the feasibility of community-cohort supervision programmes addressing acquisitive offending, as trialled in adjoining jurisdictions, alongside any current risk management measures. I relieve all parties of the obligation to produce further forensic evidence as matters stand but allow the defence the opportunity to update representations following the report’s completion. Mr H, I remind you that your late guilty plea attracts a reduced discount and that the court will weigh heavily your previous convictions and the persistent nature of this offending. Credit is nevertheless given for your eventual plea. The hearing today has been conducted in open court with full participation from prosecution and defence representatives. My thanks to Ms Laura Jacobs, appearing for the Crown, and to Mr Adam Fairchild, who represents you under a Legal Aid representation order. Today's proceedings have been audio-recorded and transcribed in conformity with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules (CrimPR). The record will be held at Manchester Crown Court for requisite purposes. You are hereby notified of your statutory right to appeal this decision within 28 days as prescribed under sections 108 and following of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions in force pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 or otherwise. Costs remain reserved. These sentencing remarks are issued this 14th day of October 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. The formal sentencing hearing will be scheduled following receipt of the probation pre-sentence report and any final submissions.
