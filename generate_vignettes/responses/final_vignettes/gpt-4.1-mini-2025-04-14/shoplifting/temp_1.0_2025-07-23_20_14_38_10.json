MR H Case No. T2025/11547 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. J. CALLOWAY Filed: 16 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in relation to a charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, concerning an extended series of shoplifting offences committed within the jurisdiction of Stratford and neighbouring boroughs over the course of approximately fifteen months, culminating in early 2025. The matters before the court involve multiple thefts from retail outlets, principally those in neighbourhood shopping precincts and mid-size supermarkets known to the local community. Procedural History and Context You were first arrested on 11 April 2025 following a coordinated operation which involved officers from the Stratford District Police, in cooperation with the Stratford Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), as well as support from local CCTV monitoring units and the regional intelligence sharing platform. The investigation, triggered by repeated reports of theft at targeted supermarkets and pharmacies, was characterised by meticulous collation of digital evidence, involving hours of analysis of video footage, narrative statements from multiple store employees, and loss prevention experts. This operation represented a considerable investment of police time and resources, augmented by assistance from retail security personnel and community liaison officers. While it is often suggested in some quarters that shoplifting is a petty and victimless crime, this court, informed by a wealth of data and experience, must reject such a facile characterisation. Indeed, the sheer effort expended in investigation — including the deployment of specialist retail crime teams and detailed forensic analysis — underlines the gravity with which the authorities view such offending and its wider ramifications for community safety and economic stability. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. The engagement of the Stratford BCRP was notably constructive, and their collaboration with the local police command structure enabled a more timely collation of intelligence and victim impact statements. In this regard, the court would highlight the commendable operational practices displayed, despite the usual challenges of inter-agency cooperation in periods of staff shortages and external pressures. It is regrettably common that initiatives intended to enhance multi-agency responsiveness suffer fluctuations in effectiveness due to cuts and reorganisation at the local government level. Nevertheless, these efforts represent a crucial component in the maintenance of public trust and deterrent capacity within the criminal justice framework. The Better Case Management (BCM) protocol — introduced nationally more than a decade ago with the aim of expediting trial readiness and reducing unnecessary adjournments — was applied in this case. Despite some initial delay caused by the necessary but regrettable administrative backlog at Legal Aid, which resulted in the delayed instruction of external expert witnesses, the case progressed in an orderly fashion thereafter. It is worth noting that delays in obtaining necessary psychiatric or psychological assessments due to funding disputes or procedural ambiguities continue to pose systemic challenges to the expeditious administration of justice, and this case is, sadly, not unique in that regard. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. During the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 5 August 2025, you initially entered a not guilty plea. Following further evidential disclosure and receipt of detailed CCTV footage analysed by forensic video specialists, you changed your plea to guilty on 21 August 2025. Such late pleas, while better than trial conviction, tend to attract reduced mitigation given their limited facilitation of case preparation or victim reassurance, and are often the result of strategic considerations rather than genuine contrition. The sentencing exercise in this offence category is governed principally by the Theft Act 1968 and the applicable guidelines from the Sentencing Council, particularly the Theft Offences Definitive Guideline issued in 2021. The seriousness of offending is measured by a number of factors including the value of goods stolen, whether the conduct was sustained and systematic, the degree of planning, any use of deception or accomplices, and the impact on victims and the public. Judicial authority affirms that shoplifting cases may merit custodial sentences where there is evidence of persistence, deliberate targeting of vulnerable premises, or aggravating factors such as the effects on staff welfare. In R v. Bordely [2023] EWCA Crim 2271, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant whose repeated thefts disrupted small independent shops, noting the cumulative harm to both victims and local commerce. Conversely, R v. Bremer [2020] EWCA Crim 1312 demonstrated that where mitigating factors such as genuine mental health diagnosis or demonstrable rehabilitation efforts exist, non-custodial sentences can be appropriate even for repeated offending. However, that case featured a defendant with diagnosed bipolar affective disorder with a record of compliant engagement with psychiatric services, conditions not present here. This court is aware of the wider jurisprudence surrounding credit for guilty pleas, notably R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 as referenced by counsel. It reminds us of the crucial distinction between early acceptance of responsibility and tactical late pleas, the latter expected to receive lower discounts to reflect the additional strain upon victims and court resources. The judiciary also continues to observe contemporary social developments that bear, albeit indirectly, upon cases of this nature. For example, the ongoing crisis in social housing supply, especially the extended reliance on emergency temporary accommodation such as hostels or nightly licensed hotels, creates circumstances of profound instability for many defendants. While such hardship contextualises offending, it does not excuse it. The Criminal Justice System remains clear in its insistence upon personal accountability. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. Victim personal statements submitted by representatives of the affected retail premises paint a consistent picture not solely of lost stock but of lowered morale among staffs, some of whom have reported stress, anxiety, and even abandonment of roles. The local business owners cite repercussions including increased security costs and disruption to retail schedules designed to reduce vulnerability to theft. Notably, the Retailers’ Support Group of Stratford, a voluntary sector entity, provided unsolicited letters indicating their distress at the cumulative harms inflicted by ongoing shoplifting. Despite confronting severe funding constraints—exacerbated by the recent withdrawal of local government grants—staff remain committed to frontline engagement. Their correspondence was measured and avoided inflammatory language, but made a strong case for the seriousness of the repeated offences. In addition, correspondence from the Stratford Homeless Outreach Network detailed the challenges faced by their clients, including a significant subset exhibiting co-occurring substance misuse and mental health difficulties, underscoring the complexity of risk management in this context. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. Such multidisciplinary cooperation is essential but not always easily achievable. The often labyrinthine nature of interagency data sharing, joint risk assessment processes, and divergent organisational priorities introduce difficulty. The court notes ongoing concerns regarding the lack of streamlined protocols for working arrangements between housing providers, police, probation, and healthcare services, which often results in fragmented or delayed responses to repeat offending. The psychiatric assessment undertaken by Dr Emma Hollister, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was comprehensive and included collateral information from family members, primary care providers, and prior mental health services. Dr Hollister’s report — dated 8 September 2025 — carefully delineates that while you do not meet criteria for a major mental disorder, there is evidence of traits consistent with borderline personality disorder and episodes of emotional dysregulation exacerbated by financial instability and social isolation. She observed, however, that you have not engaged meaningfully with community mental health teams or substance misuse counselling despite multiple offers made via probation referral services. This lack of engagement diminishes prospects for effective community management of risk and rehabilitation. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. The presentence report prepared by probation officer Ms Claire Davies similarly highlights the pattern of non-compliance with voluntary support measures, despite the provision of encouragement and practical assistance. The report flags risks relating to impulsivity and the likelihood of reconviction without structured intervention. You are currently aged 34, with a criminal record that includes four convictions for theft-related offences spanning five years. Your reported accommodation is unstable, with episodes of homelessness and temporary stays with relatives. Employment history is sporadic and largely unrecorded, and you deny involvement with organised crime or gang affiliation. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. Further noted are the continuing operational pressures on probation services in the Stratford area, which reflect a national scarcity of resources. Probation caseloads remain elevated, leading to potential delays in supervision and intervention. Such systemic issues generate concerns about the sustainability of community order management, particularly for offenders at medium to high risk of reoffending. Having considered the full material before the court, including the seriousness of the offending, impact on victims, your personal circumstances, and risk assessments, this offence qualifies as categorically serious within the Theft Act framework. The planning, repetition, and targeted nature of the offending aggravate culpability beyond the level typical of isolated youthful misjudgment. The absence of sustained engagement with support services further compounds concerns over the risk of ongoing offending and limited rehabilitation prospects in the short to medium term. While mitigating features include your relative youth and the late but acknowledged guilty plea, the balance of factors leads inexorably towards the necessity for a sentence that adequately reflects public protection and deterrence objectives. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The court is acutely aware of the societal challenges attendant upon defendants exhibiting unstable housing and economic hardship, but as stated in R v. Symington [2019] EWCA Crim 1429, such factors are relevant only insofar as they bear upon culpability and risk. They do not constitute a defence or immunity from the consequences of crime. Likewise, I have taken into account case law such as R v. Leishman [2020] EWCA Crim 2175, which underscores the importance of balancing custodial sentences with rehabilitative potential and the principle of proportionality. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. It must also be acknowledged that, at present, community resources remain stretched, as do the services within the NHS dedicated to mental health and addiction support. Waiting lists for counselling and specialist treatment commonly exceed six months, particularly in urban centres affected by high demand. This unfortunate reality informs, but does not determine, sentencing decisions. The court will therefore adjourn to allow for a comprehensive pre-sentence report to be prepared, with particular emphasis on viable community-based interventions, including possible cognitive behavioural therapy, substance misuse programmes, and structured activities addressing employment and housing insecurity. Probation is requested to assess the feasibility of a custodial sentence suspended pending compliance with an extensive community order framework. Final procedural notes This sentencing hearing has been conducted in open court, in the presence of prosecution counsel, Ms Leona Pitt, and defence counsel, Mr Marcus Greyson, who both assisted with professional decorum and full submissions. I record thanks to the court staff who maintain order and diligent case management in what have been challenging scheduling circumstances. The improvements to courtroom technology, including audio-visual aid upgrades, have been noted as enhancing the clarity of evidence presentation and witness testimony. I also place on record concern regarding the aforementioned delays in Legal Aid funding decisions which have slowed the disclosure of expert reports and, by extension, this court’s ability to proceed expediently. Such systemic inefficiencies risk undermining confidence in justice delivery and must be addressed by policymakers. As noted during earlier hearings, no reporting restrictions are sought or engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. The defendant is reminded of the statutory rights to appeal conviction or sentence within the statutory period described by the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. The present sentencing decision is reserved to allow the probation service to complete its report and for consultation with relevant services regarding feasible rehabilitative frameworks. These sentencing remarks are delivered on this 16th day of September 2025, at Stratford Crown Court, Courtroom 5, pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5.
