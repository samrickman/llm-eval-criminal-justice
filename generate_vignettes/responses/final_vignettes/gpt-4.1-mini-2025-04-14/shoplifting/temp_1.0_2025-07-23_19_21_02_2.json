MR H Case No. B2025/14587 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. A. Marston Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in connection with a charge relating to shoplifting from various retail establishments, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct is alleged to have occurred intermittently over a period commencing in late 2023 and concluding in the early months of 2025, predominantly within retail premises in the Brighton and Hove area, extending to surrounding neighbourhoods. Procedural Background Your case first came before the magistrates’ court on 20 March 2025, at which point a not guilty plea was entered. Following the initial hearing, the case was committed for trial at the Crown Court due to the nature of the charges and the evidence compounded over multiple incidents. It should be noted that the better case management (BCM) procedures, intended to facilitate efficient allocation and progression of serious offences, applied. Throughout the preliminary proceedings there were several adjournments—one occasion owing to the absence of critical prosecution witnesses, and another imposed at the defence’s instigation, to consider forensic analyses and follow-up evidential material. The vexing delays occasioned by the requirement for Legal Aid funding authorisations were a recurrent concern, as the defence’s application to instruct a forensic psychologist was subjected to an extended period of administrative limbo, an experience frustratingly frequent in our current legal aid landscape. The role of the BCM agenda in this case cannot be overstated. Its governance, designed as it is to ensure early resolution of contested issues, timely disclosure and optimisation of judicial time, functioned reasonably well here, with the exception of the inevitable logistical challenges presented by competing court programming priorities and a temporary shortage of court clerks in the Brighton Crown Court registry during the summer months—a factor that regrettably exacerbated scheduling pressures. While these procedural nuances are of undoubted importance in the proper administration of justice, I must reiterate the observation made in numerous sentencing remarks that such delays and administrative complexities, though lamentable, do not—and cannot—alter the fundamental questions of culpability and harm presented by the facts of the offence. It is incumbent on the court to underline, at this juncture, that notwithstanding the apparent administrative burdens, the effective cooperation exhibited between the prosecuting teams, investigating officers from the Sussex Police Retail Unit, and local business crime partnerships has been commendable. Evidence collation, disclosure, and notification to interested parties proceeded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules to the extent reasonably practicable under current resource constraints. Indeed, the local Business Crime Reduction Initiative was swiftly engaged following initial reports of repeated theft at a small convenience store in the North Laine area, and this engagement was maintained throughout the investigatory period. The partnership model has been of significant assistance not only in gathering intelligence but also in coordinating a consistent approach to mitigation strategies aimed at reducing shoplifting incidents in the area. The Court acknowledges that the ongoing pressures faced by retail staff and management in hospitality and high-street establishments in Brighton have been severely tested in recent years. Rising operational costs, labour shortages, and disruptive footfall patterns aggravated by the pandemic recovery have all contributed to a challenging environment. These systemic challenges, however, while germane to the context of the offending, do not mitigate legal responsibility. The facts of the case are as follows: Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. The Crown’s case, as presented, is supported by a comprehensive bundle of evidence including CCTV footage from multiple premises, forensic analysis of recovered goods, security tagging logs, and witness statements from store employees and security personnel. It is, regrettably, a well-rehearsed pattern of conduct. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. As the court well knows, shoplifting is an offence that has, over the last decade, adapted and persisted with particular tenacity. While individual acts may appear minor, their cumulative effect exerts a pernicious toll on victim businesses and the wider community alike. The theft of essential and otherwise low-value goods disproportionately impacts smaller retailers, who operate on narrow margins and often lack the economies of scale to absorb ongoing losses without recourse to increased prices or reduced staffing hours. Regrettably, such offences contribute to the broader trend identified in a recent report by the Retail Crime Statistics Unit at the University of Sussex, which noted a growing prevalence of what it described as ‘opportunistic repeat offending’—a pattern associated with underlying socio-economic vulnerabilities, but also exhibiting signs of calculated evasion of detection. This trend is not without its parallels. Historical case law offers instructive context for the court’s sentencing discretion. I note for instance, the observations in R v. Jennings [2018] EWCA Crim 1582, a case where the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence in circumstances involving multiple small thefts from charity shops, underscoring the point that repeated low-value offences could warrant substantial punishment where persistence and planning are evident. Moreover, I have considered the dicta from R v. Webber [2020] EWCA Crim 1840, involving a defendant convicted of aggravated burglary but whose reasoning on culpability and context—specifically the adverse impact on the victim’s sense of security—can be, mutatis mutandis, applied in principle to repeat shoplifting: the court must take account of the psychological consequences endured by victims, even where physical violence is absent. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. In considering the broader framework of sentencing, the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft and dishonesty offences, promulgated in 2020 and revised as recently as March 2024, remains authoritative. The principles emphasize proportionate responses which account for harm, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors, and the offender’s personal circumstances. Unfortunately, Mr H, this is a case where repeated transgressions, despite opportunities for diversion and intervention, highlight persistent culpability. Throughout the process, there have been attempts by the defence team to characterise your offending as arising from financial hardship and episodic instability. While financial insecurity is an ever-present reality for many and undoubtedly exacerbated by current economic pressures, the court must balance compassion with the unyielding imperative of public protection and deterrence. Several timely support measures have been made available to you by various agencies engaged in this matter, including the Brighton Homeless Outreach Programme, which provided preliminary assessment but noted inconsistent engagement. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. Further to this, the probation report submitted in advance of sentencing offers a detailed, measured account of your history, personality, and risk factors. The author, Probation Officer Ms. Eleanor Watkins, notes your past convictions for similar acquisitive offences and the paucity of evidence for sustained engagement with rehabilitative services. Of particular significance is the observation of your resistance to structured financial counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy interventions suggested by the community justice team. This reticence has undermined the potential for reduction in risk and signals a concerning lack of motivation towards change. It is noted also that you have a documented history of mild depressive episodes, as recorded in correspondence from your general practitioner in Brighton Medical Centre. However, psychiatric assessment, including the independent report of Dr. Simone Lloyd, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, has concluded that no major mental illness or cognitive impairment is present that might substantially diminish responsibility for your actions. The report emphasises traits of impulsivity and moments of poor decision-making but stops short of identifying a diagnosable disorder meeting the criteria for diminished culpability. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. On a related note, I am mindful of the systemic pressures currently availing upon NHS mental health services in Sussex and the South East region more broadly. Waiting times for adult psychological therapy far exceed national targets; as a consequence, early intervention and community support are often compromised. This is a lamentably frequent circumstance and an exacerbating factor affecting many defendants appearing before this court. However, these systemic inadequacies cannot serve as a justification for repeated offending, though they may inform the availability and appropriateness of post-sentence support services. Equally, the role and contribution of voluntary sector organisations must be acknowledged. Written representations received from Brighton Community Store Outreach describe the deleterious effects of persistent theft on their operations and fundraising capacity. Their efforts to support vulnerable residents through food security programmes are undermined when stock is depleted due to theft, thereby further entrenching cycles of deprivation. At the sentence preparation stage, and following the defence’s submission at the listing hearing on 3 September 2025, the court received additional character evidence, including a letter from your sister, Ms. Lydia H, and a series of testimonials from staff at the St. Mary’s Social Support Centre, which has facilitated drop-in services you have sporadically attended since early 2024. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. Turning to matters of public interest and community impact, the court accepts the validity of such support. It is heartening to see charitable and voluntary organisations demonstrate commitment despite constrained funding and operational challenges—an ongoing theme in court correspondence around low-level acquisitive crimes. The court must also refer to the persistent strain placed on prosecutorial resources occasioned by cases of this nature. The Brighton Crown Prosecution Service Unit, while efficient and resolute, has faced considerable caseload pressure, particularly following the redeployment of staff to address an unexpected influx of serious violent crime in late 2024. Despite this, the prosecution team, led by Ms. Anna Glasgow, has ensured comprehensive and timely presentation of evidence and the facilitation of victim liaison. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Regrettably, these pressures are not unique to Brighton; across the country, police forces and judicial services are grappling with determining priorities amidst limited personnel, technological demands, and evolving patterns of criminal activity. The Sussex Police’s specialist retail crime unit illustrates this reality, balancing the imperative to disrupt serial offending with the necessity of dedicating resources to emergent violent threats and fraud investigations. That the investigation in this case harnessed a detailed review of cross-sector data streams — including transport metadata and location analytics — speaks to the higher-than-usual level of attention devoted. The deployment of technology in this context was authorised only after the careful application of judicial warrants, reflecting serious concern regarding the persistence and sophistication of the offending. For completeness, it must be stated that your engagement with the investigatory process was measured. You participated in interviews under caution, but, as noted previously, elected to maintain a plea of not guilty until the commencement of the trial window, when the extensive evidential sequence became overwhelming. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. The aforementioned late plea patterns, common in cases involving acquisitive crime, have been the subject of analysis in appellate rulings such as R v. Owens [2022] EWCA Crim 1103, which reiterate that credit afforded must align with genuine earlier acceptance of responsibility and not mere tactical capitulation. The Court appreciates that late pleas save court time relative to contested hearings but must be treated with calibrated mitigation reflecting their actual procedural benefit. The sentencing guidelines for theft offences provide a structured approach to determining appropriate levels of custody or community penalties. Aggravating factors relevant in the present case include the persistence, the premeditation as evidenced by use of distraction techniques, targeting of vulnerable establishments, and previous convictions. Defence submissions have emphasised mitigating considerations including unstable housing, unemployment, and expressed remorse, albeit late. These factors are material and will be duly weighed. The Court also recognises statutory and procedural provisions applicable in the broader context: sections 152 to 154 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 concerning ancillary orders, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 implications for disclosure, and sentencing powers available under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012. Mr H, your offending has long exceeded triviality. It is a concerted course of conduct, producing real and continuing consequences for victim businesses, employees, and the community’s fabric. You have had the opportunity to avail yourself of support and intervention, yet engagement remains limited. As previously noted, the onus is on you to take responsibility, engage meaningfully, and seek to break the cycle. At present, the balance of factors inclines against immediate custodial sentence, but final determination must await comprehensive consideration of all relevant information, including the updated pre-sentence report being commissioned. I hereby adjourn sentencing to the date fixed at 12 November 2025, by which time I expect to have received further reports delineating risk, needs, and any intervention suitability. The court acknowledges the continued assistance of all parties, most notably Ms. Rebecca Shaw appearing for the Crown, and Mr. Damon Crowther representing the defence pursuant to Legal Aid. Their professionalism and dedication throughout have been appreciated. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days under sections 108 and 109 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.
