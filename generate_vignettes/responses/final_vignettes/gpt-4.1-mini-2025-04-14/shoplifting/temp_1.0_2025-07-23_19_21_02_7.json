MR H Case No. T2025/15843 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. R. FLETCHER Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of theft from retail premises, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending, while catalogued under a single count, epitomises a sustained pattern of behaviour involving repeated shoplifting across various establishments in the Bristol city centre over a protracted period. Procedural Background You were first arrested on 11 July 2025 following an investigation coordinated by the Bristol Metropolitan Police Retail Crime Unit in partnership with the Bristol and Bath Business Crime Reduction Initiative. This case arises following months of surveillance, store intelligence collation, and information-sharing meetings convened among local stakeholders, including retail security managers and representatives from the Safer Bristol Partnership. The offence has been progressed under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, an initiative designed to streamline procedural adherence, ensure timely disclosure, and expedite case resolution with due regard for the rights of all parties concerned. It is regrettable that, notwithstanding these procedural aims, the matter experienced intermittent delays attributable to the administration of Legal Aid funding for expert reports and competing listing priorities arising from judicial strike action earlier this year. On 11 July, you were taken into police custody and informed of your rights. Interviewed pursuant to your statutory entitlements, you initially denied involvement. However, the prosecution disclosed a detailed selection of CCTV footage and witness statements which, when analysed in conjunction with contemporaneous stock-loss records and the results of forensic examination of clothing seized from your residence, painted a compelling and cohesive evidential picture. Subsequent to full disclosure and pre-trial hearings conducted under the auspices of District Judge Mellor, you entered a guilty plea on 18 September 2025, some six weeks after your initial appearance. It bears noting—though peripheral to the matter before the court—that recent reviews of the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative processes, including the independent report published in March 2025 by the Justice Efficiency Commission, have highlighted systemic inefficiencies in the authorisation and funding of expert psychological assessments. In this case, your defence application to instruct a consultant forensic psychologist was delayed on account of protracted correspondence, necessitating multiple re-submissions before approval was granted in mid-August. Such delays are symptomatic of deeper structural problems besetting representation in criminal proceedings—a matter of concern for the judiciary, practitioners, and policymakers alike. The court acknowledges the professional diligence of Ms Hayley Preston barrister, who appears for the Crown, and of Mr Simon Clarke instructed for the defence pursuant to a representation order granted under the Legal Aid scheme. Their submissions have been thorough, nuanced, and served with commendable courtesy notwithstanding the pressures under which the administration of justice continues to operate in an era marked by budgetary restraint and rising caseloads. In its wider sociological context, this case unfolds against a backdrop of persistent and escalating retail theft in urban centres throughout the United Kingdom, a phenomenon well-documented in recent criminological literature. Studies such as those published in the Journal of Crime and Prevention Studies, Issue 47, 2024, indicate that theft offences in retail environments are often characterised by a confluence of factors including economic precarity, substance misuse, and localised social fragmentation. While it would be facile to attribute offending purely to socio-economic variables, the court recognises that such contextualisation is valuable insofar as it informs the construction of rehabilitative sentencing options. However, such analysis remains ancillary to the primary concern of the court, which is to issue a proportionate response to the gravity of the conduct charged. I further wish to commend the efforts of personnel within the Bristol Retail Support Network, whose voluntary engagement with impacted businesses provides vital assistance and contributes to community resilience. Their comprehensive victim impact statements illustrate not only the tangible financial damages sustained but also a pervasive sense of insecurity among retail staff—a dimension of harm that is often overlooked in weighing sentence appropriateness. The offence itself, as properly understood in law, centres on the dishonest appropriation with the intention to permanently deprive. The Theft Act 1968 remains the cornerstone statute governing such offences, its legislative framework supplemented by the Sentencing Council’s guideline published in 2021, which emphasises the necessity of considering the offender’s culpability, the harm caused, and any relevant aggravating or mitigating features. The appellate authority provides further guidance. To cite the seminal case of R v. Dias [2019] EWCA Crim 384, the Court of Appeal underscored that repeated dishonesty offences, even where individually of modest value, cumulatively demonstrate a significant breach of public trust warranting stringent sentencing measures. Similarly, in R v. Hamid [2022] EWCA Crim 721, the court reaffirmed the principle that offences against small independent retailers attract particular scrutiny, given their vulnerability and the outsized impact of loss on their operations. Of tangential interest but no direct bearing on this case, it is worth recalling R v. Aldridge [2020] EWCA Crim 1104, which concerned a defendant convicted of fly-tipping hazardous waste in a protected greenbelt zone. There, the court imposed a custodial sentence reflecting the environmental damage and public health risk engendered, notwithstanding the absence of personal injury. That case, whilst instructive as a demonstration of sentencing consistency, differs markedly in both conduct and impact from the matter before this court. Similarly, reference may be made to the decisions in R v. Barrow [2018] EWCA Crim 1993 (possession of a bladed article in a school car park) and R v. Newcastle [2017] EWCA Crim 1420 (criminal damage to a church noticeboard), neither of which has relevance save to illustrate the breadth of offences regularly prosecuted through Crown Court structures. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. The facts giving rise to your conviction are both straightforward and disquieting. You adopted a modus operandi characterised by repeated penetration of retail premises during peak trading hours, employing a variety of concealment techniques and taking advantage of staff distraction—at times involving multiple accomplices, though there is no evidence that you co-ordinated criminal enterprise beyond your own actions. The impact of your offending must be considered in its full breadth. Not only was there loss of retail stock, but also disruption to business operations, increased security expenditure, and emotional distress caused to employees — effects compounded by the repetition inherent in your conduct. In reviewing the offending, it is necessary to reflect upon the efficacy of multi-agency interventions. The case progressed, in part, via information-sharing between police and council antisocial behaviour teams, designed to identify and disrupt suspected repeat offenders. While such collaboration is laudable and represents best practice, the present case demonstrates limitations of current preventive mechanisms when faced with persistent acquisitive offending. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. The effective application of robust retail security protocols, including the installation of electronic tagging systems and staff training in theft awareness, has been universally advocated. Nevertheless, as this case shows, determined offenders often undermine such measures through improvisation and persistence. It is thus incumbent on courts to calibrate sentencing to ensure general and specific deterrence, while also facilitating rehabilitation where appropriate. The Sentencing Council’s guideline treats repeat offending as an aggravating factor but balance must be struck. Custodial sentences for summary-level thefts may be counterproductive if not underpinned by rehabilitative provision. It is also instructive to observe that the case was delayed by rescheduling to accommodate a psychiatric evaluation. The report, undertaken by Dr Margaret Caldwell, consultant forensic psychologist, opined that you exhibit no discernible mental illness but are affected by chronic low mood and intermittent substance misuse. The assessment emphasised your limited engagement with structured support services despite multiple offers. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. Dr Caldwell’s report highlighted that impulsivity and difficulties managing financial stressors were contributory factors to your conduct. While the report commends your acknowledged willingness to accept responsibility at this stage, it regrets your previous disengagement from community services which might have mitigated risk. Such reports underscore the chronic under-resourcing evident in local mental health and social support networks, which struggle to provide responsive and tailored interventions to individuals like yourself. This remains a systemic challenge across the UK. It is noteworthy, albeit irrelevant to your individual case, that at the last sitting of this court a co-defendant in an unrelated affray involving pool cues in a public house nearby was remanded in custody. That defendant’s violent conduct contrasts markedly with the present non-violent personal conduct, but offers a salutary reminder of the range of offending that this court routinely addresses. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. Continuing with procedural detail, your case was impacted by administrative issues concerning legal representation and report commissioning. The August hearing was adjourned on account of technical failings in service of documents and the late submission of character references from charitable bodies including the Greenfield Family Trust and the Bristol Economic Support Network. Their timeliness and content were both accorded due weight in the sentencing process. Furthermore, we note the observations made by Probation Officer Ms Andrea Simmons in her pre-sentence enquiry, which detail your personal circumstances: age 34, living in supported accommodation following a recent tenancy termination, and previous convictions for similar offences including shoplifting in 2021. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. Ms Simmons notes that you have not engaged consistently with probation supervision and that while your family background is characterised by instability, you maintain some contact with siblings who have not had any criminal convictions. She stresses the need for interventions focused on financial management, coping strategies, and substance misuse. In the course of assessment, it also emerged that your housing provider had recently been issued with a local authority noise abatement notice concerning other tenants unrelated to your residency. It falls outside the ambit of this court’s consideration but underscores the broader challenges facing community agencies. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. With respect to recent appellate guidance in cases touching on similar offending, the Court of Appeal in R v. Salim [2023] EWCA Crim 1355 reaffirmed that even relatively low-value repetitive theft can justify custodial sentences where prior warnings have been given and diversions declined. The court stressed the importance of considering deterrence of others given the cumulative social cost. The court is also conscious of North Somerset Probation Service’s current staffing shortages, which delay report preparations and supervision allocations. Such workforce pressures challenge the delivery of effective community sentence management, a factual backdrop pertinent to the feasibility of non-custodial sentences. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. Besides the procedural narrative, this case also highlights the broader cultural and societal debates surrounding acquisitive offending. There is ongoing public discourse about causes ranging from economic deprivation and social exclusion to mental health issues and substance dependency. Courts must balance these considerations without yielding to sentimentality or undue leniency. On an unrelated note, it is regrettable but true that the defendant’s sister, presently not involved in these proceedings, faces charges for benefit fraud in a neighbouring jurisdiction. No inference is drawn from this regarding your conduct, but the court records it for completeness in exploring ancillary family context as submitted by probation. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. Turning to relevant principles of sentencing, the overarching aim remains the prevention of reoffending and protection of the public, in addition to punishment and reparation. The court must filter through the multiplicity of factors to arrive at a sentence consistent with the Sentencing Council’s guideline and established case law. Among aggravating features are the repeated nature of your offending, the targeting of vulnerable small business operators, and the impact on employee wellbeing. Mitigating factors principally comprise your eventual admission of guilt and some degree of personal hardship. It remains a matter of profound frustration that despite numerous opportunities to desist, and a pre-existing relationship with the Probation Service, your engagement with rehabilitative services has been inconsistent. The voluntary sector’s efforts—exemplified by organisations such as Bristol Pathways and the City Economic Development Initiative—have repeatedly attempted to support you. Your lack of stable employment and tenuous housing arrangements, while not uncommon among defendants in acquisitive crime cases, impose additional strain on overstretched public and charitable agencies, a factor of systemic concern but not justification. In light of the foregoing, the court directs that a full pre-sentence report be prepared, with particular attention paid to the following areas: your receptiveness to structured cognitive behavioural interventions, suitability for unpaid work under a community sentence, accessibility of local substance misuse programs, and the viability of supportive housing referrals. The court will invite probation to consider any existing risk management strategies and to proffer recommendations capable of reducing your likelihood of reoffending in the near and medium term. Finally, I wish to acknowledge the courtroom staff present today. The layout of this court underwent recent refurbishment, improving accessibility for all. Court ushers, clerical officers, and security personnel have facilitated proceedings efficiently despite reported delays in interpreter services owing to broader supply issues. I therefore adjourn sentencing to a date fixed for 20 November 2025, by which time the probation assessment should be complete. Meanwhile, the defendant remains on bail subject to conditions explained at earlier hearings. These are the sentencing remarks of Her Honour Judge L. R. Fletcher, delivered in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. A full transcript has been recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is hereby advised of the right to appeal within 28 days under section 108 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 Section 49 are engaged in these proceedings. Costs are reserved.
