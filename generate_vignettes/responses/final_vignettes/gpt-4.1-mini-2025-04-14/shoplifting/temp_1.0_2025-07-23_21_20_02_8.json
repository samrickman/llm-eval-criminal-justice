MR H Case No. M2025/05829 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Eleanor Winslow Filed: 13 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence following your conviction for theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a period of some 18 months and occurred across various outlets within Greater Manchester, including several independent pharmacies, convenience stores, and a small local supermarket chain with branches located in high street shopping areas. While the individual value of items taken is modest, the sustained nature of this conduct, and the considerable disruption caused, make these offences serious in the eyes of the court and the wider community. Procedural History and Case Management Your arrest took place on 7 August 2025, consequent upon an extensive investigation coordinated between Greater Manchester Police’s Business Crime Unit and the Retail Security Liaison Department. This investigation was supported by the Manchester Business Crime Reduction Partnership, which serves as a conduit for sharing intelligence between retailers, enforcement agencies, and community organisations. The partnership’s ability to cross-reference multiple incidents involving similar modus operandi was crucial in identifying you as the suspect. It must be stated that the coordination of such multi-agency efforts—while theoretically straightforward under official protocols—is often impeded by practical constraints, including agency resource shortages, competing operational priorities, and frequent staff turnover. These factors, regrettably, often result in delayed or inconsistent information sharing. However, in this instance, the partnership's cooperation appeared more cohesive than typically observed, with minutes from the coordinating meetings reflecting a commitment to swift information exchange, albeit with some procedural lapses regarding data recording. Following arrest, you were interviewed under caution on 9 August by officers from the Business Crime Unit. The interview recording and transcript form part of the evidential material considered by this court. While you initially maintained your innocence, the accumulation of cogent CCTV footage and witness statements left no reasonable doubt as to your involvement. Your solicitors subsequently indicated your intention to enter a guilty plea, which you did on 12 September. The initial hearing was listed promptly but experienced adjournments attributable largely to defence applications for further disclosure and requests for psychiatric assessment. Of note, the Legal Aid Agency encountered some procedural difficulties in processing the authorisation for commissioning a forensic psychological evaluation. Delays of this nature, while common in the current legal aid climate, are regrettable given their tendency to protract proceedings unnecessarily. Such inefficiencies underscore the chronic underfunding and administrative hurdles now commonplace in publicly funded defence representation. Equally, the Better Case Management protocol, intended to streamline charge review, disclosure, and plea processes within the Criminal Procedure Rules framework, faced challenges here. While the pre-trial timeline was generally adhered to, intermittent scheduling conflicts in this listing—related to court staffing levels and prior adjournments—required rescheduling of hearings on three occasions. The cumulative effect of these delays is a burden not only on the court system but on all participants, including witnesses and victims. Judicial observations on the delays and procedural hurdles are not simply commentary but reflect a systemic concern echoed throughout criminal justice discourse: that persistent under-resourcing and burgeoning caseloads risk undermining the equitable administration of justice, especially in offences perceived as ‘low level’. It is also appropriate to recognise the role played by the charitable retail recovery initiative Manchester Hearts Care, which provided support to victimised businesess albeit constrained by funding shortages and staff turnover. Their engagement included liaison with affected retailers and support to employees experiencing stress and anxiety due to repeat theft incidents. The written submissions received from their caseworkers were detailed and carefully balanced, refraining from emotional hyperbole while elucidating the practical impact of repeated theft on small business resilience. I record my thanks to both the prosecution, led by Ms Jacinta Fielding, and to Mr Paul Swinton, instructed under the Criminal Defence Service, who represents the defendant in these proceedings. Their professional conduct has assisted the court in advancing a just resolution despite the procedural challenges encountered. The Theft Act 1968 remains the principal statute governing the offences charged. Section 1 defines theft succinctly, yet the statutory framework is frequently supplemented by case law interpreting evidentiary standards and the contours of dishonest intention. In this case, the offences fall within the established framework for serial shop theft, a matter extensively considered by appellate courts in recent years. Of particular relevance is the decision in R v Flynn [2023] EWCA Crim 857, where the Court of Appeal reinforced the notion that repeated dishonesty, even involving low-value individual items, can amount collectively to significant harm warranting custodial sentences. Mr Flynn’s offending involved multiple thefts from convenience stores and pharmacies with a similar naked exploitative approach. Similarly, R v Esteban [2021] EWCA Crim 1319 elucidates the sentencing principle that the cumulative effect of repeated theft upon vulnerable retail staff and small business finance should be accorded appropriate weight, regardless of valuation threshold. The court in Esteban highlighted the secondary emotional and operational impacts, including employee turnover, altered rotas, and increased security measures. Though distinct from this case in offence typology, the judgment in R v Balcombe [2022] EWCA Crim 654 remains instructive insofar as it involved an offender who, despite no history of violence, was sentenced to immediate custody for orchestrating repeated thefts targeting community pharmacies with controlled substances. That ruling underscores that sentencing severity is influenced by patterns of offending and public protection imperatives rather than merely incident value. More widely, the court notes with interest the evolution of sentencing guidelines and best practices promulgated by the Sentencing Council, including the Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (2019), which emphasises culpability and harm, victim impact, and offender characteristics as key factors. In particular, aggravation applies where offenders deliberately exploit vulnerable premises or employ diversionary tactics. While none of these cases involves identical factual matrices to the matter before this court, their underlying principles and evolution provide a worthy legal framework for considering your offending conduct and subsequent reparation prospects. A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation was undertaken by Dr Elinor Moss, a Consultant Clinical Forensic Psychologist retained through Legal Aid funding. Dr Moss’s report, commissioned to elucidate any underlying psychological vulnerabilities or illness that may have bearing on culpability or sentencing, is dated 10 October 2025 and is filed with the court. Dr Moss found no evidence of psychotic disorder or major psychiatric illness. However, the assessment noted traits consistent with impulsivity, mild anxiety disorder, and episodic depressive symptoms. The report further identifies a pattern of maladaptive coping strategies, including occasional alcohol misuse and social withdrawal. Importantly, Dr Moss concluded that while these factors may mitigate in terms of impulsive behaviour, there is insufficient evidence to suggest impaired criminal responsibility or diminished capacity. Accordingly, the report recommends targeted cognitive behavioural interventions rather than custodial treatment. Dr Moss also drew attention to historic instability in your accommodation and employment status, which she described as “consistent with socio-economic disadvantage but not indicative of a psychiatric disorder.” The report remarks on a lack of engagement with mainstream support services, despite multiple outreach attempts by community agencies. The court is mindful that underfunding and shortages in postcode-specific mental health provision, as reported in the recent NHS High Intensity User Audit (2024), contribute to systemic barriers that may exacerbate such non-engagement. Alongside this clinical evaluation, a probation social enquiry report was prepared by Ms Abigail Turner, dated 11 October 2025. The report outlines your personal, familial, and social circumstances, reiterating your transient housing situation and noting prior convictions for a similar category of offences. Ms Turner comments on your expressed willingness to engage with rehabilitative programmes but highlights inconsistent past participation. Ms Turner’s report underscores the enduring strain on probation services within Greater Manchester, citing caseloads in excess of recommended limits and high demand for accredited programmes, such as the Enhanced Thinking Skills Programme, which have waiting lists that currently extend beyond six months. Collateral letters of support were submitted on your behalf by representatives of YourSpaceHub, a community centre providing outreach to former offenders, and from a sibling, Ms Fiona D., who details assurances of familial support upon your reintegration. I acknowledge these contributions, and the court is mindful of their relevance in assessing the prospects for rehabilitation balanced against the need for community protection. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. The facts of your offending, as derived from accepted evidence and the contents of the charge, reflect repeated dishonesty across multiple retail outlets. CCTV exhibits depict a methodical approach, including instances of concealment of items within personal belongings and the use of distraction techniques aimed at staff. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. The footage demonstrates not merely opportunism but a deliberate and considered modus operandi, timed to exploit periods of diminished supervision such as staff shift changes and busy transaction times. It should be recorded that one incident involved the removal of security tags using tools commonly carried, reflecting a degree of premeditation and the use of deception to override security measures. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. Victim impact statements submitted by various store employees, while describing an absence of physical threat, articulate the emotional strain and decreased morale arising from your repeated intrusions. One statement from a pharmacist detailed how persistent theft of over-the-counter medicines, some of which cater to individuals reliant on controlled but accessible treatments, led to an imposed lockdown on certain stock and altered opening hours—a measure with reputational and economic consequences. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. The cumulative financial impact on these small businesses cannot be overstated. Losses necessitated tighter security protocols, increased staffing costs, and in some instances contributed to temporary closure, exacerbating pressure on local communities already contending with economic hardship. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. It is clear, moreover, from the evidence that your behaviour did not cease despite earlier cautionary interventions, including a community resolution disposed of in early 2024. This illustrates the limitations of diversionary measures when engagement is lacking. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. Further examination of the investigation file reveals that additional intelligence was gathered regarding associated conduct involving co-defendants, whose cases are subject to separate proceedings. In particular, one co-defendant has been charged with offences including criminal damage to signage on public transport infrastructure and possession of a bladed article on school premises. While neither charge relates directly to you, the interconnected nature of these associations is of interest to those considering future risk and rehabilitation pathways. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. However, it is paramount that the court assesses your individual culpability on its own merits, distinguishing it clearly from any co-defendant’s separate offending which may involve more serious or unrelated crimes. The court is also conscious of wider social developments impacting the context of this case. The ongoing crisis in affordable housing, the rise in street homelessness, and the COVID-19 pandemic’s aftermath have collectively shaped a challenging environment. As reported in the Greater Manchester Housing Partnership Annual Review 2024, temporary accommodation placements have increased by 22% over the past two years, putting additional strain on support networks. These macro-level pressures, while significant, do not diminish individual responsibility but rather inform the complexity of rehabilitation and public protection in contemporary urban settings. The court must also remark on reports issued by the Metropolitan Police’s Digital Forensics Unit (2023), which have detailed rising backlogs in analyzing CCTV footage related to retail crime, contributing to delays in prosecution. Your case, notwithstanding, benefited from relatively prompt forensic processing, which no doubt assisted in the timely review and conclusion of investigative stages. The court recalls that the Pc Harvey v. Manchester Borough case [2019] EWCA Crim 536, although factual unrelated herein, notably emphasised the necessity for timely evidence analysis as a cornerstone of fair trial rights — a principle upheld without exception in these proceedings. Further afield, the continuing operational challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency have affected numerous cases. The agency’s recent internal review, published in their 2025 Annual Report, concedes that authorisation delays for expert reports and funding approvals remain endemic, a concern echoed by the Criminal Bar Association and reiterated in the 2025 Crown Court Users Consultative Group minutes. This prolonged bureaucratic inertia places an appreciable burden on defendants and their counsel, often extending pre-trial periods and contributing to judicial backlogs. It is a development that this court views with the utmost concern. The evolution of court protocols, particularly the Better Case Management (BCM) system, aimed at standardising advance disclosure and inter-agency coordination, continues to encounter practical implementation challenges. These include difficulties in synchronising calendars across interrelated agencies and variable compliance with required timetables, especially during periods of industrial action and staffing shortages affecting court services. Recent refurbishment of Court 4 at Manchester Crown Court, completed in May 2025, has improved facilities for witnesses and vulnerable parties. Despite this, the court notes occasional delays in interpreter availability, a matter continually under review to enhance procedural fairness in diverse cases. Notwithstanding these procedural vicissitudes, the administration of justice in this matter proceeded with appropriate professionalism and commitment from court staff, police, and legal representatives. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. Having regard to the seriousness of the offending, the sustained pattern, the adverse effect on victims, and your prior record, the court must consider sentencing options that balance punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. The Sentencing Council guidelines identify theft involving repeated breaches as meriting particular attention to the offender’s history, the cumulative harm caused, and the presence or absence of mitigating features such as early guilty plea and engagement with support services. While your plea of guilty is acknowledged and has been entered at the earliest opportunity following the provision of additional evidence, the court finds limited mitigation in respect of personal circumstances, given the longstanding nature of these offences and prior warnings. Expert reports and probation assessments recommend targeted cognitive-behavioural programmes addressing impulsivity and acquisitive offending patterns, as well as support with financial management and social skills enhancement. However, past inconsistent engagement tempers optimism regarding successful rehabilitation. Notably, the pre-sentence report recommends exploring options involving community payback with rehabilitation activity requirements but leaves open the possibility that custody may be required to achieve adequate deterrence and public reassurance. Given these considerations, and the prevailing authority in similar cases, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report before formal sentencing is fixed. This report will provide a detailed assessment of your suitability for community-based sentences, including potential referrals to environmental improvement projects or structured unpaid work schemes, alongside mental health and addiction intervention possibilities. The court wishes to reiterate the importance of sustained engagement with support services, many of which face resource challenges yet continue to operate with commendable dedication. Agencies such as Mind Manchester and Streetwise Outreach have expressed willingness to assist post-sentencing, contingent on your cooperation. Finally, the court records its appreciation for the professionalism of all parties involved in bringing this case to a just conclusion, despite the procedural challenges outlined. The sentencing hearing will be scheduled following the receipt of the pre-sentence report and any updated representations from the defence or prosecution. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 13 October 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Manchester. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.
