MR H Case No. 2025/18473 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L. Underwood Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in respect of an offence of theft, commonly described as shoplifting, committed contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The matter concerns a series of incidents occurring over a protracted period spanning from early 2023 through the late spring of 2025, engaged predominantly within retail establishments in the Windsor and Maidenhead local authority areas. Procedural History The genesis of the prosecution arose following complaints forwarded by multiple retail operators, notably small and medium-sized grocers, chemists, and convenience stores situated in proximity to Windsor town centre. The charges emerged after extensive inquiries conducted jointly by the Windsor Borough Police and the Thames Valley Business Crime Unit. The scale of investigative effort devoted to this case was considerable, with an emphasis placed on reviewing surveillance footage, collating witness statements, and profiling a suspected pattern of repeated offences consistent with the modus operandi observed. Alas, it remains an unfortunate truth that offences of this nature, while seemingly low in standalone value, cumulatively impact upon public confidence, business viability, and the welfare of retail staff. The court acknowledges the challenges faced by officers responsible for handling such matters. The relentless overlay of investigative and administrative burdens placed on already stretched police resources heightens the risk of inefficiency and fatigue among frontline personnel. This case, though relatively straightforward in evidential terms, marks a rare instance where inter-agency coordination has yielded a coherent punitive response within appropriate procedural timeframes. You were arrested pursuant to a warrant executed on 18 May 2025, following an extensive period of covert observation and intelligence collation that included, but was not limited to, covert mobile surveillance, license plate data cross-referencing, and analysis of retail CCTV networks. Your initial attendance under caution occurred on 19 May 2025, at which point you elected to remain silent. Subsequent forensic examination of recovered items, including clothing articles and an unregistered rucksack, contributed substantively to the evidential basis for charge. The case has proceeded to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, with pleas entered as of 15 July 2025. It is pertinent to note that the BCM system aims to streamline case progression whilst avoiding unnecessary adjournments. In this matter, despite some early engagement difficulties owing to delayed legal representation and the availability of expert reports, the case has nonetheless progressed in a timely fashion. Both prosecution and defence have co-operated towards the effective listing and preparation for trial. I express appreciation to both counsel for their engagement with the process. The case was also delayed by the need to secure Legal Aid funding for commissioning a clinical psychologist experienced in the assessment of recidivist acquisitive offenders. I take this opportunity to comment with no small degree of exasperation on the persistent inefficiencies of the Legal Aid Agency when authorising such requests. The application lodged on 10 June 2025 required multiple iterations, culminating in a protracted approval on 28 June 2025. These procedural glitches serve only to frustrate clients’ rights to expeditious justice and place an undue strain on all parties concerned. The Crown, represented admirably by Ms Lucille Thornton, has made clear the gravity of persistent retail theft in modern urban contexts. Likewise, Mr Jeremy Wallace, on behalf of the defence, has submitted mitigation rooted principally in social welfare factors and limited engagement with support services. It has come to my attention, tangentially, that the office of the assigned probation officer has encountered unprecedented staffing shortages coinciding with this case’s preparation. It is hardly novel that community corrections departments operate under resource constraints, often resulting in delayed report preparation or fractured continuity of supervision. No significant criticism is directed here, merely an observation on how systemic pressures inevitably shape individual case outcomes. In line with established authority, notably R v. Keaton [2019] EWCA Crim 1512, the court recognises that persistent shoplifting offences warrant a measured response reflecting both culpability and the often complex social antecedents underlying such offending behaviour. While Keaton concerned an extended series of offences involving organised theft rings, the principles concerning the deterrent effect and proportionality of sentencing are apropos. Of interest too is the decision in R v. Petrovic [2021] EWCA Crim 2548, involving an offender convicted of serial shop theft where the Court of Appeal emphasised the significance of prompt guilty pleas in securing sentence mitigation. The timing and sincerity of admissions remain material considerations, even where past convictions are present. Case reports confirm, regrettably, a trend towards an increase in offences of this nature in the Thames Valley region over recent years — a phenomenon traceable in part to socioeconomic instability, rises in unemployment, and a visible uptick in street-level opportunism. Data compiled by the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership indicate a 14% year-on-year increase in thefts involving small independent shops between 2021 and 2024. The associated financial losses, not to mention the detrimental impact on staff morale, highlight the broader harms occasioned by such behaviour. The court has considered the statements of several store managers and assistants, who describe ongoing anxiety about repeat theft, leading in some cases to reduced staffing, enhanced security protocols, and even temporary closures for risk assessment. Taken as a whole, the background to this offence places it in the context of pressing contemporary challenges faced by urban retail sectors. Yet the law remains clear — hardship does not excuse dishonesty, nor does it diminish the need for accountability. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. It is necessary to underscore at this juncture the forensic and digital evidence which, while robust, demanded meticulous assemblage. Tempered often by concerns regarding privacy and evidential integrity, the multi-layered gathering of data contoured a compelling narrative of repeated incursions upon shop premises. Here one reflects on the modern realities of policing, where technical expertise must be marshalled not only efficiently but judiciously. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. In the wider spectrum of criminal jurisprudence, this court is mindful of the case of R v. McAllister [2018] EWCA Crim 2047—an instance of aggravated burglary involving theft beyond the shoplifting remit. Although wholly distinct factually, the principles underpinning proportionality and the consideration of aggravating features retain pertinence when grappling with repetitive acquisitive offences. On a procedural note, it has been brought to this court's attention that the late appointment of an interpreter at a sentencing hearing in a neighbouring court resulted in significant delay. While unrelated, it highlights systemic pressures and the precarious balance courts must strike between expeditious administration and the individual rights of defendants. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. At this stage, the court pauses to recognise the efforts of the Windsor Retailers Association, whose collaborative initiatives — including staff training in theft prevention and liaison with police liaison officers — have provided both practical and moral support to individual shop staff impacted by offences of this kind. Their written representations, submitted in advance of sentencing, refrain from rhetorical flourish, focusing instead on facts and the human cost of such offending. In addition, the voluntary sector has played a quiet yet vital role. The Thames Valley Community Outreach Programme submitted a letter drawing attention to the limited availability of housing support for individuals in financial precarity. Their observations echo a broader national crisis in housing provision, marked by soaring rental prices and acute shortages of social housing. Again, while these issues do not excuse criminal behaviour, they provide vital context. Mr H, the psychiatric report commissioned by this court and authored by Dr Samantha Ingram, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, is a document of considerable length and detail. It characterises your presentation as typified by low mood, intermittent anxiety, and a degree of impulsivity, though no clear diagnosis of severe mental illness was established. Dr Ingram expressed concern at your inconsistent engagement with proposed supportive interventions and noted a pattern of self-isolation and social withdrawal. The report cautiously advises that without a structured therapeutic framework, risk of reoffending remains present. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. Turning to the jurisprudential framework, the court is guided by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences, promulgated in 2020. The guideline articulates a comprehensive sentencing matrix, factoring in the value of property taken, the sophistication of offending, and the impact on victims. Aggravating features such as repeat offending, vulnerability of victims, and breach of trust merit due weight. Though shoplifting is occasionally perceived as a relatively minor incursion upon law and order, particularly when involving low-value goods, this court aligns with the considered position advanced in R v. Bridges [2021] EWCA Crim 810, where the Court underscored that acquisitive crime, if left unchecked, undermines community cohesion and places intolerable strain upon retail sectors and public resources alike. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. It is important also to reflect on the broader operational environment within which the criminal justice system currently functions. The court is acutely aware of the immense pressures facing the Probation Service nationally, grappling with recruitment challenges, financial restrictions, and the demands of an expanding caseload. These factors inevitably affect the timeliness and depth of pre-sentence reporting. Moreover, one cannot overlook the ripple effects on the court system itself. Recent strikes by court clerical staff have at times caused adjournments and interruptions across multiple jurisdictions. Again, this matter was not directly delayed due to such industrial action, but the phenomenon forms part of the backdrop against which all participants must operate. The effective administration of justice remains the highest priority, notwithstanding such operational tribulations. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. In relation to sentencing mitigation, the defence submissions have drawn attention to your housing instability and purported lack of stable family support. While such factors are acknowledged, they do not sufficiently mitigate the persistent nature of your offending. The court must balance compassion with public protection and deterrence. It is also germane to mention that this court has received a letter from the local Housing Association, which emphasises the strain upon accommodation services caused by increasing rates of tenancy breaches and anti-social behaviour. While unrelated to your specific tenancy arrangement, the letter indicates an ongoing challenge within public housing management — a challenge that may impact individuals with limited support networks and heightened vulnerability to social exclusion. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. In addition, the court notes correspondence from the Windsor Volunteer Aid Society, which describes the pressures on charitable food banks in the area. It is worthwhile to acknowledge that such organisations operate under severe resource constraints, yet persist in offering vital assistance to those in poverty. The court does not overlook these realities in assessing the social context of offending. Finally, the court must address the issue of your previous criminal record, which comprises three prior convictions for theft-related offences, including an offence involving the theft of a mobile phone from a public venue and a community resolution for shoplifting in 2021. Those earlier matters resulted in non-custodial penalties but appear to have had limited deterrent effect. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. I have also been provided with a victim personal statement from the manager of one impacted retail outlet. Though restrained in tone, the statement highlights both the financial loss and the human cost in terms of the stress felt by staff. The statement underscores the impact of repeated offending rather than a single incident, painting a picture of chronic disruption. Mr H, the facts demonstrate a course of conduct marked by persistence and a degree of planning. You exploited the familiarity of frequenting local shops to target times of low staffing and relied upon distraction techniques and concealment to evade detection. While there is no suggestion that your offending involved violence or threats, it caused real and sustained distress to victims and staff. This is a material aggravating factor. You have pleaded guilty, albeit not at the earliest opportunity. This court, accordingly, will reflect on the stage at which your plea was entered in the exercise of sentencing discretion. In matters of this nature, the court is frequently reminded of the need to promote rehabilitation alongside punishment. However, rehabilitation must be grounded in active engagement and willingness to accept support, qualities which have, regrettably, been sporadic in your case. The pre-sentence report will be critical in advising on your personal circumstances and on risk of reoffending. It will consider your social circumstances, possible interventions, and proposals for community-based sanctions. Advanced programmes focusing on cognitive behavioural therapy and impulse control may be appropriate if you demonstrate genuine commitment. Your age and previous convictions establish you as a repeat offender, but not one whose offending has reached scale or sophistication warranting custodial sentence as a mandatory starting point. That said, the court must consider the cumulative impact of persistent acquisitive crime upon the business community and the public perception of safety within the town centres affected. I must also be candid and inform you that sentencing will take into account the broader imperative of general deterrence. The increasing incidence of retail crime is a matter of national concern. Courts must therefore send a clear signal that repeated offences, albeit low in individual value, attract commensurate consequences. The court recognises that you currently lack stable employment and reside in temporary accommodation provided by the local authority. Your personal circumstances are understood to be difficult, and your engagement with available support services limited. It must be reiterated, however, that such circumstances cannot be treated as a licence to offend or a shield from sentencing consequences. In conclusion, I will reserve my decision on sentence pending the preparation and receipt of a detailed pre-sentence report. The report is to address your suitability for community rehabilitation, your personal circumstances, and risk factors relevant to reoffending. I expect the probation service to make recommendations in line with sentencing guidelines, considering options which may include a community order with requirements addressing offending behaviour, unpaid work, and possible curfew or electronic monitoring if warranted.
