MR H Case No. T2025/15489 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. M. Ellison Filed: 15 August 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in relation to a series of offences of theft from retail premises contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, committed over a protracted period beginning in the autumn of 2023 and concluding with your arrest in May 2025. The offending took place across multiple shops within the metropolitan boundaries of Birmingham, notably concentrating on convenience stores, small pharmacies, and an independent bookshop chain. The background to these proceedings is worth recounting in some detail, not merely out of procedural formality, but as a reminder of the substantive efforts extended by the prosecuting authorities, law enforcement, and victim representatives in bringing this matter to this point. The case was originally instigated following a number of reports by shopkeepers who had observed suspicious activity linked to a male matching your description. Early investigative efforts were hampered, as is frequently the case in such offences, by limited CCTV coverage, poor image quality, and the transitory nature of retail staff who often lacked the resources or inclination to maintain detailed incident logs. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. Before turning to the offending itself, it bears noting that the flow of cases such as yours contributes significantly to the cumulative burden on policing, judicial resources, and community safety initiatives. Indeed, the court is acutely conscious that acquisitive crimes—even those of ostensibly low financial value—may aggregate into substantial economic harm and community unease. Moreover, the demand placed upon frontline police officers to investigate, and on prosecutors to assemble coherent and compelling evidential packages, is non-trivial. Regrettably, as has been observed in numerous prior judgments, the Criminal Procedure Rules (CrimPR) are well-intentioned but often strained under the weight of delayed forensic analyses, compounding the difficulty of addressing what might otherwise be straightforward cases. The designation of this matter to the Crown Court followed the detection of a pattern of sustained offending, and the associated threat it presented to vulnerable local businesses. This court notes with some irony that, despite repeated efforts over the past decade to digitise evidence management and expedite case progression, delay remains a lamentably consistent feature. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. An additional factor of procedural interest in the present case involved the necessity, occasioned by the defence, to obtain psychological evaluation to explore potential mitigating circumstances rooted in mental health or neurodevelopmental conditions. The Legal Aid Agency’s administrative response was predictably labyrinthine. The initial application lodged in July 2025 was deferred pending clarification of qualification criteria. It was not until mid-September that full approval was granted, necessitating several telephone exchanges and written submissions. This pattern of obstructive bureaucracy, though well-documented, remains disheartening, given the importance of timely expert input in ensuring just outcomes. The clinical report prepared by Dr Fiona Kavanagh, a consultant forensic psychologist, offered a nuanced but ultimately subdued assessment. While no severe or enduring psychiatric disorder was diagnosed, some traits indicative of impulsivity, affective instability, and maladaptive coping mechanisms were identified. The report highlighted your expressed history of familial disruption, economic instability, and a degree of social isolation, but concluded that none of these afforded a compelling explanation capable of diminishing responsibility. Indeed, the balance of the report favours accountability combined with appropriate rehabilitative measures. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. It is appropriate at this juncture to allude briefly to the victim's experience and associated community impact. The court has reviewed victim impact statements supplied by a range of retail proprietors and employees, elicited through the efforts of the Birmingham Business Crime Prevention Partnership. These statements collectively convey the tangible and intangible harms sustained: not merely loss of stock valued in modest sums but a pervasive erosion of staff confidence and increased anxiety regarding workplace safety. Some employees reported modifying their conspicuous appearance, altering shift patterns, and in several instances, seeking transfers to alternative locations. This erosion of workplace security and morale cannot be understated. Small business owners have conveyed particular concern over the cumulative effect of repeated losses, amplified by the strain of increased insurance premiums and depleted customer footfall. The anxiety and stress commonly experienced in such circumstances, while difficult to quantify, deepen the social consequences of offences that might otherwise be categorised as “minor”. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. This case also brings into sharp relief the operation of multi-agency interventions aimed at curbing retail theft. The Coventry and West Midlands Retail Support Network, though chronically underfunded, has been diligent in its efforts to liaise with affected proprietors, disseminate intelligence bulletins, and facilitate offender engagement schemes. However, the judiciary remains mindful of the limitations of such networks, constrained by finite resources and episodic staff shortages. Adding to the complexity of the criminal justice loop is the frequent challenge of balancing expediency with fairness. As many practitioners will attest, the reality of caseload pressures—particularly in major urban centres—encourages triage approaches, prioritising serious violence and organised crime. Theft offences, often perceived as secondary, risk marginalisation. This can prompt frustrated victims to pursue civil remedies, which, while potentially effective financially, do not address the broader issues of offender accountability and public reassurance. In the present matter, the court heard from Mr Edward Forsyth, a Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecutor with the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, who detailed the investigative timeline and the measures taken to safeguard evidence integrity. Mr Forsyth observed that your eventual guilty plea, entered on the morning of the trial, followed exhaustive disclosure and a series of case management hearings. While the plea is noted, it arrives markedly late in the process. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. The court is obliged to remind itself and the parties of the principles governing plea credit at sentencing. As established in R v. Bannister [2023] EWCA Crim 1098, the timing and sincerity of a guilty plea bear directly on reductions in sentence length. The court referenced Bannister’s guiding assertion that “credit is a marker not only of admission but of respect for the process and of remorse that tangibly alleviates prosecutorial and judicial burden.” Moreover, in R v. Sterling [2022] EWCA Crim 654, the appellate court emphasised that a plea entered only after the prosecution has concluded its evidential case yields minimal procedural economy. Such late pleas, while admissible and often prudent, attract correspondingly reduced mitigation. In advancing these remarks, the court acknowledges that the delay in plea may have been motivated by a desire to secure legal advice or await expert reports. Nonetheless, the resultant additional strain on victims and witnesses is regrettable. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. The Probation Service provided a comprehensive pre-sentence report, which supplements the psychological assessment. Prepared by Senior Probation Officer Nicola Griffith, the report catalogues your history of prior offences, including two related convictions for shoplifting from 2019 and 2021, both resulting in community orders with mixed outcomes. It is plainly evident that, despite opportunities for intervention and support, compliance with previous statutory requirements has been intermittent. Officer Griffith notes your current unemployment, tenuous housing situation, and reluctance to engage consistently with rehabilitative programming. While apparently cooperative at interview, your presentation suggested a degree of ambivalence about desisting from criminal conduct. Of importance is also the assessment of risk. The report categorises you as presenting a moderate to high likelihood of reoffending absent meaningful intervention. Such a conclusion justifies the court’s consideration of secure supervision or custodial measures to forestall further harm and to prioritise public protection. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. The court has also noted the history of your social circumstances, which included reported periods of homelessness and reliance on public assistance. Letters of support were tendered from representatives of the Birmingham Homeless Outreach initiative and the local Citizens Advice Bureau, both highlighting your sporadic attendance at appointments and indicating a fractured support network. Such information, while relevant to the holistic appraisal of your prospects, must be balanced against the imperatives of justice and deterrence. The court is mindful of the vital role played by such agencies in mitigating the social determinants of crime and commends their ongoing efforts despite resource constraints and increased demand. Reference is made to the lingering national debate surrounding the allocation of funding for criminal justice social services and the impact of austerity measures on probation caseloads. Recent Parliament Select Committee reports have underscored how underinvestment compromises the systemic capacity to provide early intervention. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. Before concluding, this court must address the broader jurisprudential context. The Theft Act 1968 has served as the legislative cornerstone governing property offences for over half a century, but its continuing relevance is frequently debated. Amendments and supplemental legislation, including the Serious Crime Act 2015, have introduced enhanced powers and sentencing frameworks for organised acquisitive crime. Notwithstanding this, the principle of proportionality remains paramount. An element of judicial discretion tailored to individual circumstances consistently shapes sentencing outcomes. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guidelines for theft offences, last updated in 2024, provide a useful compass. Of particular note is the inclusion of criteria considering the defendant’s previous convictions, nature of the impact on victims, sophistication of the offending pattern, and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors. Several appellate decisions illuminate these issues. For example, R v. Trenton [2023] EWCA Crim 1762 concerned a defendant who committed a series of burglaries of vacant homes during holiday absences. Though the factual basis diverges substantially from the present case, the ruling elucidates the court’s approach to repeat offending, emphasising the need for sentences with sufficient deterrent effect. Similarly, R v. McLeary [2022] EWCA Crim 1033 grappled with sentencing in the context of environmental crime, specifically fly-tipping on protected green belt land. That case theorised the social contract breached by persistent offences that collectively inflict harm, emphasising community impact over monetary value. In the present case, while the offending does not engage the same degree of culpability or consequence as these cited authorities, it nonetheless resonates as part of the continuum of acquisitive crime that erodes social trust and safety. I pause to acknowledge the contribution of Ms Samantha Reid, instructing counsel for the defence, whose submissions were measured and detailed despite limited material mitigation. Her representations on your behalf, highlighting the challenges of your social context and advising on potential community-based sentencing options, were appreciated. Similarly, I extend gratitude to Mr Aidan Coulson for the Crown, whose diligent prosecution was executed with professionalism and due regard for evidential clarity and victim interests. It is worth noting, however, that this court remains concerned at the persistent delays—now seemingly endemic—in securing expert reports and arranging timely pre-sentence assessments. The attendant impact on defendants’ rights and case progression is a matter of continuing judicial note. In addition to assessing culpability and personal circumstances, the court must consider the broader principles of sentencing — particularly the need for deterrence, reparation, and rehabilitation. The potential for community sentences incorporating rehabilitative elements, such as offence-focused programmes, cognitive skills workshops, and unpaid work requirements, must be evaluated against the risks identified. The court is also cognisant of the financial pressures faced by statutory and voluntary agencies charged with the rehabilitation of offenders. The Voluntary Sector Forum in Birmingham recently issued a report highlighting chronic underfunding, workforce shortages, and the consequent erosion of service quality. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests a concerning rise in the prevalence of mental health comorbidities among acquisitive offenders. This intersection mandates a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to sentencing and intervention. Given these complexities, the court will defer a definitive sentencing decision pending receipt of updated probationary and psychiatric reports. Such reports will inform the appropriateness, or otherwise, of custodial vs. community rehabilitation measures. Today's hearing proceeds in Open Court. I record appreciation for the court staff whose administration and procedural management have ensured the smooth conduct of these proceedings notwithstanding regional pressures and the recent refurbishment of Courtroom 1, which has enhanced accessibility but presented scheduling challenges. In concluding these remarks, I must express the court’s solemn recognition of the persistent difficulties facing both defendants and the institutions designed to serve justice, safety, and rehabilitation. The balance between compassion and deterrence, opportunity and accountability, remains delicate but vital. Sentencing is adjourned to 12 September 2025 to allow for the preparation and consideration of the required advice and reports. All involved parties will be notified of the exact timetable, and it is expected that no further adjournment will be necessary save for unforeseen circumstances. These sentencing remarks are issued this 15th day of August 2025, in Court 1 at Birmingham Crown Court. The hearing has been transcribed and recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules (CrimPR). The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days, in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no active reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.
