MR H Case No. B2025/14327 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. K. Rawlings Filed: 12 November 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced in respect of a charge of theft, specifically shoplifting, contrary to the provisions of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending took place over a period spanning late 2023 into early 2025, occurring at varied premises within the Bristol metropolitan area and nearby districts. The prosecution case—that you have now admitted—was presented under a single count on the indictment, representing what is described as a course of conduct involving repeated thefts of goods, the details of which will be elaborated upon shortly. Procedural History and Court Context Your initial apprehension followed a protracted investigative process commencing in January 2025, involving the coordinated efforts of multiple law enforcement and community safety agencies. The Bristol Business Crime Partnership, established in 2009 to foster collaboration between commercial enterprises, local police, and the municipal council, played a key role in collecting intelligence and providing victim liaison services. This defunct yet occasionally mentioned body, notwithstanding its archival status, was noted in initial briefs, although its dissolution in 2022 rendered direct involvement nominal at best in the present proceedings. A pre-trial review hearing on 1 March 2025 led to an adjournment for case management purposes. At that hearing, the matter was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 27 April 2025. The progression of the case otherwise adhered, in broad terms, to the indicative timeframes prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Rules (CrimPR), albeit not without some procedural difficulties. Initial attempts to obtain Legal Aid funding for an independent psychiatric evaluation encountered delays due to shifting eligibility criteria and administrative backlogs within the Legal Aid Agency—a pattern increasingly characteristic of resource-constrained public administration. Such delays, lamentably common in criminal proceedings, not only retard the justice process but, on occasion, test the patience of all parties concerned. It is worth pausing to note that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and defence counsel both engaged cooperatively throughout, with Ms Emily Radcliffe representing the Crown and Ms Jeremy Thom, a solicitor advocate, representing you under a representation order granted on 15 February 2025. The court records their efforts with appreciation, though it falls to me to observe the cumulative procedural complexity besetting even comparatively minor offences in the current legal climate. Public confidence in the criminal justice system depends, in no small measure, upon its reputation for timely and proportionate resolution of cases. The Better Case Management (BCM) framework, introduced formally in the early 2020s to promote judicial scrutiny of case progression, was invoked here. While the framework was designed to expedite procedural milestones and reduce unnecessary adjournments, its implementation has been far from uniform across jurisdictions. In this instance, the court acknowledges that the case management hearings proceeded with a degree of efficiency and adherence to prescribed standards, a welcome counterpoint in a generally overburdened system. The theft provision under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines the primary offence: the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof. Shoplifting, though often perceived as a relatively minor offence due to the low monetary value of items commonly involved, must not be treated lightly where patterns of repeated offending emerge, impacting victims’ businesses and community welfare. In R v. Chambers [2020] EWCA Crim 1721, the Court of Appeal underscored the principle that repeated acquisitive offending directed at retail premises warrants a sentencing approach attentive both to the cumulative harm inflicted and the broader public confidence implications. While the individual thefts in that case were each of low value, the serial nature and deliberate tactics adopted by the appellant supported a custodial term to mark denunciation and deterrence. Similarly, it is instructive to consider R v. Preston [2019] EWCA Crim 1459, where the defendant engaged in a series of aggressive shoplifting incidents involving intimidation and concealment. The Court emphasised the importance of factoring in the psychological impact on staff and the disruption to business, even when physical violence was not present. Although Mr H’s conduct cannot be equated in gravity to Preston, the circumstances nonetheless warrant serious regard. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. The breadth of published sentencing guidelines for theft offences, including the 2023 edition, provides a calibrated framework for assessing culpability and harm. Paragraphs 2.12 through 2.26 outline relevant aggravating and mitigating features, among them the presence of previous convictions, sophistication of offender tactics, impact on vulnerable victims, and the cumulative effect of multiple offences constituting a \"course of conduct,\" as is alleged here. Notably, this court is reminded of the dictum in R v. Beckwith [2022] EWCA Crim 991, which emphasised the courts’ responsibility to consider the broader societal consequences of prolific minor offences. The judiciary must balance proportionality with the imperative to sustain deterrent messaging and uphold victim confidence. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. The detailed evidential record reveals a series of shoplifting episodes from various retail premises, including multiple grocery stores, pharmacies, and convenience shops. These incidents, emerging through painstaking collation of CCTV footage, staff accounts, and inventory checks, depict a pattern of deliberate, repeated theft. Your modus operandi encompassed the use of concealed garments and bags to appropriate items largely comprising toiletries, over-the-counter medicinal products, and confectionery. Such targeting reflects an awareness of the secondary market value of these goods, as well as an attempt to minimise detection—though, regrettably for you, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. In one notable incident, a shop manager observed you attempting to distract staff by engaging in seemingly innocuous conversation while covertly removing items from shelves. On another occasion, you were captured on multiple cameras, traversing a retail space with a conspicuously bulky coat, which appeared designed to facilitate concealment. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. Furthermore, at least one victim store reports that your continued presence and repeated offending have caused considerable disruption to staffing arrangements, with some employees requesting adjusted working hours or site transfers. These accounts attest to the intangible harm resulting from such offences—a factor considered significant by sentencing courts, notwithstanding the absence of physical harm or threat. The involvement of the Bristol Retailers' Liaison Group merits mention. This body, though not an official prosecuting authority, has played a commendable role in supporting affected business owners through arranging security audits, staff training in theft prevention, and advocating for enhanced collaboration with law enforcement. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. Whilst your case is discrete and singular, it is essential to view it in light of your prior criminal history. You have previous convictions for theft-related offences, including two disposals via conditional caution in 2022 and a community order in 2023. Despite these interventions, offending appears to have persisted or escalated in frequency. Probation service records reveal episodic engagement and occasional absences from scheduled appointments. The preparatory reports before me also cite a lack of full acceptance of responsibility until recently, alongside a degree of minimisation concerning the impact of your conduct. Such factors, while not determinative, necessarily invite a degree of caution in assessing your prospects for rehabilitation absent appropriate statutory intervention. The psychiatric report submitted on behalf of the defence, prepared by Dr Helen Wentworth in August 2025, provides a detailed assessment of your mental state. Dr Wentworth concludes that you do not meet diagnostic criteria for major mental illness but exhibits traits consistent with impulse control difficulties and mild anxiety disorder. There is no evidence of organic brain dysfunction or psychotic illness. The report emphasises your reported socioeconomic stresses, including unstable housing and intermittent unemployment, while also noting limited engagement with support services designed to address these vulnerabilities. Dr Wentworth cautiously suggests that psychosocial interventions targeting impulse regulation and coping mechanisms may be beneficial. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. Conversely, the probation officer’s pre-sentence report notes a medium risk of harm and relatively high risk of reoffending, primarily driven by socioeconomic factors and limited protective support networks. The report underscores the importance of structured supervision with cognitive behavioural components. It is instructive to signal current pressures within probation services nationally, where staff shortages and extensive caseloads frequently constrain the reach of intensive intervention programmes. This systemic limitation often results in delayed access to tailored support, particularly for individuals presenting multifaceted social complexity. The court also receives correspondence from the Bristol Homelessness Action Alliance, outlining the ongoing challenges faced by those at risk of insecure accommodation or rough sleeping. While not specific to you, the material serves as a salutary reminder of the broader social environment in which many defendants exist—a context that, while not excusing offending, situates it within the landscape of lived experience. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. Victim personal statements provide harrowing insights into the impact of repeated theft on local shopkeepers and their staff. While the financial sums involved in individual offences may appear modest, the cumulative losses impose significant strain on small and independent businesses, many of which already operate on narrow margins. One business owner writes poignantly of the erosion of community space and the chilling effect of persistent offending on employee morale. The psychological burden on staff—manifesting as anxiety and diminished job satisfaction—constitutes real harm, recognised expressly by the courts as an element requiring redress. This court notes with respect the efforts of the Bristol Retail Crime Prevention Strategy team, whose ongoing engagement with affected businesses includes advice on environmental design, surveillance enhancements, and staff safety protocols. Such initiatives represent an essential component of community resilience but are inevitably reactive and, to an extent, constrained by funding limitations. It is a cause for concern that these programmes are often stretched beyond capacity, necessitating careful choices about resource allocation. The victim impact is thus not solely monetary but also manifest in the weakening of local commercial fabric and increased community insecurity. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. In the broader social context, the court acknowledges evolving patterns of acquisitive offending, increasingly fuelled by economic pressures, social exclusion, and the pervasive challenges of mental health. Recent Home Office reports from 2024 indicate a modest upward trend in petty theft in urban centres, including Bristol, with marked spikes noted in areas of high deprivation. This trend has seen concomitant strain on emergency services, retail businesses, and local authorities seeking to stabilise neighbourhoods. The “place crime” theory articulated in criminological literature underlines that persistent petty offending, while individually minor, collectively engenders significant community harm. It is incumbent upon the courts, therefore, to respond proportionately but firmly. As has been well documented in media commentary, including recent discussions in The Times and The Guardian, society’s tolerance thresholds are approaching critical levels, with calls for enhanced sanctions alongside expanded rehabilitative infrastructures. The Role and Challenges of the Legal Aid System Throughout these proceedings, the court and parties have contended with notable funding and resource difficulties associated with Legal Aid applications—specifically in respect of expert assessments integral to the defence’s case. This frustrating reality is not unique to this jurisdiction and speaks to systemic issues in the administration of justice. Defence counsel’s application for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist experienced in acquisitive offending was delayed for several weeks due to procedural queries and insufficient clarity in the statutory criteria. Such delays hamper timely resolution and impose further stress upon defendants already grappling with complex needs. The court regrets that remedies have not yet been implemented to streamline these processes effectively. This state of affairs is unsatisfactory in the extreme and risks undermining defendants’ access to appropriate representation and expert advice. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. It is equally lamentable that the capacity of forensic and digital units to analyse and process evidence, including CCTV archives and electronic transaction data, remains stretched. Policemen, analysts, and technical staff dedicated to retail crime investigations must often balance these duties with pressures relating to more serious offences such as violent crime or fraud. The consequence can be operational delays and protracted case preparation. Your arrest in February 2025 represented the conclusion of an intelligence-led operation targeting a suspected prolific thief. Such resources are not expended lightly; intelligence analysts maintain a careful balance of priorities to deliver effective public protection outcomes. The authority to utilise telephone data and CCTV triangulation was granted only after due judicial scrutiny, reflecting the seriousness with which your offending was regarded. The court is tasked with navigating a complex seam in determining an appropriate sentence that adequately reflects the culpability of your conduct, the harm caused, your personal circumstances, and the wider public interest. The acknowledged persistence of offending despite prior community resolutions is a significant aggravating factor. Such history signals a heightened risk of recidivism and demonstrates, I regret to say, a pattern of behaviour not deterred by earlier interventions. Notwithstanding this, the mitigating factors of your mental health assessment—while not amounting to a mental disorder—must be taken into account in shaping the form of sentencing and supervision. Your apparent willingness to engage with support services subsequent to the current proceedings offers some hope for rehabilitation. It is also pertinent to reflect that the shoplifting offences, while serious and damaging, did not involve violence or threat thereof—an aspect that influences the gradation of sentence severity. In considering the composite sentencing framework, the court will have regard to both custodial and community options. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on Theft offences advocates custodial sentences where offending is repeated, planned, and persistent, yet also recognises the potential for rehabilitation through requirement orders where appropriate. I remind all parties that an immediate custodial sentence does not always serve the interests of justice, especially when community-based sanctions may be better tailored to address criminogenic needs and reduce reoffending risk. The court has also considered the underlying social factors contributing to your offending, including episodes of unstable accommodation and unemployment. While these circumstances do not excuse criminality, they are relevant to the question of sentence type and conditions. Finally, the court expresses its gratitude to the staff of the Bristol Retail Recovery Network, whose expert support for victims has been invaluable in collating victim impact statements and offering practical assistance post-offence. Such organisations perform a vital function in estate and community cohesion, often under significant resource constraints. Having reviewed all material—statutory and non-statutory guidance, case law precedents, the factual matrix, expert reports, victim statements, and submissions from counsel—it falls to this court to adjourn for the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report. Such report is to be prepared by the Bristol Probation Service and should explore fully options for community rehabilitation, appropriate supervision levels, cognitive behavioural therapy courses, and any ancillary support mechanisms, including housing assistance and employment counselling. The probation officer is also requested to assess risk factors for further reoffending and offer recommendations for a tailored package of interventions. This matter is adjourned to the scheduled sentencing hearing on 17 December 2025, at which time this court will determine the appropriate disposal informed by the report and any further relevant representations. These sentencing remarks are entered as of this 12th day of November 2025, in Court 8 of the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. The defendant, Mr H, is advised of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.
