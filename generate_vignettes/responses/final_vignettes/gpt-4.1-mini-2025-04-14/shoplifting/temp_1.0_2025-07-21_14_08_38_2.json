MR H Case No. H2025/15309 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge S.C. Bannister Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentencing following a single indictment pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to your conduct in respect of a series of shoplifting incidents occurring between the months of October 2023 and February 2025. The offending was principally focused within the Kingston-upon-Hull metropolitan area, including commercial premises situated along Beverley Road, Princes Quay shopping centre, and several independent convenience stores across the northern district. Procedural Background Your initial interview under caution took place on 2 March 2025, after police officers from Humberside Police's Economic Crime Unit received multiple reports from retail security teams across the city. The investigations were supported by the Hull Business Crime Reduction Partnership, an initiative established following the 2017 Policing and Crime Act reforms aiming to enhance information sharing between law enforcement and the commercial sector. This partnership has been credited with a modest reduction in shoplifting incidents locally; however, it continues to face challenges related to staff shortages, especially in the intelligence analytic workforce. It is a regrettable reality that attempts to quantify retail theft often rely heavily on incomplete data and volunteer-collected statistics, a circumstance that weakens the evidential base but does not diminish the real-world harm experienced by victims. The court notes the recent public report issued by the Association of British Retailers, which underscored the systemic under-reporting of such offences due to resourcing constraints and a growing sense of futility among retailers. This phenomenon is compounded by delays in the prosecution process, which this case exemplifies to some extent. Following your arrest on 1 March 2025, you were initially granted bail subject to a curfew and weekly reporting conditions, as recorded at the Hull Magistrates’ Court. Subsequent procedural steps included a plea and trial preparation hearing on 19 May 2025, at which you entered a plea of not guilty. The matter was adjourned to trial on 28 July 2025. It was only at the commencement of the trial proper, on 26 July 2025, after extensive disclosure and pre-trial meetings involving your legal representatives, that you elected to plead guilty on the basis of an agreed facts bundle. This pattern of delayed pleas in shoplifting cases has drawn considerable comment in the appellate courts. The position was summarised most recently in R v Chambers [2024] EWCA Crim 287, where it was noted that the timing of a plea is a critical factor in determining the extent of credit that may be afforded. The Court of Appeal reiterated that a plea entered on the first reasonable occasion should normally attract the maximum reduction, while late pleas warrant a reduced discount due to the strained resources and burden imposed on the criminal justice system and victims alike. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. The Crown's case was reliant in part on an accumulation of CCTV footage from multiple sources, corroborated by statements from store managers and staff, as well as a search of your person upon arrest which revealed possession of items consistent with stolen goods reported missing on separate occasions. The investigation, although thorough, encountered obstacles, including the absence of certain footage due to system malfunctions and the retention of evidence by third parties. During the investigation and subsequent court proceedings, the court has received a number of letters and reports from various professional and community organisations. Most notably, correspondence from the Hull Community Safety Partnership highlighted ongoing concerns about repeat low-level acquisitive offending and its impact on local businesses and residents. Similarly, a letter from the East Yorkshire Shopkeepers Association expressed frustration regarding the turnover of store staff and the reluctance of some victims to pursue prosecutions, fearing reprisals or further victimisation. The court acknowledges and is grateful for such contributions, which provide important context for the sentencing exercise. Conversely, numerous reports have flagged the rising pressure on Probation Service resources, including a noted shortage of officers trained in effective management of offenders with impulse-control difficulties or financial adversity, factors often intertwined with shoplifting. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. The court has reviewed a psychiatric report appended by Dr Amanda Walshe, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, dated 10 August 2025. Dr Walshe’s detailed and professionally composed assessment concluded that you do not meet criteria for any major psychiatric disorder but exhibit traits consistent with low self-esteem, intermittent depressive symptoms, and an emerging pattern of substance use primarily involving alcohol. The report highlights a cyclical pattern of impulsivity and financial stress underpinning your offending behaviour but stresses a lack of motivation to engage meaningfully with proposed support services. This assessment adds a layer of nuance to the understanding of your conduct, albeit it does not provide sufficient grounds to categorise you as suffering from a condition warranting diversion away from the criminal justice system. Your prior engagement with mental health services has been sporadic and ultimately unproductive, a recurring theme which this court has encountered with some frequency in cases of acquisitive crime. The probation report prepared by Officer Liam Prescott is also on file, dated 12 August 2025. It candidly sets out the challenges facing both you and the agencies tasked with risk management and rehabilitation. Notably, it speaks of your accommodation instability, reliance on short-term supported housing, and fractured family relationships that provide limited practical support. Importantly, the report recommends consideration of a community order incorporating a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement with a focus on financial literacy and impulse control, alongside unpaid work hours tailored to enhance accountability and reintegration. The strain borne by local services has been palpable. Extended waiting lists within the NHS community mental health teams in this region mean that prompt access to targeted interventions remains aspirational rather than assured. This systemic gap is an unfortunate backdrop to the personal circumstances of many defendants appearing before this court. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. The court is indebted to Ms Fiona Summers, probation officer, and Dr Walshe for their thorough input and acknowledges the contributory efforts of local voluntary sector organisations detailed in ancillary reports dated 3 and 9 August 2025. The activities of groups such as the North Hull Food Project and the City Outreach Workers Association have provided constructive outreach and diversionary options which, regrettably, you appear yet to embrace fully. In approaching the present case, the court is mindful of the statutory sentencing regime as established by the Sentencing Act 2020 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2021 and the relevant guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council pertaining to theft offences. The principle of proportionality remains paramount, balanced against the need for punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and the protection of the public interest. There is relevant case law that informs sentencing practice in shoplifting matters. For instance, in R v Haywood [2023] EWCA Crim 1092, the Court of Appeal provided authoritative guidance on the treatment of repeat offenders whose crimes, although individually minor in value, collectively evince a persistent disregard for the law and community norms. The court stressed the importance of considering cumulative harm, particularly the cumulative psychological impact on retail employees and smaller business proprietors. Moreover, the judgment in R v Newton [2022] EWCA Crim 876 underscored the concept that offenders with ongoing engagement in acquisitive crime, even in the absence of overt violence, can attract sentences commensurate with the degree of calculated opportunism suggested by their modus operandi. These cases reinforce an evidentiary and sentencing framework that requires the court not only to reflect on the individual act but also on the continuing threat posed by recidivism and disregard for community standards. Similarly, while factually distinct, the Court has had regard to R v Rothwell [2021] EWCA Crim 1432, dealing with environmental offences involving fly tipping. The court drew parallels in recognising that harm need not be purely physical or material to warrant penalty but can include damage to communal trust and the perception of safety. Though unrelated in facts, such reasoning echoes here as it concerns cumulative societal impact. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. The defendant’s offending pattern reveals a degree of premeditation and resilience in the face of prior intervention. Visual evidence shows repeated visits to the same retail outlets during weekday afternoons, with a focus on consumable goods and personal care items of small but easily concealable size. On at least three documented occasions, your conduct involved the concealment of merchandise within personal bags without payment, confirmed by security personnel and later supported by forensic marking technology results. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. Noteworthy is the disregard for signage and previous warnings issued by store managers. While no physical confrontation occurred, the psychological effect of repeated pilferage on staff has been recorded in victim impact statements received by the court, which note increased stress levels and staff turnover attributable, in part, to your actions. Such matters, while intangible in immediate value, have genuine consequences for workplace morale and operational continuity. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. During the course of proceedings, the court considered representations from the Defence regarding family circumstances and socio-economic hardship. Letters submitted by your sister, Ms Hannah Williams, paint a picture of a supportive but fractured family network contending with health difficulties and economic precarity. Additionally, correspondence from the East Hull Crisis Accommodation Service outlined their commitment to assisting you post-sentence but made clear the resource constraints and waiting periods inherent in re-housing large numbers of individuals experiencing homelessness. Moreover, the court is informed by reports from local charities such as the Hull Mental Health Action Group, which have repeatedly attempted engagement with you on a voluntary basis. Such organisations operate in a climate of increasing demand, where funding fluctuations and rising client numbers generate considerable administrative burden and program delays. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. On a procedural note, the court acknowledges the issues encountered by all parties due to intermittent industrial action undertaken by court staff and probation officers in late spring of this year. Such disruptions, while outside the ambit of those directly involved, inevitably extended timelines and contributed to an atmosphere of judicial fatigue and procedural strain. Additionally, delays in securing legal aid funding for instruction of a commissioned forensic accountant caused postponements in receipt of certain evidence, despite timely applications and diligent advocacy from defence counsel. This is consistent with the growing concern expressed by practitioners about the capacity and responsiveness of the Legal Aid Agency under current policies. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. Mr H, your pattern of offending exemplifies the persistent problem of low-level acquisitive crime that, while neither violent nor high value in isolation, cumulatively exacts a toll not only on victims but on public confidence in retail environments. The court must balance recognition of your personal circumstances with the demands of deterrence and the protection of vulnerable commercial premises. It is recognised that retail theft, especially when repeated, places sustained psychological pressure on employees and reduces the willingness of business owners to invest in areas perceived as insecure. Therefore, an appropriate sentence must address the wider public interest in upholding confidence within community commerce. Your lack of meaningful engagement with support services and your failure, despite multiple warnings and prior community interventions, to desist from the behaviour, indicate a concerning degree of obstinacy and disregard for societal norms. Nevertheless, the court accepts that your plea at the earliest realistic time and your personal circumstances, including unstable housing and familial pressures, merit consideration and may moderate the sentence appropriately. I will, as customary, direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared, with particular attention to the feasibility of a community order tailored to meet your rehabilitation needs. The report should explore the potential for participation in accredited thinking skills modules, financial management courses, and compulsory unpaid work—all with the aim of reducing the likelihood of reoffending and promoting social reintegration. A custody threshold will be examined carefully in light of all material before me, including the prospects for compliance and likelihood of protection of the public. I acknowledge the professional conduct of Ms Lorna Fletcher, prosecuting counsel, and Mr Douglas Harper, who has represented you under a Criminal Defence Service funding order. I also register my thanks to the usher and court staff for their assistance, in particular in navigating the complexities caused by contemporaneous administrative changes to court IT systems, which temporarily delayed evidence access during the trial week. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Hull. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal judgment and sentencing orders shall be conveyed accordingly. The defendant is informed of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged herein. Costs are reserved.
