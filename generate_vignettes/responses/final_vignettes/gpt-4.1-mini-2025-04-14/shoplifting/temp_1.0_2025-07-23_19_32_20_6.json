MR H Case No. T2025/13879 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. J. MORRISON Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing following your conviction for shoplifting offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending is charged as a single count but arises from a sustained series of thefts spanning approximately eighteen months, primarily within the Bristol city centre and surrounding retail zones. Procedural History The case against you was brought to trial after a protracted investigative process. Initially reported to local law enforcement by several independent retailers frustrated by repeated, targeted losses, your conduct was eventually linked through a combination of CCTV footage, witness statements, and forensic examination of objects and clothing associated with the incidents. You were arrested on 14 June 2025 following an organised police operation conducted by the Bristol Retail Crime Unit, supported by local Business Crime Prevention Taskforces and informed by intelligence-sharing protocols coordinated with the South West Regional Intelligence Network. This unit, as many in the court will know, is tasked with the challenging work of combating acquisitive offences that disproportionately impact small, independent tradespeople as well as national retail chains. While some may regard shoplifting as a relatively minor infraction, the resources devoted to investigations of this kind belie such a notion. It must be remarked that the operational costs of surveillance, forensic processing, and case preparation run into tens of thousands of pounds in aggregate, drawing on personnel whose time might otherwise be devoted to more serious matters including violent crime or organised gang activity. Your case was listed for pre-trial proceedings on 22 July 2025 and was subject to the Better Case Management (BCM) process implemented to expedite the resolution of Crown Court cases while maintaining procedural fairness. The BCM listing was adhered to in a generally timely fashion, notwithstanding some delay related to scheduling conflicts arising from industrial action affecting staff at the Legal Aid Agency. This action, regrettably, resulted in a postponed hearing and consequently added to the duration of your pre-sentence proceedings. The court notes the efforts of defence counsel in surveying the available evidence, particularly given the complex disclosure arising from multiple retail establishments. It is acknowledged that your legal representatives sought expert psychiatric input—their application for authority to instruct an independent forensic psychologist was subject to what can only be described as an extended and cumbersome bureaucratic process within the Legal Aid framework. Such delays are nothing less than detrimental to the efficient administration of justice and warrant formal noting here, albeit there is a cautious optimism that forthcoming reforms may address these systemic deficiencies. Representatives of the Crown have been diligent in the presentation of evidence and in assisting the court with clarifications concerning aggravating factors typical of sustained shoplifting behaviour. The cooperation between retail proprietors and law enforcement has been, by most accounts, commendably robust, and their input into victim impact statements provides valuable perspective on the broader consequences of your offending. Among those assisting the court was Ms. Jacqueline Sterling, a Crime Prevention Officer employed by the Bristol City Council, whose detailed testimony on the economic and psychological impacts on small business owners was striking. Ms. Sterling’s report stresses the exacerbation of anxieties for retail staff—particularly those who have no prior training in confronting theft or disorder—and underlines the importance of swift, visible responses to maintain public confidence. The Legal Aid Agency’s repeated hesitations over approval of defence funding led to a particularly protracted period before the psychiatric evaluation commissioned by your counsel was delivered. Dr Wesley Grant, the appointed forensic psychologist, submitted a report on 9 September 2025, which the court has duly reviewed in full. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. It is necessary, at this juncture, to reiterate certain principles governing the sentencing framework applicable to your conduct. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the primary statutory provision. The Sentencing Council guideline on theft offences enjoins the court to consider not just the monetary value of stolen goods, but also factors such as frequency, planning, and aggravation arising from the impact on victims. Recurrent offending particularly discounts simplistic notions of minor culpability. The leading authority on the timing of pleas and sentencing credit is the Court of Appeal decision in R v. Shepherd [2023] EWCA Crim 1119, which affirms that early admission of guilt reflects a reduction not merely in cost but a genuine acceptance of responsibility. In this instance, your guilty plea was entered relatively late, on the day the trial was due to commence, and accordingly warrants a reduced discount under the current regime. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. The court is mindful of the difficulties posed by rising pressures on public services, including the Probation Service which faces record shortages nationwide. These staffing deficits impact the timely preparation of pre-sentence reports and the subsequent allocation of supervised interventions. Similarly, local mental health teams remain strained by lengthy waiting lists, particularly within adult psychiatry where community resources exist in precariously thin supply. The systemic context certainly informs but does not excuse individual lapses in behaviour. Those who solicit court and public resources must be prepared for scrutiny and consequence. Turning to the facts, your offending exhibited hallmarks of deliberate targeting of stores with limited security measures, preferring outlets with restricted CCTV coverage and often preying on vulnerable staff working without backup. The court notes the submissions of Ms Harriet Donner QC, counsel on behalf of the Crown, who emphasised the strategic nature of your actions, including methods to conceal stolen articles within counterfeit or repurposed packaging and the use of repeated visits to the same premises. It must also be recorded that representatives from local charity organisations, including the Bristol Community Support Network, provided written representations concerning their perspective on the impact of repeated retail theft on city centre regeneration efforts. They argued for sentencing outcomes that balance public protection with opportunities for rehabilitation, mindful of wider social challenges. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. The court has also considered statements received from neighbours and former employers, which, while highlighting some instances of instability in accommodation and employment history, largely reflect a person capable of conforming to lawful conduct when supported appropriately. The defendant’s sister, Ms Denise Clark, submitted a detailed letter describing ongoing family efforts to engage you with vocational and addiction support programmes. During trial management hearings, it emerged that your defence team sought to present evidence concerning co-defendants in an unrelated matter of aggravated burglary, which was ultimately ruled inadmissible on grounds of relevance. This tangential episode delayed proceedings and caused some confusion among lay observers. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. The court is aware of the broader legislative context shaping decisions in matters of theft and acquisitive crime. The Theft Act 1968, along with subsequent amendments, sets out the essential elements, but sentencing is also informed by statutory guidance and by relevant case law that illuminates the judicial approach to patterns of offending demonstrating persistence and disregard for prior warning. Although no violence was involved in these offences, the psychological impact upon victims and local communities must not be underplayed. The Court also acknowledges the findings in R v. Dunmore [2022] EWCA Crim 1456, concerning the theft of copper cabling from a freight depot in Kent—an offence unrelated to your conduct but which highlights how property crimes with economic and operational consequences warrant serious response. Equally tangential but relevant by analogy are the principles laid down in R v. Lin [2020] EWCA Crim 1082, where systematic environmental pollution caused by fly-tipping was judged to merit immediate custody despite the absence of direct victim confrontation. The court takes these references to underline the judiciary's stance against offences that may appear minor in isolation but reveal embedded disregard for societal standards. The court also recalls related authority in R v. Barton [2019] EWCA Crim 934, a case involving repeated possession of a bladed article in a school car park—distinct from your matter but instructive in the consideration of repeat offending and community impact. Throughout the hearings, I have reflected on the commentary of Justice Lambert in his foreword to the 2021 Sentencing Guidelines Manual, underscoring the judiciary’s duty to provide sentences which are “just, proportionate, and conducive to the purposes of sentencing”—a triad that applies equally whether the offence is violent or acquisitive. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. The court recognises the recent efforts of the Bristol City Retail Partnership, which has worked closely with police and community groups to introduce improved surveillance and staff training despite significant budget constraints. Their resilience is commendable in the face of an uptick in shoplifting and other low-level disorders that beset high streets nationwide. One practical impediment to efficient court management in this case was the late arrival of court-appointed interpreter services. While not a factor for you, Mr H, the delay occasioned was emblematic of wider constraints under which our justice system and associated administrative services operate. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. Expert reports submitted include detailed psychological assessment by Dr Grant, who notes that your profile does not constitute a formal psychiatric diagnosis but reflects certain behavioural tendencies consistent with impulsivity and inconsistent engagement with support offerings. This conclusion is consistent with observations made in other cases of persistent acquisitive offending not rooted in severe mental illness. For instance, R v. McKay [2018] EWCA Crim 1123 addressed shoplifting conducted by a defendant with borderline personality disorder traits, where the sentence emphasized containment combined with rehabilitative probation conditions. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Turning to ancillary procedural matters, it has been noted that co-defendants named in earlier stages of the investigation were charged with offences including affray following a pub brawl, possession of controlled substances, and criminal damage to council property. None of these charges bear directly upon your conduct but contributed to the volume of documentation and cross-examination necessary during trial preparations. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. Victim impact statements in this case were detailed and poignant, submitted by proprietors and staff hurt by the repeated losses and the drain on morale. Some employees reported increased anxiety and stress, with two requesting transfers to alternative premises to avoid further contact. Others cited the need to shorten opening hours or reduce staffing to mitigate vulnerability to theft. It is vital not to underestimate the cascading effect such crime has on local economies—business closures ripple through communities, reducing employment opportunities and neighbourhood vitality. The Bristol Retail Association has documented a rise in shop vacancies attributed, in part, to predation by repeat shoplifters. It is with some regret that the court acknowledges the presence of negative commentary on social media related to your case, much of which lacks nuance and sometimes perpetuates stereotypes about poverty and criminality. The court, however, remains resolutely focused on facts and evidence, not public chatter. This court has heard submissions from Ms Harriet Donner for the Crown and Mr Callum James for the defence. I thank both counsel for their thorough and professional conduct. I also wish to acknowledge the work of the clerk, ushers, and court officers who have managed the procedural complexities of this matter with steady competence. In light of all considerations, including the factual matrix, expert opinion, and broader social context, it is appropriate at this juncture to defer sentencing to allow a complete pre-sentence report to be prepared by the probation service. The report should address the scope for community-based rehabilitation tailored to your needs, the risk assessment regarding reoffending, and possible responses to any underlying contributory factors including housing instability, financial hardship, or substance use. The report should also consider specific interventions such as accredited offence-focused programmes, cognitive behavioural therapy, and possible inclusion in restorative justice initiatives where appropriate. I reserve final sentencing for the hearing scheduled on 17 October 2025. A copy of these remarks will be submitted to all interested parties.
