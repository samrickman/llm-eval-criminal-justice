MR H Case No. T2025/14637 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. R. COCHRANE Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of theft, specifically shoplifting from commercial premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour under consideration, as set out in the indictment, relates to repeated acts spanning a period from mid-2023 through to early 2025 within the Greater Peterborough area and nearby retail districts. Procedural Background Your arrest was effected on 28 February 2025 by officers of the Peterborough Local Policing Unit after an investigation initiated by the city’s Retail Theft Taskforce. This unit was formed in response to an observable increase in shoplifting incidents in the wake of post-pandemic retail recovery efforts. The case was classified as appropriate for Crown Court jurisdiction due to the sustained pattern and the cumulative value of goods involved exceeding the threshold for magistrates’ court competence, compounded by the history of repeat offending on your part. It must be acknowledged that the establishment of the Retail Theft Taskforce stemmed from a strategic initiative to improve inter-agency responses to commercial theft, which has long been recognised as a drain on local economies and a source of distress for business owners and staff. The Taskforce utilises an amalgamation of intelligence sharing, covert surveillance, and multi-agency coordination, including the cooperation of private security operatives contracted by retail chains. In this context, intelligence-led policing measures were employed extensively, with the eventual arrest coming only after several weeks of concerted monitoring. The case experienced initial listing challenges due to the unusually high court workload during the summer of 2025, magnified further by the ongoing staff shortages within criminal justice administration nationally. A previous hearing scheduled for 10 August 2025 was adjourned on account of defence counsel awaiting funding authorisation for the instruction of a forensic psychologist — a delay lamented by all parties but illustrative of the systemic pressures within the Legal Aid framework. The funding request itself was subject to protracted correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency, involving multiple resubmissions and clarifications over a period of six weeks. I must place on record the court’s continuing dissatisfaction with such procedural inefficiencies, which serve only to retard the timely administration of justice. The present sentencing hearing has proceeded with both prosecution and defence representatives present and fully prepared. I record my thanks to Ms Catherine Burns, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, and to Mr Michael Travers, instructed under a Legal Aid order, representing you. I also acknowledge the presence of the court clerk, ushers, and court security staff, who continue to maintain courtroom order amidst these demanding caseloads. It is appropriate here to revisit the historical trajectory of the Theft Act 1968, under which you are charged. The statute has been foundational in English criminal law regarding dishonesty offences for over five decades. Amended on occasion to reflect societal developments, including the Theft Act 1978 and subsequent legislation addressing related property crimes, it nevertheless remains the primary reference. The relevant sentencing guidelines were last substantively revised by the Sentencing Council in 2021, emphasizing the importance of offence context, culpability, and harm. The court is also mindful of the Better Case Management (BCM) framework introduced in 2013, which aims to streamline trial preparation and disposal phases. This matter was managed under BCM protocols, with initial hearings prompting the early disclosure of evidence, including CCTV footage, witness statements, and forensic reports, thereby ensuring procedural transparency and efficiency commensurate with expectations under the Criminal Procedure Rules. It is worth noting that the case progressed without any significant procedural defaults or failures—a rare procedural achievement worthy of acknowledgment in an era of chronic judicial delay. The Crown has presented a thorough evidential matrix, including commercial CCTV records, witness eyewitness accounts from store staff, and corroborative forensics relating to items recovered in your possession at the moment of arrest. There was an initial not guilty plea at your first appearance on 5 March 2025, but this was amended to a guilty plea at a hearing held on 14 September 2025, following the receipt of further detailed evidence. While that admission alleviates some of the burden on witnesses and court resources, the timing of your plea falls within the category often described in case law as a “late” guilty plea. This carries implications for any mitigation in sentencing credit, as emphasised in R v. Khan [2022] EWCA Crim 1156 wherein the Court of Appeal restated that the timing of a plea reflects the offender’s acceptance of responsibility and influences the degree of reduction. Turning momentarily to ancillary case law, in R v. Milton [2019] EWCA Crim 1873, dealing with offences involving theft from charitable institutions, the court noted that while the monetary value was modest, the reputational damage and disruption to charitable operations warranted enhanced custodial considerations. Of course, that judgment is factually distinct, but the principle of aggravated harm through victim vulnerability is broadly instructive. Similarly, R v. Owusu [2020] EWCA Crim 902 involved a repeat offender found guilty of aggravated commercial burglary, a more serious offence bearing little direct relation to the present facts but noteworthy for its statement on public protection concerns arising from repetitive acquisitive offending. Further, R v. Carlyle [2018] EWCA Crim 562 concerned possession of a bladed article in a school car park—a matter unrelated to your case save for highlighting the courts’ firm stance on offences potentially endangering vulnerable groups, underscoring the contextual weight courts afford such factors in sentencing assessments. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. Post-arrest, the police established through intelligence-led surveillance and forensic examination a pattern to your activities. The consistency of your methodology emerged clearly: timed visits to midweek shopping days, selective targeting of unstaffed aisles, and the use of concealment tactics. Multiple staff statements attest to a growing atmosphere of trepidation among employees at the targeted outlets. The cumulative financial impact, while individually minor per incident, amassed to a figure significantly exceeding the £1,500 mark, invoking greater prosecutorial attention. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. Of note, the evidentiary package submitted included a victim personal statement from the manager of a local pharmacy, expressing the demoralising effect your conduct had on staff wellbeing and morale, challenges to managerial scheduling, and the economic burden borne by the business after repeated shrinkage. Such statements serve as important reminders that victim impact in shoplifting cases extends beyond the monetary. Regarding your background, you are aged 34. You carry previous convictions for theft-related matters, notably a caution in 2021 for shoplifting and a conviction for handling stolen goods in 2018. Your personal history reveals periods of unstable housing, unemployment, and intermittent engagement with substance use services, though there is no diagnosis of serious mental illness. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. Within the psychiatric and psychological assessments obtained pursuant to the court’s direction, Dr Olivia Miller — a consultant forensic psychologist instructed at the defence’s request — reports your presentation as consistent with borderline personality traits, impulsivity, and maladaptive coping mechanisms. While not suggesting psychosis or major mental disorder, Dr Miller highlights longstanding difficulties with emotional regulation and low tolerance for distress, factors which may bear upon motivations but do not mitigate culpability. The report recommends structured interventions focusing on cognitive-behavioural approaches, impulse control, and engagement with local addiction services. The Department of Probation has prepared a comprehensive pre-sentence report, authored by Probation Officer Sophie Lin, which was made available to all parties ahead of this hearing. The report points to medium risk of reoffending with a focus on acquisitive offending patterns. It also laments your inconsistent participation with voluntary support offers and noted difficulty maintaining stable accommodation, a recognised criminogenic factor. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. The report references your family circumstances briefly; you have a sister residing in Birmingham with whom contact is intermittent. Letters submitted on your behalf from your sister and a social support worker at the Peterborough Homeless Outreach Service convey sympathy and hope for your rehabilitation but are cautious about unrealistic expectations. Notably, the letter from the outreach service worker speaks to the strain on local housing support schemes, which are operating at near maximum capacity. The chronic shortage of affordable and supported housing in the region is well-documented, with waiting lists extending for years for suitable placements, further exacerbated by a rise in street homelessness. Such context is relevant to overall assessment but not a fresh excuse for persistent criminality. The court recognises environmental pressures but equally holds steadfast to the principle that personal responsibility remains paramount. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. Switching briefly to procedural observations, I comment on recent innovations trialled within the Crown Courts of the East of England, particularly the measured adoption of technological solutions to expedite case management. Electronic disclosure systems, enhanced digital evidence presentation, and remote witness facilitation have yielded some efficiencies, albeit tempered by perennial challenges of uneven internet connectivity in rural circuits. I also note the recent refurbishment of Court 1 at Peterborough Crown Court, which included improved audio-visual aids and an ergonomically designed judge’s bench. While marginal to sentencing considerations, such improvements contribute positively to the judicial process and participant experience. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. Turning to the wider social implications, one cannot ignore the broader societal backdrop to this offending pattern. Nationally, the past decade has witnessed considerable shifts in retail security technology, consumer behaviour, and community policing priorities. The rise of self-service checkouts, contactless payments, and increased video surveillance have altered the landscape, but criminal methods adapt swiftly—thus the importance of continued vigilance. Moreover, the court shares awareness of the pressures faced by shop workers, many reliant on minimum wage jobs, vulnerable to physical and emotional strain, and increasingly disillusioned by repeated encounters with theft. The cumulative cost of such offences imposes upward pressure on pricing, insurance premiums, and ultimately consumer access. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. The Crown has presented evidence that you previously participated in a local diversionary programme targeting first-time or low-risk offenders, focused on restorative justice and community service. Unfortunately, the programme concluded with your cessation of compliant engagement and immediate resumption of offending upon conclusion. This fact adversely colours any mitigation based on reduction of culpability or prospects for rehabilitation and is a pertinent aggravating factor. The court must balance community safety with the necessity for a sentence sufficiently robust to denote the serious nature of persistent acquisitive offending. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. In considering sentence, I am mindful of the sentencing guideline stipulations. Factors aggravating your culpability include persistence, prior offending, disregard for warnings, and the impact — both economic and psychological — on retail staff. Mitigating factors are limited, primarily your eventual guilty plea and some evidence of personal difficulties, though none sufficient to diminish criminal responsibility. Recent jurisprudence informs that custodial sentences are appropriate where offending demonstrates significant planning, repeated breach of trust, or where community-based interventions have been exhausted or declined. However, this court remains conscious of the overrepresentation of similar offenders in custodial institutions and the need, where possible, to deploy proportional alternatives balancing rehabilitation and public protection. It is essential to reiterate that sentencing powers are exercised not merely to punish but to prevent reoffending and promote reintegration within society. The court welcomes the probation service’s willingness to recommend structured programmes targeting offending behaviour, and will consider such in full at the formal sentencing hearing. Finally, I must address the issue of credit for the late plea. As earlier noted, the timing of the guilty plea bears on any discount applied to sentence length, reflecting judicial recognition of early acceptance of wrongdoing and substantial savings in court time and emotional cost to victims. In assessing your plea timing, I note it was entered some months into the process, only after the prosecution presented an unassailable case. The sentencing discount will thus be appropriately limited. I shall adjourn the matter to permit receipt of the updated pre-sentence report, incorporating any new information from probation and clinical professionals, and will impose sentence accordingly on the date set. The sentencing remarks issued today, 17 October 2025, are delivered in open court, Court 1 at Peterborough Crown Court. A full transcript has been prepared in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules and will be entered on the court record. The defendant is advised of the statutory right to appeal within 28 calendar days following sentencing, pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under section 4(2) of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. Legal costs remain to be addressed at the conclusion of proceedings.
