Mr H Case No. T2026/04352 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. Westwood Filed: 14 September 2026 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of a charge of theft by shoplifting, as set out under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, brought against you following a protracted investigation spanning several months. The offending occurred predominantly in the Hartford metropolitan area, with some related instances in adjoining boroughs. This indictment reflects a course of conduct which, while superficially minor in its individual episodes, collectively amounts to offending of significant concern, both to public confidence and to those affected by your actions. Procedural Background Your matter first came before the magistrates’ court on 4 February 2026, initially listed for plea and case management. Due to the complexity of the evidence and the requirement for additional disclosure, the proceedings were transferred to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, an initiative designed to streamline the management of triable-either-way offences where the gravity or volume of material warrants the involvement of higher-tier judicial resources. The BCM process has been a feature of criminal case handling since its introduction in the mid-2000s and aims to prevent undue delay by ensuring thoroughness in prosecution preparation and facilitating early engagement with the defence. In this instance, although certain adjunct applications were made regarding disclosure of CCTV footage and witness availability, the case proceeded largely within BCM timelines. It is appropriate here to place on record the cooperation of Hartford Borough Police and the Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) of the district, whose engagement and inter-agency communication aided in efficient case progression. The BCRP, a public-private arrangement involving local retailers, law enforcement, and council representatives, exemplifies the modern approach to tackling acquisitive offences through coordinated intelligence-sharing and community response. Despite difficulties caused by periods of police officer shortages and staff turnover, the investigations unit maintained momentum, as recorded in successive operation logs submitted to the court. The investigative phase was marked by the use of digital forensic techniques, including analysis of CCTV footage from multiple retailers, forensic examination of seized personal effects, and corroboration of witness statements from shop-floor staff and loss prevention officers. These evidentiary components formed the basis for your detention and charge under the Theft Act. The statutory context that governs such offences is clear; while theft under £200 is often subject to summary disposal, persistent offending or conduct that evidences premeditation rightly attracts Crown Court jurisdiction and a sentencing approach commensurate with its cumulative impact. Following your initial appearance, you were remanded on conditional bail, which was continued across several hearings subject to compliance with curfew and residence restrictions. These conditions were periodically reviewed at pre-trial listing hearings on 25 March and 16 April 2026. The case was further adjourned on 21 May to allow expert psychiatric assessment, commissioning which was impeded by administrative delays within the Legal Aid Agency—a recurring issue the court has noted with increasing frustration in recent years. The protracted authorisation of funding for the independent reports required to fairly assess your mental health and personal circumstances severely delayed preparatory proceedings. It is a lamentable state of affairs that the administration of justice is at times hindered, not by substantive legal conflicts, but by bureaucratic inertia, as was manifest here. Your psychiatric evaluation was eventually conducted by Dr Sandra Hollings, a consultant forensic psychiatrist with experience in cases involving behavioural impulsivity and substance use. Her detailed report of 2 September 2026 contains observations pertinent to risk assessment, potential causal factors for your offending, and responsiveness to rehabilitative interventions. The report was supplemented by the probation service’s pre-sentence questionnaire, which addressed your social history, previous convictions, and recent compliance with bail conditions. It must also be noted that your representations to the court came alongside several character references, including letters from your sister and a local volunteer employed by a homelessness charity. These documents attest to your temperament and occasional engagement with community services. The court recognises the effort such statements represent and their potential to illuminate the humanity behind the offending conduct, even as they do not detract from the seriousness of the offences charged. The Crown was represented with customary diligence by Ms Elaine Robertson, whose meticulous presentation of evidence left no aspect unexamined. On behalf of the defence, Mr Gareth Milton has pleaded on your behalf, advancing consistent arguments focused on mitigating circumstances, underlying vulnerability, and the necessity for a proportionate sentence reflective of your personal difficulties and rehabilitation prospects. It is regrettable that delays occasioned by external factors limited the court’s ability to expedite resolution, as public confidence is invariably tested when justice is protracted. There has been insufficient media attention in this, as in many low-level acquisitive crime cases, a point observed in broader criminal justice discourse, but here the court proceeds mindful that the impact on victims and community stores is tangible nonetheless. In considering sentence, the court is bound by the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, as last amended in 2024. The guideline emphasises five principal considerations: the culpability of the offender, the harm caused — including to victims and the broader community — the need for deterrence, rehabilitation prospects, and any personal mitigation. Reference may be made to R v. Unsworth [2023] EWCA Crim 601, a case concerning repeat retail theft, where the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence despite the low individual value of stolen goods, highlighting the cumulative effect on victim confidence and operational burden on retail staff. Unsworth emphasised that persistent offending trait is a significant aggravator, especially when previous interventions have failed to stem recidivism. The principles enunciated in R v. Grantham [2019] EWCA Crim 487, dealing with shoplifting from charity shops, reinforce that sentencing must reflect not only pecuniary loss but also psychological impact on vulnerable victims and the strain on limited community resources. Grantham underscored the relevance of offender insight and cooperation as factors warranting careful consideration. Further, while the present matter is manifestly distinct from the more serious offences addressed in R v. Alcott [2022] EWCA Crim 820 — where the defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary of a private dwelling during family absence — the general principles regarding evaluation of time served and plea timing are germane. Alcott established that the timing of a guilty plea, particularly when entered late, significantly influences sentencing tariffs. The court is likewise mindful of the underlying statutory purposes encapsulated in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, reinforcing that sentencing aims not solely to punish but to promote rehabilitation and protect the public through effective risk management. This balance is at the forefront of judicial reasoning in acquisitive crime. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. The facts of the offending reveal a pattern of systematic engagement with various retail outlets, involving the appropriation of goods, the concealment of items upon entry, and tactical evasion of store security measures. The repeated nature of your conduct and the geographical spread of your activities indicate more than transient lapses. During the investigation, the court was presented with extensive CCTV footage corroborating witness statements which depicted your movements within and around stores, as well as forensic recovery of pilfered items in your possession. These findings solidify the prosecution’s case beyond reasonable doubt. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. Notwithstanding the absence of physical violence or threats, the impact on store employees — often young, part-time workers vulnerable to intimidation — has been profound. Statements collected from individuals working at local convenience stores reveal heightened anxiety, altered scheduling practices, and diminished morale. One loss prevention officer noted a pervasive sense of unease: “Many of our staff have expressed reluctance to work alone or at night shifts because of this individual’s repeated presence.” Such effects, though intangible, resonate deeply in the assessment of harm occasioned. A further examination of case law is instructive. The decision in R v. Spinks [2020] EWCA Crim 1035, concerning a fly-tipping offence which, while unrelated factually to theft, emphasised the social and environmental consequences of repeated disregard for law, underscores the courts’ increasing recognition of cumulative social harm. Spinks received a custodial term despite absence of direct physical injury, reflecting that societal norms and public confidence necessitate a proportionate response. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. The court also notes the relevance of interdisciplinary expertise in calibrating an appropriate sentence. The report of Dr Hollings provides insight into your mental health profile. While there was no diagnosis of major mental illness, the presence of mild depressive symptoms, borderline personality features, and substance misuse issues, particularly involving intermittent cannabis consumption, contribute to risk assessment and rehabilitative planning. It is of concern that you have had limited engagement with the local drug and alcohol service, partly due to mistrust and inconsistent attendance. Such non-cooperation constitutes an obstacle to effective rehabilitation and public protection and is a recurring theme in cases managed by the Newark Probation Service. Moreover, your socioeconomic circumstances are challenging. You currently reside in privately rented accommodation under a short-term lease, with intermittent financial support from family members. Your employment history is sparse; recent periods of unemployment have exacerbated fiscal and psychological stressors. The probation report prepared by Officer Janice Moreland, dated 10 September 2026, highlights a complex picture of vulnerability blended with personal agency. It recommends a sentence that incorporates elements of supervision and structured support, underscoring the importance of addressing offending behaviour directly. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. Alongside these issues runs the broader societal context. The court is mindful of phenomena noted in numerous recent reports, including the Home Office’s 2025 Crime and Community Safety Review, highlighting a persistent increase in acquisitive offending linked to ongoing economic dislocation and welfare system pressures exacerbated by inflationary trends. While such macro-level analysis does not excuse individual offending, it frames the challenges facing law enforcement and social services alike. Parallel to this, the local authority’s housing department reports continued strain resulting from a surge in applications for emergency accommodation—consequent upon the collapse of the hospitality and retail sectors under pandemic-related restrictions. The resultant homelessness and housing instability complicate rehabilitation strategies for those entangled in criminal justice systems. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. I must also express concern regarding the Legal Aid Agency’s administration in this case. The delay in funding instruction for independent psychiatric advice, manifesting as procedural vacillation and multiple rounds of clarification, risks undermining defendants’ rights to timely and fair hearings. Such delay, while borne in this case largely through no fault of the court or parties, has systemic implications that merit urgent attention. Equally, the challenge of ensuring appropriate access to community-based support remains considerable. The probation service, despite commendable dedication, is hampered by staff shortages—an issue not unique to Hartford but endemic across much of the country—and the COVID-era backlog in mental health assessments persists. Waiting times for interventions can stretch into months. These systemic pressures should not be allowed to dilute judicial resolve. It is incumbent upon this court to balance compassion with the imperative of deterrence, individualised rehabilitation with the need for certainty in the law’s application. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. It bears repeating that your previous convictions include multiple occasions of shoplifting, as recorded between 2018 and 2023, and one caution for possession of cannabis. None of these antecedents involve violence; however, the repetition reinforces the conclusion of an entrenched pattern of offending. The court is also aware of your failure to maintain previous community orders imposed in 2021, which were revoked due to non-compliance. Despite these warnings and interventions, the offences in question were committed, demonstrating a regrettable resistance to change that diminishes prospects for leniency. The Crown is therefore entitled to submit that a sentence with a custodial element is warranted, both as punishment and deterrence. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Victim impact statements prepared by the Hartford Retail Federation underscore the disruption shoplifting causes beyond sheer financial loss. Staff turnover, increased security costs, and reduced store hours are the practical consequences, but the psychological toll on employees is less visible and yet equally significant. One statement reads: “The constant fear of theft creates an environment of suspicion that affects everyone. Staff morale has never been lower, and many good workers have left because they no longer feel supported or safe.” This court recognises the broader societal ramifications of offending such as yours. Retail outlets, particularly smaller independent stores, are community cornerstones that rely on mutual respect and lawful engagement. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. Turning to sentencing options, the Sentencing Council guidelines provide for consideration of community orders, suspended sentences, and custodial terms where appropriate. The threshold for immediate custody in shoplifting cases is ordinarily reserved for repeated and aggravated offending or where the offender refuses all engagement with rehabilitative prospects. Given your personal circumstances, including mental health factors and housing instability, a community-focused sentence with robust supervision merits consideration, provided that it includes specific rehabilitative requirements addressing offending behaviour and substance misuse. It is imperative that any sentence imposed conveys the gravity of your criminal conduct, the adverse impact on victims and local businesses, and the necessity of public confidence in the administration of justice. That said, prior community orders have failed to secure compliance, and there is a demonstrable risk of ongoing reoffending if interventions are insufficiently stringent. The probation officer’s recommendations point to a multi-faceted approach, blending cognitive behavioural programmes, substance misuse treatment, and practical support for housing and employment. In the wider context, the court is aware of cases in which sentences were aggravated due to failure to engage with treatment pathways. For example, in R v. Chen [2024] EWCA Crim 1399, a defendant with a history of acquisitive crime and substance dependency received an immediate custodial sentence after repeated breaches of community orders, despite support being made available. The court held that public protection must, at times, take priority over therapeutic ambition. The court has also noted with appreciation various written representations submitted by charity organisations active in Hartford, including SafeStay Housing and the Hartford Food Bank, which emphasise the precariousness of the local social safety net and the complexity of needs faced by offenders similar to yourself. In a macrocosmic sense, this case is emblematic of the pressures that face the criminal justice system: the intersection of crime, poverty, disability, and community cohesion. It is neither reducible to easy answers nor immune to the contingency of resources and political will. I am mindful, however, that sentencing is not social policy. It is the application of law by a tribunal charged with balancing competing interests in pursuit of justice. The custody threshold is not crossed lightly, and the court must be satisfied that no community alternative can adequately address risk or signify the condemnation warranted. I have carefully considered the submissions of learned counsel on both sides, and I record my thanks to Ms Robertson and Mr Milton for their thorough and civilised advocacy. The proceedings have been conducted in open court, with full adherence to due process requirements. The layout of this courtroom, recently refurbished under Ministry of Justice initiative funds awarded in 2024, provides an environment conducive to solemn and respectful adjudication. Before concluding, it is incumbent to note that various case law relating to more serious offences, such as R v. Davies [2018] EWCA Crim 2128 concerning possession of a bladed article in a school car park, or R v. Lambert [2021] EWCA Crim 1075 involving affray after a pub brawl, bear no relevance here beyond illustrating judicial approaches to culpability and sentencing principle. It is also of no bearing that a co-defendant named Davies in a separate unrelated matter in 2025 failed to appear for sentencing and remains at large—the present case concerns your conduct alone. Some ancillary procedural distractions included a brief adjournment in May linked to an unrelated trial involving arson charges in Court 5, as well as an incident where court clerk absence necessitated rearrangement of listings in June. Such events, while peripheral, form part of the tapestry of routine court life and bear no substantive onus upon this matter. Finally, the presence of a visitor to the public gallery whose unrelated grievance with local housing providers was aired briefly outside court doorways serves only to highlight the complexities of social interdependence that occasionally intersect, but do not intrude upon, criminal proceedings. In the circumstances, I direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith, with the fullest consideration given to potential rehabilitative schemes inclusive of cognitive skills training, substance misuse programmes, and community reintegration assistance. I will reserve sentence to a later date, allowing the probation service time to complete this report and any further observations from the defence or Crown to be considered. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2026, in Court 4 at Hartford Crown Court. The proceedings have been fully transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be duly transmitted to the appropriate registries. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.
