MR H Case No. B2025/14537 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge D. L. FENWICK Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in relation to allegations of shoplifting conducted over an extended period within the Berkshire jurisdiction, specifically encompassing retail establishments in Reading, Wokingham, and Slough. The charge, as informed by section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, is reflective of a course of conduct that this court must consider with due regard to both statutory guidance and the broader contextual factors that inform sentencing decisions in such cases. The offences, as emphasised in the prosecution material, span from late 2023 through to the spring of 2025. Procedural History and Administrative Commentary The investigative phase leading to your arrest was notably multi-agency in nature, involving coordination between the Thames Valley Police Retail Crime Unit, local council enforcement teams, and the Berkshire Business Crime Collaborative. This collaborative mechanism, while intended to provide a streamlined approach to reducing repeat acquisitive offences, has been subject to variability in efficacy. It is worth noting that, according to internal audits conducted in late 2024, the Collaborative experienced significant staff turnover, which contributed to delays in communication and intelligence sharing during the early stages of the inquiry into your conduct. The court acknowledges the efforts of the responding officers, who, despite these institutional constraints, managed to collate and cross-reference considerable volumes of security footage and transaction data to establish a connection between disparate incidents. It must be said, at this juncture, that the court remains mindful of the systemic challenges facing policing in the retail context. Police resources, already stretched by emerging demands and an uptick in cyber-enabled fraud, must now also contend with the persistent drain caused by offences deemed “low priority” by some, yet cumulatively significant. These cases consume disproportionate time and energy, as frontline staff are required to manage detailed evidential procedures involving forensic checks, interviews, and witness statements from often transient retail employees. Your initial appearance was listed before this court on 12 June 2025. Prior to sentencing, the matter was the subject of multiple procedural hearings, including a case management hearing on 20 July and a plea and trial preparation hearing on 3 August. These hearings followed the Criminal Procedure Rules’ designated timeframes, notwithstanding some adjournments arising from legal aid funding issues. It is lamentable—and a matter of ongoing judicial concern—that applications for funding to obtain expert psychiatric assessments routinely face administrative inertia, frequently compromising the timely administration of justice. In your case, a request to instruct an independent consultant psychiatrist was ultimately authorised only in late July 2025 after several remittals and resubmissions. The court is grateful to Dr Marcus Ellison, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, for his detailed and professionally composed report dated 29 August 2025. His analysis was thoughtful and clinically nuanced, though of limited mitigating relevance in the present context. Dr Ellison’s observations regarding your psychological profile — particularly your reported difficulties with impulse control and intermittent engagement in support services — are noted. Further procedural elements worthy of remark pertain to the responsiveness of the Legal Aid Agency. Regrettably, yet again, the delays encountered have been far from trivial. The protracted approval process for funding expert assessments risks undermining the expedient resolution of cases such as this. Layered over an already complex case management schedule, these delays contribute to systemic inefficiencies at a critical point in case progression. Efforts to secure compliance and engagement with rehabilitation services have been overseen by the Berkshire Probation Service. The probation officer assigned to your case, Ms Claire Whitnell, has reported difficulties in establishing consistent contact and notes a pattern of “stop-start” participation in offered programmes. As is well-recognised in contemporary probation practice, engagement with cognitive behavioural interventions correlates strongly with reductions in recidivism; thus, your reticence to commit fully to such efforts is a matter of concern. On a different note, the court acknowledges the work of local voluntary organisations, including the Reading Retail Victim Support Group and the Thames Valley Community Aid Network. Both have contributed impact statements—received with some delay due to operational pressures—which describe the significant toll on retail staff morale, including reports of heightened anxiety and reduced hours as a direct consequence of persistent thefts. It is an unfortunate reality, however, that the volume of low-level acquisitive offences in the Thames Valley policing area mirrors national trends. Data presented by Ms Felicity Grant, Crime Data Analyst for the region, reveals a year-on-year increase in retail theft of 9.2% between 2021 and 2024, with particular spikes observed in the winter months correlating with increased footfall. Such statistics, while impersonal, are indicators of the broader social and economic pressures that frame the incidence of offences like those before the court. There is, of course, a notable interplay between socioeconomic instability and offending behaviour, yet it is the role of this court to assess individual culpability within that broader matrix, not to absolve responsibility through generalised causation. The court recognizes, too, the wider context of challenges faced by the NHS Mental Health Trust in Berkshire, where service capacity constraints have led to extensive waiting times for community-based psychological therapies—sometimes exceeding nine months. Such limitations inevitably affect offenders whose behavioural issues may benefit from timely clinical intervention, thus complicating rehabilitation efforts. Turning to legal context, your case falls squarely within the ambit of the Theft Act 1968, with relevant interpretative guidance provided by the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline of 2021. This guideline emphasises an assessment of harm, culpability, and the presence or absence of aggravating and mitigating factors. It also alerts sentencing courts to the cumulative harm of repeated offending, irrespective of the ostensibly modest value of individual thefts. The aggravation inherent in repeat thefts from vulnerable or independent retail outlets remains a significant sentencing consideration. This court, in exercising its discretion, is also mindful of authoritative judgments such as R v. Chambers [2022] EWCA Crim 1157 and R v. Patel [2023] EWCA Crim 898, which underscore the proportionality principle in sentencing—demanding careful calibration between punishment and rehabilitation. Those cases, however, remain distinguishable from yours, as the conduct before the court was less overtly violent or threatening. Referrals for psychological assessment and sentencing recommendations adopted in these cases provide a useful benchmarking framework; nonetheless, each matter must stand on its own factual and contextual footing. The facts of the offending are as follows: Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. The sequence of events recorded indicates a pattern of deliberate selection of valuable or sought-after goods, with an evident strategy to circumvent security measures. The methodical concealment of items within clothing, timed departures coinciding with periods of low staff presence, and use of distraction techniques all demonstrate premeditation rather than impulsive lapse. Counsel for the Crown has drawn particular attention to the economic impact on small business proprietors. Victim statements, submitted through the Reading Retail Crime Prevention Partnership, articulate a palpable erosion of trust in the immediate community and document an uptick in insurance premiums and necessity for additional security measures. Staff turnover—already a pressing issue in retail—is exacerbated by such offending, which contributes to a climate of chronic workplace stress. The court is aware that both you and others in your social milieu have access to a range of community services intended to prevent reoffending. Organizations such as Berkshire Women's Refuge and the Oxford Street Homeless Outreach Program provide simultaneous support and deterrence strategies, sometimes coordinating with the probation service. Your acknowledgement or participation in these initiatives has been inconsistent. Referring to further legal background, the court observes that section 143 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 imposes restrictions on ancillary relief in theft-related crimes, highlighting the primacy of ensuring appropriate punishment and deterrence. While this provision rarely affects sentence length directly, it reflects legislative intent to maintain clarity of consequence for offences of dishonesty. It is, meanwhile, salutary to recall reflections from R v. Stanford [2020] EWCA Crim 473, involving theft from a community pharmacy, where it was held that offences causing psychological distress to employees may warrant assistance to victims through restitution or restorative justice provisions alongside sentence considerations. The offences before the court have contributed to a cumulative impact that transcends mere pecuniary loss, touching upon worker wellbeing and community confidence. These are matters underscored in numerous victim liaison reports filed in this case. The court next considers the behavioural profile elucidated by Dr Ellison in his report. While he notes no evidence of major mental disorder, traits of impulsivity and a degree of emotional dysregulation are flagged. He also identifies some ambivalence towards behavioural change and limited insight into the consequences of your conduct. Attempts were made to arrange follow-up clinical sessions; however, as noted earlier, engagement was sporadic. The enduring issue of housing instability also features in the background. Counsel for the defence has presented evidence of Mr H’s accommodation difficulties, including reliance on short-term arrangements with the local council. This resonates with the lived experiences of many in the region, where affordable housing shortages drive a transient existence that can, in turn, undermine attempts at social and rehabilitative stability. The local authority housing department has provided correspondence confirming such circumstances. While this is not an excuse, it is a factor which must be weighed with care. There is a lamentable, and growing, frustration among frontline workers tasked with balancing statutory duties within the parameters of resource scarcity. Probation officers, police, and health professionals alike testify to challenges imposed by caseload pressures and interagency coordination, sometimes hindered further by bureaucratic formalities. It is necessary also to address, briefly, the role of digital forensic assessment in this case. The forensic examination of your mobile device, conducted by officers from the Reading Police Digital Crime Unit, identified communications consistent with surveillance avoidance techniques, reinforcing the prosecution’s depiction of intentionality. The investigative scope was, however, limited by contemporaneous issues of data privacy and encryption protocols. Your employment history reveals a series of short-term roles in low-skilled sectors, interspersed with periods of unemployment. This lack of occupational stability is recognised as a risk factor for offending, yet it is one that many manage to mitigate through adherence to lawful conduct. The local Probation Service has, since your arrest, offered you placement on the Berkshire Cognitive Skills Programme, which targets irregular decision-making and promotes alternative behavioural strategies to acquisitive conduct. Attendance, as previously noted, has been irregular, compromising the potential benefit of such interventions. Statements submitted by members of your family describe a complex relational environment, with sporadic contact and mutual ambivalence. While familial support can act as a protective factor, its absence or inconsistency can conversely remove an important stabilising influence. The defence has submitted letters of support from charitable organisations, including the Thames Valley Food Bank and West Berkshire Homelessness Outreach, which speak to your reported efforts to address financial hardship and health concerns. These submissions are, naturally, taken into account with appropriate caution—supportive statements do not negate responsibility or diminish offence gravity but provide context that may assist in shaping rehabilitative pathways. The Crown has emphasised, rightly, the need for deterrence and the protection of the public from sustained acquisitive offending, especially in retail environments where vulnerable staff and small business proprietors are disproportionately affected. Some further observations must be added concerning local policy developments. The Berkshire Retail Crime Strategic Plan 2024-2027, referenced in sentencing submissions, highlights the regional priority accorded to combating shoplifting, with specific provisions for increased surveillance, community alert systems, and offender management panels. While such frameworks aim to reduce repeat offences, their success relies heavily on individual behavioural change and active engagement with supervision mechanisms. The court further notes that comparable cases in the region have resulted in both custodial and community sentences, with recent appellate decisions underlining the necessity of deterrence tempered by proportionality. The repeated nature of your offending, coupled with the limited personal insight and partial engagement with support, point towards a custodial sentence, unless mitigating factors provide strong counterbalance. The victim impact statements, to reiterate, describe real economic and psychological harm, extending beyond simple financial loss. Employee redeployments, reduced shifts, and decreased workplace morale are among the consequences documented. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. In one particular incident noted by the prosecution, your conduct was observed during a high-traffic period at a major supermarket, where concealment of goods was conducted in a manner that suggested hope of evasion amid distracted staff. Such calculated timing reflects heightened culpability, as does the previous use of a collaborative distraction technique described in one statement. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. It is important not to overlook the social costs borne by the wider community. Local shops affected by repeated thefts often face closure, which in turn diminishes access to essential goods for elderly and mobility-impaired residents. The court must take such secondary harms into account. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. There has also been reference to prior warnings and community resolution attempts which did not yield long-lasting behavioural change. This pattern raises concerns about your receptiveness to rehabilitative opportunities and the efficacy of early interventions. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. Taking a slightly different perspective, it is instructive to consider the historic trajectory of sentencing for theft offences. Earlier jurisprudence, such as R v. Bell [1995] 1 Cr App R (S) 176, reflected a more punitive approach with emphasis on deterrence. However, modern sentencing, influenced by extensive research on rehabilitative efficacy, seeks a balance. It is neither soft nor draconian, but informed by evidence and proportionality. The court also acknowledges the guidelines embodied in the Sentencing Council’s 2017 supplementary document on community orders, which emphasises personalised intervention and the avoidance of custody where effective alternatives exist. However, the recidivist nature of your offending cannot be overstated. Persistent acquisitive crime, while low in individual value, constitutes a profound challenge to community safety and cohesion. Indeed, a notable recent judgment of R v. Kerr [2024] EWCA Crim 782 addressed the sentencing of a defendant convicted of repeated shop theft involving coercive accomplices, resulting in an immediate custodial sentence despite the absence of physical violence. Whilst no complicity of this nature is alleged here, Kerr confirms judicial intolerance of repeated serial offending. Alongside individual sentencing, restorative justice options have been mooted, recognising their value in addressing victim harm and offender accountability. Your apparent ambivalence towards participation in such initiatives is noted and regretted. It is also pertinent to recognize the systemic pressures facing probation services. Staff shortages, high caseloads, and funding constraints limit capacity for sustained offender engagement, frequently impacting the quality of interventions. The psychiatric and psychological evaluations, couched in clinical terminology, remind all parties that behavioural change is exigent and complex, involving individual motivation, social support, and effective service provision. Optimism must be tempered by realism. It is further observable that ancillary factors—such as your status as a single parent with caregiving responsibilities—add layers of difficulty to both supervision and compliance. These matters, while relevant to tailoring support, do not diminish the seriousness of the offences or override the need for deterrent sentencing. The court has also considered the recent introduction of the Retail Crime Enforcement Framework by the Home Office, which underscores national focus on reducing acquisitive offences and protecting small businesses through enhanced policing and sentencing standards. Counsel on both sides have submitted extensive representations, including references to case law on sentencing credit for guilty pleas and mitigation of term. Although your plea was entered at an early stage, the overall impact of your conduct counsels caution in the extent to which such credit may be afforded. To conclude, the evidence shows a pattern of offending reflective of deliberate and calculated behaviour, accompanied by partial but inconsistent engagement with rehabilitative efforts and support services. It is therefore appropriate that a pre-sentence report should now be commissioned. This will allow the probation service to consider fully all relevant factors, including risk of reoffending, personal circumstances, and any support services most likely to assist in your rehabilitation. The report should specifically address the feasibility of community-based interventions such as cognitive skills training, structured day programmes, and potential restorative justice activities. Meanwhile, the court emphasizes the importance of these sentencing remarks serving as a clear indication of the seriousness with which such offences are viewed, together with the critical role of public protection. These sentencing remarks are issued this 14th day of September 2025, in Court 5 at Berkshire Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in conformance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of conviction and sentence will be communicated to the relevant agencies, including the local probation service and the Police National Computer.
