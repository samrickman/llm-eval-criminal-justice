MR H Case No. B2025/13456 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. C. BAMFORD Filed: 23 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction for theft, in relation to a series of incidents of shoplifting committed at various retail establishments within the Birmingham metropolitan area over the course of fifteen months, culminating in your arrest in late May 2025. The charge is brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, engaging the established framework for dealing with dishonesty offences involving the appropriation of goods from commerce without payment. The offending represents a continuing breach of trust and law which has caused disruption to local businesses, some of which are small enterprises vulnerable to economic fluctuations and criminal loss. Procedural Background This matter has travelled a somewhat protracted path to this sentencing hearing. Following your arrest on 30 May 2025, which culminated after a three-week period of surveillance coordinated between Birmingham City Police and representatives of the local Retail Crime Prevention Network, you were initially remanded in custody due to concerns relating to alleged breaches of earlier bail conditions. On 15 June 2025, at a plea and trial preparation hearing, you entered a not guilty plea, necessitating preparation for a contested trial. The case was listed for trial in September 2025 but was resolved shortly before the hearing when you tendered a guilty plea. It is regrettable that your admission of guilt did not occur at an earlier stage. The Crown Court, pursuant to well-established precedent — including the guidance laid down in R v. Marshall [2019] EWCA Crim 1434 — accords sentence reductions according to the timing of guilty pleas, providing the greatest discount for those entered at the first realistic opportunity. Late pleas, particularly those entered after the close of the prosecution case or immediately prior to trial, attract a significantly reduced credit. The principle was reiteratively affirmed in R v. Stockton [2023] EWCA Crim 880, which emphasised that the incentive for an early guilty plea rests upon genuine acceptance of responsibility and recognition of harm, rather than tactical advantage. The Court wishes to place on record the professional conduct of counsel on both sides. Ms Fiona Prestwick, appearing for the Crown, has presented her submissions cogently and in a manner consistent with her obligations. Mr Peter Langton, representing the defence under a Legal Aid contract, has made earnest applications on behalf of your interests and pursued relevant enquiries that have informed today’s proceedings. Nevertheless, this court notes with concern yet again the delays occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency in granting authority to instruct a forensic psychiatric expert. The initial request, submitted on 4 July 2025, was comparably protracted, only being resolved on 14 August 2025 after multiple reminders and administrative exchanges. Such delay, extolled by practitioners and judges alike, only adds to the systemic strain faced by courts and defendants and risks undermining the principle of a timely trial. Moreover, the case was further elongated by issues surrounding the availability of expert clinical opinion. Dr. Rachel Dunn, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided her report on 8 September 2025 following an extended wait caused by NHS mental health service waiting list backlogs. This backlog, mirrored nationally, is symptomatic of a broader crisis in community mental health provision, where demand consistently outstrips supply despite multiple policy initiatives. The absence of timely assessments complicates court processes and frustrates attempts to tailor sentences which appropriately reflect individual circumstances. It is inappropriate to ignore the societal context within which these offences arose. This jurisdiction, like many across the United Kingdom, has witnessed a modest but sustained increase in petty acquisitive crime during the past five years, attributable in part to socioeconomic pressures, fluctuating employment opportunities, and the lingering aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic upon community cohesion. Retailers, especially those operating in economically marginalised neighbourhoods, report growing losses linked to theft, often accompanied by threats to staff and the adoption of costly protective measures. It would be simplistic to dissociate these personal offences from the wider malaise, though the court is conscious that societal hardship provides explanation but not justification or excuse for unlawful conduct. The dicta of Lord Justice Rose in R v. Dunlop [2017] EWCA Crim 390 highlight the delicate balancing act faced by courts: justice must be tempered by mercy, but must also preserve public confidence and prioritise the protection of the vulnerable. While the defendants in that environmental offence case committed harm with clear knowledge of statutory prohibitions, the principle applies equally to petty thefts which cumulatively impose genuine burdens on society. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. The incidents you engaged in were not isolated events but rather reflect a degree of premeditation and persistence. Surveillance footage and witness accounts demonstrate a familiarity with store layouts and habitual return to particular locations. The court observes that your conduct appears driven less by opportunism than by a pattern of behaviour sustained over time, with thefts focused primarily on convenience stores, chemists, and a single chain of discount food outlets. These premises are frequented by vulnerable demographic groups including the elderly and families with young children, amplifying the consequence of each infringement. It is worth reflecting on the entangled responsibilities of agencies beyond the criminal justice system in such cases. Mental health trusts, housing authorities, social services, and voluntary sector organisations often interface with individuals entangled in repetitive acquisitive offending. For instance, correspondence from the Birmingham Community Mental Health Partnership — copied to the court — confirms that you had been referred for support relating to anxiety and mild depressive symptoms, though engagement was variable and ultimately ceased eight months prior to your latest offence. This pattern of sporadic contact is familiar in clinical settings, where individuals oscillate between periods of compliance and disengagement, underscoring the complex interplay between personal circumstances and criminal behaviour. Further, liaison with Smethwick Housing Services evidences that you have experienced housing instability, with a history of short-term tenancies and occasional homelessness. There is testimony from Shelter Aid UK detailing several instances offering assistance which, regrettably, you declined. This raises considerations about the sufficiency of support and the individual responsibility to utilise offered resources. The court must acknowledge ongoing challenges in addressing such multifaceted cases, where criminality, vulnerability, and systemic deficiency intersect. It is no secret that probation departments grapple with staffing shortfalls and stretched caseloads — as outlined in a recent report from the National Probation Service published in March 2025 — complicating efforts to deliver bespoke rehabilitative packages. Similarly, multi-agency risk assessment conferences (MARAC) and integrated offender management protocols, though beneficial, demand considerable administrative time and cross-sector collaboration that are often impeded by resource constraints. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. The Crown’s position emphasises the cumulative impact on retail victims and the broader community, underscoring the financial losses sustained and the erosion of staff morale triggered by repeat encounters with offenders such as yourself. Multiple statements provide testimony from shop managers who corroborate feelings of insecurity, necessitating rota adjustments and the installation of additional surveillance equipment at owner expense. It is notable, in this regard, that the Business Crime Reduction Partnership for Birmingham has compiled data highlighting a 12% rise in shoplifting incidents across the city over the past two years, with over 70% involving repeat offenders. This statistic dovetails with national trends described in the Home Office’s 2024 Crime Statistics paper, which attributes such increases to a variety of socioeconomic factors but does not diminish the individual culpability of those charged. An observation of wider significance is offered by Justice Mellor in the judgment of R v. Fielding [2020] EWCA Crim 1450, wherein the Court of Appeal remarked on the insidious harm caused by persistent acquisitive crime in undermining public trust. That case involved a series of shop thefts following which the defendant developed a rapport with retail workers but failed to desist despite warnings, ultimately resulting in a community sentence with curfew conditions. While the facts differ, Fielding illustrates the principle that deterrence and rehabilitation must be carefully calibrated. The court is not unmindful of the difficulties faced by retailers. It also recognises the reach and impact of third-party organisations in the voluntary sector, whose input often remains underappreciated in the public domain. For example, the charitable group ShopSafe UK has authored a report circulated to this court, highlighting the strain on staff confidence caused by recurrent theft-related incidents — noting as well the disproportionate impact on small independent retailers who lack the resources to implement enhanced security measures, sometimes leading to staff turnover and business closure. Such effects ripple through communities, reducing local economic vibrancy. It is also pertinent to recall that offences of this nature can impose psychological harm, even in the absence of physical violence or threats. Studies commissioned by the Retail Trust in 2023 indicate elevated stress, Burnout Syndrome, and anxiety among retail workers subjected to frequent customer or offender interactions perceived as hostile or intimidating. These factors must inform the judgment of culpability and sentencing severity. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. You have previous convictions for shoplifting offences, with prior community resolutions offered in 2021 and a conditional discharge imposed in 2023. Despite these interventions, your offending behaviour has persisted, posing challenges to traditional rehabilitative approaches. This history weighs heavily against the granting of a purely non-custodial sentence absent stringent conditions. In relation to psychiatric and psychological assessment, Dr Dunn’s report provides a nuanced portrait. She finds no evidence of a formal mental illness rendering you unfit for sentence or trial, yet comments on traits consistent with impulsivity, low distress tolerance, and chronic stress linked to socioeconomic factors. There is a suggestion of maladaptive coping mechanisms, including episodic misuse of alcohol documented in ancillary notes from your GP, Dr Simon Halliwell, who has prescribed medication for mood regulation but notes inconsistent adherence. The report cautiously recommends consideration of medium-level intervention targeting emotion regulation and cognitive-behavioural techniques. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. The probation officer assigned your case, Ms Eliza Wren, produced a pre-sentence report on 20 September 2025, ahead of today’s hearing. She notes your current lack of employment and housing insecurity, and expresses concerns about non-engagement with previous interventions. Ms Wren highlights the possibility of enrolling you in a Thinking Skills Programme, designed to address cognitive distortions and offending patterns specific to acquisitive crime. Among the ancillary issues raised are referrals to financial advice services, attempts to harness local authority housing pathways, and suggestions for voluntary sector support aimed at reconnecting you with employment and training opportunities. Nevertheless, Ms Wren emphasises the importance of your own motivation and compliance in determining the success of any such scheme. I find it appropriate to quote the prefatory remarks of the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, which underscore the court’s duty to balance punishment, public protection, and rehabilitation, while mitigating factors such as remorse and personal circumstances require cautious appraisal lest mitigation become de facto absolution. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. It is a matter of record that you declined to participate meaningfully with outreach workers at the Birmingham Voluntary Support Network, which seeks to provide a bridge between statutory services and vulnerable individuals at risk of offending or reoffending. That missed opportunity is a regrettable but not uncommon aspect within the criminal justice landscape, where resource constraints and personal reluctance impede progress. Your defence counsel has submitted written mitigation on your behalf, including a letter from your sister, Ms Tanya H., which attests to your difficult childhood and familial instability. While such contextual information is germane to the court’s broader understanding, it cannot, and does not, supplant the necessity of accountability for harmful actions. Equally, statements from the West Midlands Community Resource Centre reflect a willingness to support post-sentence rehabilitation, contingent upon your engagement. By way of redress, the court notes references made in defence submissions to relevant case law including R v. Knight [2021] EWCA Crim 605 concerning partial credit for pleas entered following extensive trial preparation, and R v. Moffett [2022] EWCA Crim 849 regarding the limits of reduction where delays have occasioned significant administrative burden. These cases illustrate the judicial caution required in the allocation of plea discounts where offenders have protracted proceedings unnecessarily. Additionally, there was mention during proceedings of co-defendant Arthur V., who pleaded guilty to separate unrelated charges involving criminal damage to a church noticeboard and who, incidentally, remains subject to a restraining order prohibiting contact with known associates involved in drug supply networks. No evidentiary link between Mr V. and you existed, and such facts are not pertinent to your individual culpability. Further unrelated procedural complications included a strike by court clerical staff during July 2025, causing several listing delays across multiple courts in the West Midlands area. This delay, while unfortunate, was external and unrelated to the substantive progress of your case, although it contributed to scheduling adjustments. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. The Police Forensic Digital Unit provided technical evidence demonstrating your use of an anonymised social media account to coordinate the purchase and distribution of goods suspected of being obtained via theft, though direct criminality in this regard was not charged. This information, while illustrating peripheral activity, lacked sufficient evidential basis for prosecution and was not attributed to you directly. The court has also sought to consider the impact of your offending on victims. Statements from affected retail staff indicate measurable distress, with some expressing ongoing anxiety about returning to work. The court takes these statements seriously and acknowledges their role in shaping sentencing outcomes within the relevant statutory framework. Consideration must also be given to the broader public interest. This jurisdiction experiences increasing challenges balancing protection of commerce, community confidence, and proportional criminal sanctions. The deterrence value of an appropriate sentence cannot be overstated. It is necessary to mention the wider phenomenon of street homelessness and begging within Birmingham’s city centre, which has seen unabated growth over recent years. Local authorities and law enforcement have struggled with increasingly complex interrelated issues of substance misuse, mental ill-health, and chronic economic hardship contributing to both offending behaviours and victim vulnerability. The court recognizes these systemic issues but reiterates that each defendant must be sentenced on their own facts and conduct. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. The sentencing guidelines issued under the Sentencing Act 2020 direct courts to categorise theft offences into levels of seriousness, taking into account harm and culpability. Your persistent theft over an extended period, refusal to desist following prior intervention, and targeted victimisation of vulnerable premises incline the court towards the higher bands within the guideline matrix, though temperate by the absence of aggravating factors such as violence or intimidation. Nonetheless, the cumulative financial loss to businesses is not insignificant. Finally, I note your expressed intention to seek assistance from the Birmingham Working Futures Employability Scheme post-sentence. While commendable, such aspirations require the foundation of lawful behaviour and engagement with court-imposed conditions. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. In conclusion, Mr H., the offences for which you have been convicted represent a clear breach of societal norms and legal standards. They have imposed financial and psychological burdens on victims and have consumed valuable public resources in investigation and prosecution. Your prior history and the pattern of defiance towards interventions reduce judicial leniency. Nevertheless, the court remains mindful of the personal and social difficulties you face and aims to balance rehabilitation with accountability. I therefore direct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be obtained from your supervising probation officer, incorporating updated clinical assessments where appropriate, and exploring the feasibility of structured community orders, cognitive-behavioural therapy modules, and financial management support as components of a rehabilitative package. The report should also evaluate the risk of reoffending and provide recommendations concerning electronic monitoring or curfew as necessary. Sentencing will be adjourned to a date to be fixed, pending the receipt of this report and any further representations from the parties. These sentencing remarks are given at Birmingham Crown Court on 23 September 2025, in Court 12. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to all relevant authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal against conviction or sentence within 28 days, pursuant to sections 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and 12 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this case. Costs are reserved.
