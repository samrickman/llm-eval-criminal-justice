MR H Case No. W2025/15430 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. P. FAIRBAIRN Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following a conviction for theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct occurred over an extended period across multiple retail establishments within the Windsor and Maidenhead areas. The offences represent a persistent pattern of dishonest behaviour targeting small to medium-sized businesses, characterised by a combination of deliberate planning and repeated disregard for the law. Procedural History Your initial arrest took place on 2 April 2025, consequent upon an investigation led by the Thames Valley Police in conjunction with the Windsor Safer Communities Partnership and the local Business Crime Reduction Scheme. This inquiry included the collation of CCTV footage from several independent retailers, the collation of witness statements from store staff, and forensic analysis of recovered goods and clothing items. The charges initially presented encompassed eleven counts of theft, subsequently consolidated into a single representative charge for efficiency and clarity. The Better Case Management process was invoked in this matter, facilitating early engagement between the parties and enabling timely disclosure of evidence. While the court recognises that the procedures adopted complied with statutory expectations and the Criminal Procedure Rules, it cannot go without remarking on the strain placed on the court system by cases of this nature—cases involving incremental yet persistent offending which cumulatively burden the administrative and human resources of the justice apparatus. The Economic Crime Unit provided advisory support to the prosecution, particularly in relation to the pattern analysis of the thefts and the identification of repeat offending methodologies. It is a recurring observation that shoplifting cases, especially those involving multiple sites over time, present unique challenges that distinguish them from singular, isolated incidents. The operational impact on retail staff, the costs to businesses—both direct and indirect—and the undermining of community confidence all compound to elevate the seriousness of what might superficially appear as minor criminality. While the justice system clearly must proportion responses according to culpability and harm, it must likewise send a message that chronic acquisitive offending is unbecoming and unacceptable. Your initial appearance was on 10 April 2025. At that hearing, you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequently, after a contested pre-trial review on 4 July 2025, during which further evidential material was furnished, you altered your plea to guilty on 6 August 2025. The timing of this plea, while welcomed, is relatively late in the proceedings and will accordingly be taken into account in mitigation assessment. It is well established in case law, including the pivotal judgment in R v. Tremaine [2023] EWCA Crim 1017, that credit for a guilty plea should reflect not only the admission but the timing and the extent to which it conserves public resources. Late pleas, particularly those tendered at or shortly before trial, typically attract reduced discount as they extend the anxiety period for victims and witnesses and strain judicial resources. I acknowledge the courtesy and efforts of Ms Lucinda Forester QC, who appears for the Crown, and Mr Joel Bainbridge, acting on your behalf under a Legal Aid representation order. Though engaged with commendable professionalism, I nonetheless must again express dissatisfaction with delays encountered in securing authorisation for expert reports from the Legal Aid Agency. Such delays, as noted in this matter, are regrettably all too common and detract from the timely progression of cases, thereby frustrating all parties involved. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. This case falls within the jurisdiction of the Crown Court by virtue of the seriousness and multiplicity of offences, mandating sentencing pursuant to the guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council. The offence is classified as theft by shoplifting, attracting an overarching sentencing framework which must take into account the extent of planning, repetition, aggravating and mitigating features, and the impact on victims and the community. It is worth briefly reflecting on the statutory origins of the offence charged. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive the owner of it. The provision has been amended periodically to address emerging modalities of dishonesty and associated harms; however, the core offence remains well understood in both statutory and common law contexts. Consideration should also be given to the local context in which this offending took place. The Windsor Business Crime Reduction Partnership has provided a comprehensive statement, which confirms that retail crime in the area has seen a steady upward trajectory over the past five years. Of particular note is the rising incidence of repeat shoplifting offences targeting certain categories of goods that hold resale value or are susceptible to diversion through informal channels. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. Staff within the relevant stores have reported levels of anxiety and stress attributable to your repeated presence and offending conduct. The retail trade maintains that such patterns of offending contribute to the closure of vulnerable outlets, the reduction of services in affected communities, and a decline in public confidence. These concerns, while sometimes dismissed in broader societal discourse as simply ‘business realities,’ represent tangible harm to those who provide frontline customer services day after day. The Local Authority’s Community Safety Unit has also lodged representations stressing the cumulative effect of acquisitive crime upon local regeneration efforts. There are ongoing initiatives intended to rejuvenate certain high street precincts, aimed at attracting new investment and fostering community cohesion. Persistent theft undermines these efforts, placing at risk both public funds and the goodwill of business proprietors. In R v. Perkins [2021] EWCA Crim 1750, the Court of Appeal provided guidance on sentencing principles applicable to repeated shoplifting offences, emphasising that while the immediate financial loss may be modest, the enduring effects on commercial viability, staff welfare, and community perceptions warrant enhanced consideration. The behavioural profile evident in this case aligns with those discussed in recent probation analyses concerning repeat acquisitive offenders. The phenomenon of “chronic petty offenders”—sometimes emboldened by economic pressures, social dislocation, or personal vulnerabilities—presents a complex challenge requiring both judicial firmness and rehabilitative vision. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. Turning to the forensic aspects, fingerprint and forensic photographic evidence recovered from your person and clothing was critical in linking you to multiple offence scenes. Additionally, analysis of electronic devices seized pursuant to warrant, while not directly implicating drug or violent offending, revealed patterns of movement and location consistent with the temporality of thefts. Digital footprints of this nature are increasingly relied upon to establish presence and intent, complementing traditional eyewitness and surveillance testimony. I do not overlook the plea hearing held on 6 August 2025, at which you entered guilty pleas to the charges laid. Such admission is appropriately credited under the guidance of R v. Hicks [2019] EWCA Crim 512, though, as previously stated, the timing curtails the extent of discount. The principles underlying plea credit are well established: they incentivise early admissions, reduce distress to victims and witnesses, and avoid unnecessary trials. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. The pre-sentence report, prepared by Ms Helena Craven of the Thames Valley Probation Service, provides an assessment of your personal circumstances, risk factors, and rehabilitative potential. While it acknowledges your expressed remorse, the report also notes a lack of meaningful engagement with voluntary support services and minimal recognition of the impact of your conduct on others. Ms Craven indicates that you have a history of unstable accommodation, periodic unemployment, and strained family relationships. There is mention of intermittent alcohol use, though no suggestion of dependency. The report emphasises the need for cognitive-behavioural interventions addressing impulsivity and decision-making, noting that access to such programmes may be limited by current service constraints. It is worth observing the difficulties faced by probation services nationally in meeting demand for structured offender programmes. Staff shortages and resource limitations frequently delay both assessment and delivery, impacting on the prospects for meaningful rehabilitation. Nonetheless, the service demonstrates commendable commitment in individual cases, often operating under considerable duress. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. On the subject of expert assessments, I refer to the psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr Miriam Swan, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose report is dated 14 August 2025. Dr Swan found no evidence of a major mental illness or significant cognitive impairment but highlighted traits consistent with impulsivity and episodes of low mood. The report emphasises that these characteristics, though not amounting to a psychiatric disorder, may contribute to difficulties in impulse control and risk appraisal. Dr Swan further notes your equivocal attitude towards addressing these issues, remarking on a “limited insight into the relationship between substance use and behavioural outcomes.” The psychiatric report recommends that any custodial sentence be complemented by access to psychological therapies and substance misuse services as appropriate. This court acknowledges the growing emphasis within the custodial estate on therapeutic interventions designed to mitigate factors underlying acquisitive offending. While treatment should never be seen as a substitute for accountability, it remains vital to maximising the prospects for rehabilitation and reducing reoffending. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. The Crown has provided victim personal statements from multiple retail employees. Their statements describe the tangible stress and lowered morale caused by ongoing theft, as well as increased workload and precautionary measures such as surveillance intensification, shelf locking, and staffing changes. One clerk expressed a sense of fear resulting from your repeated visits and a diminished sense of workplace safety. This testimony serves as a reminder that shoplifting, though classified as a property offence, can have profound personal effects on those who witness and endure it. It is a form of intrusion into the everyday lives of individuals, undermining their confidence and, in some cases, contributing to burnout and absenteeism. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. Turning to legal aid arrangements, I must note once again the procedural frustrations experienced in securing funding for expert evidence and reports. Applications were made as early as May 2025 but were subject to multiple refusals and requests for additional information, which prolonged the investigative phase and delayed case progression. While the defence undertook commendable efforts to navigate this bureaucracy, the wider systemic dysfunctions evidenced by frequent case delays require further attention and reform. The judiciary, government, and relevant agencies must collectively consider how to streamline funding processes so as to prevent such impediments to justice. This corollary holds particular urgency in cases engaging vulnerable defendants reliant upon expert assessments for fair trial preparation and sentencing. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. In considering sentence, this court must be guided by both the statutory framework and the Sentencing Council guidelines. Among the factors warranting close attention are the sustained nature of the offending, the impact on victims and community, the circumstances of the offender including age, previous convictions, and prospects for rehabilitation. This court is mindful of the public service challenges posed by acquisitive crime, including the increased burden on retail staff, the need for vigilant security measures, and the depletion of policing and investigative resources that might otherwise be deployed to matters posing greater risk of harm. The sentencing objectives of reduction in crime, reparation, punishment, and rehabilitation are not competing or exclusive but must be balanced in arriving at a just and effective outcome. The court recognises that your personal circumstances include periods of housing instability and underemployment, but these constitute context rather than excuse. Looking to pertinent authorities, the Court finds instructive the reasoning in R v. Weatherby [2022] EWCA Crim 1329, which held that multiple offences of shop theft across diverse locations can be aggregated within a single charge for sentencing purposes without diluting their cumulative impact. The appellate court cautioned against underestimating the wider harms attendant on repeat offending. Similarly, in R v. Merton [2020] EWCA Crim 878, the Court emphasised that custodial sentences remain appropriate where persistent theft evidences defiance of community standards despite prior interventions, particularly where rehabilitation efforts have been unsuccessful or absent. In this regard, the court has noted the absence of any sustained engagement with local support or rehabilitation services, alongside a recidivist pattern of offending, as aggravating features. Further, the court considers that the recent trend toward diversion and community disposal schemes, while laudable and beneficial in appropriate cases, cannot be permitted to shelter offenders who show no substantive progress or contrition. I must observe that the work of the Windsor Retail Support Network deserves acknowledgement. Their ongoing liaison with affected shops has been constructive and measured, avoiding sensationalism while persisting in raising awareness of the cumulative impact of theft on businesses and employees alike. Their role exemplifies the vital part played by voluntary and community groups striving to supplement statutory responses amid constrained public funding. Equally, thanks are due to the Thames Valley Counselling Service, which seeks to provide mental health support for those engaging with the justice system. Their outreach and psychosocial interventions contribute significantly to ameliorating some of the underlying causes of offending. Alas, their capacity is stretched thin. Lastly, may I recognise the efforts of the court ushers, clerks, and administrative staff who, under increasingly heavy caseloads, maintain order and decorum with patience and professionalism. Sentencing in this matter will proceed upon receipt of a detailed pre-sentence report from the probation service, whose comprehensive assessment will explore further your suitability for community-based rehabilitation options, cognitive skills programmes, and potential custodial requirements. I reserve final judgment pending that report, with particular focus on balancing proportional punishment with opportunities for constructive reform, consistent with the public interest in effective crime reduction.
