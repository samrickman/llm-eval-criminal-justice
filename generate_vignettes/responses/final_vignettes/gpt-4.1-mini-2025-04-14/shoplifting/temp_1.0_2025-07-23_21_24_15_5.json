Mr H Case No. K2025/16043 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. E. Ramsden QC Filed: 8 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced for an offence under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically in relation to shoplifting offences committed across multiple locations in the Greater Middleton area during the period from November 2023 to April 2025. This indictment represents a single count encompassing a course of conduct, reflecting the cumulative nature of the offending behaviour attributed to you. Procedural and Investigative Background Your apprehension followed an extensive investigation co-ordinated by the Middleton Business Crime Partnership, involving the Middleton Borough Police, local store security teams, and the Regional Business Crime Intelligence Unit. The investigation was notable for its multi-agency cooperation, with local officers tasked with discreet surveillance operations whilst analysts from the Regional Unit conducted detailed reviews of CCTV and electronic point-of-sale data. It is pertinent to acknowledge here the considerable administrative burden such investigations impose on law enforcement resources, particularly in light of increasing demand on police services dealing with both “serious and organised crime” and a parallel rise in acquisitive offences which, while comparatively lower in immediate threat, cumulatively degrade public confidence and strain community resilience. From a procedural standpoint, the case was initially charged on 17 April 2025 following your arrest two days prior. Representation was secured under the Legal Aid Scheme, with Mr Daniel Marks of counsel instructed to act on your behalf. Notwithstanding this, the matter experienced several adjournments, notably due to the late submission of expert psychiatric reports and delays within the Legal Aid Agency’s approval processes—a point which this court must express some disappointment over, given the importance of timely access to expert assessments for sentencing preparation. These delays are symptomatic of systemic pressures affecting legal aid provision nationwide, with attendant implications for timely justice. Your initial plea at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 13 July 2025 was one of not guilty; however, following the completion of the prosecution’s evidential disclosures—comprising detailed CCTV stills, witness statements from retail staff, and forensic analyses of recovered property—you entered a plea of guilty on 29 August 2025. The court takes into account that this plea was entered relatively late in proceedings. While the law encourages early acceptance of responsibility, it must also recognise that the right to a fair trial includes proper scrutiny of the evidential basis before admission of guilt is made. The principles elucidated in R v. Harrison [2019] EWCA Crim 2572 regarding credit for guilty pleas are therefore of particular relevance here. The investigation was assisted by the Middleton Safer Neighbourhoods Team, who compiled a community impact assessment detailing the effect of repeated shoplifting offences on local traders, including loss of stock, diminished staff morale, and increased security costs. These assessments were supplemented by correspondence received from the Middleton Retail Business Association, whose efforts to coordinate victim support and crime prevention initiatives merit commendation—especially in an era characterised by stretched voluntary sector resources and budgetary austerity. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. It is instructive to situate this offending within the broader legal context. The offence of theft as per section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 has an established legal framework predicated on the dishonesty of the appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. Where shoplifting involves a pattern of repeated or widespread offending, the courts have consistently held that this aggravates culpability beyond what a single isolated theft would entail. The sentencing guideline issued by the Sentencing Council for Theft Offences (effective January 2020) emphasises the importance of culpability factors such as planning, persistence, and sophistication, as well as harm factors that extend beyond mere monetary loss to encompass psychological impact on victims and communities. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. Parallel to the legal dimensions, this court has taken note of a detailed report prepared by Dr Helen Cooper, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, instructed pursuant to a defence application. Dr Cooper’s assessment, conducted over two sessions in July, included psychometric testing and a clinical interview, enabling a considered opinion on your mental health and suitability for community-based interventions. The report concluded that although no severe enduring mental illness was present, there are marked difficulties in impulse control, coupled with maladaptive coping strategies linked to chronic socioeconomic stressors. Dr Cooper identified moderate risk factors associated with reoffending, particularly where emotional distress and environmental triggers converge. The report further underscores that engagement with supportive services has been inconsistent. While this clinical perspective offers potential avenues for rehabilitation, it equally counselled caution concerning risk and the need for structured oversight. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. Turning to case law pertinent to sentencing, the court observes the recurrent references in appellate decisions concerning the interplay between repeated low-level acquisitive offending and public protection. In R v. Steel [2022] EWCA Crim 2112, the Court of Appeal reiterated that persistent shoplifting, particularly where it involves deliberate evasion of detection, order manipulation, or accomplice facilitation, warrants custodial sentences in the absence of mitigating features such as demonstrable remorse or rehabilitation prospects. Likewise, R v. Jenkins [2021] EWCA Crim 1909 emphasised that credit for a late guilty plea should be restricted if the defendant has failed to engage meaningfully with support services or ignored earlier diversionary options. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. This court also notes more tangentially the influence of R v. Millhouse [2017] EWCA Crim 400, where offending involving the theft of high-value electrical goods from a warehouse was considered. Although factually distinct, Millhouse introduced useful principles concerning proportionality and the significance of harm beyond financial value—including disruption to supply chains and the psychological impact on commercial employees. While those considerations cannot be mechanically applied to the present case, they serve as a reminder of the multifaceted nature of harm in theft offences. A further consideration surrounds the operational context of the Middleton Business Crime Partnership. Established in 2018 with the express intention of enhancing inter-agency collaboration, the Partnership includes representatives from the police, local authority, private security firms, and the Crown Prosecution Service. Its pioneering use of a shared intelligence database, coupled with routine liaison meetings, has delivered notable successes in reducing the incidence of retail crime—particularly in business parks and suburban shopping centres. However, even here the increased frequency of shoplifting offences has taxed staff capacity and created challenges in managing offender profiles and coordinating interventions. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. The court is compelled to remark upon the current state of public resources in relation to offender management and support services. Chronic underfunding within probation services has led to a backlog in assessment appointments and a reduction in the availability of tailored rehabilitation schemes. Similarly, mental health services report rising referral waiting lists, particularly in community liaison and substance misuse teams. These systemic pressures, while beyond the ambit of the court’s immediate influence, frame the backdrop against which offences such as your own must be considered. Notwithstanding this, the court’s mandate remains to balance rehabilitation opportunities with the protection of the public and deterrence. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. Consideration must also be given to the victim impact statements tendered herein. Staff from affected retail premises described feelings of anxiety and professional demoralisation as a consequence of your conduct, including unwarranted suspicion towards other customers and the imposition of increased security protocols that disrupted service. One statement from a long-serving store assistant highlighted the emotional toll of repeated encounters, noting a resultant deterioration in workplace wellbeing and, in one extreme case, a request for redeployment. While no physical harm occurred, the psychological and organisational consequences are real and deserving of judicial attention. This court is aware of ongoing scholarly debate regarding the effective response to low-level acquisitive crime. Studies from the Centre for Justice Innovation highlight the potential benefits of blending restorative approaches with cognitive behavioural therapies targeted at impulse control and decision-making enhancement. However, evidence of willingness to engage is often a pivotal factor in determining the suitability of community interventions. In your case, while initial engagement occurred, it waned over subsequent months. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Further relevant is the correspondence submitted from the Middleton Homelessness Prevention Service, relating to your housing status during the period in question. It appears that you have experienced intermittent periods of precarious tenancy, with episodes of temporary lodging in emergency accommodation. The pressures arising from housing instability no doubt compound social disadvantage and complicate rehabilitation prospects. Nevertheless, the court is mindful that these circumstances do not absolve personal responsibility or diminish the seriousness of offending. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. The court has also reviewed the pre-sentence report compiled by Mrs Fiona Saunders, Probation Officer, which provides a detailed risk assessment and personal history. It outlines previous episodes of theft-related offending, some of which were subject to community resolutions and conditional discharges. The report identifies limited engagement with employment or voluntary services and notes that you have declined established referral pathways to addiction support. The report recommends intensive supervision with a structured programme addressing cognitive skills, emotional regulation, and financial management, coupled with accommodation stabilisation support. In terms of the custodial threshold, the sentencing guideline makes clear that an immediate custodial sentence is justified where an offence involves significant planning and persistence, particularly if prior community measures have failed and where the offending has a sustained detrimental impact on victims and local communities. The absence of previous serious violent offending does not exclude the possibility of custody where public protection requires deterrence and denunciation. The court wishes to recognise, without endorsing any particular outcome, the commendable efforts of both the Middleton Retail Support Network and the Middleton Lifeline Project. These voluntary sector organisations operate under chronic financial constraints to provide practical assistance and advocacy for vulnerable individuals. Their representations underline the complex interplay between social marginalisation, poverty, and offending, advocating for rehabilitative approaches that balance empathy with accountability. In addition, it is appropriate to acknowledge the cooperation of counsel for both parties. Ms Nayla Khan, standing for the Crown, has presented submissions with professionalism and clarity, while Mr Daniel Marks has advanced appropriate mitigating points on your behalf. I thank both for their courteous interventions in what has otherwise been a relatively straightforward procedural progression. The present court environment has recently undergone refurbishment to enhance accessibility and security. These improvements reflect the judiciary’s commitment to maintaining an environment conducive to the fair and dignified administration of justice. Court staff, including ushers and clerks, have performed admirably in ensuring smooth operations amidst increased workload and pandemic-related constraints. It is regrettable that administrative delays, particularly concerning the Legal Aid Agency’s authorisation of funding for expert reports, have prolonged resolution of this matter. The agency is urged to consider process reforms to expedite such requests, thereby safeguarding defendants’ rights to timely expert assessments and reducing unnecessary adjournments. The court also takes this opportunity to note the increasing pressures upon policing capacity resulting from rising rates of acquisitive offences. While these constitute “lower priority” compared to violent crimes, the diversion of resources to investigate and prosecute persistent shoplifting erodes the capacity to respond to serious threats, an unintended consequence that is yet insufficiently acknowledged within resource allocation frameworks. Sentencing will reflect all of the foregoing considerations, balanced against the statutory purposes set out under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The court must address retribution, deterrence (personal and general), rehabilitation, and the protection of the public. At this stage, the court is unable to impose sentence pending the receipt of an updated pre-sentence report, taking into account your recent change in accommodation status and any steps taken toward engagement with rehabilitative support. I shall direct that the probation officer submit an addendum report within four weeks, addressing these matters, as well as any further observations relevant to risk management. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 8 September 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Middleton. The proceedings have been recorded pursuant to Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be lodged with the appropriate authorities. You are reminded of your right of appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply to these proceedings. Costs are reserved.
