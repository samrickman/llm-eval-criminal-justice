MR H Case No. NGT-2025-01942 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. P. WAINWRIGHT Filed: 18 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following a charge under section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968, relating to a representative offence of shoplifting. The indictment reflects a sustained course of conduct involving multiple incidents of theft from various retail premises situated within the jurisdiction of Northgate and its immediate environs over a period extending from the autumn of 2023 to early summer 2025. Procedural History Your initial appearance was recorded at the Northgate Magistrates’ Court on 9 August 2025, when you first entered a plea of not guilty. Following the direction of the Crown Prosecution Service, the case was committed to this court under the Better Case Management process on 30 September 2025, with a plea and trial preparation hearing scheduled. It is worth noting that your guilty plea was entered longitudinally—conceded on the morning of trial, after the full evidential case had been presented and the jury empanelled. This judicial forum has become all too accustomed to last-minute pleas in cases concerning acquisitive crime. While the law rightly preserves the right of every defendant to defend allegations, the court must weigh the impact of such timing on the administration of justice. It is well-established, notably in R v. Morley [2019] EWCA Crim 445, that credit for a plea of guilty can be significantly reduced when entered at a late stage, particularly where it delays the conclusion of proceedings and imposes additional burdens on victims, witnesses, and court resources. Your case was adjourned on two occasions, the first occasion linked to applications for funding by the defence to instruct a forensic psychiatrist with expertise in behavioural addictions and impulsive offending. The Legal Aid Agency’s response was notably protracted; official correspondence reflects a series of requests for clarification, additional paperwork, and protracted decision-making which, regrettably, extended through a six-week period. This delay did not serve the interests of justice; it added pressure to an already congested court list and prolonged uncertainty for all parties involved. It falls to the court to observe with no small measure of concern how persistent administrative inertia within public legal aid provision risks subverting the timely and equitable resolution of criminal cases. Counsel for the defence had, with appropriate professionalism and diligence, submitted all requisite documentation as promptly as possible. The recorded chronology highlights an unfortunate systemic dysfunction; the cause of which is of course beyond the jurisdiction of this court to redress, but for which I nonetheless record profound dissatisfaction. You were remanded on bail following your arrest on 15 June 2025. Conditions attached to your bail required residence at a specified address and reporting to your local police station twice weekly. Compliance with these terms was noted in the pre-sentence report as generally satisfactory, notwithstanding occasional failures to notify changes of contact details, which police attribute to your transient housing circumstances. The business community has had some involvement in this matter through the Northgate Retail Crime Partnership, a well-established multi-agency initiative designed to mitigate shop theft and related crimes. The partnership’s activities involve information-sharing, coordinated patrols, and victim support services. While the group’s capacity is understandably constrained by limited funding and manpower, it nonetheless furnished several victim impact statements which provide valuable insight into the practical effects of your offending on local retailers and staff. The court is conscious, however, that such schemes operate within significant systemic limits. Frontline officers consistently face the challenge of balancing demands from a wide array of calls for service, meaning that acquisitive offences often compete for attention with higher priority investigations, including violent crime or organised gang activity. This dynamic is echoed in the recent report by the National Policing Board (2023), which identified that acquisitive property crimes—even in their smaller and repetitive manifestations—consume substantial operational resources, with estimated costs extending beyond financial losses to include staff absence and deteriorating workplace morale. Instructed counsel appearing today, Ms. Fiona J. Willoughby for the Crown and Mr. Gareth T. Milligan for the defence, have provided their submissions with due regard to the statutory framework, guideline principles, and relevant case law. Their detailed advocacy is appreciated. It is appropriate at this juncture to remind the court of the statutory sentencing framework applicable to theft offences. The Theft Act 1968, at section 1, defines theft as dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with the intent to permanently deprive. Sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council (Definitive Guideline on Theft offences, 2021) identify key aggravating factors, including a history of similar offending, targeting of vulnerable victims, use of deception, and impact on staff vulnerability or community confidence. The case law further elucidates sentencing considerations where repetitive shoplifting with cumulative impact is concerned. As iterated in R v. Horton [2022] EWCA Crim 517, judges must balance the apparently modest value of items stolen with the broader harm caused, encompassing the fear engendered in shop staff, reputational damage to the affected business, and the cumulative burden on public enforcement services. On the topic of relevant comparative authority, I also consider instructive the judgment in R v. Clayton [2020] EWCA Crim 1719, which emphasised the importance of proportionality and individualised sentencing, cautioning against imprisonment for first or isolated low-value retail theft, but affirming immediate custody where offending forms part of a persistent pattern demonstrating clear disregard for previous warnings and rehabilitative opportunities. The court acknowledges the increasing deployment of advanced forensic techniques and digital investigative tools in establishing proofs of identity and chronology in omission-based offences. In this case, items retrieved and CCTV footage have been instrumental in corroborating the prosecution’s narrative, alongside electronic transaction records at various points of sale. Against this backdrop, the court now turns to the materials before it, including pre-sentence reports, psychiatric assessments, victim and agency correspondence, and of course, the statements put forward on your behalf. As a matter of process and fairness, the Social Services department prepared a safeguarding assessment following concerns voiced by a local homelessness prevention team. This report, dated 2 October 2025, carefully considers your personal circumstances, highlighting precarious housing status and history of substance misuse. It recommends continued engagement with supported accommodation services and community mental health provision. The interviewing social worker commented on your guarded but cooperative demeanour during discussions. Separately, the court received a letter from HelloBright, a local charity focused on assisting vulnerable adult offenders through education and skills training. The letter commends your recent attendance at a series of workshops and your expressed willingness to reconsider pathways towards employment. Such representations, while welcomed, do not mitigate the seriousness of the offending before the court, but serve as indicative of potential for positive change. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. I must note, dispassionately and with care, that the repeated nature of the incidents suggests a degree of planning and opportunism. The typology of stolen goods reflects an understanding of items with relatively high resale value and ease of concealment. This is not, in the court’s view, a simplistic lapse in judgment but rather a conscious and sustained engagement in criminal behaviour. Prior to your arrest, several local shop owners participated in the Business Crime Reduction Partnership intelligence meetings. Notes submitted in evidence describe a strategic sharing of data, enabling the identification of patterns of movement and modus operandi consistent with your conduct. This demonstrates a commendable level of cross-sector cooperation, albeit within limits imposed by resource constraints. It also bears mentioning that one co-defendant, charged in an allied indictment for conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary, was found to have supplied information regarding electronic security alarms at local premises. That defendant absconded following release on bail and remains at large, with active warrants issued by police. I emphasise that your case is to be considered independently, as there is no direct evidential link to whoever may have been involved in those separate offences. In R v. O’Donnell [2017] EWCA Crim 1968, the Court noted that associational offences such as conspiracy can often complicate matters of culpability and sentencing, but care must be taken to ensure sentences properly reflect the individual’s responsibility. The current defendant has no recorded association with the co-defendant’s activities and so such background, though provided for completeness, bears no direct relevance to your culpability. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. Somewhat tangentially, the court recalls a contemporaneous criminal trial held in the neighbouring borough concerning fly-tipping in a sensitive greenbelt area, arising out of an entirely separate matter. While not pertinent to the current proceedings, it serves as a reminder of the breadth of criminality that intersects with issues of community protection and environmental stewardship. The court hopes the principles laid down therein, including the importance of deterrence and reparation, are helpful in contextual understanding, though not determinative here. Returning to the present case, your history, as detailed in the probation service report dated 7 October 2025, discloses a series of convictions primarily for theft-related offences commencing in 2018. The report identifies five prior incidents of shoplifting, all resulting in community resolutions or conditional discharges, yet there appears to have been little sustained engagement with rehabilitative interventions. The psychiatric report, produced following instruction from this court and authored by Dr Neil Harding, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, offers valuable insight. The report, dated 11 October 2025, states that you exhibit no formal psychiatric diagnosis but describes traits of borderline personality organisation, manifested in impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and intermittent self-harm ideation. Dr Harding emphasises your expressed motivation by underlying financial distress, but notes that trauma-informed interventions have so far failed to engage you fully. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. The report stresses the need for ongoing multidisciplinary management and warns of elevated risk of recidivism absent meaningful intervention. Participation in accredited cognitive behavioural programmes targeting acquisitive offending, such as the Thinking Skills Programme or Addressing Substance-Related Offending, is recommended. It is important to consider, additionally, the strain placed on public health systems by the growing prevalence of complex emotional and behavioural disorders in offenders. NHS commissioning data from the Northgate and Eastern CCG notes waiting times for adult community mental health teams in excess of twelve weeks, placing significant pressure on mainstream access for those who lack the capacity or motivation to engage independently. The probation officer overseeing your case commented on the tension between individual readiness to change and institutional capacity. Such considerations are critical when tailoring appropriate intervention packages aimed at reducing reoffending risk. Within the context of sentencing, it is necessary to examine the wider social and economic factors at play. The national picture reflects continuing challenges with street homelessness, welfare adequacy, and employment precarity. As documented in the 2024 Annual Report of the Homelessness Monitor, there is an increasing incidence of rough sleeping concentrated in urban centres including Northgate. The interplay between insecure housing and low-level acquisitive crime is complex but must not be overstated to the point of excusing clear legal wrongs. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. Local authority housing teams have reported ongoing difficulties in accommodating vulnerable single adults, exacerbated by funding shortfalls and rising demand. Meanwhile, community organisations such as SafeStay Northgate provide vital emergency shelter but operate with finite resources. On the topic of victim impact, statements from individual shopkeepers convey the human cost beyond mere monetary loss. Several witnesses describe heightened anxiety, disrupted work patterns, and a pervasive sense of vulnerability within small retail outlets, some of which have introduced new security measures costing thousands of pounds to implement. The Retail Support Network submitted a detailed analysis ahead of today’s hearing. Their assessment notes that repeat shoplifting incidents increase staff turnover and sickness rates, compounding the operational challenges faced by small businesses — many of which linger on narrow margins. Furthermore, the psychological toll on frontline workers is not adequately recognised in public discourse, yet is palpable. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. There exists a danger in treating offending of this nature as “victimless crime.” It is not. It is a crime with tangible, often hidden casualties. The law and the court must acknowledge this reality solemnly. Certainly, the defendant’s letter to the court, submitted on 14 October 2025, expresses regret for the distress caused, and articulates a desire to address underlying difficulties. The letter was composed with a readable hand and is free from illegibility or undue incoherence; a matter on which the court is obliged to comment in fairness, given frequent cases to the contrary. Prior outreach by Your Local Offenders Support Team (YLOST) has included attempts to engage you in alcohol reduction services, debt advice, and housing stability programmes. Their correspondence highlights a mixed pattern of response marked by intermittent attendance and eventual disengagement. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. The courts remain aware of the critical role that multi-disciplinary partnerships play in preventing reoffending and enhancing public protection. Models such as the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) and the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) framework have been deployed to varying success in cases involving higher-risk offenders. While not directly engaged in your circumstance, the principles of coordinated intervention inform contemporary probation practice. Reference should also be made to R v. Templeman [2018] EWCA Crim 957, where the Court of Appeal underscored the imperative of sentencing consistency, warning against unwarranted disparity in similar offending profiles, while recognising individual mitigating factors. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The issue of credit for a late plea of guilty requires balanced consideration. Your admission, entered only upon the cusp of trial, necessarily attracts a reduced discount consistent with authorities such as R v. Dyer [2020] EWCA Crim 2018. Although it spares the need for a contested trial, it comes after the Crown has expended considerable effort in preparation, and the inconvenience to witnesses has been prolonged unnecessarily. Public confidence in the justice system depends, in part, on the timely and efficient resolution of cases. Last-minute pleas can erode this confidence and add to systemic pressures. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. Having considered all materials, including the personal circumstances of the defendant, expert opinion, victim impact, and sentencing precedents, I conclude that a custodial sentence is warranted. The repeated nature of the offending, the failure to respond to previous interventions, and the evident planning and persistence combine to elevate the culpability beyond the threshold for immediate custody. Nonetheless, I emphasise that sentencing must also reflect prospects for rehabilitation and reintegration. It is my intention to balance deterrence, punishment, and rehabilitation in arriving at a just outcome. Accordingly, I await a comprehensive pre-sentence report prior to passing sentence. The probation service is requested to explore suitable community rehabilitation options, including cognitive behavioural programmes, structured unpaid work, and financial management support. The report should also appraise the feasibility of a supervision model incorporating mental health liaison and housing support networks. I reserve final determination until such report has been received and considered. The court records its thanks to all who have contributed to the thorough and diligent preparation of this case, including the prosecution team led by Ms Fiona J. Willoughby, and to Mr Gareth T. Milligan for his robust and conscientious defence submissions. The hearing has been held in open court with full compliance to applicable protocol.
