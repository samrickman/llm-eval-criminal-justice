MR H Case No. M2025/13421 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. W. Ellington Filed: 12 September 2025 Mr H, you appear for sentencing on a charge of theft by shoplifting numerous items of low to moderate value, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans multiple occasions over a period extending from early 2023 through to May 2025, encompassing various retail premises within the boundaries of the Greater Manchester area and its suburbs. This court’s function today is to impose a sentence reflecting the seriousness of the offence, the impact on victims, the public interest, and all relevant mitigation. Procedural Background Your initial appearance before magistrates took place on 14 July 2025, where you indicated a not guilty plea, thereby necessitating committal to the Crown Court for trial or plea. The transfer was conducted under the auspices of the Better Case Management hearing procedures, which are designed to optimise case progression and secure early clarity on issues of fact and law. Although the Better Case Management (BCM) protocols have been in place for over a decade, their practical application remains subject to variable interpretation across jurisdictions. It bears noting that the aim of BCM is to reduce delays and duplication of effort whereby cases can be resolved promptly and justly. At a pre-trial review conducted on 29 July 2025, the parties confirmed the likely length of a contested trial and the anticipated number of witnesses. It was ordered that the matter be listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing, which duly occurred on 20 August 2025. At that hearing, your solicitors advised the court that you would now plead guilty, albeit at a late juncture, having contested the charge for a considerable period. Regrettably, this pattern of late pleas in acquisitive crime is not uncommon. In the experience of this court, such recalcitrance often derives from a mix of factors: a reluctance to confront reality, a misguided belief in the weakness of the prosecution case, or strategic calculation intended to maximise any potential discount in sentence. It is important to emphasise that the credit assigned for a guilty plea is not an automatic right, but a matter of judicial discretion determined by the timing and genuineness of the admission. Consequently, the mitigation afforded to you will be assessed in accordance with established case law. The Court is reminded of the judgment in R v. Tranter [2022] EWCA Crim 905, wherein the appellate court delineated the parameters for plea credit in theft cases. In that instance, Tranter was convicted of repeated thefts from large retail outlets involving a concerted strategy to conceal merchandise. He maintained his innocence until late and was ultimately awarded only 10% credit for his plea, reflecting the burden placed on witnesses and the justice system as a whole. That authority is instructive despite its differing factual matrix. Furthermore, R v. Bellingham [2024] EWCA Crim 1256 offers pertinent guidance on sentencing principles for repeat shoplifters where there has been a demonstrable disregard for prior interventions. Bellingham, who operated a sophisticated network to steal goods for resale, was sentenced to an immediate custodial term which the Court of Appeal upheld, citing the need for deterrence where patterns of offending evidenced calculated persistence. Though your offending does not mirror those complexities, the overarching themes of accountability and public protection merit consideration. It is also proper to mention the ruling in R v. Smythe [2021] EWCA Crim 430, concerning sentencing in instances involving minor property damage associated with thefts. Smythe was convicted of defacement of public transport property and was sentenced accordingly. That case serves as a useful reminder that ancillary behaviour may exacerbate the gravity of theft offences even if it does not involve direct violence. No such ancillary damage is alleged here, but the principle reminds us that offences rarely exist in neat isolation. The business of retail theft typically presents challenges beyond the individual case—its cumulative effect being disproportionately burdensome for both victims and the justice system. The residual economic loss, multiplied by the psychological toll on oftentimes vulnerable retail workers, warrants a measured response. Indeed, the psychological literature highlights how affected employees may experience heightened anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, or workplace deterrence after repeated victimisation. It has become increasingly evident to this court, and to law enforcement agencies tasked with response, that persistent shoplifting plays a multifaceted role in broader community disorder. Whether through the direct financial damage sustained by small independent retailers or the consequent curtailment of services, the ripple effect can be profound. This is elaborated further in the recent White Paper on Retail Crime, published in April 2025 by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, which recommends enhanced inter-agency cooperation to tackle repeat offenders. In this regard, the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) covering Greater Manchester undertook a comprehensive data review during the spring of 2025. Their findings underscored a worrying trend: a marked increase in the frequency of repeat retail theft offences, coinciding with reductions in frontline policing numbers amid national budgetary constraints. The BCRP report, attached to the prosecution’s supplementary files, suggests that while their network facilitates improved intelligence sharing, resource limitations often impede timely response. It is against this extensively mapped evidential and contextual backdrop that your conduct must be assessed and appropriate sentencing imposed. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. The investigative phase commenced following reports from a chain of pharmacy outlets suffering consistent product losses. The police operation involved liaison between the Greater Manchester Police’s Acquisitive Crime Unit and store security personnel. Early enquiries were hampered by the mobility of the suspect and the sporadic nature of the incidents. Nevertheless, a pattern of offending became apparent, including the use of camouflage techniques and opportunistic targeting during busy hours. During the police interview on 2 June 2025, which took place at Manchester Central Police Station under legal caution, you maintained an initial denial. However, forensic analysis of items found in your possession and matching CCTV recordings eventually led to corroboration of the Crown’s case. Your defence counsel advised that you would enter a guilty plea but reserved the right to argue mitigation at sentence. The health and welfare aspects pertaining to you have been thoroughly investigated. A psychiatric report prepared by Dr Marcus Thornton, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was commissioned on 24 August 2025 following a detailed clinical examination and collateral report from your general practitioner. Dr Thornton’s findings, set out in a 21-page document dated 9 September 2025, are comprehensive and cogently drafted. Dr Thornton concludes that you do not suffer from any major psychiatric disorder that might impair your criminal responsibility or diminish culpability. However, he identifies traits consistent with underlying impulsivity, moderate levels of alcohol misuse, and a history of depressive episodes, which may have contributed to your offending behaviour. The report importantly notes your history of engagement with community mental health services but highlights a lack of sustained attendance or therapeutic compliance. The clinical observations include references to your experiential narrative of socio-economic deprivation, periods of unemployment, and episodic homelessness. Whilst these factors contribute to your personal difficulties, Dr Thornton emphasises that your offending appears to be a complex interaction of choice and circumstance, rather than the outcome of a diagnosable pathological compulsion. It is noteworthy that this court received a letter from the Bolton Outreach Support Network, dated 5 September 2025, which details their attempts to engage you in rehabilitation services relating to alcohol misuse and financial management. The letter expresses disappointment regarding your sporadic attendance and apparent reluctance to accept sustained help. This is regrettable given the availability of resources intended to reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. The Probation Service provided a full Pre-Sentence Report dated 10 September 2025, compiled after extensive interviews and assessment of your background. The report sheds light on your social circumstances, noting an unstable accommodation history, limited family contact, and several periods of benefit interruptions. Your previous convictions include four for theft and two for public order offences dating back over a decade. Of particular concern is the report’s identification of a low threshold for reoffending coupled with a reluctance to engage with structured interventions. Of interest to the court are the broader systemic pressures noted within the probation narrative. It acknowledges staff shortages, increased caseloads, and restrictions on resources which, in this jurisdiction, have occasioned delays in both supervision and community programme availability. This is hardly peculiar to Manchester; similar constraints have been consistent themes in reports across the north west region for several years. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. This court commends the diligence of probation officers who continue to manage growing demands despite such encumbrances. In particular, the efforts of your assigned officer, Ms Olivia Dewar, warrant mention. Her detailed account underscores both your challenges and the systemic obstacles to effective rehabilitation in a system beset by underfunding. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. The issue of housing is ever-present in the context of acquisitive offending. The precarious nature of your living arrangements has been documented in correspondence from Your Manchester Homes Limited, dated 12 August 2025, confirming the issuance of several notices for breaches of tenancy terms related to noise complaints and unauthorised occupants. This adds to the complexity of your case but is not without precedent in similar circumstances encountered by this court. The strain on social housing providers in Greater Manchester is well documented, resulting in extended waits and frequent moves for vulnerable tenants. Coupled with the nationwide shortage of supported accommodation, this dynamic fosters environments that may contribute indirectly to criminal behaviour. Nonetheless, neither the judiciary nor the community services system can afford to conflate causation with justification. While context may inform sentencing, culpability remains firmly with the individual for their actions. It is recalled that you were previously the subject of a community resolution for shoplifting in 2021, which involved a restorative justice conference mediated by victims’ liaison officers. Such interventions are widely recognised as effective tools in the justice arsenal, promoting offender accountability and victim empowerment. They may, at times, forestall more draconian sanctions when followed by demonstrable behavioural change. Alas, your recommitment to similar conduct dilutes the intended efficacy of such measures. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. The written submissions received from the Associated Retailers Support Group (dated 31 August 2025) provide compelling evidence of the impact persistent theft has on small business operators. They poignantly recount operational disruptions, additional security expenses, and morale declines among staff who frequently feel vulnerable while attempting to perform routine tasks. These testimonies are not clichés but earnest accounts warranting due weight. Similarly, the Manchester Saucer Street Pharmacy provided a victim impact statement describing the emotional distress caused to employees, one of whom reportedly required time off work due to anxiety. These consequences illustrate the often-overlooked human cost inherent in such offences, despite the temptation to discount them as mere financial abstractions. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. The prosecution’s case is not without some recognition of your cooperation post-plea. The Crown’s counsel, Ms Laura Redmond, has formally acknowledged your acceptance of guilt, though with dissatisfaction at the timing of your admission, which occurred shortly before what would have been the trial date, imposing avoidable costs and strain on victim witnesses. The defence, represented by Mr Simon Edge, undertakes to argue for a community-based sanction incorporating rehabilitative elements that address underlying behavioural factors and seek to mitigate the risk of further offending. He highlights your efforts to attend voluntary alcohol counselling sessions, albeit intermittently, and points to the absence of any violence or threats in your conduct. These are noted, but they do not obviate the seriousness of persistent dishonesty. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Judges are often confronted with the difficult balancing act of upholding the principles of punishment and deterrence while recognising and encouraging genuine attempts at reform. The Courts of Appeal have previously underscored this tension, notably in R v. Weller [2020] EWCA Crim 389, where the sentencing judge’s imposition of a community order rather than custody was upheld for a low-value theft offender demonstrating commitment to change. Conversely, in R v. Dowling [2023] EWCA Crim 749, the Court emphasised that where prior opportunities for diversion have been spurned, and offending has persisted, more immediate and custodial sanctions are warranted. The degradation of public confidence in retail security and the demoralisation of shop staff is no trivial matter. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. This court also notes with caution that the complexities of shoplifting extend beyond individual pathology into the broader criminogenic environment. The normalisation of opportunistic acquisitive crime, fuelled in some quarters by economic insecurity, glamourisation on social media, and peer influence, remains an ongoing challenge for social policy and law enforcement alike. However, these considerations, while informative for policymakers and practitioners, cannot diminish the legal and moral responsibility borne by offenders. In sentencing, the court must have regard to the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline, updated in 2022, which identifies harm, culpability, and offender characteristics as bases for categorisation into different sentencing brackets. The categorical framework assists this judge in placing the present case within the appropriate context, recognising both aggravating and mitigating elements. Your history of repeated shoplifting and related dishonesty indisputably elevates the culpability score. However, absence of violence, lack of organised criminality, and your personal circumstances introduce some mitigatory weight. Importantly, your late guilty plea will attract a marginal reduction in sentence, consistent with established principle, although markedly reduced by its timing. This court cannot ignore that the cumulative public resource cost of persistence in offending in this nature is substantial. Police investigatory focus, protracted criminal proceedings, and victim support mechanisms compound the intangible cost to community well-being. The escalation of such offences, if unchecked, threatens to undermine trust in lawful governance and communal safety. Additional procedural observations merit recording. This courtroom was recently refurbished to enhance accessibility and acoustic quality, an investment welcomed by practitioners and observers alike. While the physical environment of justice is ever important, it is but a vessel for the equitable administration of law, contingent upon the diligence and fairness exercised within. The court registrar, Ms Fiona Campbell, has conducted her customary role with professionalism in the face of ongoing administrative pressures and staff shortages felt across the Crown Court estate. Such dedication is indispensable to the operation of justice. The hearing today has benefited from the exemplary conduct of counsel on both sides. Mr Edge’s submissions, while predictable in tone, were presented with clarity and due regard to procedural propriety. Ms Redmond ably represented the Crown’s position with an appropriate balance of firmness and professional courtesy. As to Legal Aid arrangements, this case experienced initial delays due to protracted applications for funding approval to instruct expert psychiatric evidence. Such difficulties persist nationwide, hindering defence preparation and, by extension, the expedient progress of justice. The system is in urgent need of reform to reduce administrative blockages and promote equitable access. Finally, there is no indication of connections to organised criminality or offences involving controlled substances or violence, factors that can exacerbate culpability and public risk considerably. Nonetheless, the court is mindful that shoplifting remains a gateway offence, and absent intervention, the trajectory may worsen. Disclaimers may not make the process swift, but fairness is paramount. The court’s ultimate aim is a sentence that serves the public interest, facilitates rehabilitation where possible, and affirms the rule of law. Having considered all the material before me and heard submissions from counsel, I am now prepared to proceed to sentence. I have requested a pre-sentence report to inform the specific nature and appropriateness of available sentencing options including custodial and community-based provisions. This report will also address your risk of reoffending, potential for engagement with rehabilitative programmes, and any outstanding welfare needs. The sentencing hearing will be reconvened on 22 October 2025, by which date I expect full reports and any further representations to have been lodged and considered. Until then, bail conditions will remain as presently ordered. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are hereby informed of your right to appeal the sentence imposed within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged unless otherwise ordered. Costs are reserved.
