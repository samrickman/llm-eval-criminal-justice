MR H Case No. H2025/13457 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. J. KENDRICK Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing following your conviction on a representative charge of theft, arising from multiple incidents of shoplifting committed over an extended period in the Haverfordwest and Milford Haven areas. The offences, though relatively low in monetary value individually, collectively constitute a serious breach of trust and a persistent disregard for lawful conduct, demanding careful judicial consideration. Procedural and Investigative Context Your arrest on 17 May 2025 was preceded by a multi-layered investigation involving cooperative efforts between Haverfordwest Police, South Pembrokeshire Community Safety Unit, and retail security personnel representing various merchants. What initially began as discrete reports of suspicious activity at separate stores was woven together into a composite pattern of offending only through painstaking collation of CCTV footage, witness interviews, and loss prevention records. It is a familiar tale: the gradual piecing together of multiple low-level incidents to construct an evidentially coherent narrative. The administrative undertakings in such cases are far from trivial. Investigators recount extensive hours spent re-examining grainy security tapes, often recorded in low light or from obstructed vantage points. The practical limitations of most modern surveillance technology are well documented: timestamps frequently lack precise calibration; camera angles can omit essential details; and individuals may be partially obscured or masked by the casual accessories of daily urban life. That said, it must be acknowledged that without these visual records, the prosecution could scarcely have been sustained. In line with procedures advanced through the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, your case was flagged for early listing and progression. The BCM protocol seeks to alleviate systemic delays, mandating early identification of issues pertinent to evidence, disclosure, and plea planning. In this instance, custody time limits and procedural timetables were closely observed, avoiding the now regrettably common pattern of adjournments due to late disclosure or expert report availability. It is unfortunate—but increasingly routine—that defendants in cases involving repeated petty theft frequently delay admission of guilt until late in the proceedings. Such strategy imposes an avoidable burden on victims, witnesses, practitioners, and judicial resources alike. The courts must balance the right to defend with the collective public interest in timely resolution. Against this backdrop, I extend my thanks to Ms Ffion Maitland, prosecuting counsel, and to Mr Ewan Lambert, who appears on your behalf. Both demonstrated professional diligence in navigating the procedural complexities inherent in the case, notwithstanding some operational challenges presented by resourcing constraints within the Legal Aid system. I must echo, with growing concern, observations already recorded by trials courts nationally regarding delays and administrative opacity arising from Legal Aid Agency authorisations, particularly in cases requiring expert assessments or multi-agency engagement. Such procedural encumbrances risk undermining the principle of access to justice. In the present matter, repeated inquiries were necessary to secure funding approval for forensic analysis of electronic evidence, extending preparation timelines without any apparent benefit to the parties involved. In this jurisdiction, shoplifting cases bring into sharp focus the tensions between limited corrective resources, the need for deterrence, and public confidence in the criminal justice system. As Illustrated in R v. Dunning [2020] EWCA Crim 1501, the Court recognised that offences which erode retail security and staff wellbeing, although involving low-value goods, cumulatively warrant significant judicial scrutiny. The guidance emphasises individual culpability, repeated offending, and the effect on business operation, all factors pertinent here. Other case law offers illuminating contrasts. R v. Chamberlain [2018] EWCA Crim 994 concerned a complex insurance fraud scheme involving multiple jurisdictions, but the Court underscored the broader principle that persistent, unrepentant offending with clear planning attracts enhanced sentencing. While the factual matrices differ, the principle of proportionality remains guiding. Similarly, R v. Eldridge [2019] EWCA Crim 1800 involved aggravated burglary with personal threat to occupiers. Although clearly more serious in degree, the case elucidates sentencing yardsticks distinguishing misdemeanours and felonies, illustrating the spectrum of judicial response to acquisitive crime. These judicial commentaries, while not necessarily analogous, provide context for the work of this court in calibrating response. It is also worth noting the establishment of the Haverfordwest Crown Court complex in 2007, with its modernised facilities designed to support efficient case management; such infrastructure reflects longstanding efforts to enable proportionate justice. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. Historical observations remind us that low-value shoplifting offences have long been treated with ambivalence within the criminal justice system. The Theft Act 1968, which remains foundational, introduced statutory definition with intention to harmonise previous common law principles. Amendments introduced in the Theft (Amendment) Act 1978 sought to address escalation and repeat offending, recognising the aggregate harm caused. Another allegedly instructive precedent is R v. Davis [2017] EWCA Crim 2102, where a defendant convicted of fly-tipping in a greenbelt conservation area incurred a custodial sentence. The environmental damage, while not immediate, demonstrated broader societal impact. The comparison is not direct, but serves to remind us that public protection extends beyond face value to encompass communal wellbeing. Returning to the facts before this court, I observe that the offences were not isolated lapses but form part of an identifiable and, regrettably, predictable framework of conduct. Your pattern of movement across retail locations — often coinciding with peak staff transitions — suggests deliberation. Your choice of investigated items reveals familiarity with retail processes and weaknesses, further evidencing calculated behaviour. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. Notwithstanding prior warnings, including community resolution referrals in 2023, you nonetheless resumed offending within a matter of months. This pattern is emblematic of a broader trend noted by crime analysts, highlighting recidivism in acquisitive crime and the challenges for intervention. It is important to acknowledge the commentary of the Probation Service regarding your case. Ms Laura Harding, your allocated officer, produced a detailed pre-sentence report, commended for its thoroughness, albeit with limitations pertinent to your engagement with support services. The report references fractured family relationships, sporadic employment, and episodes of transient accommodation, reflecting some degree of socio-economic instability. However, the report also notes your unwillingness to consistently participate in rehabilitative programmes. This non-engagement is troubling and speaks to risk factors for continued offending. The court is mindful of the constraints under which probation services operate, particularly staffing shortages exacerbated by recent recruitment challenges and increased caseloads. Specialist teams tasked with managing prolific offenders report difficulties in balancing demands, interpolated with emergent cases of serious violent crime. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. Turning to psychiatric assessments, I gratefully acknowledge the contribution of Dr Andrew Price, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose evaluation was solicited following concerns raised during preliminary hearings. Dr Price's report, submitted on 20 August 2025, concluded that you do not suffer from a major mental disorder, but that features indicative of mild, chronic anxiety and low impulse control were present — consistent with an adjustment disorder. Dr Price observed that while these traits might exacerbate vulnerability to stressors, they do not amount to diminished responsibility. Accordingly, therapeutic intervention might assist, but the primary mode of accountability remains judicial. In this context, he recommended consideration of structured psychological support, ideally integrated with probation supervision. This court notes also the wider problems confronting mental health services, with persistent shortages leading to increased NHS waiting times for community mental health care. The fragmentation of care pathways aggravates access difficulties for vulnerable individuals, often compounding recidivism risk. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. Correspondence heard upon the court file includes letters from a local charity, Pembrokeshire Outreach Network, led by Ms Eleri Morgan, whose submission praises your limited engagement with their harm reduction programmes but expresses concern about the absence of sustained commitment. Their outreach work, while invaluable, has seen increased demand and diminishing funding in recent years. Consideration should also be given to remarks provided by the store managers of three affected premises. These documents highlight not only financial loss but also emotional stress experienced by staff, some of whom requested altered work patterns due to anxiety over repeat incidents. The court further notes the ongoing contributions of the Business Crime Reduction Unit, which has sought to implement coordinated responses including awareness sessions, improved staff training, and anonymous reporting mechanisms. These efforts reflect a community-wide commitment to deterring retail crime. Curiously, it is noted in the police report that during the period of investigation, unrelated disturbances occurred in Courtroom 5, including an incident necessitating intervention by fire services due to an arson attempt involving courtroom materials. While entirely unconnected to your case, such events underscore the challenges of maintaining order within judicial precincts. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. I pause to remind all parties of the statutory framework governing sentences for theft. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guide on theft offences (published in 2021 and applicable here) delineates culpability bands, offending patterns, and aggravating factors such as vulnerability of victims, use of concealment tactics, and prior convictions. Your antecedents include multiple previous convictions primarily relating to similar offences, including a conditional discharge imposed in 2023 following a cautionary intervention. While such disposals are designed to forestall further offending, your subsequent conduct demonstrates the limits of such non-custodial measures in your case. Additionally, the recent decision of R v. McAllister [2024] EWCA Crim 1103 reinforces that repeated opportunistic theft, even where low in individual value, should not be treated as trifling in aggregate. There, an immediate custodial sentence was upheld for a pattern of thefts targeting small independent retailers, with particular emphasis on deterring reoffending. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. The Crown have invited the court to consider the wider implications of such offending patterns, especially in light of economic pressures faced by smaller enterprises post-pandemic, and the cumulative effect on employment, community safety, and civic confidence. In considering sentencing options, I am mindful of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and the Sentencing Act 2020—each imposing duties to balance punishment, rehabilitation, and public protection. You fall into a category where community sentences may be appropriate, provided that compliance can be reasonably assured. Nonetheless, the persistent nature of your offending militates against leniency absent demonstrable change. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. Reference has been made to ancillary considerations, such as the role of informal support networks. Notably, a letter from your sister, Ms Katrina H., submitted in support, speaks to a complex domestic history, including periods of estrangement and intermittent financial assistance. While family support is a relevant mitigation factor, in your case it appears to have been inconsistent. Similarly, data drawn from the municipal housing authority indicates a history of overcrowded accommodation, with care leaver status noted—a factor often associated with elevated vulnerability to substance misuse and offending. There is, however, no indication of substance dependency in this matter, an observation corroborated by toxicology screening at arrest. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. I must acknowledge the pressures upon police resources generally. Crime figures for Pembrokeshire reveal a rise in calls relating to non-serious offences, stretching response capacities and complicating prioritisation. Officers tasked with investigating your case reported numerous other concurrent investigations, including large-scale seizures of narcotics and violent crime inquiries, which absorbed disproportionate time and attention. Elsewhere, colleagues in the Fraud Investigation Unit conveyed ongoing efforts to tackle financial crimes involving complex identity theft rings—a type of offending distinct from your own but illustrative of the diverse challenges faced by law enforcement. Within the judiciary, there is increasing recognition of the need for multi-agency collaboration—For example, the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) has provided a useful platform in cases of domestic abuse. While not applicable here, the framework serves as a model of inter-agency cooperation. The staff of Haverfordwest Crown Court, including ushers and clerks, have performed admirably throughout this case. Their commitment to orderly process underlines the professionalism that undergirds the administration of justice, even when confronted with routine and repetitive case types. At the sentencing hearing today, the court has heard submissions from both counsel. The defence contends that your recent housing instability, absence of stable employment, and mental health traits call for a community sentence with robust rehabilitative oversight. The Crown, while acknowledging these factors, emphasises the need to reflect the cumulative impact of your offending and to deter continuation. The defendant’s letter to the court was thoughtfully composed and expresses remorse, though it must be read in the context of your pattern of behaviour and the timing of guilty plea, which occurred only at the point when conviction was inevitable. In exercise of the sentencing discretion vested by statute and court guidance, I must weigh these complex factors with care. It remains the court’s duty to impose a penalty sufficient to reflect the gravity of the course of conduct, to promote deterrence, to encourage rehabilitation, and to protect the public. I will therefore adjourn sentencing to enable receipt of an updated pre-sentence report, with particular emphasis placed on risk assessment, the viability of community orders incorporating cognitive-behavioural interventions, and any potential for accommodation-based support. These remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Haverfordwest. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right of appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.
