MR H Case No. H2025/13456 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. M. KENDRICK Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before the court today for sentence following your conviction on a charge of theft, specifically shoplifting, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, of which you have been found liable, spanned a duration encompassing the latter months of 2023 through to early summer 2025. The geographical spread of the offending centres upon retail premises situated within the environs of Hull city centre and adjoining districts, with incidents documented in commercial zones that include high footfall shopping areas and local convenience outlets. Procedural History Your case has moved through the criminal justice system following an arrest effected by officers from the East Yorkshire Police on 15 June 2025. This was predicated on an investigation commenced in response to a series of reported thefts over several months from multiple retail businesses, a situation that initially gave rise to separate reports later aggregated under a single investigative umbrella. The court notes that the case was initially lodged before the magistrates’ court but was committed to Crown Court on grounds of the aggregate volume and nature of the offending, consistent with established practice in matters involving sustained courses of dishonesty. The prosecution's decision to proceed by way of indictment was in keeping with proportionality principles and reinforced by the repeated pattern and degree of planning indicated by the evidence. Before proceeding to the substantive facts, it is apposite to record the court’s regret at the administrative delays that have attended this matter. These included an adjournment imposed owing to protracted negotiations with the Legal Aid Agency concerning authorisation of specialist psychological assessment funding, as well as an earlier deferment occasioned by the unavailability of key witnesses associated with business premises affected by the offence. Understandably, such delays create compounded stress for all parties involved. The court acknowledges the patience exhibited but reiterates the importance of systemic improvements to mitigate similar occurrences in future cases. The victim impact statements, tendered by proprietors and staff from various shops, were compelling. They illuminate a broader canvas of harm extending beyond pure financial loss, notably emphasizing the deleterious effects on staff wellbeing, morale, and impacted routines. The statements evoke a sense of growing vulnerability among frontline workers tasked with both customer service and loss prevention. It is customary, in matters of this nature, to reflect on the wider socio-economic environment that forms the backdrop to such offences. Like many urban centres across the country, Hull is grappling with pressures associated with retail shrinkage, rising rates of social deprivation, and the attendant strain on public services intended to ameliorate such conditions. These factors provide context, but they do not explain or excuse illegal conduct. It is well established by the authorities that persistent acquisitive offending consumes a disproportionate share of limited public resources. The extended attention demanded for investigations — including the collation and analysis of CCTV material, in-store liaison, and inter-agency exchanges — detracts from efforts devoted to combating more violent or organised crime. While the perceived \"low harm\" nature of shoplifting may engender some public complacency, this court rejects any suggestion that such offences are trivial or victimless. Perhaps it is salutary to observe that the Crown Prosecution Service, in conjunction with local policing units, has sought to coordinate responses through the East Riding Business Crime Partnership—a coalition formed to reinforce intelligence sharing between retailers and enforcement officers. The effectiveness of this strategy rests not merely on operational mechanics but on sustained engagement and resource allocation, which face significant challenges amid broader austerity measures and competing priorities. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. Turning to procedural details, you initially entered a not guilty plea at the first hearing on 29 June 2025. However, in light of further evidentiary disclosures including enhanced surveillance footage and corroborative witness statements, your defence team altered course and entered a guilty plea on 4 September 2025, just weeks prior to the trial listed date. The court is compelled to address the timing of your plea. As has been stressed in numerous appellate authorities, the extent of discount attributable to a guilty plea is intrinsically linked to the timing and nature of that plea. Pleas tendered at the earliest opportunities warrant the most substantial reduction in sentence, fulfilling dual aims of showing remorse and conserving court and prosecutorial resources. Pleas entered at a late stage, while obviously preferable to contested trials, attract lesser credit. Authorities such as R v. Hamilton [2019] EWCA Crim 2007 and R v. Chen [2020] EWCA Crim 1126 provide detailed precedent for this principle. In Hamilton, the Court of Appeal remarked that a late plea offered within days of trial commencement, after exhaustive disclosure, merited a reduced discount given the additional burdens imposed on witnesses and the tribunal. It bears noting that the facts of Hamilton—centred on fraud—differ from the present factual matrix but the legal principles regarding guilty plea and credit apply regardless of offence type. The court was assisted by psychological assessments carried out at your request. Psychiatrist Dr. Samuel Eastwood provided a detailed report dated 9 August 2025. Dr. Eastwood concludes that you do not manifest any diagnosable major mental illness but exhibits personality features consistent with impulsivity and low self-regulation. Importantly, the report notes some evidence of mild alcohol misuse and maladaptive coping mechanisms in response to socioeconomic stressors. The report is meticulous and professionally composed, offering cogent analysis yet ultimately cautious in extending mitigation based on mental health concerns. It explicitly discounts any notion of diminished responsibility or significant cognitive impairment. While the report acknowledges your candidness during assessment sessions, it emphasises that your underlying difficulties do not justify or entirely explain your offending behaviour. It is, in this context, worth recalling the sentencing remarks in R v. Matthews [2023] EWCA Crim 840, where a defendant with similar clinical features received a custodial term due to the combination of persistence and public impact. Matthews prefigures the approach to be adopted here—treatment needs are undoubtedly relevant, but public protection and deterrence are paramount. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. An intriguing but tangential note arises from another matter referred to in the correspondence from the Legal Aid Agency, concerning funding disputes in cases involving defendants with co-occurring substance misuse and acquisitive offending. While such issues have no direct bearing on your own case, their mention serves to underline wider systemic difficulties faced by practitioners and agencies alike. The court must also record the professional diligence of Ms. Chloe Drew, probation officer, who submitted a pre-sentence report on 14 September 2025. Her report offers a comprehensive overview of your background, including educational history, prior convictions, family circumstances, and social supports—or lack thereof. It is evident that you have experienced periods of unstable accommodation and employment, factors that are by now sadly all too common among those appearing here today. Within that report, Ms. Drew emphasises your historical association with charitable organisations focused on homelessness prevention and addiction support. Unfortunately, such contacts appear sporadic, with limited evidence of sustained engagement. The probation service, constrained by staffing shortages and operational pressures, nonetheless endeavours to coordinate with these providers to furnish a holistic package of post-sentencing interventions, should a non-custodial order be contemplated. I must observe, with some frustration, that such shortages within the probation workforce, particularly in this region, have been a feature of recent judicial commentary. Caseloads often exceed recommended thresholds, limiting capacity for robust supervision or rehabilitative engagement. Additionally, constraints within local NHS mental health services compound difficulties in obtaining timely dual diagnosis assessments or psychosocial interventions. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. It is useful to recall the historical context of the Theft Act 1968. When first enacted, the statute sought to codify a wide range of theft-related offences into a single legislative framework. Amendments over ensuing decades, including those effectuated by the Theft (Amendment) Act 1996 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, have reflected evolving understandings of crime and societal attitudes towards property offences. Though shoplifting remains one of the most frequently prosecuted property offences in England and Wales, the courts have consistently reminded practitioners that sentencing should be proportionate and nuanced, reflecting both offence seriousness and offender circumstances. The Sentencing Council Theft Guideline, last revised in 2020, directs the approach to penalties in cases such as yours. It lays particular stress on the value and nature of goods stolen, the sophistication and planning involved, previous convictions, and the impact on victims. Though individual items stolen may be of modest value, the aggregate effect of repeated offences and the resulting cumulative loss is rightly regarded as an aggravating consideration. While your offending does not fall within the legislative category of aggravated theft involving violence or threats, the repeated nature of your offences, and their effect on small business operators struggling amidst the current economic climate, cannot be dismissed lightly. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. It is worth noting that the case was managed under the Better Case Management (BCM) pilot schemes in this jurisdiction. BCM, as non-specialist practitioners are aware, is a procedural initiative designed to accelerate case progression and prevent protracted adjournments. It emphasizes clear disclosures, timely exchanges of evidence, and early resolution where possible. While your matter experienced some deviations from indicative timetables—chiefly stemming from Legal Aid delays and the aforementioned witness availability challenges—overall the process adhered satisfactorily to expected standards. I should also acknowledge the contribution of defense counsel, Mr. James Collery, and prosecution counsel, Ms. Laura Simmons, both of whom impressed the court with their thorough preparation and professionalism throughout the hearings. The court would be remiss not to mention that this courtroom recently underwent a refurbishment, during which state-of-the-art digital evidence presentation hardware was installed. Enhanced technology facilitates clearer examination of CCTV footage and photographic exhibits in cases such as this, though inevitably it demands a learning curve for staff and familiarization by all participants. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. While the personal circumstances of defendants may often serve to explain offending behaviour without excusing it, the court must maintain an unwavering focus on safeguarding the community and preserving public confidence in the administration of justice. Lest it be thought this court lacks appreciation of the social context, it is acknowledged that economic instability, escalating household costs, and an ongoing shortage of affordable housing contribute significantly to pressures on vulnerable populations. One cannot ignore the recent expansions in the claimant pool for various state benefits, nor the widespread public cynicism towards institutions perceived as distant or indifferent. Such sentiment, documented in a 2024 report commissioned by the National Institute for Justice, reflects a growing disconnect that challenges the traditional social contract. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. As a comparative observation, one may take note of R v. O’Sullivan [2020] EWCA Crim 1254, wherein the defendant’s repeated fly-tipping on protected green belt land occasioned a sentence involving community order with unpaid work. The case’s more environmentally oriented nature belie its relevance to our shared principle: repeated, calculated wrongdoing that impinges on community wellbeing commands definite punitive and rehabilitative responses. Furthermore, the plea reduction regime examined in R v. Wynter [2021] EWCA Crim 1856 signals clearly the importance placed on not merely the act of pleading guilty but the timing and motivation underlying such pleas. Late pleas, while beneficial in procedural terms, must be carefully scrutinised to discount tactical considerations designed to obfuscate proceedings or to mitigate sentence artificially. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. The impact on victims extends beyond financial loss, as confirmed by statements from local shop managers and employees. Concerns about repeat offending have contributed to altered working patterns, increased security measures, and in some cases recruitment freezes, all of which press adversely on business operations—particularly smaller, independent proprietors struggling to survive in the current retail climate. The Retail Support Network, a voluntary organisation devoted to assisting businesses affected by theft and antisocial behaviour, has provided helpful input to the court. Their detailed correspondence highlights an increase in shoplifting incidents during the pandemic period, with ongoing concerns about the long-term psychological toll on staff at front line checkouts. Their evidence helped frame the court’s understanding of the wider impact of theft offences such as those committed by the defendant before us today. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. It is noteworthy to observe, albeit not germane to your conduct, that a co-defendant in a related but distinct matter was remanded on charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a case completely independent of your offending and assuredly not involving any element of your participation. Such matters, though sometimes mistakenly conflated in public discourse, bear no relevance on the adjudication of your own case. Once again, I must express my concern that delays within the Legal Aid framework have impeded the timely progression of this matter, a matter that has been a point of sustained criticism across various court jurisdictions. The court appreciates the pressures faced by the Agency but underscores the necessity of expeditious and transparent decision-making to safeguard defendants’ rights and preserve administrative integrity. Sentencing is a complex matrix of factors, balancing the interests of justice, deterrence, rehabilitation, and the specific circumstances of the defendant. In your case, the court is mindful of your age, 34 years at the time of offending, and your prior convictions for acquisitive crime, featuring three previous convictions for theft-related offences within the last decade. There is no evidence of gang or organised crime association, nor any indication of coercion or undue influence. There is a history of unstable housing, periods of unemployment, and marked financial insecurity. Nonetheless, these matters represent contextual background rather than mitigation built on accepted legal principles. In accordance with standard practice, I will therefore direct that a pre-sentence report be procured from the National Probation Service. Such a report is to include a detailed assessment of your offending behaviour, likelihood of reoffending, willingness or suitability to engage with rehabilitative programmes, including cognitive-behavioural interventions and substance misuse treatment, if considered relevant. The report should also address the potential efficacy of community sentences, custodial sentences, or suspended sentences, employing a risk and needs led approach. I stress that no sentencing decision is made today: the court awaits full consideration of all factors, including representations that may be made on your behalf or by interested agencies. The matter will be relisted for sentence at the earliest reasonable date once the report is delivered. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 6 at Hull Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. You are advised formally of your right to appeal under sections 108 and 111 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of sentencing. No reporting restrictions pursuant to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 section 49 apply. Costs are reserved.
