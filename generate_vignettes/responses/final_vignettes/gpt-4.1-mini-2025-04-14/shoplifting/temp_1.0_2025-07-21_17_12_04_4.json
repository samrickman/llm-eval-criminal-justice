Mr H Case No. M2025/14578 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. E. Carrington Filed: 3 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence regarding offences of theft from retail premises, insofar as they arose over an extended period within the Greater Manchester area. The charges before the court represent a culmination of your conduct classified under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, involving acts committed from approximately mid-2023 through into early 2025. They predominantly relate to persistent shoplifting incidents at various retail establishments clustered around both urban and peri-urban localities. The procedural history in this matter is itself emblematic of the complexities faced by modern criminal justice processes in the domain of acquisitive crime. You were apprehended on 19 February 2025 following a protracted investigation led by the Manchester City Retail Crime Partnership, in conjunction with the Greater Manchester Police’s Economic Crime Unit and supported by private sector security providers. This inquiry was precipitated by an uptick in reported instances of stock shrinkage across a selection of medium-sized department stores and convenience outlets, which had established internal protocols to flag repeat incidents matching a specific suspect profile. The intersection of private-sector asset protection and public law enforcement in such cases brings to the fore a number of operational considerations, notably the fragmentation of ownership structures across retail chains and variations in security infrastructure. While some locations benefit from sophisticated electronic tagging systems and extensive CCTV coverage, others rely largely on manual observation and point-of-sale audits, complicating evidence gathering and case continuity. Furthermore, the resource constraints faced by investigatory teams tasked with assembling prosecution cases in these low-value but high-volume offences cannot be overstated. I must take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation for the staff of the Manchester Retail Crime Partnership. Their meticulous collation of internal loss prevention records, combined with collaboration with frontline policing officers, facilitated the assembly of the evidential base in a manner that prevented otherwise foreseeable delays. It is a testament to the commitment of all parties involved that this matter has progressed to trial without the chronic procedural stasis seen elsewhere. It is nevertheless a salutary reminder of the administrative burden imposed by even low-level offending on an overstretched criminal justice system. You were interviewed under caution at the Manchester Custody Centre on 20 February 2025. Initially, your responses were equivocal, with a number of denials and vague references to mental health difficulties. Nonetheless, the police investigation was buttressed by CCTV imagery captured across multiple premises and corroborated by witness statements. Your defence team utilised the Better Case Management (BCM) framework to elicit disclosure of prosecution materials and to ensure adherence to case preparation timetables. The BCM protocol, which has been in place since 2014, was designed to enhance the efficiency of pre-trial processes, emphasising early guilty pleas and thorough case management hearings. While generally effective in streamlining proceedings, its demands often expose weaknesses in agency cooperation and evidential readiness, yet this case represents something closer to the ideal. Petitioners and defendants alike face a multitude of challenges navigating the contemporary court system. Among these are the ongoing pressures exerted by funding constraints in the Legal Aid regime. Indeed, I am compelled to express a degree of frustration with the inconsistent and protracted approval process surrounding applications for expert psychiatric assistance submitted on your behalf. The delay in instructing the consultant forensic psychiatrist — Dr Gabrielle Whitman — required repeated interlocutions over a six-week period before clearance was obtained. Such bureaucratic impediments impede not only efficient case resolution but also risk undermining the principle of fair trial. The court is in earnest hopes that the Legal Aid Agency will review its administrative procedures to prevent repetition. Moreover, it is notable that your plea of guilty was entered belatedly on the morning of the scheduled trial. This, regrettably, is a regrettably frequent occurrence in matters involving acquisitive offending. While the law affords defendants the option to contest charges up to the point of conviction, late pleas diminish the opportunity for the court to confer the full benefit of mitigation. The case law is plain on this issue. In R v. Beckett [2019] EWCA Crim 1333, the Court of Appeal emphasised that credit for plea must correspond to not only the fact of a plea, but also its timing relative to the progression and strength of the prosecution evidence. Similar principles were reaffirmed in R v. Pritchard [2022] EWCA Crim 579, where limited guilty plea credit was upheld due to plea timing. I pause here to address the broader societal context in which offending of this nature should be situated. The incremental escalation of low-level acquisitive crime, particularly in underserved communities, places substantive pressure on retail businesses and by extension the wider local economy. There remains a notable pattern of store closures attributed, in no small part, to persistent shrinkage. The economic repercussions extend beyond immediate financial loss, affecting staff job security and consumer confidence. The court is also mindful of the psychological impact experienced by frontline retail employees, a group disproportionately exposed to the stress of repeated theft incidents and resultant operational changes. In an era marked by significant social disruption, and concomitant strains on public services, one observes a marked increase in street homelessness and drug dependence within the localities overlapping retail centres. These factors contribute to a complex mosaic of vulnerability and opportunity, both influencing and compounding patterns of acquisitive crime. Critically, courts must resist the temptation to conflate causation with justification; while social context informs sentencing discretion, it does not excuse breach of law. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. The facts of this case situate themselves firmly within this established framework: a series of calculated, recurrent thefts involving deliberate concealment of goods, timed to coincide with staff absences or momentary distractions. Your conduct evidences a modus operandi honed over months, employing misdirection and concealment devices designed to subvert detection. Such behaviour requires a measured response. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. The well-established principles set forth by the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft are instructive. The importance of assessing culpability and harm requires close examination of patterns of behaviour, propensity for reoffending, and underlying motivation. While financial loss in individual instances may be modest, cumulative harm to retail businesses, staff wellbeing, and community order is material. I note too the guidance in R v. Fairbanks [2021] EWCA Crim 744, where the Court stressed the detrimental public impact of recidivist shoplifting within deprived zones. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. The court has had the benefit of a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Whitman, who conducted a thorough assessment over several consultations in custody and at the appointed clinic. The report is both detailed and professionally composed. It reasonably concludes that you suffer no serious mental disorder but identifies traits consistent with adjustment disorder and chronic anxiety symptoms. Importantly, it notes a background of unstable housing, bouts of intermittent substance misuse, and a history of traumatic childhood experiences, though it carefully delineates these from direct causal links to offending. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. The report offers a degree of optimism regarding your amenability to targeted psychological interventions, recommending consideration of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to address impulsivity and decision-making deficits. Parallel to this, the probation service has submitted a pre-sentence report highlighting challenges concerning your accommodation status, employment history, and limited engagement with rehabilitative programmes. These agencies note the chronic under-resourcing of mental health and social care services, which serves as a constraining factor on effective support provision. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. Notably, your previous contact with probation services has been sporadic and marked by non-attendance, a pattern unfortunately replicated in many cases of persistent acquisitive offending. The probation report additionally raises concerns about a tendency to understate the seriousness of your conduct, which may impede compliance with future court-imposed conditions. This aligns with known obstacles faced in enforcing community sentences, particularly in relation to offenders with unstable personal circumstances. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. In considering the wider criminal record, you have previous convictions principally comprising offences of shoplifting and minor public order incidents. There is no suggestion of violent conduct or organised criminal association. Previous court interventions have included conditional discharges and community orders, yet these have yielded limited behavioral change. The present offending thus represents a clear breach of prior assurances and court recommendations. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. This court is conscious that the circumstances of your upbringing and current vulnerability are part of the background that may speak to mitigation. However, justice must maintain its central focus: protection of the public, deterrence, and rehabilitation. The law does not operate in a vacuum seperate from social realities but calibrates its responses to reoffending risks and the imperative of public safety. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. I note with interest the submissions made by counsel on behalf of the Crown and defence. Ms Helen Bowers, prosecuting, succinctly but firmly outlined the collective impact on the victims—small business owners and staff—whose statements reveal not merely loss but also a corrosive effect on the sense of security and community cohesion. Mr Owen Childress, representing you, advanced a plea for leniency grounded in your personal circumstances and a purported readiness to engage fully with rehabilitative measures post-sentencing. Before addressing sentencing options, I reflect upon the evolving case law in this domain. The decision in R v. Mayfield [2023] EWCA Crim 888 underscored the appellate courts' continued emphasis on tailored rehabilitation, especially in cases where psychiatric or psychological factors are implicated. It provides useful guidance on balancing custodial sentences and community orders with sufficiently robust supervision and therapeutic support. However, the same authorities affirm that persistent or escalated offending necessitates a firm punitive response. In R v. Cornwall [2020] EWCA Crim 577, the Court reaffirmed that repeated acquisitive offences warrant sentences that commensurately reflect the cumulative impact and the need for deterrence, notwithstanding the absence of physical violence. While community sentences remain a vital tool, the threshold for immediate custody may be met where prior interventions have failed and the risks of ongoing harm are judged to be significant. It has been brought to the court’s attention that the legal framework surrounding sentencing has undergone subtle but important adjustments, including the introduction of structured sentencing options enhanced by rehabilitative conditions such as the Rehabilitation Activity Requirement and Mental Health Treatment Requirements. These innovations seek to address root causes without defaulting to incarceration, where appropriate. The Crown and defence are in agreement that a pre-sentence report is indispensable to inform a proportionate approach. Such reports serve a crucial function in appraising risk, identifying suitable interventions, and providing the sentencing judge with a comprehensive corpus of information through which to balance competing interests. The wider statutory and policy context cannot be ignored. The strain placed on probation staff by expanding caseloads, reduced budgets, and complex offender profiles represents a salient challenge. Similarly, mental health services remain under significant pressure, with waiting times and thresholds creating barriers to timely treatment. These systemic issues do not excuse individual offending but frame the environment within which sentencing decisions must be situated. Added to this is the reality of the enduring backlog in the Crown Court system, exacerbated by recent disruptions including industrial action and pandemic-related effects. Delays in the administration of justice inevitably impact defendants, victims, and the public alike, underscoring the value in expeditious resolution of cases where possible. The case has also been marked by a series of adjournments, notably due to the late provision of expert reports and the need to allow the Legal Aid Agency to authorise private instructions for psychiatric examinations. Such procedural episodes illustrate perennial challenges in balancing defendant rights with the public interest in effective case management. Turning briefly to ancillary matters, I note that reference has been made to prior unrelated family court proceedings involving a sibling of the defendant which, while unfortunate, bear no relevance to the case at hand. Similarly, the landlord of the property where you currently reside has been the subject of a noise abatement notice unrelated to these proceedings. These facts serve as contextual background but do not bear upon the assessment of culpability or risk. I also observe, without comment on evidentiary weight, that a co-defendant linked to unrelated charges of affray and possession of a bladed article remains at large, an issue peripheral to this matter but illustrative of the complexities in multi-agency policing efforts in the locality. The public interest demands that the sentencing outcome not only reflects the seriousness of the offending but also serves to maintain confidence that repeat acquisitive crime will not be tolerated or minimized. This court must exercise its discretion in accordance with established principles, ensuring that decisions are fair, proportionate, and informed by the full factual matrix. At this juncture, I adjourn sentencing to allow the probation service to compile a comprehensive pre-sentence report encompassing not only your personal circumstances and offending history but also an assessment of your current risk profile and prospects for rehabilitation. This will be supplemented, as necessary, by input from relevant health and social services. I direct that all efforts be made to expedite the preparation of such reports, in recognition of the court’s duty to administer justice without unnecessary delay, mindful always of fairness to all parties concerned.
