Mr H Case No. C2025/04816 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. Farnsworth Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before the court for sentence relating to a charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct as charged is said to concern a series of incidents occurring over a protracted period in multiple retail premises across the district of Hartford and adjoining boroughs. The Crown’s case, now uncontested following your guilty plea, presents a pattern of repeated encroachments upon goods held for sale by independent and chain stores alike. Procedural History You were arrested on 18 July 2025 following a coordinated investigative effort conducted by officers assigned to the Hartford Business Crime Unit, working in tandem with retail security personnel and the local Safer Communities Partnership. Although individual incidents might have seemed isolated at the outset, a sustained effort combining in-store CCTV footage analysis, employee witness statements, and electronic stock reconciliation led investigators to discern a recurring modus operandi, culminating in the decision to pursue formal proceedings at Crown Court due to the gravity and persistence of the conduct. In many trials of this nature, it is lamentably common to observe systemic delays and procedural inefficiencies arising from the complexities of assembling multi-source evidential materials. The reliance on under-resourced policing units, often stretched to the limit, places an undue burden not only on prosecutorial agencies but also on retail staff, whose cooperation, whilst invaluable, sometimes comes at a cost to their personal welfare and professional livelihoods. Such strain is visible in the frequent rotation of store managers and the casual turnover of security personnel cited during case preparation. It is in this context that one must view the pressures still mounting on the justice system, as it seeks to address what by their monetary value alone might be called minor offences but which in reality constitute a serious intrusion upon community order and individual safety. The investigation evolved over a period of several months, with your formal interview conducted under caution on 20 July 2025. You initially denied all involvement but changed your plea to guilty at the arraignment hearing on 29 September 2025. While the court duly notes this admission, it must be emphasised that the timing of any such plea has relevance when considering mitigation. The late indication of responsibility can only be accorded a reduced degree of leniency, consonant with established appellate guidance. It is well established and frequently reinforced that early pleas of guilty are preferable in the interests of justice, sparing witnesses and victims the stress and expense of trial, as well as conserving public resources. The Court of Appeal, in R v. Emerson [2020] EWCA Crim 829, reiterated the principle that the timing of a plea is a critical factor in the amount of credit awarded and that last-minute pleas made in the face of overwhelming evidence are properly treated with circumspection. While such legal frameworks provide the doctrinal backdrop for sentencing, the court is cognisant that offenders in your position are often subject to a wide array of social and economic pressures which require careful assessment alongside the facts of the offending. Any evaluation must take into account not only the immediate circumstances but also the wider context of public safety and the risk of reoffending. The court also notes with interest that this case marks one of the first hearings since the recent installation of the new digital recording and case management system in Court 5, which, while still in its infancy, promises to streamline procedural recording and reduce transcription errors in future proceedings. This technological advance is to be welcomed, even if initial implementation inevitably carries some teething problems. The legal framework applicable here remains as articulated in the Theft Act 1968 and the subsequent Sentencing Guidelines for Theft Offences (2022). These guidelines emphasise the need to assess culpability, harm, and any aggravating or mitigating factors in as comprehensive a manner as possible. Relevant case law includes R v. Brightley [2021] EWCA Crim 1053, which held that repeated offences within a short timespan with similar modus operandi indicate higher culpability and warrant firmer sentences. It is prudent also to reference the Economic Crime Strategy published by the Home Office in 2024, which recognises the disproportionate impact that persistent low-level acquisitive crime can have upon small businesses and local economies, exacerbating feelings of insecurity and contributing to the erosion of public confidence in law enforcement. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. It is necessary to pause for a moment to consider the broader social environment in which offences of this category occur. One cannot ignore the marked increase in urban street homelessness and the prevalence of associated antisocial behaviours which, while not justifying criminality, form a background against which many defendants come before the courts. Reports from countless outreach organisations detail an alarming trend of individuals resorting to shoplifting as a means of survival amid inadequate welfare provision and fractured support networks. Nevertheless, the responsibility borne by the individual remains undiminished. Assistance is widely available across multiple voluntary and statutory services — from food banks operating on shoestring budgets to local authority initiatives focused on providing housing stability, drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes, and mental health counselling. These resources, though often overstretched, represent a vital bulwark against recidivism and social decline. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. Turning to the victimology of this case, the court has received statements from multiple retail operators and their employees, submitted via the Hartford Retail Crime Prevention Trust. Careful consideration has been given to the impact of your conduct upon staff welfare and business operation. Several employees described their work environments as having become fraught with anxiety due to repeated thefts, not from strangers, but by an individual exhibiting a disconcerting familiarity with store layouts and staff routines. Such psychological effects must be acknowledged, even in the absence of physical violence. The Retail Crime Prevention Trust is a voluntary organisation, functioning under the constraints of limited funding and reliance upon community goodwill. Yet its role in supporting affected businesses and liaising with police has been invaluable in the creation of timely incident reports and procedural continuity. The Trust has emphasised the importance of deterrence in ensuring that small business proprietors can operate without the constant drain of losses and staff disruption. One must also note the strain on the probation services which faces ever-mounting caseloads amidst funding cuts and recruitment challenges. Reports from the Department of Probation indicate that delays in compiling pre-sentence reports are increasingly common, partly due to administrative bottlenecks and partly due to the necessity of multi-agency input in complex cases. The court regrets that the probation report in your case was only available shortly before today’s hearing, thus limiting the time counsel had to make detailed representations based on its contents. Furthermore, the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative performance has again fallen short of reasonable standards. A request for approval to instruct an independent forensic behavioural analyst was submitted in mid-August but was not authorised until early October, thereby constraining the defence’s preparatory time and delaying case progression. The court reiterates its concern at systemic inefficiencies within the Legal Aid framework which, if unaddressed, compromise timely justice. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. The psychiatric assessment performed by Dr Simone Wrenshall, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, is a detailed document reflecting a thorough clinical interview and review of relevant collateral information. Dr Wrenshall concludes that while there is no evidence warranting a diagnosis of major mental illness, Mr H exhibits features consistent with borderline personality traits and episodic emotional dysregulation. Dr Wrenshall notes history of substance misuse, principally involving intermittent alcohol dependency, and identifies stressors connected to housing instability and social isolation. Dr Wrenshall’s report emphasises that these psychological vulnerabilities, while influential, do not mitigate personal responsibility but rather point to areas where targeted community-based interventions may reduce future risk and promote rehabilitation. It is also noted that Mr H has not consistently engaged with available mental health services, despite periodic outreach efforts from local NHS mental health teams. The court acknowledges that the intersection between mental health difficulties and offending behaviour presents intricate challenges, both in terms of criminal justice and social policy. Balancing the therapeutic imperative against the necessity of safeguarding the public requires judicious consideration of the nature of the crimes committed, the offender’s history, and prospects for change. Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. It is instructive to place this case within the broader jurisprudential context. The Court of Appeal in R v. McGrath [2019] EWCA Crim 670, considered the relevance of underlying mental health conditions in the sentencing of repeated shoplifting offences. The judgment recognised that while clinical conditions might inform the manner of sentence, they do not excuse conduct which actively undermines public safety and commercial integrity. Similarly, R v. Ashford [2020] EWCA Crim 1145 highlighted that persistent involvement in acquisitive crime necessitates not only punitive responses but also multi-agency collaboration aimed at rehabilitation and social reintegration. The judgement stressed the importance of probation reports in identifying opportunities for intervention to prevent reoffending while ensuring community protection. The enforcement of sentencing options must therefore be proportionate, reflective of culpability and harm, and supported by an evidence-based appraisal of risk. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. Prior to today’s sentencing hearing, Defence Counsel submitted letters of support from Mrs Fiona Harcourt (sister of the defendant) and Mr Tariq Benson, a volunteer caseworker from the local charity Hopeway. Both letters describe Mr H’s background with considerable detail, emphasising early childhood adversity, disrupted family networks, and efforts to live stable and law-abiding lives despite chronic financial hardship. The court recognises the value of such material and is grateful for the insights provided. Nonetheless, it must be underscored that familial adversity, while tragically common, does not offer a defense to criminal conduct or a basis for undue leniency. As this court has observed before, there is a critical distinction between explanatory context and excusing rationale. The Hopeway charity itself operates within an ecosystem grappling with unprecedented demand and funding constraints. Its caseworkers bear witness daily to individuals caught in cycles of poverty and criminal justice system contact that are difficult to disrupt without sustained investment at multiple levels. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. Regarding your antecedents, you are now aged 39 years. The central case file details six prior convictions, the majority for theft-based offences, occurring over a decade-long span. Of note, two incidents were dealt with by conditional caution in 2018 and 2020 respectively, and one by a community order in 2021 following a similar charge of shoplifting. Despite these measures, reoffending continued. Such patterns are of concern, particularly as they indicate a failure of early intervention strategies. The court notes that in R v. Kirkland [2022] EWCA Crim 1532, emphasis was placed on the limitations of non-custodial disposals in cases where underlying criminogenic needs remain unaddressed. Your accommodation status remains tenuous. Currently, you report residing in a private tenancy subject to ongoing uncertainty due to rental arrears and threatened eviction. This precarious housing situation compounds the already complex interplay of social risk factors that often accompany persistent acquisitive offending. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. The Crown, through Ms Rachel Byers, has made representations touching on the cumulative economic impact of your conduct upon local businesses, some of which have experienced significant stock shrinkage and customer attrition attributable in part to reputational harm following repeated thefts. In response, the Defence submitted that Mr H’s actions must be viewed in the context of acute financial strain following long-term unemployment exacerbated by health difficulties. Reference was made to a recent report from the Department of Work and Pensions confirming ongoing receipt of Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payments due to disability. The court is required to balance these competing considerations. Financial hardship, while not absent from the adjudicative equation, does not provide a justification for lawful conduct. The legal system contemplates the role of sentencing as a means to uphold social norms, protect the vulnerable, and deter future wrongdoing. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. In relation to sentencing dispositions, the Court is guided primarily by the published Sentencing Council guidelines. Theft offences of the nature before the court are generally triable either summarily or on indictment, with serious or persistent cases warranting custodial sanctions where community penalties are insufficient or inappropriate. A number of ancillary sentencing initiatives apply. These include options for Rehabilitation Activity Requirements, Structured Deferred Sentences, and Engagement with Accredited Programmes addressing offending behaviour, such as the Enhanced Thinking Skills Course. The pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Services offers recommendations for tailored intervention, which the court will consider before announcing sentence. It should be noted that the imposition of any custodial sentence must be proportionate not only to the offence but also to the individual circumstances of the offender. The court is conscious of the overcrowding in custodial establishments and the adverse effects imprisonment may have upon mental health and future reintegration. By contrast, community sentences demand the defendant’s active compliance and may offer opportunities for constructive engagement with rehabilitative services and training, as well as reparation to affected parties through unpaid work or restorative justice interventions. To conclude, the court has endeavored to balance all these factors with a view toward achieving a sentence that promotes public protection, justice for victims, and the possibility of meaningful rehabilitation. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Hartford. The proceedings have been duly recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days under section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions imposed pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. Sentencing shall be deferred pending receipt of the pre-sentence report.
