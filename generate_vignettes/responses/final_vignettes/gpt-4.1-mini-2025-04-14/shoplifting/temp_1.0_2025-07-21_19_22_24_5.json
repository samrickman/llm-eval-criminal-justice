Mr H Case No. T2026/04839 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. WHELAN Filed: 14 October 2026 Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence upon your conviction by way of guilty plea to an offence of theft, specifically shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, as the court understands, extends over a significant period and involves a pattern of repeated thefts from retail premises within the Belmont and surrounding boroughs. The conduct has been examined carefully, and it is necessary to consider both the procedural history and the wider context in which these offences took place before any disposal is determined. Procedural History This matter began its journey through the criminal justice system with your arrest on 8 June 2026, following an investigation instigated by the Belmont Business Crime Reduction Unit. This unit, working in conjunction with the local police safer neighbourhood teams and retail security managers, had recorded a discernible rise in thefts from various corner shops and pharmacies in the area. Initial reports to the police, while initially recorded as isolated incidents spanning low monetary values, were later analysed collectively, revealing a telling pattern. The investigative approach relied heavily on store surveillance recordings, stock monitoring, and witness testimony, gathered over several months. The court is all too familiar with the frustrations that attend investigations of this nature. While advancements in technology have improved image resolution and data storage, the sheer volume of footage to sift through, coupled with varying store layouts and coverage blind spots, impose an onerous burden upon policing resources. Furthermore, fluctuating staff turnover among retail personnel can result in inconsistent witness statements and challenges in maintaining institutional memory. In this particular case, despite such challenges, the investigation proceeded with admirable diligence. Your interview under caution took place on 17 June 2026. On this occasion, you initially denied any wrongdoing. However, forensic examination of clothing found in your residence, which matched that worn in multiple CCTV clips, was instrumental in the subsequent charging decision. You were formally charged on 2 July 2026. The matter was moved to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management model and was listed for a pre-trial review on 25 August 2026. The Better Case Management system is designed to expedite case progression and promote early resolution. It encourages timely disclosure, encourages guilty pleas at the earliest opportunity, and facilitates appropriate pre-sentence preparation. In this matter, the parties have adhered substantially to the indicative timelines. That said, some adjournments occurred due to issues securing Legal Aid funding for expert reports, a recurring theme in many criminal proceedings of late. Of note, the court has also been informed of pressures arising from staffing shortages within the local probation service. The resultant caseload burdens may have impacted the availability of probation officers for timely report preparation. Additional nervousness among defence representatives about the adequacy of rehabilitation proposals in the suspect’s case also prolonged procedural timelines. It is necessary to underline that, despite the relatively low financial value of the stolen items, the pattern of offending cannot be viewed in isolation from the cumulative effect on affected businesses and individuals. Repeated breaches of trust damage community cohesion and impose real psychological and economic harms on those who rely on these establishments, whether as consumers, employees, or proprietors. In respect of your plea, you entered a guilty plea on 20 September 2026. The timing of the plea was relatively late, having initially pressed a not guilty plea at the earlier hearings. Late pleas, while lawful, do not entitle to automatic full credit given their impact upon court time, witness anxiety, and prosecutorial resources. The Court of Appeal, in cases such as R v. Maxwell [2024] EWCA Crim 1789, has underscored that the discount for guilty pleas must be proportionate to the timing and sincerity of the admission. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. The Crown have prepared an extensive schedule of evidence, comprising over 600 pages including CCTV transcripts, police statements, victim impact documents, and forensic analysis. This level of detail, while thorough, highlights the labour-intensive nature of prosecuting such offences. It is a reminder that these cases consume considerable public funds and human resources, despite their sometimes modest monetary stakes. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. We find ourselves, unmistakably, in an era when low-level retail theft cases have become increasingly prevalent, placing strain on multiple arms of the criminal justice system. Frontline retail staff are often the unacknowledged victims of these offences, facing not only loss of stock but also anxiety that can impact their wellbeing. Indeed, it is recorded in this case that some staff requested transfer to other locations or imposed personal coping strategies to manage workplace stress. This effect is not to be discounted. The court places on record appreciation for the work of the Business Crime Reduction Unit, whose proactive engagement with shop owners has fostered an improved intelligence-sharing network. It is regrettable, however, that similar schemes appear unevenly resourced nationally, leading to variable responses in comparable cases. On four separate visits within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same small shop and stole alcohol and tobacco products. The investigative process was complemented by reports from the Retail Support and Recovery Trust, a voluntary sector organisation providing victim support and advocacy. Their submissions to the court commented on the knock-on effect of repeated retail theft on community confidence and local economies. Such organisations, while operating under financial constraints and growing service demands, play a vital role in bridging the gap where statutory services are stretched thin. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. A psychiatric report was commissioned following an application by your defence team, instructing Dr Genevieve Harrod, consultant forensic psychiatrist. The report, dated 7 October 2026, is a detailed and professionally prepared document. Dr Harrod concludes that you do not suffer from a diagnosable major mental disorder but do exhibit features consistent with impulse control difficulties and moderate depressive symptoms linked to socioeconomic stressors. Notably, Dr Harrod highlights a lack of engagement with available community support, including substance misuse services, which is concerning given the risk factors present. Let me emphasise the court’s recognition of the broader societal context here. The mental health and social service frameworks are often overstretched, with long waiting lists for NHS psychological therapies and significant demand on third-sector organisations. Consequently, cases such as yours highlight gaps in service delivery and challenges faced by vulnerable populations. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. The probation service submitted a pre-sentence questionnaire conducted in early October 2026. The report notes your chaotic housing circumstances, lack of stable employment, and peripheral family connections. While acknowledging your expressed willingness to comply with community-based interventions, the officer expressed reservations about the likelihood of sustained engagement without additional structured support. The court also observes that, notwithstanding the strains on local authority housing provision—where temporary accommodations and emergency placements have surged in recent years—such instability cannot excuse repeated rule-breaking. The balance must be struck between understanding and accountability. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. It is necessary to reflect briefly on the relevant statutory and guideline framework. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the defining provision for offences of dishonesty in appropriation. Sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council for theft offences emphasize factors such as planning, persistence, circumstances of the victim, and value. Cases such as R v. Brewster [2023] EWCA Crim 1487 have illustrated the court’s approach to aggravating features in serial theft matters. There, despite modest individual values, the repeated and methodical nature of offending drew a custodial outcome. The Court of Appeal stressed the wider societal harm occasioned by sustained disregard of lawful boundaries. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. Further appellate decisions, including R v. Ferris [2025] EWCA Crim 913, have underscored the principle that although remedial rehabilitative initiatives remain desirable, they must not be viewed as a panacea in the face of persistent offending behaviour. The court is also aware of the extensive administrative burdens imposed on public services when dealing with multi-agency cases. Collaborative mechanisms such as Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARACs) and Integrated Offender Management panels are increasingly called upon to coordinate responses. While beneficial, these often generate additional procedural complexities and require sustained interdepartmental cooperation, which may not always be feasible within existing capacity. Mr H stated in interview that he frequently takes items, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. Despite these complexities, the current case was progressed with reasonable expedition. That said, the court acknowledges the impact of external factors, such as the recent industrial action affecting court listings nationally, which contributed to limited date availability and the need for adjournments. It is unfortunate that your legal representation encountered delays in securing necessary funding from the Legal Aid Agency for expert instruction. This carried the risk of infringing upon your right to a timely and fair hearing. The agency’s administrative processes remain a source of concern within the profession and judiciary alike, with repeated calls for systemic reform. The pleading pattern and timing here fall within a broader trend of late admissions in shoplifting cases. Whilst some may view this as tactical, it inevitably diminishes credit for cooperation. The Crown has nonetheless acknowledged your ultimate acceptance of responsibility. The court trusts this will be reflected appropriately in final sentencing calculations. The impact of your offending upon local businesses and communities should not be underestimated. Though the stolen goods’ value in isolation may seem trivial, the cumulative effect undermines local economies and the sense of security within affected neighbourhoods. The court is mindful, however, to exercise proportionality and fairness. In conclusion, the court will order a pre-sentence report to be compiled by the probation service. This report will assess the suitability of community-based orders incorporating rehabilitative and restorative elements, including potential participation in cognitive skills training and financial management programmes. It will consider whether an unpaid work requirement might be appropriate and identify supports necessary to bolster stability and reduce the risk of reoffending. The report will be requested to advise on the likelihood of your engagement and compliance, mindful of the evidence before this court. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Belmont. A formal transcript has been prepared and logged pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days of the date of sentencing under the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. No reporting restrictions under section 39 of the Youth and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 apply. Costs are reserved.
