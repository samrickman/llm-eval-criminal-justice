MR H Case No. C2025/04159 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. V. Carroway Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced in respect of charges concerning theft from retail premises, offences committed contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. Your conduct is said to have occurred over a protracted period spanning from late 2023 to the early months of 2025, with multiple incidents reported principally in the Kennington and Westminster areas, targeting various small to medium-sized retail establishments. Procedural History The charging process began with your arrest on 29 March 2025. This followed a considerable period of investigative work carried out jointly by the Kennington Neighbourhood Policing Team and officers affiliated with the local Business Crime Reduction Initiative. The pattern of offending, whilst initially recorded as isolated, gradually revealed itself to be a sustained campaign of shoplifting, affecting several independent retailers and chain outlets alike. The coordination required across these distinct agencies demonstrated a commendable mobilisation of local criminal justice resources, given increasing strains on frontline staff. It is important to underline that the investigation which led to your arrest was complex and resource-intensive. Officers undertook a large amount of time-consuming evidence collation, including the analysis of extensive CCTV footage, the gathering of witness statements from retail staff — many of whom operate under significant pressures and turnover — and the integration of intelligence from the Safer Streets Partnership. These investigative steps were not straightforward, given the notoriously low resolution and fragmentary nature of much retail surveillance footage. The challenge of assembling a sufficient evidentiary basis for charge cannot be overstated. Cases involving non-violent acquisitive crime often absorb a disproportionate amount of policing hours, despite the comparatively modest material values at stake. Yet these are not matters to be treated lightly: the cumulative effect on businesses, their employees, and the wider community is significant. The court also recognises, regrettably, that funding constraints within the Legal Aid Agency caused a regrettable delay in approving defence representation and expert report applications, extending the pre-trial stage beyond usual expectations. Such systemic hurdles impair the right to fair and prompt justice – a situation of deep concern to this bench that sadly recurs with alarming frequency. At a plea and case management hearing conducted on 12 June 2025, you initially entered a not guilty plea. However, following the disclosure of detailed digital evidence and further witness statements — including from managers within multiple affected premises — you altered your plea to guilty on the morning of the trial date, 2 October 2025. Late change of pleas, whilst not unusual, attract scrutiny in these circumstances. The reduction in sentence credit available, as established by the Court of Appeal in R v. Darlington [2022] EWCA Crim 317, is necessarily more limited when the plea follows substantial prosecution evidence and significant preparatory work by the court and witnesses. This principle is consistent with the requirement that early acceptance of responsibility is to be encouraged and rewarded, not belated tactical acquiescence. In preparation for sentencing, the court has received reports from the probation service and an independent psychiatric evaluation instructed pursuant to the defence’s application. I take this opportunity to thank Ms Enid Pollock, probation officer, and Dr Victor Al-Masri, consultant forensic psychiatrist, for their detailed and professionally prepared assessments. Their contributions have been instrumental in assisting the court to form a holistic understanding of your personal circumstances, mental health, and risk profile. I must also commend the efforts of retail staff and local voluntary organisations for their ongoing engagement throughout these proceedings. Many individuals operate within under-resourced and high-stress environments, yet have contributed constructive victim impact statements. It is right to acknowledge the often overlooked emotional and psychological toll borne by those affected by repeated retail theft, frequently on modest incomes, and working long hours to maintain essential community services. The court further notes submissions made on your behalf regarding accommodation instability, financial hardship, and sporadic engagement with voluntary sector support. Correspondence from the Kennington Homelessness Support Collective details repeated contacts with you over the past year, expressing both concern and readiness to offer assistance. An exchange of letters between your sister, Mrs Janice M., and your defence solicitor was submitted, highlighting familial difficulties but also offering words of encouragement towards rehabilitation. These materials have been given due consideration. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. It must be recorded that notwithstanding the mitigating narratives tendered, the offence itself possesses a gravity not to be underestimated. The Crown has identified a clear and persistent pattern of offending, demonstrating deliberate intent, planning, and a repeated willingness to disregard law and order. Recalling the well-established sentencing principles articulated in R v. Bristol [2019] EWCA Crim 870, the court must balance the seriousness of the conduct, its effect on victims, and the community, against your personal circumstances and prospects for rehabilitation. Sentencing for theft offences requires careful consideration of both individual culpability and the wider public interest in deterring repetition. In that vein, the sentencing guidelines published by the Sentencing Council for theft (Effective from March 2024) highlight the aggravating factors relevant here: the frequency and persistence of your conduct, the targeting of vulnerable small businesses, and the adverse impact upon shop employees’ wellbeing and workplace safety perceptions. Mitigation is offered primarily through your contrition, as evidenced by the guilty plea, and certain personal difficulties. The court is also mindful of relevant appellate authorities, including the detailed analysis in R v. Walker [2023] EWCA Crim 1405, where repeated thefts from community-run stores formed the basis for a custodial sentence with an emphasis on rehabilitation. Attention to the structured community interventions recommended in that case may be instructive. However, a strict comparison must be avoided given factual differences and local contextual considerations. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. At the case management hearing on 21 August 2025, the court was provided with an updated pre-sentence assessment prepared by Ms Pollock. She noted, among other matters, the difficulties encountered in establishing sustained engagement given your history of erratic contact and unaddressed psychological vulnerabilities. In the course of her report, she highlighted the challenges facing probation services, staffing shortfalls, and increasing caseloads that hamper personalised intervention efforts. The Kennington Probation Office operates under considerable pressure, with a reduction in available rehabilitation resources and a lengthening wait-list for cognitive behavioural programmes addressing acquisitive offending. It is a regrettable reality that public service capacity often lags behind demand, and those seeking assistance find their pathways congested. The court’s hope is that, post-sentencing, you will fully commit to any rehabilitative measures identified as appropriate, both for your benefit and the protection of the public. I also reference the recent inquiry into the administration of court support services, which has brought to light systemic difficulties in maintaining interpreter availability, despite significant efforts to ensure inclusivity. This has, on occasion, resulted in adjournments or suboptimal communications which impede fair process. While not directly applicable here, such issues contextualise the operational environment in which criminal proceedings unfold. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. Turning to the psychiatric assessment, Dr Al-Masri observed no evidence of a major mental illness or cognitive impairment sufficient to mitigate criminal responsibility. Nonetheless, he noted features consistent with borderline personality disorder traits, including impulsivity and difficulties in emotional regulation. The report carefully emphasises the need for ongoing mental health support, but cautions that these do not detract from accountability for calculated criminal acts. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. It is pertinent to remark that, while the court is acutely aware of the significant pressure placed upon mental health services nationally — including stretched NHS community teams, long waiting lists for therapeutic interventions, and regional disparities in service provision — the fact remains that the existence of unmet need does not diminish the seriousness of offending. That tension between vulnerability and responsibility is among the more challenging aspects of sentencing in contemporary jurisprudence and must be addressed with nuance and care. This court also receives representations from the Retail Victim Support Unit, which submitted a comprehensive impact statement on behalf of affected businesses. The report emphasises not only economic loss due to shrinkage and stock replacement, but also the psychological impact on individual employees, citing increased stress, fear, and reduced job satisfaction. I echo the courts’ recognition of these indirect harms which, while less readily quantifiable, are no less real. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. The court has considered the parameters of sentencing set forth in the Theft Act and relevant guideline judgments. You are an adult aged 35, with a prior record including three recorded convictions for shop theft, the most recent of which resulted in a conditional discharge imposed in 2021 following a police caution. I am conscious of the importance, emphasized in R v. Thomason [2022] EWCA Crim 1107, of not allowing previous disposals to be treated as procedural absolution where conduct persists. Repeated failure to desist strongly underlines the need for a sentence commensurate with both punitive objectives and public protection. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. Your case has been handled under the Better Case Management protocol, which aims to expedite court proceedings and reduce unnecessary trial delays. While this framework has been largely effective procedurally, this court notes with regret that various administrative setbacks, particularly those tied to the legal aid process, have induced substantial delay. It cannot be overemphasised how these bureaucratic obstructions impose costs upon all participants — defendants, counsel, victims, and the court alike. I also place on record the cooperation demonstrated by the Crown Prosecution Service, and thank Miss Georgina Ashworth for her diligent and precise presentation of the prosecution case. On your behalf, Mr Calloway Hyde QC’s advocacy was measured and thoughtful, and he deserves the court’s gratitude for his skilful and considered submissions throughout. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. It is observed that you currently reside without permanent accommodation, utilising temporary hostel arrangements maintained by the Kennington Housing Support Network. While this situation undoubtedly exacerbates your vulnerability, housing insecurity alone cannot excuse the breaches of the law before me. Yet this court is aware of the substantial increase in homelessness and rough sleeping across London, a matter of serious social concern and policy challenge. In this respect, the court acknowledges the ongoing efforts of multiple charities and local authorities to respond to an unprecedented demand that far outstrips resource availability. Alongside this, the strain on public mental health services, youth offending teams, and probation agencies creates a systemic environment of fragility, which may contribute to cycles of offending and recidivism. Nonetheless, courts must balance compassion with the imperative to maintain social order and protect the interests of victims. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, claimed it wasn’t a serious crime and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. Having outlined the salient features of your offending, personal circumstances, and expert assessments, the court turns now to sentencing options. Given the pattern, persistence, and impact of your conduct, a custodial sentence is certainly within the range of reasonable outcomes. However, the mitigating factors — particularly your guilty plea, the likelihood of reduced credit resulting from its timing, and identified personal vulnerabilities — must also be weighed carefully. The sentencing guideline encourages the consideration of community orders incorporating rehabilitative requirements, including cognitive skills development, substance misuse treatment where relevant, and accommodation support. This court will request a comprehensive pre-sentence report from probation to assist in tailoring an appropriate disposal. The goal is to maximise opportunities for rehabilitation and reduce the risk of further offending. While community interventions serve important functions, the court must remain vigilant to the reality that a failure to impose sufficient deterrence can embolden repeat offending, to the detriment of public confidence and the fabric of community safety.
