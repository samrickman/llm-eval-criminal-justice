MR H Case No. T2025/13821 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge W. E. BARLETT Filed: 12 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction for theft by shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from a series of offences committed over a span of approximately fifteen months within the Brighton and East Sussex area. The offending was principally directed at a mixture of high street retailers, convenience stores, and pharmacies. This sentencing hearing marks the culmination of a procedural journey extending over seven months, featuring multiple hearings, defence applications, and a considerable volume of documentary material. Procedural History Your initial arrest occurred on 2 April 2025, following the conclusion of an extensive enquiry conducted by the Brighton Retail Crime Unit, assisted by the Sussex Police Safer Neighbourhood Teams and intelligence analysts from the County Crime Bureau. The investigation was complex, involving the harvest of surveilled footage from numerous independent and chain retail premises across several districts. Cross-reference of intelligence reports from store security teams and the Brighton Business Crime Reduction Partnership played a pivotal role. The investigatory diligence was arduous, emphasising the contemporary challenges law enforcement faces when tackling seemingly minor, yet cumulatively impactful, acquisitive offences. As is frequently the case in such matters, the inter-agency cooperation highlighted the growing burden on resources tasked with protecting retail establishments from repeat thefts. It is well recognised that while these offences may appear less serious than violent crimes or drug trafficking, they nonetheless impose a significant strain on police time, retail staff wellbeing, and ultimately consumer confidence within affected communities. The cumulative operational hours devoted to nearing twenty distinct incidents involving yourself were non-trivial and necessitated strategic tasking under the Sussex Business Crime Weekly Brief, wherein priority was accorded according to known offenders’ notoriety and repeat offending patterns. The police interview conducted on 8 April 2025 saw you initially deny involvement in any incidents beyond a single minor theft at a supermarket in central Brighton. However, inconsistencies with surveillance footage and forensic examination of clothing recovered at your residence led to a formal charge on 29 April 2025. The count was formulated as a representative charge addressing the episodes under investigation, a practice consistent with judicial efficiency when confronted with serial acquisitive offending. The matter thereafter was allocated to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management protocol, having been transferred on 15 May 2025 for trial preparation and plea consideration. It is relevant to observe that the Court has long grappled with the procedural difficulties inherent in cases of this nature. In many jurisdictions, delays and adjournments are commonplace, reflecting systemic pressures in court listings, the complexity of evidence collation, and the fluctuating availability of expert psychological and social reports. Notably, in this case, various interlocutory applications were made, including a request by the defence for a mental health assessment to evaluate the presence of any underlying vulnerabilities or notional mitigating factors. This application was granted in part, but unavoidably delayed by protracted communications with the Legal Aid Agency, whose administrative inefficiencies continue to vex criminal proceedings across the country. The delays occasioned did not stem from any fault of the prosecution but rather reflect a wider institutional struggle to marshal expertise expeditiously. Of ancillary interest, during the listing phase, there was an adjournment precipitated by a co-defendant’s material witness's failure to attend, owing to an unrelated matter involving allegations of fly-tipping on Green Belt land near Crawley by that individual. Such tangential matters, while unfortunate, underscore the multiplicity and interwoven nature of criminal proceedings which can, at times, impact overall case progression. The court nonetheless commends the professionalism displayed by all staff engaged in managing the associated administrative burden. At the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 3 September 2025, you entered a plea of guilty. The Crown acknowledges your admission, albeit at a relatively late stage in proceedings. As established jurisprudence dictates, the timing of a guilty plea is an important determinant of credit to be afforded on sentence. The Court of Appeal in R v. Griffiths [2023] EWCA Crim 1825 reaffirmed that early pleas conserve public resources and spare witnesses undue distress, whereas pleas entered near the trial date reduce the grounds for mitigation. Therefore, while your plea is properly recorded, it receives a modest credit for timing. In the course of those preparatory hearings, detailed disclosure was furnished to the defence, including witness statements, CCTV footage from venues in Hove and central Brighton, and expert documentation from the Sussex Forensic Science Centre confirming partial fingerprint matches on packaging seized from various sites. The Crown’s evidence was thus robust and coherent. It is germane to record the observations offered by the probation service in their initial report dated 6 October 2025. The report indicates that the defendant has a history of minor acquisitive offending dating back to 2017, with multiple cautions and community resolutions for shoplifting and related low-level dishonesty. The probation officer notes a lack of steady employment, intermittent episodes of accommodation instability, and a tendency to resist engagement with support services offered through local charities and council schemes. The report further highlights the defendant’s failure to participate in voluntary interventions recommended during previous court disposals. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. The Court has also received a psychological assessment compiled by Dr Siobhan Reynolds, consultant forensic psychologist, dated 20 September 2025. Dr Reynolds’ report is comprehensive and professionally composed, offering a detailed account of your cognitive functioning, emotional regulation, and risk factors. The report notes some traits consistent with mild executive dysfunction and impulsivity, but no diagnosable psychiatric disorder was established. Of note, Dr Reynolds highlights your history of sporadic substance misuse, primarily alcohol, although there was no evidence of dependency. The report recommends engagement with cognitive-behavioural interventions aimed at improving self-control and addressing the criminogenic thinking patterns underpinning your offending. In the course of judicial consideration, I again find it necessary to remark upon the benefits and pitfalls of multi-agency collaboration in cases such as this. Agencies such as the Brighton Community Safety Partnership, the Retail Crime Reduction Unit, and the Sussex Police Licensing Team offer valuable intelligence and victim support. Their joined efforts, however, are challenged by understaffing and competing priorities, particularly given the rise in non-serious offences demanding immediate attention—such as nuisance antisocial behaviour and low-risk street disorder—which frequently draw resources away from longer-term acquisitive crime enforcement. By way of comparison, the court recalls R v. Hanson [2024] EWCA Crim 667, a matter concerning aggravated burglary with grievous bodily harm that, while markedly more serious, illustrates the judicial balancing act in calibrating sentence against relative culpability and societal harm. Though unrelated, that case set precedents on the circumstances warranting custodial sentences even where mental health interventions are present, underscoring the court’s duty to weigh rehabilitation against public protection imperatives. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. It is also apposite to note procedural complexities arising during this case's listing. The venue has recently undergone refurbishments, with new digital display systems installed, enhancing the court’s ability to exhibit CCTV and other visual material to juries and counsel. This technological advancement marks progress, albeit its benefits remain partially untested under full trial conditions here. As is often the case in offences involving repeat shoplifting, the emotional and psychological toll upon retail employees cannot be underestimated. Victim impact statements submitted through the Retail Support Network conservatively estimate the cumulative financial loss to businesses exceeds £2,500. Staff report feelings of vulnerability, stress, and in some circumstances, the need to modify work schedules or modify store security arrangements in response to your behaviour. One employee’s statement, in particular, detailed an occasion on which you were observed wearing a notably distinctive jacket while exiting a premises with concealed goods, which directly contributed to your identification and subsequent arrest. The court recognises the invaluable role of victim support services such as the Retail Employees Wellbeing Project and the St. Matthew’s Charity, whose tireless contributions often go unnoticed but serve as a cornerstone of restorative justice frameworks. Their offers of facilitated dialogue and tailored counselling remain essential components of a modern justice ecosystem. It is vital to acknowledge the broader social context within which your offending took place. We live in a time marked by significant economic disparity, housing precarity, and social fragmentation—a milieu in which petty acquisitive offences have become increasingly visible. However, the court must caution against conflating systemic insecurity with licence for unlawful conduct. Indeed, the Criminal Justice System serves as a bulwark against such conflations, ensuring accountability amidst complexity. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. Moreover, the court remains cognisant of the strain placed upon probation and rehabilitative services nationally. Higher volumes of lower-level offending have contributed to a backlog in offender supervision and delays in access to behavioural change programmes. The Sussex Probation Trust has communicated its concern regarding underfunding and staff shortages, factors which invariably impact quality and consistency of offender management. Despite this, the court expects defendants to engage proactively in available support to demonstrate genuine commitment to desistance. Turning to relevant case law, the Court must be guided by the principles set out in the seminal decision of R v. Cunningham [2019] EWCA Crim 542, which reemphasised that repeated acquisitive offending necessitates a proportionate response balancing punishment and rehabilitation. In that context, a sentence of community supervision coupled with targeted interventions often presents the most efficacious means of reducing reoffending and enhancing social reintegration. Mr H used a question about Oyster Card transactions to divert the shopkeeper’s attention, then leaned over the counter to take a displayed item. It is also instructive to revisit R v. Davies [2020] EWCA Crim 887, a case involving multiple thefts from charity shops, where the appellant’s consistent pattern of offending despite warnings led to a custodial sentence. Although that case featured no threats or violence, the harm inflicted upon vulnerable staff and consequent reputational damage to the charity was held to be a significant aggravating factor. The court emphasised the broader community harm and deterrence considerations. Equally, in R v. Foster [2022] EWCA Crim 1196, the offender was convicted of repeated shop thefts involving electronics and personal care items. The court acknowledged mitigating factors including addiction and unstable housing but concluded that such factors necessitate, rather than negate, intervention. The custodial element in Foster’s sentence was relatively brief due to his prompt guilty plea and genuine engagement with treatment post-arrest. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. As noted earlier, this case was delayed in part due to difficulties experienced with securing authorisation for the instruction of a forensic psychologist to prepare an assessment appropriate to the defendant’s behavioural profile. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted process—characterised by repeated requests for additional documentation and shifted explanatory criteria—frustrated early resolution, drawing criticism not just from defence counsel but from the presiding judge at several procedural hearings. The court urges increased efficiency in this realm, as such delays erode not only case progress but also defendant welfare, inasmuch as outcomes are deferred and opportunities for timely intervention lost. I have reviewed a letter submitted by the defendant’s sister, Ms Bernadine H., dated 30 September 2025. The letter expresses familial concern for your wellbeing and describes efforts to secure stable accommodation and employment. While such expressions merit acknowledgment, it remains incumbent upon you to demonstrate consistent responsibility and engagement with constructive supports. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. Further correspondence has been received from the Brighton Soup Kitchen and the Homeward Bound Initiative, both voluntary-sector organisations that provide assistance to individuals experiencing financial hardship and housing instability. Their reports speak to the challenges faced by many residents, including yourself, but also stress the importance of personal accountability in overcoming adverse circumstances. Of note, the defendant’s conduct predates the onset of the recent economic downturn but has undoubtedly been impacted by associated austerity and rising living costs. Nevertheless, this court must reiterate that economic difficulty does not excuse criminal conduct. It may contextualise, but never exculpates. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. In the course of reviewing the case, the court considered various irrelevant factors which, while possessing potential legal or procedural interest in other contexts, bear no direct influence herein. These include a recent prosecution within Brighton Town involving aggravated affray following a pub altercation involving pool cues; an unrelated arson case at a commercial warehousing unit in nearby Lewes; and proceedings against a co-defendant charged with impersonating a police officer during arrest. None of these incidents involve the defendant and are noted for completeness only. Moreover, the defendant’s immediate family have, in separate court proceedings, been involved in various unrelated matters including benefit fraud and noise abatement disputes—with no material bearing on the present charges. Such extraneous details serve as a reminder of the complexity of social networks but must not contaminate judicial reasoning or sentencing. Turning again to sentencing considerations, the current offence is characterised by the sustained pattern of offending, limited remedial engagement, and the tangible impact upon both victims and local businesses. While no episodes of violence or overt threats were caused, the psychological burden upon retail staff—some of whom altered their professional roles in response—tempered what might otherwise be seen as a purely financial crime. Mr H stated in interview that he frequently takes items, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. The sentencing framework, pursuant to the Sentencing Council Guideline on Theft Offences, necessitates a balanced consideration of culpability, harm, personal mitigation, and the public interest in deterrence. The court must also weigh the prospects for rehabilitation, the defendant’s personal circumstances, and any previous criminal history. Mr H, you are now 35 years old, with an offending history dating back nearly a decade, punctuated mainly by shoplifting and minor dishonesty convictions. You have yet to establish meaningful periods of lawful employment and currently reside in temporary accommodation provided by the local authority. Your inconsistent engagement with support services and reluctance to embrace rehabilitative opportunities temper the assessment of your prospects. In conclusion, I shall adjourn sentence to obtain a detailed pre-sentence report which will encapsulate all relevant information and provide a framework for evaluation of available sentencing options. The report should consider the viability of community orders incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements, unpaid work, and cognitive skills training. The potential for restorative justice approaches will also be assessed. The detailed preparation of this case, the presentence assessment, and the ratification of appropriate sentence should ensure a proportionate and just outcome, consonant with the needs of public protection and personal reform. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.
