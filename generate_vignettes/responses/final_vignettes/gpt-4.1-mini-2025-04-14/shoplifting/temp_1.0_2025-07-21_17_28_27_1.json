MR H Case No. T2025/13845 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. HAWTHORNE Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence arising from charges concerning acquisitive offending contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending consists of a series of thefts from various retail outlets within the greater Bristol environs over an intermittent period spanning from late 2023 through to early 2025. This conduct has engaged the attention of multiple investigative agencies and community safeguarding entities, given the cumulative impact on local businesses and the wider public realm. Procedural History and Case Progression Your arrest occurred on 18 February 2025, following an extensive, multifaceted inquiry initiated by the Bristol City Police Crime Unit. This unit, in conjunction with the West of England Business Crime Partnership and the Avon and Somerset Community Safety Team, orchestrated a targeted response to a discernible spike in retail thefts in the city centre and adjacent neighbourhoods. These efforts were buttressed by intelligence-sharing protocols consistent with the Crime Reduction Partnership’s operational framework, engaging both public and private stakeholders to collate evidence. It is important to recognise that the investigation was neither trivial nor perfunctory. It was characterised by a coordinated, labour-intensive approach involving hours of forensic analysis of CCTV footage, multiple witness interviews, and cross-referencing of retail stock losses. The burden placed upon overstretched police resources should not be underplayed. In recent years, there has been a documented increase in the allocation of personnel to ‘volume crime’ categories like shop theft, reflecting their deleterious impact on community well-being and commercial viability. Such deployment inevitably diverts finite investigative capacity from offences of greater inherent danger, yet it remains justified given the cascading effects of acquisitive crime on local economies and victim confidence. Of particular note, the investigative phase was periodically hampered by procedural matters. Listing constraints at the Bristol Crown Court, compounding staffing shortages within the clerking office, occasioned delays in progression. These administrative impediments reflect a national trend, as courts across the jurisdiction contend with rising caseloads and resource reductions, a phenomenon explored in the 2025 report by the Sentencing Council on court efficiency. As lamentable as these delays may be, they do not mitigate the seriousness of the allegations with which you are confronted but serve as a reminder of the operational context within which the justice system currently functions. Further, there was a notable delay occasioned by the withdrawal and subsequent re-application for Legal Aid funding to instruct an independent psychiatric expert. This process extended over some six weeks, occasioning an adjournment of the initial plea hearing set for 4 May 2025. The Representations Team at the Legal Aid Agency cited a requirement for enhanced justification amid budgetary constraint pressures, an illustration of the systemic challenges that legal practitioners currently face in safeguarding defendants’ rights to expert opinion. These systemic issues have been raised in submissions before this court, including in the interlocutory decision of R v Cartwright [2024] EWCA Crim 768, which affirmed that no undue procedural obstacles may be permitted to delay fair trial rights. It is regrettable that such issues continue to beset case progression. The plea and trial preparation hearing eventually took place on 22 June 2025, at which time you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequent to this, upon further disclosure and the presentation of additional surveillance evidence by the Crown, your position changed and you tendered a guilty plea on 12 September 2025. This timing is pertinent to sentencing credit considerations, which will be addressed shortly. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. Issues of public perceptions regarding acquisitive crime are well-documented in the criminological literature and judicial commentary. The court is mindful of the work of Professor Amanda Blake of the University of Manchester, whose empirical studies indicate that repeat shoplifting exerts a disproportionate impact on staff morale and local retail economies, often precipitating staff attrition and increased insurance premiums. The harms are cumulative, and although each individual act may appear minor in isolation, their serial nature produces broader public consequences. The victim impact statements tendered herein reveal the significant psychological toll borne by shop employees, many of whom are young and relatively inexperienced in frontline service positions. Staff recount episodes of anxiety when working alone, alterations to shift patterns to avoid contact with the defendant, and a pervasive sense of insecurity during working hours. These impacts are consistent with findings within the 2024 report from the Retail Workers’ Health Alliance, which underscores the vulnerability and mental health strain experienced by those working in acquiring environments subject to frequent theft and attendant disruptions. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. In an unrelated but instructive vein, the court recalls the judgment in R v. Coyne [2019] EWCA Crim 1437. That case involved a defendant whose pattern of repeat shoplifting extended over eighteen months and included episodes of aggressive behaviour towards retail staff. Although Mr Coyne’s offending was distinguished by the addition of violence, the custodial outcome emphasised the necessity of deterrence in persistent dishonesty offences. While the facts here do not suggest violence, the persistent nature of the offending similarly militates for an appropriately calibrated sentence. The court also acknowledges the judgment of R v. Denson [2023] EWCA Crim 1149, which considered the implications of mental health factors in sentencing for acquisitive offending. The Court of Appeal there affirmed that mental disorder, while potentially a mitigating factor, does not ipso facto justify non-custodial sanctions where offending remains deliberate and calculated—particularly when public confidence demands a firm response. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. Dr Jamal Ahmed, consultant forensic psychiatrist, authored a detailed clinical assessment pursuant to a remand in custody, supplemented by interviews and review of past medical records which included prior presentations for anxiety and episodic low mood. Dr Ahmed’s report, dated 5 September 2025, concluded that you present no enduring psychiatric disorder necessitating in-patient hospitalisation or secure care. Rather, your psychological profile is consistent with mild to moderate depressive symptomatology coupled with features of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. Dr Ahmed further highlighted your acknowledged history of polysubstance misuse, primarily involving occasional alcohol and cannabis, though these behaviours were reported to have reduced markedly during recent custodial periods. The report underscores a fluctuating engagement with community mental health services, characterised by missed appointments and inconsistent adherence to prescribed therapeutic regimens. The Probation Service pre-sentence report, prepared by Officer Lucy Cartwright and dated 2 October 2025, provides a comprehensive outline of your personal circumstances, including current accommodation arrangements in hostel accommodation provided under local authority auspices. Ms Cartwright reports limited positive engagement with rehabilitative programmes to date, citing your reluctance to participate in structured group work or one-to-one interventions. The report also reflects upon your limited employment history and lack of stable income, noting vulnerability to social exclusion and isolation. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. Regarding risk of reoffending, the Probation Officer utilises the Offender Assessment System (OASys), which classifies your risk as medium for both general and acquisitive crime categories, given your prior convictions and pattern of offending. The report recommends targeted cognitive-behavioural interventions to address impulsivity and improve decision-making skills, alongside practical support for housing stability and employability training. It is necessary to observe with some concern that your apparent failure to consistently avail yourself of available support services echoes a recurrent pattern within caseloads managed by the Probation Service. This inclination towards non-engagement presents practical challenges for effective rehabilitation and risk management, underscoring the importance of judicial intervention to impose conditions that promote adherence. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. The investigation drew upon a constellation of evidence. CCTV footage, collected from several retail premises including local supermarkets and convenience stores, were reviewed by the Avon and Somerset Forensic Imaging Unit. The unit’s analysis, supported by sworn statements from retail loss prevention officers, established your presence at the scene of multiple thefts with combined stock losses totalling in excess of £2,400. A noteworthy feature of the investigation was the reliance on advanced image enhancement technologies, which permitted finer identification of the defendant’s distinctive gait, clothing, and carry items despite suboptimal camera angles. Such forensic advancements have transformed the evidentiary landscape in retail crime, a fact recognised in the 2023 Home Office report on technological integration in policing. Also pertinent were intercepted communications between you and third parties advocating for the sale or exchange of allegedly stolen goods, an aspect considered by the Crown in reaching a decision on the scale and intensity of the charges brought. While these messages do not implicate any individuals beyond yourself, they do suggest an element of sophistication and planning inconsistent with impulsive petty larceny. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. The court must address, briefly, matters raised in defense submissions regarding the possible presence of coercion or duress. No compelling evidence was brought forward to substantiate these claims. Neither were there credible links proposed between yourself and organised criminal groups in the area, a matter of some importance given the frequent conflation in media narratives of shoplifting with organised retail crime. The court is clear that you acted independently and without external compulsion. It is also recalled that one co-defendant, Mr James Tallis, is subject to separate proceedings arising from offences of criminal damage and affray committed during a disturbance near one of the shopping precincts. That matter bears no direct relation to your conduct but serves as a backdrop to the wider investigative sweep conducted in the locality. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. The court notes, with continuing disquiet, the well-documented struggles defendants face in securing legal aid funding for expert psychiatric reports, as well as funding for specialised defence advocates. Your legal team has diligently represented your interests throughout, with Mr Stephen Broad appearing on your behalf as a thankfully skilled and conscientious advocate. Instances of delay attributable to repeated clarifications sought by the Legal Aid Agency, coupled with burdensome administrative processes, place significant strain on defence teams and inevitably impact your right to expeditious justice. The court urges relevant authorities to continue efforts to streamline and humanise such procedural requirements, consistent with the observations made in the Independent Review of Legal Aid published earlier this year. The Retail Support Association submitted a statement detailing increased anxieties within the sector and noting that repeated shoplifting incidents have led to increased operational costs, including the employment of additional security measures and loss prevention staff. This burden is frequently passed on to consumers and contributes to the erosion of trust between local businesses and their clientele. Community safety teams report an upsurge in calls regarding antisocial behaviour rivalled only by wider concerns over street homelessness and rough sleeping, which has risen notably in Bristol’s city core. The intersection of these social phenomena complicates efforts to implement storage and loss prevention strategies within retail outlets, leading to tensions between business owners and vulnerable populations. The court is aware that collaborative multi-agency working is tasked with grappling with these complexities, although outcomes are often undermined by resource shortfalls and policy ambiguity. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. As set forth in statute and elucidated within the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences 2021, sentencing must strike a balance among the seriousness of the offending, the culpability of the offender, and personal mitigation. The court must consider the financial loss, any vulnerability or harm caused, your antecedents, and the prospects for rehabilitation. Credit for your guilty plea will be tempered by its late entry. The principle articulated in R v. Fowke [2020] EWCA Crim 876 instructs that a plea entered at an advanced stage, especially following protracted contestation and preparatory proceedings, warrants reduced discount to reflect the limited benefit obtained in terms of trial management and witness expense. Your plea on 12 September 2025, after multiple hearings and disclosure rounds, qualifies in this respect. It remains important to consider your personal circumstances, including your housing instability, mental health profile as discussed, and expressed willingness to engage in rehabilitative work, albeit belatedly. The court must weigh carefully the necessity of both punishment and rehabilitation, the latter being pivotal to reducing the risk of reoffending and enhancing community safety. Notably, the court acknowledges the challenging social milieu you inhabit, including limited access to stable employment opportunities, protracted waits for social housing, and the broader impacts of socioeconomic deprivation. Courts have increasingly recognised the role that such factors play in shaping offending patterns, as highlighted in the academic and judicial discourse, including the recent lecture delivered by Lord Justice Hayward on sentencing equity. Nonetheless, individual responsibility remains paramount. Prior conduct, including four convictions for shoplifting, informs the court’s understanding of your maturity and the repeated failure to desist despite prior interventions. This represents a significant aggravating element. The authority of R v. Kendall [2018] EWCA Crim 1892 reiterates that persistent offending in spite of warnings and community measures evidences a higher degree of culpability and warrants sentences of increased severity. In light of the foregoing, I direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report with a focus on achievable community interventions and the possible imposition of a custodial sentence with conditions oriented towards your rehabilitation and public safety. The report should explore the feasibility of cognitive-behavioural treatment programmes, plus accommodation support including referral to housing liaison officers. I shall take no further step to final sentence today. The matter will be listed for sentence on 3 December 2025, to afford the probation service the requisite time to produce its report and for all interested parties, including your legal representatives, to make representations. These sentencing remarks are issued this 14th day of October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record will be notified to the relevant agencies.
