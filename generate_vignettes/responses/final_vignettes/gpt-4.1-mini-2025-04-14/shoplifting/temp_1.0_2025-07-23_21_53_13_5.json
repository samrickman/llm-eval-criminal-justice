MR H Case No. CR2025/25918 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. S. Armitage Filed: 19 August 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a single indictment alleging theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising out of events spanning a protracted period across multiple retail outlets predominantly located within the Feltham and surrounding boroughs. It is, however, understood that the indictment is representative of a more extensive course of offending behaviour, the precise detail of which will emerge in due course. Procedural History This matter came before the courts following a series of reports from independent and chain retail operators who, over the better part of 18 months, recorded repeated incidents of unexplained stock loss and suspicious interactions consistent with theft by concealment. The case followed a multi-agency investigation spearheaded by Feltham Borough Police’s Retail Crime Unit in collaboration with the Feltham Business Crime Reduction Initiative, an entity whose remit has frequently been discussed at length in these courtrooms as part of the modern policing strategy to combat low-level acquisitive crime in a rapidly evolving urban environment. Whilst laudable in theory, the practical challenges faced by these units should not be underestimated nor lightly dismissed. As has been repeatedly observed in numerous case management hearings, the underlying difficulties of coordination, timeliness in intelligence dissemination, and consistency in enforcement render such partnerships vulnerable to delays and inefficiencies, despite the best efforts of individual officers and dedicated staff. The origins of the case's progression under the Better Case Management (BCM) approach are germane. BCM, first introduced in the early 2010s with the aim of expediting case resolution and reducing the backlog of persistent low-level offending, provides a framework mandating early disclosure, structured timetabling, and active case monitoring. Feltham Crown Court's adoption of BCM protocols over the last decade has procured a modest enhancement in the throughput of acquisitive crime trials, but judicial officers remain acutely aware of the frequent procedural obstacles posed by under-resourcing, evidential gaps, and defence tactical considerations. In this instance, initial hearings were delayed owing to the Defence’s late application for Legal Aid funding for an independent forensic psychiatrist—approval of which was eventually granted on 21 May 2025 after a protracted period of correspondence and multiple applications to various branches of the Legal Aid Agency. The delays occasioned by this process, while unfortunately all too familiar in contemporary practice, had a tangible impact on the timetable for the preparation of your defence. It must be recorded that you initially entered not guilty pleas during the first appearances, a course of action not unusual in cases involving cumulative offences where the weight of evidence is assembled progressively and often not fully disclosed until some weeks later. Over time, however, following comprehensive presentation of the evidential material—largely comprising CCTV footage, stock discrepancy analyses, and forensic examination of seized materials—you changed your plea on the morning of the trial window, an occurrence which triggers its own set of considerations regarding mitigation and case management efficiency. This court is mindful of the guidance set down by the Court of Appeal in R v. Thompson [2019] EWCA Crim 814 regarding plea timing and the extent of credit available; those passages continue to inform this tribunal’s approach. Acknowledgements are due to Ms Caroline Fenwick of the Feltham Retail Crime Partnership for her meticulous coordination of victim impact statements and a detailed overview of the economic and psychological toll on affected business proprietors and employees. The statements, whilst not attached to these remarks, have influenced the court’s perspective on the wider ramifications of shoplifting beyond mere monetary loss. Likewise, the voluntary sector organisation Good Neighbours Feltham has submitted representations concerning community support options and is noted for their continued work with persons at risk of exclusion from mainstream social services—a fact which underscores the rich tapestry of intervention points that unfortunately remain unexploited in this matter. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. Turning to the broader societal context in which this offending occurred, years marked by austerity measures and reduced funding for social services have significantly eroded the capacity for early intervention and wraparound support for vulnerable populations. It is a regrettable reality that many individuals who might otherwise have been diverted from offending pathways find themselves funneled into the criminal justice system simply by reason of systemic frailties rather than personal moral failure. This observation is neither exculpatory nor directly pertinent to the sentence to be imposed but reflects the environment in which this case took place. The considerable increase in street homelessness and the rise of so-called “hidden homelessness” in this region have placed additional strains on local authorities and charitable organisations alike. The difficulties of securing emergency accommodation and mental health support have been exacerbated by these pressures, and the positive engagement of Good Neighbours Feltham with this population remains a noteworthy example of community resilience. Equally pertinent is the impact on those charged with enforcing public order and facilitating restorative justice. The Feltham Probation Service’s capacity has been demonstrably stretched in recent years, attributable in part to an increase in referrals arising from crimes of acquisitive nature, compounded by staff shortages and bureaucratic encumbrances. This systemic challenge has tangible consequences for the management of defendants, including yourself, whose cases require careful assessment, timely reporting, and the delicate balancing of rehabilitative opportunities with community safety imperatives. The interdependency of these factors cannot be overstated. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. It is worth recalling for context the legislative history underlying section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which replaced a slew of antecedent common law provisions and sought to codify the parameters of dishonest appropriation. The statute’s wording has, at times, been subject to judicial interpretation, particularly regarding the element of dishonesty and the requirement for the property to belong to another. This court further acknowledges the continuing evolution of case law affecting the applicability and scope of theft offences in novel contexts. See, for example, R v. Ghosh [1982] QB 1053, which articulated the now-tired two-limb test for dishonesty, later refined by Ivey v. Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67, where the Supreme Court redefined the test for dishonesty in a manner that removes subjective elements in favour of an objective standard. Although not directly determinative of this case, such jurisprudential developments form part of the judicial backdrop. It is, of course, a commonplace point that shoplifting, while often lamented, is sometimes treated as a minor or victimless crime. This court must resolutely reject such a notion, not only because of the direct losses incurred by businesses but due to its indirect effects on employees and the wider community. The psychosocial effects on retail workers—some of whom fear repeat victimisation, harassment, or even physical assault—must be given proper weight. Indeed, I have received victim impact reports describing adjustments to work patterns, staffing rosters, and a growing sense of unease, all of which contribute to workplace stress and diminished morale. Therefore, it is neither fair nor just to diminish the gravity of shoplifting, particularly when it is neither spontaneous nor opportunistic, but planned and repeated. In considering analogous legal authorities, I reference the Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v. Clifford [2020] EWCA Crim 511, where a repeat offender received a substantial custodial sentence for serial acts of theft from multiple small retailers. The judgment emphasised the significance of persistence, premeditation, and disregard for prior warnings. Similarly, in R v. Bradshaw [2022] EWCA Crim 884, the court underscored the importance of reflecting the cumulative harm caused by such conduct, albeit each individual theft might be categorised as low value. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. It must be noted that early pleas of guilty attract the most significant discount on sentence, reflecting a genuine recognition of wrongdoing and a saving of court and witness resources. By contrast, pleas entered at the last moment—often when the weight of evidence becomes incontrovertible—warrant a tempered approach to mitigation. This is of particular relevance given your initial not guilty pleas entered and the timing of your eventual admission. A referral was made to the community psychiatric team during the intervening period, and a report compiled by Dr Fiona Meredith, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was submitted to this court. Dr Meredith’s report, dated 2 August 2025, is indicative of the complexity of your mental health status. While it does not identify a diagnosable severe mental illness, the report does note traits consistent with borderline personality disorder and episodes of emotional dysregulation. Importantly, Dr Meredith remarks that these features do not diminish your culpability but may inform appropriate rehabilitative pathways, particularly via psychological therapies targeted at impulse control and stress management. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. The report highlights a pervasive pattern of disengagement from community services, inconsistent attendance at appointments, and, regrettably, a reluctance to engage with structured support for known substance misuse issues, notably alcohol dependency. These aspects complicate attempts to craft an effective intervention strategy and heighten the risk of reoffending. The Probation Service’s pre-sentence report, received yesterday, echoes these concerns and provides detailed recommendations aimed at maximizing compliance through a mix of structured programmes and assertive community engagement. In this context, it is instructive to recall the principle articulated in R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412, particularly with regard to offenders whose clinical presentations sit ambiguously on the border between personality disorder and enduring mental illness. The Court there emphasised that treatment and supervision must be “woven tightly” to both safeguard the public and offer the best chance of rehabilitation. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. Returning to procedural matters, the court notes that this case, although originally listed for sentence on 5 August, was adjourned at the defence’s instigation in order to facilitate the preparation of the expert psychiatric and probation reports. The delays occasioned thereby are regrettable but unavoidable, and the court has endeavoured to list the matter expeditiously to avoid undue prolongation. Another noteworthy observation emerges from a recent report by the Crown Prosecution Service’s Retail Theft Taskforce, highlighting a worrying national trend towards increased sophistication in shoplifting techniques, including the use of online resale platforms and the exploitation of self-service checkouts. While such modus operandi has not been explicitly established in your case, the shifting landscape remains relevant to sentencing considerations insofar as it illustrates evolving patterns of offending and the attendant risks posed. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. In similar vein, the court reflects on the importance of inter-agency cooperation, as evidenced in the response to a recent incident of fly-tipping on protected green belt land within the borough—a matter unrelated to your own offending, yet illustrative of the pressures on the same local enforcement units. The failure to address environmental breaches swiftly adds to the cumulative burden borne by regulatory bodies, police, and local residents alike. Such examples, though peripheral here, contribute to an understanding of the operational context in which your case unfolds. A further point of systemic relevance arises from commentary on the Legal Aid Agency’s current processing times, which have extended to averages of ten weeks for forensic psychological assessments, thereby engendering significant consequences for case progression and defendant welfare. Legal professionals appearing today have lamented the necessity of navigating these administrative obstacles, an observation borne out in this matter’s chronology. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. I acknowledge in passing the assistance of Mr Daniel Shaw, instructing solicitor for the defence, and Ms Joanne Keeler, counsel appearing for the Crown, both of whom conducted thorough and professional submissions within the constraints imposed by the case’s complexity and the aforementioned delays. Their respective endeavours, though routine to this court, deserve formal acknowledgment. Illumination is also afforded by the intersection of criminal offending and social media phenomena. Courts nationally have noted the emergence of “shoplifting challenge” videos proliferating on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. These often serve to glamorise petty crime and propagate mimetic offending behaviours, posing particular challenges to the juvenile and young adult population. While no direct evidence links you to such online activity, awareness of the wider cultural milieu remains important. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. Observations on the condition of the court’s facilities are rarely germane to sentencing but are included here as a point of procedural record. Since the recent refurbishment of Courtroom 5, the improved accessibility and technological upgrades have enhanced the capacity for timely hearings. Nonetheless, occasional technical failures of recording equipment continue to cause minor interruptions, as evidenced by today’s brief delay in commencing. It is perhaps fitting at this juncture to place on record the court’s respect for the front-of-house personnel. Court ushers and clerical staff, often subject to challenging environments and demanding public expectations, facilitate the orderly conduct of proceedings and maintain decorum. Their contribution, though unsung, is integral to the administration of justice. In accordance with guidance from the Sentencing Council’s Overarching Principles and the Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (2022), this court considers factors including the harm caused—both tangible and intangible—the level of culpability, the offender’s degree of remorse, antecedents, and prospects for rehabilitation. While the monetary value of items taken in isolation may appear modest, the persistent nature of offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, and attendant impact on victims elevate the seriousness significantly. The court also has regard to the tragic case of R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, involving arson in a communal block, cited not to equate the gravity of the offences but to exemplify the court’s broader duty to ensure that offences which undermine social cohesion are met with commensurate sanctions. Likewise, the decisions in R v. McKinnon [2021] and R v. Calderwood [2022] remind us of the importance of addressing conduct that may, on first appearance, appear trivial but when viewed cumulatively, calls for a firm response. The current position on guilty plea discount, as recently set out in R v. Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754, confirms that credit is to be awarded not as a matter of course but reflecting timing and sincerity. This case’s late plea places it towards the lower end of the mitigation scale. Insofar as rehabilitation measures are concerned, the Probation Report recommends consideration of a community order incorporating a requirement for participation in a cognitive behavioural programme targeted at acquisitive offending and impulse control. The report notes barriers to compliance, including your ambivalence towards engagement and fluctuating accommodation status, the latter being symptomatic of the ongoing housing crises impacting Feltham and much of the South-East. The report cautiously supports a tailored approach balancing custodial risk with public protection. I wish to reiterate that the court does not lightly consider custodial sentences in theft cases, particularly given the systemic pressures on prisons and the importance of avoiding unnecessary institutionalisation. However, the persistent, deliberate nature of offending, combined with the limited engagement with support services, tempers optimism as to the efficacy of community disposal alone. In light of these considerations, I reserve the final sentencing decision until the receipt of this court’s directive pre-sentence report. The probation officer is instructed to include an assessment of the feasibility of community interventions as well as the potential for restorative justice meetings with affected retailers where appropriate. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 19 August 2025, in Courtroom 5 at Feltham Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be duly transmitted to the relevant authorities for administrative purposes. The defendant is reminded of his right of appeal within 28 calendar days of sentencing pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs remain reserved for future determination.
