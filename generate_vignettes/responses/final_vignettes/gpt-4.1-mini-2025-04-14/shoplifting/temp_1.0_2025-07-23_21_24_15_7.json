Mr H Case No. T2026/14087 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. R. Willoughby Filed: 16 September 2026 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of offences involving theft from retail premises, committed over a sustained period between November 2024 and May 2026. The charges—brought pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968—relate to a course of conduct characterised by multiple incidents across various commercial areas within the Kirklees district and adjoining boroughs. Procedural and Investigative Background You were apprehended on 25 May 2026 following the culmination of an extensive multi-agency operation coordinated by the Kirklees Safer Communities Unit. The complex investigation required the pooling of resources from local policing teams, Retail Theft Reduction Officers, and the Huddersfield Business Crime Partnership. The enquiry was encouraged by reports from various independent convenience stores and pharmacy outlets concerning repeated, low-value thefts by an individual whose description corresponded with yours. Such investigations into acquisitive crime, although often perceived as “low-harm” within public discourse, are resource-intensive and present substantial operational challenges. A considerable amount of officer time is necessarily devoted to trawling through hours of CCTV footage, cross-referencing witness statements, and managing evidence logs. While digital recording devices are widely deployed across retail chains, issues with footage quality, field of view restrictions, and variable lighting conditions often impede investigations. It bears mentioning that the limitations of surveillance technologies present a significant burden to investigators seeking to establish evidentiary continuity in these cases. In balancing the opportunity costs inherent in such deployments, the police must concurrently contend with rising demand for intervention in matters of more acute threat, including incidents of violent crime, domestic abuse, and gang-related activities. The Kirklees Safer Communities Unit has reported increased pressure on personnel resources throughout the period in question, particularly given concurrent demands posed by neighbourhood disorder and the sentencing of prolific offenders involved in high-risk offending. The systemic backdrop to this case is, therefore, one of stretched capacity and competing priorities. Following your arrest, you were interviewed under caution on 27 May 2026. Despite initial denials, the prosecution was able to rely on a combination of digital forensic evidence, including footage from smart CCTV installations, electronic point-of-sale records, and customer testimony, to present a coherent and persuasive case. You elected to change your plea to guilty on the day of trial, thereby sparing witnesses the ordeal of giving evidence. It is regrettable, but not uncommon, that pleas of guilty in shoplifting matters are frequently entered late in the proceedings. While the availability of a sentence reduction for early admission is a cornerstone of efficient justice, such concessions are predicated not upon the procedural mechanism of indictment but upon the substantive demonstration of remorse and acceptance of responsibility. Courts are wary of pleas entered merely as tactical devices once the weight of evidence has become insurmountable, a principle underscored in the recent appellate authority of R v Humphrey [2025] EWCA Crim 215. The timing of your plea, therefore, significantly informs the starting point for credit consideration. The case has proceeded through standard listing arrangements under the Better Case Management (BCM) system. The BCM protocol was introduced with a view to streamlining case progression and reducing delays, emphasising early engagement by parties to allow simplification and avoid protracted trials where possible. It is fair to observe that in this matter, notwithstanding protracted preparatory steps occasioned by necessary forensic analysis and witness management, the BCM objectives were broadly met. The case was listed within suggested timeframes, papers were served in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, and the joint efforts of prosecution, defence, and the court administration were broadly commended in case management hearings. I would, however, record some residual concern regarding institutional processes relating to the funding and instruction of expert assessments. The defence’s applications for authorisation to instruct a qualified forensic psychologist—intended to assist with considerations of rehabilitation and culpability—were subject to repeated deferrals by the Legal Aid Agency. Such delays are symptomatic of systemic constraints within that body, as noted in the judiciary’s periodic criticism of operational inefficiencies that impede defendants’ access to appropriate expertise. In cases involving repeat acquisitive offending, timely psychological assessment may be critical, both for sentencing and for formulating credible rehabilitative pathways. It is perhaps worth pausing to recognise, in that context, the ongoing pressures faced by the Probation Service. Nationally, an enduring shortage of qualified probation officers, compounded by high caseloads and resource limitations, has constrained the ability of the service to effectuate early risk assessments, prepare pre-sentence reports expeditiously, and deploy suitable offender management strategies. These systemic challenges bear upon the wider delivery of criminal justice outcomes and bear reminder in considering options available for community-based disposal where warranted. The Role of Victim Impact and Charity Representations Throughout the proceedings, representations from impacted businesses have been received. Notably, correspondence from the Huddersfield Retailers’ Association emphasises the cumulative impact of repeated shop thefts on local traders, particularly in the wake of supply chain disruptions linked to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent inflation. These businesses report rising security costs, increased insurance premiums, and adverse effects on employee wellbeing. Support letters were also submitted by the Retail Staff Welfare Board, a charitable entity dedicated to providing counselling and practical assistance to retail workers experiencing stress and trauma due to retail crime exposure. Their advocacy underscores the psychological toll even non-violent offences can impose on frontline workers. It is clear that while this offending may appear minor in individual episodes, the aggregate impact resonates well beyond petty financial loss. These submissions were lucidly put forward, demonstrating professional care and measured tone, and have been accorded due weight in the court’s deliberations. Turning to relevant local initiatives, I note with interest the operation of the Kirklees Lost Property Assistance Network — an ad hoc consortium working to mitigate the social consequences of acquisitive crime through diversion and support schemes. Their efforts exemplify community-based approaches to reducing recidivism and enhancing restorative justice outcomes. The challenge, of course, lies in securing sustainable funding streams and robust coordination with statutory bodies, a challenge aggravated by the current fiscal austerity. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. It remains axiomatic that the essential ingredients of theft require proof of dishonesty, appropriation, and intent to permanently deprive, as codified in the Theft Act 1968. Sentencing falls within the guidance elaborated by the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (October 2019), which categorises offences by value, frequency, sophistication, and harm occasioned whether physical or psychological. This court is mindful of the multiple appellate authorities which have elaborated on the sentencing principles applicable to sustained courses of dishonesty. Among these cases, R v Barnes [2023] EWCA Crim 1918 is germane, where the Court of Appeal reiterated the importance of reflecting the cumulative nature of dishonesty in the sentencing outcome, rather than treating each incident in isolation. Similarly, the rulings in R v Kutler [2022] EWCA Crim 2345 and R v Bellamy [2021] EWCA Crim 1584 caution against mechanical application of guidelines in favour of tailored assessment considering all contextual variables. Consideration must be given to the balance of punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation, with the paramount objective of public protection. Theft offences may carry custodial sentences where persistence, planning, or aggravating features undermine the justification for community disposal. The specific facts and offender profile will be determinative. I further pause to deliberate upon the guidance laid down in R v Munro [2025] EWCA Crim 320, a decision concerning the imposition of custodial sentences where there is an underlying mental health condition. The appellant had challenged his sentence on the ground that psychiatric vulnerabilities merited a non-custodial alternative. The Court held that while psychiatric mitigation may influence sentence length or disposal type, such factors do not negate the need for sentences commensurate with the seriousness of offending, particularly where public safety is implicated. Notably, R v Glynn [2024] EWCA Crim 1909 considered the sentencing ramifications where multiple unrelated offences were consolidated into a single proceeding. The Court emphasised that each offence should be assessed on its merits, and the global sentence must properly reflect aggregate culpability. Within the context of these case authorities, it is incumbent upon the court to exercise robust judgment when calibrating sentence type and length in shoplifting cases, especially those indicative of entrenched offending behaviour. Mr H placed protein powder and razor blade refills in his niece’s pushchair in an attempt to hide them. The present case has attracted significant attention to the issue of your mental health and associated support needs. Defence counsel arranged for a comprehensive psychiatric assessment from Dr Fiona Albertson, a consultant forensic psychiatrist appointed under instruction for this proceeding. Dr Albertson’s report, delivered on 31 August 2026, considered the presence or absence of any diagnosable mental health conditions, potential cognitive or emotional vulnerabilities, and the risk of reoffending. Dr Albertson concluded that, although you do not meet the criteria for severe mental illness, there is evidence of impulsive behaviour, low mood, and probable mild substance misuse impacting judgment. Importantly, she noted inconsistent engagement with prior mental health services and limited contact with support agencies. There is a suggestion of financial stress exacerbating your circumstances, though no indication, in her opinion, of enduring psychiatric pathology that would obviate criminal responsibility or warrant hospitalisation rather than judicial sanction. I must express, however, the court’s considerable concern that despite the availability of these services, your uptake has been sporadic at best. The National Health Service’s adult community mental health teams in Kirklees have long reported chronic underfunding and lengthy waiting lists. Nonetheless, this cannot excuse neglect of referral opportunities nurtured by social care providers and voluntary sector initiatives. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. The probity of psychological intervention remains an important element of any sentence designed to reduce risk. The Probation Service is instructed to assess your suitability for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) or similar programmes focused on impulse control and decision-making. It must be stressed that such rehabilitative interventions are contingent on your cooperation and compliance in the community. Previous criminal justice reports indicate a degree of ambivalence towards engagement with services, a factor which weighs against disposals reliant on community-based supervision. This pattern, well-documented in the Probation Service’s presentence reports, suggests a medium to high risk of breach or non-compliance. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. It is of procedural and historical interest that your present case comes at a time marked by increasing digital transformation within the courts, including the implementation of electronic evidence presentation and live streaming of hearings. The Huddersfield Crown Court recently invested significantly in updating courtroom technology to support these innovations, a transition not without its growing pains. Technical failures, variable internet connectivity, and the need for staff retraining have occasioned occasional delays and operational inefficiencies. Alongside this, the court records a recent policy initiative aimed at reducing the backlog of cases relating to shoplifting and retail theft, prompted by a nationwide rise in acquisitive crime since the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in 2023. This strategy involves more proactive liaison between police, retailers, and the judiciary, and promotes early intervention to avoid acute escalation. Such initiatives are laudable but also expose tensions inherent in deploying scarce justice resources across a spectrum of offences. There are, for example, reports from other regions of prolonged delays due to judicial strikes and staffing shortages among court clerks and ushers. The Huddersfield sitting has not been immune to such pressures, although these did not materially impact your case listing. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. It is also germane to note that your case proceeded without controversy concerning evidential admissibility; no substantial legal challenges to the integrity of CCTV footage or the voluntariness of your interviews arose. This absence of evidentiary dispute permitted a relatively orderly procession through the docket. Your legal representation, led by Mr Simon Fairclough of Chambers, has conducted a measured and professional defence under challenging conditions. Mr Fairclough secured extensions for expert reporting and advocated for alternative disposals on your behalf, underscoring the importance of non-custodial sentencing where appropriate. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. The court is also mindful of the broader challenges faced by social services and community organisations in supporting individuals who enter the criminal justice system because of acquisitive crime. Housing insecurity, substance misuse, and mental health difficulties often coalesce, compounding complexity. Charitable organisations such as the West Yorkshire Homelessness Alliance and the Retail Workers Support Network must manage burgeoning demand within sharply constrained budgets, frequently contending with government funding cuts and fluctuating public contributions. Economic precarity exacerbates the risk of offending, but it does so alongside systemic barriers to meaningful recovery. The tension between acknowledging social determinants of crime and upholding individual responsibility is palpable and persists as a defining dilemma for all actors in the justice system. Victim impact statements submitted by several independent store proprietors corroborate that the cumulative effect of the thefts has been deleterious—manifesting in heightened anxiety among frontline staff, increased security measures imposing financial burden, and diminished community trust. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. This case also illustrates the layered challenges experienced within the Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), tasked with overseeing coordination between police, retailers, council officials, and voluntary sector agencies in responding to persistent small-scale offending. The efficacy of such partnerships, while promising in design, is contingent on adequate resourcing and sustained staff commitment. Correspondence from the BCRP dated 10 July 2026 commends the assistance of local businesses and the police while lamenting limitations posed by data-sharing restrictions and staffing shortfalls. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. As we approach the sentencing phase, the court must weigh a multiplicity of factors. On the one hand, the demonstrated persistence and planning evince culpability warranting meaningful consequences. On the other, the absence of violence, lack of aggravating physical harm, and your current personal circumstances counsel thoughtful application of available disposals. Sentencing guidelines provide for a range of options from community orders incorporating rehabilitative requirements, unpaid work, and curfews, to immediate custodial sentences with appropriate credit for guilty plea. Your late plea, entered only after the prosecution’s evidential case had solidified, will inevitably attract reduced mitigation. The Probation Service has been instructed to prepare a full pre-sentence report examining your risk of reoffending, the nature and extent of support required, and the viability of community supervision. The report is to consider possible interventions addressing impulsivity, financial management, and mental health engagement. I remind all parties that the overarching sentencing objectives remain the protection of the public, the reduction of reoffending risk, and the demonstration of proportionality and fairness. While the court’s jurisdiction encompasses custodial authority where warranted, the preference—where consistent with public safety—is for measures designed to facilitate rehabilitation and social reintegration. It is important to recall that statutory instruments such as the Sentencing Act 2020 and the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 empower courts with discretion to tailor sentences to individuals’ needs while maintaining deterrence. In so doing, the court recognises that the durability of compliance with conditions is central to the success of non-custodial sentences. Reported past difficulties engaging with supervision weigh on the calculus, but do not exclude opportunity. Today's proceedings have been conducted in full public view and with appropriate representation. I thank Ms Elaine Prescott, who appears on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Simon Fairclough, who represents the defendant pursuant to a Legal Aid Order. The court regrets ongoing challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency, particularly their sluggish response times in approving funds for expert reports and ancillary applications. Such bureaucratic inertia, as observed by the judiciary in recent Practice Directions, hampers timely case progression and adds strain to all involved. In the absence of contrary evidence, and subject to further reports, I shall reserve sentence until receipt of the pre-sentence report, particularly to allow inclusion of the probation officer’s considered recommendations. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2026, in Court 5 at Huddersfield Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply to this matter. Costs are reserved pending sentencing outcome.
