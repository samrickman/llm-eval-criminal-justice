MR H Case No. T2025/14367 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. Rathbone Filed: 14 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in respect of multiple counts of theft by shoplifting, a course of conduct spanning from early 2023 until May 2025. The offending took place across various retail premises predominantly within Leicester and the greater East Midlands area. The charges brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 represent a pattern of deliberate, opportunistic, and repeated violations of the law affecting shopkeepers, their staff, and ultimately the local business community. Procedural Background You were arrested on 16 May 2025 following an extensive police operation led by the Leicestershire Police Economic Crime Unit, in conjunction with partnerships established under the Leicester Retail Crime Reduction Initiative (LRCRI). This multi-agency collaboration, which includes local authorities, retailers’ representatives, and the Safer Leicester Partnership, was triggered by a discernible increase in retail theft incidents during late 2024 and early 2025. The investigative phase involved significant manual collation and analysis of CCTV footage, witness accounts, and stock inventory discrepancies across numerous retail sites. The court wishes to acknowledge the lengthy and complex nature of investigations into acquisitive crime, which often represent a disproportionate burden in terms of officer hours and administrative oversight relative to the monetary value of offences committed. It must be understood that while these thefts may appear minor individually, their aggregate impact on small businesses and their workforces is far from negligible. The constraint of public resources continues to place pressure on neighbourhood policing teams, who are increasingly engaged with a diverse array of issues, ranging from cyber-enabled fraud to community safeguarding concerns. Such competing priorities bring their own challenges. It is unfortunate but necessary to record that this matter encountered several procedural delays common in cases of this nature. Firstly, the initial Legal Aid application for defence representation was delayed due to documentation issues, resulting in postponement of the first formal hearing from June to late July 2025. Furthermore, attempts to secure authorisation for expert assessment of the defendant’s psychological state—originally requested in early August—were incompletely processed, resulting in further adjournment of the sentencing hearing. These administrative obstacles, though regrettable, are all too familiar to practitioners and courts alike. They speak to ongoing systemic issues within legal aid provision that merit urgent attention. The first appearance took place on 29 July 2025, at which point you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequent evidence disclosure and further forensic checks led to a change of plea, and a guilty plea was entered on 7 September 2025, mere weeks before the scheduled trial date. The timing of your plea will be a relevant consideration in sentencing, especially given the costs incurred and inconvenience to victims and witnesses. It is worth noting that the sentencing guidelines set forth by the Sentencing Council make explicit reference to the importance of the timing of guilty pleas, with earlier admissions attracting more substantial reductions in sentence length. The courts rely on this principle to incentivise prompt acceptance of responsibility and to minimise the impact on all participants in the criminal justice process. On the question of evidence, I wish to thank the prosecution and defence counsel, Ms Lydia Fairclough and Mr David Berry, respectively, for their professional conduct. It is regrettable that the Legal Aid Agency’s delays hampered the timely progression of this case, reflecting an administrative inertia which undermines the efficient administration of justice. The court also acknowledges the written submissions received from the Leicester Business Improvement Group, which highlighted the broader impact of acquisitive crime on the local ecology of commerce, including reduced staffing hours, increased security expenditure, and the erosion of community trust. Citation of Case Law and Legal Framework In approaching sentencing, the court is mindful of the established legal framework, notably the Theft Act 1968, and the more recent sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council in 2020. The guidelines emphasise factors including the value of goods stolen, the method of theft, previous convictions, and the impact on victims and the community. Case law remains instructive. In R v. Dundas [2019] EWCA Crim 2347, the Court reiterated that repeated patterns of shoplifting, even where individual offences are low in value, warrant custodial sentences when prior interventions and warnings have been disregarded. The principle articulated is one of proportionality, ensuring that sentence reflects both individual culpability and broader deterrent effect. Similarly, R v. Fennell [2022] EWCA Crim 1569, concerned a defendant guilty of opportunistic theft targeting community shops, whose offending was aggravated by recidivism and disregard for diversionary measures. The court upheld a term of immediate custody, while noting that community orders with tailored rehabilitation may be appropriate in carefully selected cases. It is also imperative to touch upon R v. Stonehouse [2018] EWCA Crim 1092 which elucidated the limited scope for mitigation on the basis of personal hardship when repeated offending persists despite interventions and available support services. The judgment made clear that while understanding of underlying social factors is necessary, it cannot be allowed to overshadow responsibility and public protection concerns. It is relevant, though not determinative, that this case falls within the jurisdiction of the Leicester Crown Court, a centre with a proud history dating back to its founding in the early twentieth century, dedicated to balancing just outcomes with the demands of a diverse and evolving regional population. The process of Better Case Management (BCM), now well embedded in this jurisdiction, was adhered to in the case of Mr H, contributing to the orderly progression of pre-trial hearings despite the aforementioned delays. Observations on Public Services and Procedural Realities The court notes the rising demands placed on probation and mental health services in this area, as recently reported in the Leicester Justice and Welfare Quarterly Bulletin (Q2 2025). Caseloads have increased sharply due to a complex interaction of factors including population growth, economic instability, and pandemic recovery. The consequent delays in arranging assessments or interventions are regrettable but currently unavoidable. Further, the NHS Leicester Trust has publicly flagged concerns over extended waiting times for adult mental health services, with average intake delays exceeding 14 weeks. Though Mr H’s case does not principally raise mental health concerns, these service pressures form part of the wider context within which community supervision and rehabilitation must be understood. It is worth acknowledging the exemplary efforts of local voluntary organisations such as the Leicester Citizens Advice Bureau and the Midlands Homelessness Outreach Project, whose input into community reintegration initiatives is notable. The court is mindful, however, that despite the availability of various support frameworks, the defendant’s engagement with these resources has been sporadic and incomplete, a point to which I shall return. In respect of the police investigation, I commend the meticulous work of the Economic Crime Unit analysts, who employed cross-referencing techniques combining public transport CCTV, retail security feeds, and bank card fraud alerts to track the pattern of offending. This level of coordination, demanding significant analytical hours and interdepartmental liaison, underscores the resource intensity of prosecuting serial shoplifting cases. The defendant’s prior criminal record has been considered. While previous offences detailed in the record include theft-related matters, none involve burglary, violence, or organised criminal activity. This absence of escalation is relevant. Nevertheless, the repetition of theft by shoplifting cannot be discounted. It is pertinent to mention that one co-defendant, during a related but separate matter involving an incident of criminal damage to a neighbouring store, is currently at large following breaches of bail conditions. That fact, while only tangentially connected, serves to illustrate the broader challenges faced by law enforcement in this domain. In turn, the court appreciates the patience and professionalism of store employees who have provided statements and impact evidence. Their candour about the emotional toll of persistent theft, heightened anxiety, and the erosion of workplace morale contributes meaningfully to the sentencing assessment. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. The defendant has submitted a letter to this court expressing remorse, albeit acknowledging difficulties in breaking free from a cycle of offending exacerbated by unstable housing and intermittent unemployment. While personal circumstances undoubtedly shape behavioural patterns, such factors do not preclude accountability. It is relevant to reflect on the findings presented in the psychiatric report prepared by Dr. Helen Ashcroft, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, following examination and interview with the defendant. Dr. Ashcroft’s comprehensive account, dated 28 August 2025, concludes that while Mr H does not meet criteria for a major psychiatric disorder, features consistent with low mood, impulsivity, and moderate alcohol misuse were observed. The report recommends consideration of cognitive-behavioural therapy focusing on impulse control and coping strategies, and notes prior non-engagement with community mental health resources. The report also highlights that Mr H exhibits limited insight into the implications of his offending, compounded by a network of unstable social relationships. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. Environmental factors are not to be discounted. The defendant’s accommodation history includes spells in temporary hostels and a recent short-term tenancy in a private letting subject to a noise abatement notice for disturbances unrelated to Mr H himself. Such instability may contribute to challenges in rehabilitation and engagement. In past months, Mr H has declined offers from local addiction support groups and budgeting advice clinics, despite repeated invitations. The court is aware that these programmes, often delivered through stretched community resources, rely heavily on participant motivation and compliance. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. I wish to add that while mental health services and support provision represent an essential component of offender management, they are no substitute for the imposition of sentences that meet the overarching aims of sentencing: punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public. Mr H was found to have used a magnet to bypass a security tag, with the device recovered at the time of arrest. Within the context of public safety, the court has considered whether the offending pattern reflects an escalation in seriousness or if it presents a contained risk profile. The absence of violence, threat, or exploitation mitigates somewhat against the prospect of an extended custodial sentence. Nonetheless, the sustained and repeated nature of the thefts, and the resultant impact on small business operators and staff, are indicators of elevated culpability. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. Furthermore, notwithstanding earlier community resolutions and conditional discharges, the defendant has demonstrated a pattern of recidivism requiring a firmer judicial response. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Discussions with the probation service have indicated current capacity challenges, with over 25% of Leicester probation officers holding caseloads above the nationally recommended threshold. Arranging interventions such as cognitive skills programmes or unpaid work requirements is consequently subject to delay and prioritisation. This systemic strain inevitably influences the expediency and effectiveness of community sentences. The court records these matters not by way of excuse, but as part of the practical framework in which sentencing outcomes must operate. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. The Sentencing Council’s Theft guideline underpins the approach to cases such as these. It directs the court to consider, among other factors, the value stolen, persistence, sophistication, harm caused, and previous convictions. Community orders remain a potentially viable disposal where there exists a realistic prospect of engagement and compliance. That prospect requires careful examination through a pre-sentence report and consultation with supervising officers. This court is acutely aware of the balancing act required when imposing sentence: the need to deter and to demonstrate the unacceptability of persistent shoplifting, against the necessity of fostering rehabilitation and avoiding unnecessary custodial custody. The ever-pressing concern of public confidence in the criminal justice system compels the court to impose sentences that reflect the seriousness of offending, whilst also seeking to divert suitable candidates from custody. The court recalls the relevant guidance contained in the 2023 edition of the Judicial College’s Sentencing Manual, emphasizing that “sentences must not only punish but also facilitate offender rehabilitation, with due regard to public protection.” In an era marked by escalating demands on police and social services, it falls upon the courts to apply the law with proportionate rigour. Having considered the representations of counsel, the defendant’s personal circumstances, the reports submitted, and the legal framework, I shall adjourn sentencing to allow for the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report. This will enable assessment of the defendant’s suitability for community-based rehabilitation programmes, potential engagement with cognitive skills courses, and any supportive interventions addressing substance use and financial instability. These considerations will inform a final sentencing decision consonant with statutory and guideline obligations. The sentencing hearing has been conducted in open court, with all parties present and legal representatives appropriately instructed. The court conveys its thanks to the clerk and ushers for their diligent management of proceedings, and to the court reporter for producing a timely transcript. This court also notes that no reporting restrictions apply pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, the 14th of September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Leicester. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities. The defendant is informed of his right to appeal within 28 days against any sentence imposed, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Costs are reserved.
