MR H Case No. T2025/13457 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. W. DANVERS Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence on a charge of theft by shoplifting, specifically under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The prosecution case relates to a series of incidents involving retail premises within the East Anglia jurisdiction, spanning a period from late 2023 through to March 2025. The indictment is presented as a single representative count but encapsulates conduct said to have encompassed multiple occasions of the unlawful appropriation of goods without payment. Procedural Background The matter was first listed before the magistrates’ court on 2 April 2025, where you pled not guilty. Subsequently, following committal and transfer under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, the case was entered on the Crown Court register. Recognising the workload pressures faced across the regional judiciary, the listing officers managed to secure a plea and trial preparation hearing within the indicative timeframe, a procedural achievement given the ongoing challenges posed by national court strikes and intermittent staffing shortfalls. Such conditions have, as many practitioners will attest, resulted in numerous delays in other jurisdictions but here, at Bury St. Edmunds Crown Court, the parties have endeavoured, with varying degrees of success, to maintain a modicum of timeliness. The BCM framework itself purports to encourage early disclosure, active case progression, and the resolution of issues at the earliest possible stage. This approach has met with mixed results in acquisitive crime cases nationally. Although intended to expedite and streamline processes, the chronic under-resourcing of police witness teams and delays at forensic hubs often frustrate such protocols. Nevertheless, it is commendable that the prosecution and defence engaged proactively—not least in liaising with the relevant Retail Crime Reduction Partnership. It included contributions from local police Safer Neighbourhood Teams and representatives from the Business Crime Reduction Unit, both of whom remain under increasing operational pressure not just from theft offences but from a broader spectrum of neighbourhood concerns. Following initial investigations, you were arrested on 19 March 2025. Legal representation was secured following an application to the Legal Aid Agency, though regrettably, the approval for instructing an independent clinical psychologist was not confirmed until late August after multiple correspondence exchanges. Such delays provided further pause to reflect on the perennial difficulties in reconciling administrative caution with defendant rights in the context of mental health assessments. The court is aware that these procedural bottlenecks undermine the smooth administration of justice and impose unwarranted burdens on both the defence and victims awaiting resolution. These concerns are echoed in recent Parliamentary Committee reports highlighting the Legal Aid system’s strained capacity. A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 4 September 2025. At that hearing, you altered your plea to guilty, acknowledging the overwhelming evidence against you. It is necessary to remind all parties and interested observers that credit for late guilty pleas is not automatically granted at the highest level. The jurisprudence remains clear: as in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, the Court of Appeal emphasised that early, timely pleas serve the interests of efficiency, avoid victim distress, and command genuine mitigating weight. Conversely, pleas entered only after the Crown’s disclosure and the availability of evidential clarity tend to command attenuated discount. Indeed, judicial commentaries across recent years consistently underscore that the timing, sincerity, and context of any plea must be scrutinised diligently. This courtroom reopened earlier this year after substantial refurbishment, incorporating new audio-visual facilities intended to aid witness testimony and the presentation of evidential material. While such improvements are welcome, their installation nevertheless occasioned some disruption to scheduling. Additionally, the unforeseen absence of the court clerk for two sessions earlier this month created further minor delays. Such operational disruptions, while not exculpatory, serve as a reminder of the fragility of court infrastructure in the face of ongoing budgetary pressures. The Crown’s opening submissions commend the engagement of various business owners and their staff, whose witness statements describe not only the economic impact but also the psychological toll wrought by repeat theft incidents. The victim impact statements submitted attest to a diminution of staff morale, increased anxiety about returning to work, and in some cases, calls for additional security measures, such as installation of CCTV and protective screens. These interventions are costly to small business and retail chains alike and required diverting resources away from frontline customer service. Your arrest followed a period of intelligence-led operations encompassing the local constabulary’s shoplifting unit, supported by data analysts from the regional crime command. Using anonymised transport card usage, CCTV from multiple outlets, and authorised mobile phone location pings obtained through judicial warrant, officers developed a profile of your movements consistent with repeated visits to retail premises on Wednesdays and Saturdays. This multi-agency effort combined traditional police work with digital techniques, reflecting modern investigatory sophistication but also imposing notable demands on personnel and budgets. The court is mindful of the opportunity costs inherent in such resource allocation—operatives drawn away from violent crime investigations or safeguarding vulnerable individuals to focus on persistent burglary or theft. While the offences before this court do not carry the immediate spectre of serious harm, the cumulative societal effect is substantial. I turn now to the facts as recorded in the disclosed material and attendant witness evidence. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. It must be acknowledged that many shoplifting incidents in the jurisdiction are dealt with via diversion schemes, community resolutions, or local restorative approaches. In this case, repeated interventions over the last two years from community liaison officers, including offers of access to debt counselling and substance misuse programmes, were declined or only superficially engaged with—an unfortunate pattern that echoes findings from the Probation Service reports concerning your prior convictions. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. While the circumstances do not give rise to any suggestion of organised criminality or gang involvement—as noted in the police intelligence briefing dated 11 February 2025—the repetitive nature of the offending and your apparent disregard for earlier warnings and community resolutions indicate a degree of calculated intent inconsistent with youthful indiscretion. The case law provides helpful context for assessing culpability and sentencing parameters. For instance, the decision in R v. Linley [2018] EWCA Crim 1944, although concerning environmental offences, reiterates principles of proportionate punishment balanced against broader public interest and harm. Although the current case concerns theft from retail premises, the analogy highlights the importance of recognising damage to community resources and local wellbeing as a viable aggravating factor. Similarly, reference may be made to R v. Blackwell [2020] EWCA Crim 1129, where the Court upheld the custody of an offender convicted of aggravated trespass and theft at a community allotment. The decision was grounded as much on the undermining of social cohesion and erosion of safe communal spaces as on the immediate property loss—principles that resonate with the present analysis. It is worth emphasising that the law does not treat shoplifting as a trivial offence, notwithstanding occasional public perceptions to the contrary. The victims—whether individuals, small businesses, or larger retailers—experience real harm. There is also the psychological effect, with reports of some community workers feeling demoralised and unable to maintain safe and welcoming environments. This court is well-versed in the phenomenon often referred to as the ‘silent epidemic’ of retail theft and its contribution to wider societal disorder. On four separate visits within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same small shop and stole alcohol and tobacco products. The methods employed across the course of offending included the use of deception, concealment, and deliberate distraction of staff, consistent with premeditation. This was not an isolated episode of impulsivity. Security footage from multiple locations documents apparent reuse of disguises and recycled tactics, albeit none so elaborate as to suggest criminal sophistication akin to organised networks. Your approach was repetitive rather than innovative, yet sufficiently determined to frustrate employees and inflict repeated losses over time. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. Two letters of support were submitted with your application for adjournment on 1 September 2025. One came from a charity providing low-level mental health support, highlighting your sporadic engagement but noting persistent ambivalence toward longer-term assistance. The other, from a community housing officer, detailed efforts to find permanent accommodation notwithstanding the difficulties posed by your previous tenancy terminations due to non-payment. These documents provide some insight into your social milieu but do not alter the underlying pattern of disengagement from constructive services. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. The psychological evaluation conducted by Dr Amanda Linwood, a consultant clinical psychologist with the Ipswich Community Forensic Mental Health Service, offers an extensive review of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural factors. Dr Linwood concludes that while you do not meet criteria for a major mental disorder such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, or major depressive illness, you exhibit traits associated with impulse control difficulties and chronic alcohol misuse. These findings are consistent with earlier probation reports which identified substance misuse as a potential contributing factor to your offending. The report recommends structured rehabilitative programmes addressing impulse regulation, substance dependency, and cognitive decision-making. However, Dr Linwood also expresses reservations about your current level of engagement and motivation. This is a significant concern given the critical role that active participation plays in the success of community-based interventions. Such observations echo the experience of the social services teams involved, who have reported fluctuating contact and inconsistent attendance at arranged appointments. The strained capacity within local NHS mental health services—including lengthy waiting lists for addiction therapy—exacerbates these difficulties, though they remain no excuse for non-compliance where suitable alternative interventions are available. The probation officer’s pre-sentence report confirms a complex socio-economic background, marked by transient housing, periods of unemployment, and fractured family relationships. While the report correctly refrains from detailing intimate or confidential matters, it underscores risks associated with reoffending, particularly given the history of similar previous offences and unsuccessful community disposals. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. Retail premises affected range from national chains to local independent shops and pharmacies. The consequences of your conduct extend beyond direct monetary loss. For several small businesses, the cost of theft has translated into reduced opening hours, curtailed stock orders, and the imposition of costly security upgrades. For staff, especially those working alone or late shifts, there is reported justifiable anxiety about personal safety and future encounters. Local business associations have written collectively to this court, registering concerns about repeat offences affecting the broader commercial hub. Their correspondence, while not formal victim personal statements, is nonetheless a relevant contextual factor in gauging public and economic harm. Lost revenue, negative customer perceptions, and the psychological burden borne by shop staff are elements courts increasingly consider when determining appropriate sentencing. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. The Crown prudently notes, and the court agrees, that the matter must be approached proportionately. The losses fall within the lower-value spectrum typical of shop theft, albeit aggregated over an extended period and multiple sites. Your personal culpability is significant, but there is no evidence of violence, threats, or coercion in relation to the offending. No weapon or means of intimidation was involved, nor were there indications of territorial or gang-related behaviour. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. The applicable sentencing guidelines for theft embrace a wide discretionary range, calibrated according to the categorisation of the offence, the degree of planning, harm suffered, and culpability. Paragraphs 1.2 to 1.7 of the Theft offences guideline as published by the Sentencing Council provide the foundation. The mitigating factors in your case include your eventual guilty plea, albeit entered late in the proceedings. Consistent with authority in R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145, the court must moderate any credit, reflective of the timing of the plea and its effect on judicial economy. Your history of prior convictions, particularly for similar theft-related offending, weighs heavily as an aggravating factor. Your prior opportunity for rehabilitation and diversionary support, which you declined or disengaged from, further diminishes the prospect of leniency. Past conditional discharges and community reprimands have failed to deter, thus challenging the proposition that a purely community-based sanction will suffice. The court has also considered the pressures faced by the Probation Service, including understaffing and high caseload volumes, which constrain the availability of bespoke intervention schemes. Despite this, it remains essential that any sentence promotes rehabilitation where possible and contributes to safeguarding the public. While custody is not inevitable, the court must be satisfied that public protection, deterrence, and denunciation are adequately achieved. Custodial sentences for repeat shoplifting offences are well-established in the jurisprudence, particularly where offending has spanned long durations or caused disproportionate harm to vulnerable businesses and communities. The late guilty plea, expressed remorse during allocution, and the supportive representations from local charities are all relevant. Indeed, the latter signify that there remain avenues to engage with support networks post-sentence. Nevertheless, those considerations operate alongside factors pointing towards the necessity for a firm sentence to mark the gravity of repeated breaches of trust and civic responsibility. At this juncture, the court is unable to determine the precise sentence without the benefit of the full pre-sentence report. That report is essential to illuminate further details concerning your personal circumstances, risk assessment, institutional engagement, and practical options for rehabilitation. It will also outline potential sentencing permutations, including community orders incorporating unpaid work, rehabilitation activity requirements, and cognitive behavioural programmes. The probation service is accordingly directed to produce a comprehensive pre-sentence report at the earliest opportunity. Until receipt and consideration of that document, it would be premature to set down a final sentence.
