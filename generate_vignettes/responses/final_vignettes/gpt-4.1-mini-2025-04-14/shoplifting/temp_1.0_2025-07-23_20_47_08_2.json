MR H Case No. B2025/06423 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. G. Whitbourne Filed: 10 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence in relation to a charge of theft by shoplifting, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans multiple incidents occurring over the course of eighteen months, primarily within premises throughout the Bristol metropolitan area, involving a number of independently owned retailers. This charge represents a consolidation of multiple events, selected for procedural efficiency and to represent a pattern of conduct rather than isolated infractions. To proceed appropriately with sentencing it is necessary first — as is customary — to outline the procedural history of the matter before the court. Your initial appearance was on 23 April 2025 at Bristol Magistrates’ Court, at which point you were formally charged and remanded on conditional bail. Your legal representation was arranged through the Legal Aid Agency, with Mr Julian Bowers of Bower & Associates appointed as your defence solicitor. Considerable delay was occasioned, regrettably, by the repeated postponement of funding for an independent psychological assessment — a delay which this court must note with concern, given the adverse effect this had on the timely progression of the case. The administrative history is not without interest in its own right. Attempts to secure a psychiatric report via Legal Aid were submitted initially on 2 May 2025, but not authorised until 18 July 2025, following multiple chaser letters and direct judicial intervention. This delay is symptomatic of wider systemic difficulties within the Legal Aid system, which have been acknowledged across numerous court reports. The inefficiency observed here raises serious questions about the burden imposed on defendants and their counsel alike. Though this court understands and appreciates the constraints under which Legal Aid operates, it must nonetheless register its dissatisfaction with the cost of justice being paid—ultimately—by the parties themselves in needless procedural prolongation. It may be worth observing, parenthetically, that such delays invariably cause knock-on effects on court listing schedules. The court calendar at Bristol Crown Court has been subject to some strain in recent months, with a marked increase in adjournments due to staff shortages, industrial action within the Probation Service, and, more recently, the logistical challenges presented by the rollout of new digital case management systems. These systemic factors, while beyond the immediate control of this jurisdiction, do impact upon the overall administration of justice and the experience of all participants before the court. You pleaded guilty at the earliest realistic opportunity, specifically at the plea and trial preparation hearing conducted on 4 August 2025. While this plea is welcomed in law and represents the proper course, the timing unfortunately did not permit what would be termed a “full discount” for an early guilty plea, given the substantial evidence presented at that hearing which rendered contest untenable. The courts have consistently maintained, including in recent authoritative cases such as R v. Harlowe [2023] EWCA Crim 1356, that the credit given for a plea must be mindful not simply of the act of pleading, but also its timing in the context of the preparatory process and genuine acceptance of responsibility. In considering sentencing, it is essential to place the matter against the wider statutory and jurisprudential framework. The Theft Act 1968, section 1, remains the foundational legal instrument governing offences of this nature. The offence involves dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving. Shoplifting per se may often be dealt with summarily or by out-of-court disposals, but persistent or organised offending, particularly where victim impact is demonstrable, justifies elevation to Crown Court jurisdiction. Recalling the judgments of the Court of Appeal, referenced above, and applying the sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council for theft offences, the court must weigh aggravating factors such as your record of prior shoplifting convictions, the planning evidenced in the commission of offences, and the psychological impact upon victims and staff. The guidelines, while not prescriptive in this instance given the extended period over which offences occurred, cautions against overly lenient outcomes where offending reflects premeditation and ongoing disregard for retail property and associated employees. A review of your prior record makes it clear that this is not your first encounter with the criminal justice system for similar conduct. You have three recorded previous convictions for shoplifting, the most recent being dated October 2023, for which you received a conditional discharge. Despite receiving warnings and participating in diversion schemes, including a community resolution with restitution components, the evidence demonstrates repetition and escalation. The facts of the case are as follows: Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. These offences were detected and investigated through cooperation between retail security personnel and officers of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary. The multi-agency investigation encompassed review of extensive CCTV footage, deployment of discrete observational patrols, and forensic examination of clothing retrieved at your arrest. The investigation was resource-intensive, requiring coordination among local policing units and the retail business crime reduction team, whose efforts in collating incident reports and coordinating witness statements are commendable. Preliminary enquiries established that your pattern of offending exhibited a degree of sophistication. For example, careful use of timing to coincide with shift changes and avoidance of direct confrontation with staff reduced immediate detection. In terms of losses, the items taken were frequently high-value over-the-counter goods such as personal care products and packaged food items, collectively amounting to a significant cumulative financial impact on small business operators and local shops serving vulnerable communities. The systemic implications of such acquisitive offending cannot be overstated. Shoplifting may, at face value, seem relatively minor in the scheme of criminality, but the cumulative effect on retailers is considerable. It leads to increased insurance premiums, requirement for heightened security measures, and, at times, reduced availability of products to consumers. Staff working in these environments experience heightened stress, sometimes resulting in altered shift patterns or even absences due to workplace anxiety. This in turn magnifies operational strain and ultimately affects community access to essential services. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. It is not without relevance that these offences occurred contemporaneously with a period of significant economic hardship in Bristol, as a consequence of ongoing national and local cost of living pressures. The court is aware of the increased demands on charitable organisations and food banks across the city, many of which have seen rising attendance numbers this year. Yet it is imperative to reiterate that economic difficulty does not remove culpability nor operates as a licence to offend. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. In terms of your personal circumstances, a detailed psychiatric report was prepared by Dr Selina Harding, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, who conducted a series of interviews and applied standardised assessment protocols. The report — dated 22 August 2025 — concluded that you do not suffer from any major mental illness but noted significant difficulties linked to impulsivity and poor decision-making skills, compounded by low mood and intermittent substance misuse. Dr Harding observed that your engagement with services has been inconsistent and that this lack of compliance reduces the prospects for effective intervention. She recommended structured cognitive behavioural therapy targeting impulse control and suggested potential benefit from integration into substance misuse programmes. Given the limited current healthcare resources and escalating waiting times for NHS mental health services, particularly for psychological therapies, such recommendations pose practical challenges to timely delivery. It is worth noting that probation services in the Bristol area have reported a marked increase in caseloads related to low-level acquisitive offending over the past two years. Staffing shortages compounded by ongoing industrial disputes within operational units have placed considerable pressure on case managers, leading to documented delays in supervision, risk assessment, and delivery of rehabilitative sessions. These constraints inform the court’s cautious approach in setting sentence and in seeking an appropriate balance between punitive and rehabilitative objectives. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. Multi-agency correspondence filed on 1 September 2025 reveals communication between Avon and Somerset Community Safety Partnership, the Bristol Retail Alliance, and your local statutory housing provider, reflecting efforts to co-ordinate housing stability alongside offence-related interventions. Notably, these agencies highlighted your current tenancy as “fragile” due to repeated complaints of nuisance, though there is no direct evidence of anti-social behaviour linked to you beyond your offending conduct. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. The court has considered the victim impact statements tendered by several shop proprietors and managers. These documents describe psychological distress caused not only by the actual loss but also by the violation of the working environment. One proprietor, operating a small family business for over 30 years, reported increased expenses on security and even the need to employ additional staff during peak hours to mitigate risk. Another described the sense of betrayal felt by employees who regarded your conduct as representing a breach of community trust. Reliance on case law is necessary to frame the legal approach. The Court of Appeal has emphasised, in R v. Amjiesh [2024] EWCA Crim 560, that theft offences demand sentences that reflect the cumulative impact on victims and public confidence, particularly where repeated conduct demonstrates disregard for previous interventions. Although the facts of Amjiesh differed, involving organised retail crime, the principles of proportionality and deterrence remain instructive. Likewise, in R v. Cresswell [2019] EWCA Crim 1071, the court considered the issue of late pleas in repeated theft offences. It was affirmed that where a defendant contests the matter until the doorstep of trial, a calibrated reduction of credit is appropriate. These principles echo the statutory sentencing framework and are not to be lightly departed from. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. There is a further observation to be made, if I may, regarding the social context of acquisitive crime. The court is mindful of evidence pointing to a growing phenomenon of what some criminologists have termed “survival theft,” where individuals commit offences for subsistence rather than material gain or criminal enterprise. While such distinctions are not determinative here, they nonetheless form part of the wider tapestry that judges must acknowledge. However, survival instincts do not absolve responsibility, and the courts cannot sanction criminal behaviour that undermines social cohesion under any pretext. Public tolerance of such offending is limited, and the law’s response must reflect both individual culpability and communal protection. In the court’s view, the aggregate impact of your offending, taken with your prior convictions, lack of meaningful engagement with support services, and the repeated nature of the conduct, mark this as a case warranting a firm but fair response. The balance between punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection must command careful consideration. There is no suggestion of gang involvement or external coercion in your case. Nor has any issue of mental incapacity been found sufficient to diminish responsibility. The court further notes that the offences did not involve violence or threat to person; nonetheless, the emotional and operational harm caused to victims and communities is real. I must, therefore, order that a pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith, to explore the suitability for community-based rehabilitation programmes, including cognitive skills training and substance misuse intervention, coupled with robust supervision and, if compliance cannot be assured, the possibility of custodial measures. At this stage, I reserve the final sentencing decision pending receipt of the report and any further submissions from counsel. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 10 September 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentencing record will be transmitted to all relevant agencies. You are reminded of your right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.
