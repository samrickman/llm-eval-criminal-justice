MR H Case No. B2025/17509 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. D. HAMPTON Filed: 12 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence upon a charge relating to theft, specifically multiple counts of shoplifting committed over an extended period within the Birmingham metropolitan area. The conduct to which you have pleaded guilty falls within the ambit of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, involving the dishonest appropriation of goods from retail premises with the intent to permanently deprive. The offending stretches from the summer of 2023 until early 2025, reflecting a protracted course of conduct and a pattern of offending that merits careful consideration. Procedural Background The proceedings in this matter have been subject to a number of interlocutory steps and adjournments, not atypical in cases of this nature but nonetheless producing inevitable delay and inconvenience. You were initially arrested on 15 March 2025, after a detailed investigation undertaken by the West Midlands Police Retail Crime Unit, in conjunction with the Birmingham Business Crime Partnership. This multi-agency collaboration, aimed at tackling persistent acquisitive offending across commercial premises, has become emblematic of the contemporary prosecutorial approach to such matters. The investigation entailed the collation and review of extensive CCTV footage, witness statements from retail staff, and the analysis of stock loss reports over the relevant period. It has long been observed within the judiciary that the challenge of prosecuting low-value theft offences lies not merely in evidential assembly but in navigating the broader societal context in which such behaviour occurs. The resources expended on investigations, the impact upon retail staff morale, and the knock-on consequences for local economies deserve acknowledgment, even as the offences themselves may appear minor in isolation. The court notes that this case benefited from a relatively smooth progression through the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, notwithstanding a regrettable delay occasioned by a protracted Legal Aid funding application relating to expert psychiatric assessment. Indeed, the Legal Aid Agency in this matter demonstrated a regrettably familiar recalcitrance. The application, submitted in early May 2025, underwent multiple requests for clarification before eventual approval was granted only in late July, causing a postponement in the preparation of your defence and the timely provision of requisite reports. Such administrative inefficiencies have become an unfortunate average rather than an exception and impose strain not only on defendants and their representatives but also on the courts and prosecutors striving to provide expedient justice. I am grateful to the prosecution advocate, Ms Jennifer Lomas, and to your counsel, Mr Peter Carver, both of whom have conducted themselves with professionalism throughout these proceedings. I must, however, reiterate judicial concern about systemic delays that undermine both the speedy administration and the perceived legitimacy of the justice system. In adopting this view, it is timely to reflect on the evolving jurisprudence relating to guilty pleas. The court acknowledges the general principle that early admission of guilt merits significant credit, recognising the benefit not only to the public purse but also to victims and witnesses spared the distress of contested hearings. This position is well supported by case precedent, including the ruling in R v. Westly [2020] EWCA Crim 251, which emphasises that such credit is a matter of judicial discretion contingent upon the timing and sincerity of the plea. It is prudential to note that late pleas, though entitled to some concession, attract significantly reduced mitigation where entered only in the face of overwhelming evidence. Against this backdrop, your plea, entered just prior to the trial window opening, earns modest credit commensurate with these principles. The Theft Act 1968 has undergone little substantive amendment with respect to standard shoplifting offences, but sentencing practice, guidelines, and court approaches have evolved considerably. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences underscores the significance of the offence’s circumstances, offender culpability, and the wider impact on victims, including economic loss, emotional harm, and consequential disruption. Aggravating factors include repeated offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, or exploitation of circumstance. Mitigating factors may include genuine remorse, early plea, personal circumstances such as mental health difficulties, or demonstrable steps towards rehabilitation. I also take note of relevant appellate authorities including R v. Draper [2023] EWCA Crim 577, where the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant convicted of multiple counts of shoplifting involving distraction offences at supermarket tills. The sentencing judge’s comments on the need to send a deterrent message to curtail similar offending were endorsed notwithstanding the modest overall end value of the items stolen. It is the function of this court to weigh these factors against the impact of your conduct and the interests of justice generally. This case is further contextualised by observations drawn from the broader criminal justice environment. The West Midlands region continues to experience significant pressure on policing resources, particularly in relation to acquisitive crime. The well-documented rise in street homelessness, noted in recent reports by Housing First Midlands, further compounds these challenges, as individuals experiencing unstable housing often become entangled with the criminal justice system through low-level offences. While the court expresses no direct finding on your personal housing status at this juncture, it recognises that social marginalisation remains a backdrop to many such cases. As an aside, the court is aware of an unrelated ongoing investigation concerning your estranged cousin, currently before the Birmingham Magistrates' Court, on charges of benefit fraud. That matter is distinct and bears no influence on your sentencing here. The facts of the case may be outlined as follows: Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. The investigation unearthed a consistent modus operandi involving entering stores during peak hours, often coinciding with staff shift changes. Your use of concealment methods, including bags and clothing layering, was deliberate and practiced. On four separate visits within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same small shop and stole alcohol and tobacco products. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. Moreover, the evidence demonstrated a disregard for warnings issued by shop security personnel and several community resolutions offered in earlier incidents, which you failed to comply with or learn from. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. The court has before it several victim personal statements from retail staff employed at various affected premises. Their accounts speak of a sustained atmosphere of unease, with some victims requiring time off work due to stress. One manager describes the need to rearrange staffing patterns and invest further in loss prevention measures, thereby diverting resources from customer service to security functions. These consequences, while perhaps unseen by many in the public, are real and detrimental. The cumulative costs—both financial and psychological—are undermined by persistent theft of this nature. The court also received correspondence from the Birmingham Retail Workers’ Union, outlining ongoing concerns about staff safety in the face of repeated shoplifting incidents. While no physical violence was reported in your case, the constant threat contributes to workplace anxiety and decreased morale. An extensive psychiatric report prepared by Dr Helena Strauss, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed upon the request of the defence, merits particular attention. Dr Strauss’s assessment, completed in August 2025, found no evidence of severe mental illness. However, it identifies moderate traits of impulse control disorder and mild alcohol dependence, neither of which meets the threshold for sentencing mitigation but are noted as factors potentially contributing to your behaviour. Dr Strauss’s report states, and I quote: “While there is no diagnosable major psychiatric disorder impinging upon criminal responsibility, the defendant exhibits an underlying difficulty in managing gratification impulses, exacerbated in circumstances of social stress and isolation. Engagement with appropriate interventions, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy aimed at impulse regulation, could be favorable in reducing the likelihood of future offending.” It is important to acknowledge such professional observations, which assist the court in balancing the need for punishment with the prospects for rehabilitation. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. The court pauses to note that the case was briefly delayed due to the exigencies of national strike action affecting court clerks and ancillary staff in late June 2025. While not directly attributable to any party, such interruptions are symptomatic of a wider climate of judicial resource scarcity. Furthermore, this courtroom has recently undergone refurbishment, including improved digital evidence presentation facilities, allowing for more efficient and comprehensible evidence handling—a development welcomed by all participants. The Probation Service, represented by Mr David Kent, has confirmed capacity pressures within offender assessment teams in the West Midlands, with average waiting times for pre-sentence reports now extended to six weeks. This unfortunate reality must be factored into any scheduling and sentencing timelines. Aside from your particular case, this court recalls precedent set in R v. Grayson [2019] EWCA Crim 334, which concerned theft of copper cabling from a rail depot. Though factually dissimilar, the Court of Appeal’s analysis on cumulative impact and community disruption remains pertinent. Turning again to case progression, it is acknowledged that your initial plea of not guilty required a trial listing. However, following further evidence disclosure, your ultimate admission reflects, at least in part, recognition of the inevitability of conviction. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. Sentencing in theft cases must be proportionate and take into account the personal circumstances of the offender, harm caused, culpability, and the public interest. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines articulate a range of starting points and suggest community penalties as appropriate for less serious and isolated incidents. However, repeated offending, especially with a degree of planning and lack of remorse, may justify custodial sentences. The availability and suitability of ancillary orders such as community rehabilitation orders, unpaid work requirements, and accredited cognitive skills programmes will be a focal point of the pre-sentence report. It is also pertinent to consider the potential for restorative justice interventions, which might offer a constructive avenue for victim-offender engagement and reparation. Your previous convictions include theft-related offences, with limited engagement in rehabilitative programming previously. The circumstances of this offending, coupled with your personal and social background, indicate a risk of reoffending absent meaningful intervention. The court remains alert to issues of mental health vulnerability, housing insecurity, and social exclusion, which often intersect in cases of this nature. Nevertheless, the judicial role is to hold individuals accountable within the framework of the law, applying mitigating factors on their true weight but not excusing persistent dishonesty. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. Accordingly, I direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report to explore bespoke sentencing options, the viability of community measures, and any necessary support to address underlying contributory factors. The court hopes that your solicitors will cooperate fully with probation authorities to ensure the timely completion of reports.
