MR H Case No. 2025/18493 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge W. C. BLAKE Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you appear today for sentencing following a conviction arising from a charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, as represented by the Crown, is said to constitute a repeated course of behaviour, targeting retail premises in the Bristol city centre and adjoining districts, over a period extending between late 2023 and early 2025. Procedural History and Case Management You were first arrested on 11 March 2025 by officers from the Greater Bristol Police’s Retail Crime Unit, following an investigation prompted by a series of thefts reported by several small independent retailers in the Redcliffe and Stokes Croft areas. These incidents had been logged over a protracted period—with CCTV footage, customer testimonies, and inventory audits forming a significant part of the evidence matrix. The coordinated response included liaisons between the Greater Bristol Business Crime Forum, local wardens, and the Safer Bristol Partnership, aimed at disrupting a perceived pattern of acquisitive offending adversely affecting small business proprietors. It must be observed that while the legal process is built upon the pillars of fairness and evidential sufficiency, cases such as this place a disproportionate administrative burden on understaffed retail establishments and strain community policing capacities; each instance of shoplifting requires a meticulous compilation of documentation, including but not limited to incident reports, staff witness statements, and security footage verification. Such work is rarely remunerated and often contributes to wider operational stress across agencies tasked with public order maintenance. Following your arrest, a pre-charge detention period elapsed during which officers carried out forensic analysis on recovered merchandise and examined digital evidence including bus travel data for the relevant dates. At interview you initially denied all involvement; however, incriminating evidence, including co-location data obtained via judicially authorised mobile device tracking under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, was tendered. Subsequently, on 3 April 2025, you were formally charged with theft, later consolidated into a representative count for efficiency of trial. Your matter was allocated to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocols implemented for acquisitive offences such as these. The BCM process, widely adopted to expedite procedures and enhance case coordination, calls for early identification of key issues, disclosure sharing, and timely plea decisions. I note for the record that despite some delays occasioned by caseworker shortages within the Legal Aid Agency, which affected the appointment of your instructed solicitor, the case progressed within acceptable temporal parameters. These delays are symptomatic of a wider systemic strain on criminal defence resource provision nationally, with recurring criticism from practitioners and the judiciary alike. The plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 29 May 2025. At that juncture, you maintained a not guilty plea. Following further evidential disclosure, including the admission of additional CCTV material and witness statements from retail staff, you changed your plea to guilty on the morning of what was listed as the trial commencement date, 21 July 2025. The Crown’s application for a Newton hearing was not pursued in light of your admission. A guilty plea, while always commendable, cannot be mechanically rewarded when entered at such a late stage. The Court of Appeal has made clear in numerous authorities—such as R v Garnham [2022] EWCA Crim 1849 and R v Carter [2023] EWCA Crim 2127—that the timing of a plea plays a crucial role in determining the quantum of reduction afforded. Late pleas, made only once the strength of the prosecution case becomes irrefutable, offer limited mitigation by way of sentence discount. In addressing the adequacy of credit available for your plea, I am particularly mindful of the cumulative impact of delayed admissions upon witnesses and the administrative apparatus of justice. The conduct of trials, especially in the context of retail theft, often imposes significant pressures on frontline retail staff who are called upon to give evidence. The distress and inconvenience thereby caused must not be overlooked. Mr H concealed £19 worth of nail polish and beauty accessories in his clothing and exited the premises without payment. It is not lost on this court, either, that your offending forms part of a broader national concern. Retail theft, particularly on a persistent or repeated basis, has increased in prevalence, with the Home Office reporting year-on-year escalation in recorded shoplifting offences. The operational strain on police forces, private security personnel, and court systems is evident and well-documented. Your actions, accordingly, must be seen through this wider prism of societal impact. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. The Theft Act 1968, notably section 1, defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. The Sentencing Council’s guideline issued in 2021 for theft offences provides the authoritative framework by reference to which sentencing discretion must be exercised. The guideline specifies factors such as the value of the goods stolen, the nature of the premises targeted, any planning or sophistication evidenced, and the presence or absence of threats or violence. In the present case, there is no indication that violence or threats were employed. Nonetheless, the cumulative effect of your offending has had a discernible effect on retail businesses—some of which are independently owned legacy enterprises serving vulnerable local populations. The court is mindful also of the psychological impact upon staff who bear the brunt of recurrent theft; behaviour once regarded as exceptional has, regrettably, become an increasingly routine occupational hazard. As set out in the Victim Impact Statements provided by the Bristol Retail Workers’ Support Network, there is a measurable diminution in staff wellbeing, which must be a material consideration. Before turning to relevant case law, it is worth recording the ongoing challenges faced by services involved in offender management. The local Probation Service, under allocation pressures, struggles to provide comprehensive rehabilitative oversight for offenders with low-level acquisitive crime profiles. Reports from regional probation officers affirm that caseloads have increased by 23% over the last year, coinciding with the reorganisation of services and a contraction of community intervention programmes. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. I note the psychiatric report provided by Dr Sweeney, consultant forensic psychologist, whose detailed assessment concluded that you do not suffer from any diagnosable major mental disorder. However, Dr Sweeney observed traits of impulsivity, low self-esteem, and a pattern of avoidance coping potentially underpinned by financial instability and intermittent periods of homelessness. No evidence emerged to suggest a significant cognitive impairment or heightened risk of violence. Positive engagement with community financial assistance schemes and mental health resources was recommended but has, by defence admission, been sporadic at best. In R v Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, cited by the Crown, the court considered the intersection between psychiatric condition and culpability in a case involving arson and serious risk to life. While that case is factually distinct—featuring significant public danger—the principle that clinical intervention does not necessarily preclude custodial sanction is instructive here. Your lack of serious mental illness appropriately situates you outside such considerations, but the report’s findings on vulnerability and impulsivity bear relevance to sentencing and risk management. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. Criminal history is a further and unavoidable consideration. You are now 39 years old, with a record that includes five prior convictions for shoplifting, two of which resulted in community orders. The remediable failure to desist following that intervention was noted in the pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Galen, probation officer, who highlighted your inconsistent compliance with previous statutory requirements, including an unfinished Thinking Skills Programme and disputed attendance at substance misuse support groups. The pre-sentence report also recounted correspondence from Shelter Bristol, a housing referral agency, which detailed your recent periods of couch-surfing and unstable accommodation. The complex interplay of housing precarity, financial hardship, and offending proclivity is recognised as a factor which can exacerbate criminogenic needs. Yet, as Ms Galen stresses, these contextual details provide explanation but not excuse. Indeed, the failure to engage with support services reflects, in her professional judgement, a level of agency inconsistent with the requisite personal responsibility. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. The broader societal context cannot be overlooked. Over recent years, the city of Bristol has witnessed a progressive increase in street homelessness and begging, with associated antisocial conduct becoming a repertoire widely observed within certain localities. The city council’s 2024 annual report on rough sleeping notes particularly acute pressures in the St Paul’s and Easton areas, with resource constraints challenging the provision of intensive case management and rapid rehousing pathways. The criminal justice system, whilst primarily concerned with law enforcement and rehabilitation, must operate within these interconnected social dynamics, recognising both the limits of punitive approaches and the imperative of proportionality. In terms of ancillary legal context, I acknowledge the continuing evolution of criminal procedure in acquisitive crime. The Better Case Management protocol, initiated in 2014 and refined continuously thereafter, seeks to expedite justice by focusing early on evidential issues and promoting efficient trial preparation. Your case followed this protocol, and I note the efficient and prompt disclosure by the Crown, which avoided protracted procedural adjournments. The competent conduct of all practitioners is hereby acknowledged. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. The Sentencing Council guideline places emphasis on harm—both financial and psychological—as well as the offender’s culpability and previous record. Sentencing is graduated, with community orders envisaged for relatively less serious and first-time cases, escalating to immediate custody where persistence, planning, or significant victim harm is evidenced. It bears repeating that credit for the guilty plea is embattled by its late timing. While your admission has saved the court the time and effort of a contested trial, it has not done so at the earliest opportunity. For this reason, the discount applicable must be modest. In shaping an appropriate sentence, I will also consider ancillary orders, including potential requirements for rehabilitation activities, unpaid work components, and possibly a residential restriction where appropriate, though the latter is not commonly applied in shoplifting cases. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. I wish to place on record the court’s thanks to the staff of the Bristol Retail Victim Support Unit, whose measured and persevering work in liaison with affected businesses provided invaluable insight into the human and economic impact of your offending. Their detailed statements convey the toll wrought not only on business margins but on staff welfare and community confidence. It is fitting that this court acknowledge their professionalism as voluntary sector personnel often engaged under conditions of high stress and limited resources. Having considered all the materials, reports, and submissions, the court recognises the complexity of your circumstances: the intersection of social disadvantage, repeated offending, and fluctuating engagement with support services. It does not lessen your responsibility; rather, it explains the challenges inherent in producing sustained desistance. Consistent with practice in such cases, I will order the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report to encompass, where possible, any further progress in engagement with support services, and to explore the suitability of interventions tailored to your identified risks and needs. Such interventions may include cognitive behavioural therapy aimed at impulsivity, financial literacy programmes, and structured community rehabilitation orders, should they be deemed appropriate. I note for the record the professional assistance provided by your legal representatives, in particular Mr Ellis Thornton, counsel of ten years’ standing, whose submissions on your behalf were carefully marshalled and duly noted. I also record the ongoing structural difficulties facing the Legal Aid Agency, with particular reference to the protracted delays in securing funding approvals for psychological assessments in your case. Such systemic inadequacies are a matter of regret for the proper and timely administration of justice. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. It would be remiss not to briefly mention the broader legal landscape in which this case sits. The court has recently been engaged in several matters involving charges of aggravated burglary, serious drug trafficking, and violent assault. While these offences are clearly more serious in nature and impact, the cumulative burden of repeated low-level acquisitive crimes must not be underestimated, nor should they be dismissed as “minor.” Each theft, while relatively small in scale, chips away at the social fabric and the sense of security within households and commercial premises alike. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be filed and transmitted to the necessary agencies for record and enforcement purposes. You are hereby advised of your right to appeal against the sentence within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, section 49, are engaged. No costs are presently ordered.
