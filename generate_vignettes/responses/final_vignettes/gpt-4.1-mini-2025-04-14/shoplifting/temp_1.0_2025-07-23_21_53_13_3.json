MR H Case No. T2025/14893 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. R. TEMPLETON Filed: 21 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today in connection with charges brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, concerning multiple incidents of shoplifting which occurred over an extended period. It is the legal and procedural duty of this court to consider the circumstances of your offences carefully, alongside ancillary factors relevant to sentencing, the impact on victims, and broader public interest. Preliminary Procedural Overview You were first arrested on 15 May 2025 by officers of the Stratford Borough Criminal Investigation Department, in the aftermath of an investigation prompted by a surge in retail thefts reported across several independent grocery and pharmacy outlets. This multi-agency engagement involved coordination between local police, the Stratford Retail Crime Taskforce, and representatives from the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership. It is pertinent to observe the considerable administrative and operational work underpinning such investigations — from forensic examination, collation of CCTV evidence, to the capture and disclosure of witness statements. Notable, too, is the strain placed on investigative resources, which are increasingly stretched as a result of competing priorities such as gang-related violence, organised fraud, and cyber-enabled crime. The investigative phase was characterised by methodical cross-referencing of shop camera footage with incident reports elicited from frontline retail workers, many of whom face pressures not only from rising theft but also from reduced staffing levels and diminished security budgets. This backdrop adds texture to the consideration of the offences before the court, though it neither diminishes nor excuses the conduct found to be proven. It bears emphasis that the substantive charge was preferred on 2 June 2025, following your interview under caution on 29 May 2025. You initially denied involvement but entered a guilty plea at a plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) held on 8 July 2025. This plea, while ultimately accepted, was late in the process, as additional evidence was likely to have been available and could have informed an earlier admission. The court is mindful of the salutary guidance in R v. Darbyshire [2023] EWCA Crim 586, which underscores that credit for a guilty plea is proportionate to its timing and to the extent of cooperation demonstrated. It should be noted that delays in these proceedings ensued, principally owing to the complexity of securing funding from the Legal Aid Agency for a psychiatric evaluation. Applications were initiated on 18 June 2025 but due to procedural inconsistencies and extended administrative back-and-forth, authorisation for expert instruction was not granted until 30 July 2025. Such delays are regrettable but, unfortunately, symptomatic of systemic pressures in the justice system. Such procedural matters weigh heavily not only on courts and practitioners but impact defendants directly — prolonging uncertainty and raising challenges to the principle of timely justice. Cognisance of these factors informs but does not mitigate the fact-finding nor sentencing process. I express my thanks to all parties involved in managing the case progression. In particular, I record appreciation for the effective advocacy of Ms Jana Maguire on behalf of the Crown, and Mr David Kalkman, instructed for your defence under a representation order. Their continued professionalism in an often arduous process merits commendation. I am also indebted to the administrative staff of the Crown Court at Stratford for their careful management of listing arrangements, especially in the face of contemporaneous industrial action affecting interpreters and court clerks. Their perseverance in maintaining order and decorum throughout has ensured proceedings remained accessible and focused on the merits. The court recognises the role of victim liaison officers in communicating with affected businesses and staff. Victim personal statements, while not always forthcoming in these types of offences, have been obtained from two independent retailers whose premises you targeted. These statements illuminate the cumulative stress and operational disruption your actions have caused, notably impacting vulnerable staff and local livelihoods already strained by economic turbulence and post-pandemic recovery challenges. The role of the Stratford Retail Support Organisation must also be mentioned. This group works tirelessly within the voluntary sector to provide advice, emotional support, and practical assistance to small business owners investing in crime prevention measures amid thorny budget constraints. Their correspondence to this court highlighted both the resourcing pressures that leave such businesses fragile and the chilling effect which repeat offences have on staff morale and community confidence. Their stance, while empathetic, does not mitigate the seriousness of your conduct but contextualises the broader social and economic environment within which this offending took place. Theft as proscribed under the Theft Act 1968 has a long-established place within English criminal law. The legislative framework stipulates that “dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive” constitutes the fundamental offence, punishable according to severity and circumstances. Over time, the courts have adapted sentencing approaches to reflect evolving understanding of social harm, offender profile, and rehabilitative potential, without losing sight of deterrence and public protection principles. It's worth recalling the developments following changes to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO), which saw shifts in community sentencing availability and increased emphasis on proportionate punishment. Yet, persistent and recurrent offending, particularly in the retail sector, continues to attract firm judicial attention — as the Court of Appeal observed in R v. Fenwick [2019] EWCA Crim 1274, where a repeat offender whose conduct involved the theft of essential medicines from a local pharmacy was sentenced to immediate custody, noting the cumulative impact on vulnerable victims and a potential threat to public safety. Co-defendant Issues and Related Proceedings While you are the solitary defendant in these proceedings, it is germane to mention that the original investigation also considered the involvement of a co-defendant, Mr J. Ellis. Mr Ellis was charged with attempted aggravated burglary but absconded prior to trial and currently remains at large. The co-defendant’s unrelated charges, involving the unlawful possession of a bladed article in a school car park and a subsequent affray at a licensed premises, are not connected to your offending and bear no relevance to your sentencing. The distinction is emphasised here to prevent any conflation of separate legal matters. Similarly, your sister, Ms Bernadine H., is presently subject to ongoing proceedings concerning allegations of benefit fraud and is not implicated in your offences. The court treats the two matters as wholly distinct. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. Turning to the particular circumstances as established through admissible evidence and agreed facts, the offending occurred predominantly in the Stratford town centre and adjacent commercial thoroughfares. The prosecution evidence included substantial video footage, witness statements, and recovered property, with forensic support. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. Your actions were systematically planned, targeting high-demand items such as over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, grooming products, and small electronics, chosen for their ease of concealment and resale value. On multiple occasions, you were observed engaging in distraction techniques, such as conversing with accomplices near points of sale or creating diversions to draw attention away from your movements. Mr H returned to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time targeting alcohol and tobacco. Such organised efforts amplify the gravity of the offending. It reflects knowledge of retail systems and a wilful defiance of store security measures, exacerbating the moral blameworthiness. The psychiatric evaluation commissioned due to your defence team’s concerns was conducted by Dr Olivia Ferns, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, whose comprehensive report was submitted on 10 September 2025. Dr Ferns’ opinion is that you exhibit a diagnosis of mild to moderate depressive disorder, complicated by intermittent social anxiety and past trauma. However, the assessment finds no psychiatric condition sufficiently severe to diminish your criminal responsibility, nor to render community supervision inappropriate. Notwithstanding the absence of psychosis or cognitive impairment, Dr Ferns highlights a pattern of impulsivity and limited engagement with support services. She notes that prior offers of assistance—both clinical and social—have been repeatedly declined, on grounds unclear but possibly connected with distrust and inertia. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. The report underscores the potential benefits of cognitive behavioural interventions and financial advisory support, coupled with monitored compliance measures. The probation officer tasked with your supervision has similarly commented on apparent ambivalence towards structured programmes, a factor likely to complicate rehabilitation efforts. It is incumbent on this court to weigh these psychological insights carefully against the wider imperatives of protecting victims, the public, and maintaining confidence in the administration of justice. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. Your antecedents include prior convictions for theft-related offences, with four such convictions spanning the last decade. Community resolutions and conditional discharges for earlier shoplifting were registered but unfortunately were not effective in deterring future offending. Of note is a caution administered in 2021 following an incident of theft from a well-known supermarket chain in a neighbouring borough. The terms of that caution were clear, including engagement with an adult offending programme — which, according to probation records, was only partially completed and not sustained beyond 12 weeks. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. Historical case-worker notes reference attempts to engage you with employment support and housing assistance. Documentation reflects intermittent contact and significant periods of non-cooperation. Reports describe your current living situation as “temporary accommodation” with instability due to tenancy issues, but formal housing support services remain involved and express willingness to continue assistance provided active participation on your part is secured. The impact of housing insecurity upon offending patterns is a matter receiving ongoing academic and policy attention. However, courts remain steadfast that hardship is not a licence to offend, nor a shield against accountability. The court has also received correspondence from the Stratford Homelessness Action Network, noting increasing pressures on emergency night shelters and highlighting the growing incidence of street homelessness and begging. While these observations provide important context, they do not bear directly on your individual culpability but establish the challenging environment both for offenders and support agencies. Similarly, letters from the Stratford Retail Business Association, along with Police Community Support Officers, articulate concerns about staffing shortages and weariness among shopfloor personnel faced with repeated incidents of theft and antisocial behaviour. The Legal Aid and Probation Services have both expressed the continuing difficulties encountered in delivering timely assessments and interventions in light of expanding caseloads and resource constraints. Such observations underscore systemic hurdles rather than mitigating personal factors. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. As established by the Sentencing Council's Theft Guideline, sentencing for shoplifting offences requires reflection on three primary considerations: the culpability of the offender, the harm caused, and any aggravating or mitigating features. Factors increasing culpability include premeditation, role within a group, and previous convictions for similar offences. Harm assessment extends beyond mere monetary loss to encompass psychological impact on victims, effects on business viability, and wider communal confidence. The courts must balance the objectives of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection, a complex exercise in discretionary judgment. In R v. Winstanley [2020] EWCA Crim 383, the Court of Appeal reiterated that repeat acquisitive offending demands unequivocal deterrent sentences to signal the limits of tolerance. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. The defence submits that your difficult personal circumstances and admission of guilt, albeit delayed, merit the court’s favour towards a community sentence incorporating rehabilitative measures. The Crown emphasises your history, the pattern of offending, and the necessity of deterrence. This court is acutely aware of the competing demands placed on justice, health, social care, and voluntary agencies in addressing the root causes of offending. The scale of societal challenges intertwining poverty, mental health, housing, and employment is vast and at times seemingly intractable. Yet justice must be both principled and practical. It cannot abdicate responsibility in favour of sympathy alone. Nor can it administer punishment without regard to rehabilitation where feasible. As has been frequently observed, crime of this nature appears minor in the catalogue of wrongdoing but carries profound cumulative harm. The weariness and fear sown into small business communities, the burden on overstretched emergency and investigative services, and the corrosive implications for trust and security are all manifest. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 21 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Stratford. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded under the provisions of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal against any sentence imposed within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are not engaged. Costs are reserved. Sentencing will be deferred pending the preparation and submission of a full pre-sentence report, which shall include consideration of all available rehabilitative and restorative options consistent with public safety and the circumstances herein. The court will then proceed to determine an appropriate sentence on a date to be fixed.
