Mr H Case No. 2025/FT09847 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. Forsyth Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing following your conviction on one count of theft by shoplifting, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The incidents span multiple retail premises within the Winchester and surrounding Hampshire boroughs over a period exceeding eighteen months. This court acknowledges the somewhat emblematic nature of such cases in reflecting the persistent challenges faced by both law enforcement and community stakeholders in managing recurrent acquisitive offending. Procedural History The matter was initially the subject of a charge dating back to early 2024, with intermediary procedural events including multiple case management hearings, an application for psychiatric evaluation, and a contested not guilty plea which was ultimately abandoned in favour of a guilty plea shortly before trial. The conduct of the prosecution and defence teams throughout has been, on balance, diligent, notwithstanding occasional setbacks attributable largely to the complexities of expert evidence procurement and the inherent pressures on the Legal Aid system. It is of some note, and indeed lament, that the application to instruct an independent clinical psychiatrist experienced in compulsive theft behaviours was met with protracted administrative delay by the Legal Aid Agency, ultimately impacting the scheduling of the plea hearing. This court reiterates its growing concern with bureaucratic obstacles impeding timely justice, a matter raised repeatedly over recent sittings across multiple Crown Court venues. The system's capacity to respond efficiently to requests for specialised expert input, critical in cases with underlying mental health considerations, remains conspicuously challenged. You were arrested on 12 February 2025 following an intelligence-led operation coordinated by the Hampshire Constabulary's Retail Crime Unit, involving advanced surveillance and analysis of public transport records, CCTV footage, and witness statements. The deployment of resources in this investigation was substantial and reflects the broader prioritisation of retail crime reduction strategies in the region. The operational teams worked in concert with the Winchester Business Safer Neighbourhood Partnership, which has itself published periodic reports on acquisitive crime trends indicating an upward trajectory over the last four years, notwithstanding local initiatives. Mr H hid £17 worth of grooming items under his jacket and walked past the tills without stopping to pay. Much attention has been drawn in recent years to the efficacy of the Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRP), especially in relation to systematic data sharing among retailers, police agencies, and ancillary services. While the architecture of such schemes is theoretically robust, the reality often falls short due to chronic staffing shortages, uneven information flow, and uncoordinated operational practices. Here, the BCRP demonstrated notable promptness in documenting offences and liaising with police. This co-operation no doubt contributed to the early identification of the pattern of offending, but the challenge of translating such data into sustained preventive action remains an open question. The NHS mental health trust serving Hampshire has also submitted a report describing current strains on community mental health services, characterised by increasing caseloads, long wait times for referrals, and limited integration with criminal justice entities. These systemic constraints serve as an important backdrop to assessments of defendants such as yourself, whose offending may intersect with unmet health needs or psychosocial vulnerabilities. However, it remains imperative that such factors do not eclipse the fundamental principle that offending bears consequences independent of personal circumstances. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. The comprehensive psychiatric report authored by Dr Samira Patel, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was tendered with the parties’ consent. Her assessment diagnoses no major psychotic or mood disorder but identifies traits consistent with impulse control difficulties and episodic substance misuse, notably involving occasional recreational use rather than dependency. Dr Patel emphasises the absence of any psychosis-linked cognitive impairment likely to diminish responsibility, but notes your reported history of childhood adversity, including periods of familial instability and educational disruption. Dr Patel’s recommendations include consideration of a structured cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention focused on impulse management and problem solving, ideally integrated within community supervision measures. The probation service has also provided a pre-sentence report highlighting your sporadic engagement with prior support services and the continuing instability of your housing circumstances, currently relying on short-term arrangements that may exacerbate stressors contributing to reoffending risk. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. The interplay between personal vulnerability and offending presents considerable complexity, as consistently noted across appellate jurisprudence. It is well established that mental illness or psychosocial difficulty neither excuses nor undeservedly mitigates offending behaviour, but where demonstrable and relevant, such factors may inform the court’s assessment of culpability and rehabilitation potential. Reference is made to R v. Eldridge [2019] EWCA Crim 550, where the Court affirmed that offenders manifesting cognitive or emotional impairments could benefit from individually tailored disposals provided public protection is assured. The Legal Aid Agency’s repeated delays in authorising forensic psychiatric expertise, regrettably, impacted case timeliness. Similar issues were noted in R v. Binks [2023] EWCA Crim 1418, where resourcing constraints contributed to adjournments exceeding procedural norms. This court joins a chorus of judicial voices urging systemic reform to ensure that access to necessary assessments is not unduly hindered by administrative barriers. On one occasion, Mr H asked staff about Oyster Card payments as a distraction, then leaned behind the counter to take a display item. As is well known, theft offences engage the sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council, including the Definitive Guideline on theft (vers. 1.3, effective since 2021). The guiding considerations include the value of the goods taken, the frequency and sophistication of offending, the degree of planning involved, and the impact on victims, particularly retail employees. While the offence presently before the court is a single charge, sentencing must take proper account of the conduct it represents — a course of repeated and deliberate thefts targeting items of modest retail value but cumulatively significant. An appraisal of aggravating and mitigating factors is required in accordance with principles articulated in R v. Mills [2020] EWCA Crim 784, which stressed the need to assess culpability through conduct pattern rather than isolated instances. The court also notes with interest recent appellate dicta in R v. Gregory [2024] EWCA Crim 2304, wherein the Court commented on the potential for community-based interventions addressing underlying addiction or mental health issues to reduce offending recidivism, provided that they are robustly supervised and accompanied by realistic rehabilitation frameworks. While encouraging in principle, such directions require the presence of willing engagement and supportive infrastructure. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. Representations from the Winchester Shopkeepers Association were received, highlighting the cumulative toll taken by repeated shoplifting on small businesses and their employees. While no physical violence occurred in the course of the offending, staff stress and lowered morale were frequently reported, alongside financial losses that, in some cases, threatened viability. Such perspectives align with broader research evidencing the eroding effects of recurrent theft on retail business sustainability, and by extension community cohesion. Small independent retailers, in particular, often operate within razor-thin margins and lack the sophisticated loss prevention resources of large chains, rendering them especially vulnerable. We also take note of statements provided by the Winchester Business Crime Reduction Partnership and the Community Safety Unit, commending the vigilance of store managers and frontline staff, yet emphasising persistent constraints in responding effectively to acquisitive crime due to resource and staffing deficits. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. It is relevant to note that the defendant’s previous criminal record comprises multiple convictions for similar shoplifting offences, the last having been dealt with by a conditional discharge imposed in 2022. The recurrence of offending notwithstanding prior formal warning illustrates the limits of such non-custodial disposals in deterring persistent behaviour absent rehabilitative engagement. Likewise, the probation report underlines sporadic compliance with past community orders, including irregular attendance at specified sessions and challenges in maintaining contact with supervising officers. This historical context frames the current sentencing exercise and underscores the importance of proportionate and integrated intervention plans. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. Comparative jurisprudence provides further context. In R v. Simms [2018] EWCA Crim 306, a defendant convicted of repeated theft from retail premises was sentenced to an immediate custodial term, emphasising the importance of protecting retail staff and discouraging opportunistic offending. Yet the Court also acknowledged the value of community sentences in suitable cases with comprehensive rehabilitation components. The balance remains delicate. It is observed, however, that certain prior cases cited in submissions, such as R v. Chapman [2017] EWCA Crim 2041 concerning aggravated burglary involving violent entry and R v. Oakley [2019] EWCA Crim 1199 regarding drug importation via courier systems, have no direct bearing on the matters currently before the court and serve solely as examples of sentencing ranges for markedly different offences. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. Turning to resourcing challenges, it is pertinent to observe the operational difficulties experienced by the probation service in Hampshire, including elevated caseload ratios and staff shortages that have limited individualised supervision opportunities. While these factors do not excuse non-compliance, they undeniably impact the capacity to implement effective rehabilitative plans on the ground. Similarly, the Hampshire Police Retail Crime Unit reports an increasing friction between core violent crime investigations and acquisitive offence caseload, with the latter often receiving lower prioritisation due to limited personnel. These competing demands underscore the systemic pressures borne out by the present case. The court also notes relevant community and voluntary sector input. Letters from local charities engaged in homelessness prevention and substance misuse support confirm the challenging context for defendants contending with housing insecurity and social exclusion. Nonetheless, such contextual factors may not be conflated with exoneration of culpability. In respect of your personal circumstances, your engagement with counselling and substance misuse interventions has been limited and inconsistent, according to the probation service. While the declared motivational outlook is hopeful, tangible progress remains elusive. I extend thanks to Ms Elizabeth Warren, who appears for the Crown, and Mr Darren Eastwood, who appears for the defence on a legal aid representation order. Both have provided well-prepared submissions and assisted the court in navigating the evidentiary and procedural complexities of this matter. The hearing has been conducted openly and with due respect to principles of fair trial and public accountability. The layout of Courtroom 4 at Winchester Crown Court was recently refurbished, enhancing accessibility and the well-being of all participants. Thanks are due to the court ushers and clerk for their attentive management of proceedings. In closing, this court is mindful that sentencing must balance the need for deterrence, punishment, rehabilitation, and the protection of the public. It must also reflect the evolving social challenges faced by those involved in and affected by acquisitive crime—challenges that transcend individual blame and speak to wider systemic issues. The court is therefore directing that a further detailed pre-sentence report be prepared by the probation service, incorporating updated psychological assessments, engagement potential evaluation, and recommendations for a proportionate disposal, with particular regard to possible community orders supplemented by cognitive skills training and ancillary rehabilitative programmes. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 4 at Winchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence, once determined, will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for entry on the National Offender Management System. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.
