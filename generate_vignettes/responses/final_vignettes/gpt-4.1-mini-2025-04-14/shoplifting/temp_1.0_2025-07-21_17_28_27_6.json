MR H Case No. H2025/15479 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. J. KENWORTH Filed: 14 October 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence upon a charge of theft, specifically multiple counts of shoplifting from various retail establishments over a protracted period. The offending conduct, as charged, is contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, and reflects a sustained pattern rather than isolated lapses. The offences occurred over an eighteen-month timeframe in the Hartfield metropolitan area and its immediate environs. Procedural History You were initially taken into custody on 5 May 2025 following an investigation that spanned several months and involved coordinated efforts by the Hartfield Metropolitan Police, alongside the Hartfield Retail Crime Task Force. This multi-agency approach involved the collation of store incident reports, digital evidence including CCTV footage, and employee statements, some of whom were compelled to provide detailed witness accounts under cross-examination during preliminary hearings. The collaborative apparatus assembled to address such behaviour invokes not only law enforcement but also retail security consultants and community liaison officers. The Hartfield Business Crime Reduction Partnership played a pivotal role, maintaining communications with affected merchants, analysing trends, and advising on best practices to reduce losses. Such partnerships, while theoretically demonstrating promising frameworks for crime reduction, frequently encounter practical challenges such as staff turnover, variations in data recording standards, and uneven financial backing from participating outlets. You elected to enter pleas of not guilty at the first listing on 18 June 2025, triggering the setting of a plea and trial preparation hearing in accordance with the Better Case Management regime. The Court noted with some measure of approval that all parties proceeded with reasonable expedition, notwithstanding the regrettable delays occasioned by Legal Aid representation orders and the late appointment of defence counsel. As is often the case in matters relying on forensic identification techniques, your legal representatives prudently sought an independent expert assessment, which was delayed by several weeks due to administrative backlogs in the Legal Aid Agency’s processing, a regrettable but familiar pattern. The second hearing, held on 15 August 2025, confirmed your intention to change your plea to guilty, a decision communicated shortly before the hearing commenced. While the court acknowledges that such guilty pleas serve to streamline proceedings and relieve witnesses of the distress associated with testifying, the timing unfortunately restricts the scope of discount applicable. As the Court of Appeal elucidated in R v. Holden [2023] EWCA Crim 1582, such last-minute admissions, absent compelling mitigating circumstances, attract significantly reduced credit. I take this opportunity to reiterate commentary on the persistent systemic issues affecting the justice system’s capacity to deliver fair and timely resolution. The delays caused by funding authorisation for expert psychiatric evaluations, as well as constraints within the probation service due to chronic under-resourcing, continue to impair the administration of justice in cases much like this one. These institutional challenges underscore the complex social ecology within which offending arises, but do not excuse it. Not least because repeated offending imposes direct burdens upon victims and indirect costs upon overstretched public services. The court also notes the recent refurbishment of Courtroom 4, completed earlier this year. While the physical environment of justice is tangential to substantive matters, it is a symbol, perhaps, of ongoing efforts to uphold dignity, decorum, and accessibility within the judicial process. Equally noteworthy is the continued commendable professionalism of the court ushers and clerical staff, who, despite rising caseloads and administrative complexity, maintain order and furnish procedural explanation to parties in language accessible to lay participants. The statutory framework governing theft is well-established, resting on the foundational principles set out in the Theft Act 1968. The offence requires proof of dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. Theft encompassing repeated incidents with calculated intent and planning attracts greater seriousness under sentencing guidelines, reflecting not only the tangible loss but also the wider psychological impact upon victims and communities. Considerable guidance is sourced from the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft, which underscores factors such as the frequency of offences, premeditation, and the vulnerability of The victims or locations targeted. The aggravating features of repeated offending, especially when directed at small independent retailers or specialist outlets, have been shown in authorities such as R v. Fenwick [2020] EWCA Crim 1825 to justify custodial sentences reflective of the cumulative harm. Though Fenwick concerned an offence of shop theft conducted under duress, its dicta regarding proportionality in sentencing remain instructive here. There is also instructive precedent in R v. Telford [2022] EWCA Crim 2134, where the Court upheld a sentence of immediate custody for thefts from community pharmacies, noting the heightened effect on staff morale and security concerns arising from targeted repeat offending. While the present charges do not include violence or threat, they are not entirely without impact beyond economic loss. Furthermore, although not germane to your own conduct, the court recalls the judgment in R v. McDermott [2019] EWCA Crim 908, involving wilful fire-raising at a local church hall, which emphasized the court’s duty to consider societal implications when imposing sentences even where direct physical harm is absent. Such cases serve as cautionary markers, reminding the court and public alike that low-level offences, if untreated, erode the social fabric. Turning to scholarly opinion, the evolution of sentencing principles over the last decade has been informed by a shifting landscape of criminal justice policy. The Better Case Management initiative, referenced earlier, was introduced following Lord Justice Briggs’ seminal Review (2016), which advocated for earlier case resolution and more effective resource allocation. While that reform has yielded improvements in some jurisdictions, the present case also demonstrates ongoing areas for procedural refinement, particularly in addressing Legal Aid bottlenecks. There is, moreover, a rich tradition of appellate decisions underscoring the interaction between mental health considerations and sentencing. Notably, in R v. Bellamy [2018] EWCA Crim 1207, the Court examined the limits of mitigation where psychiatric diagnosis intersected with persistent offending, concluding that clinical need does not diminish the court’s obligation to protect the public. Although your own clinical reports, which I shall discuss shortly, do not disclose major mental illness, that case frames the broader judicial approach well. The court is called, implicitly, to situate your offending within a wider societal tableau marked by rising economic precarity, fluctuating employment patterns, and increasing strains on housing services. Hartfield’s municipal homelessness figures have risen steadily in recent years, with temporary accommodation placements often lasting beyond statutory maximums due to acute shortages. Local food banks face demand far exceeding capacity, something reported in recent correspondence from Hartfield Community Aid, which also notes pressures on volunteer staffing. It bears mention that the Hartfield retail sector has, over the last five years, witnessed a slow attrition of independent shops, displaced in part by online commerce and rising business rates. This market transformation affects not only economic dynamics but community cohesion, as small retailer participation is integral to neighbourhood vibrancy. The converse – an environment in which persistent petty theft cycles endure – risks destabilizing this fragile equilibrium. There have been recent policy forums on the role of multi-agency panels, including Hartfield’s Local Crime Reduction Strategy Group, which continues to grapple with data-sharing limitations under GDPR constraints. Such restrictions hinder the prompt identification of repeat offenders and the deployment of tailored interventions; a problem noted elsewhere in the country, as highlighted in the Home Office’s “Review of Data Integration in Crime Reduction” (2024). Your case was also briefly delayed due to a court-wide adjournment resulting from a fire alarm activation in the adjacent Court 5 complex on 22 September, necessitating an evacuation and subsequent re-listing. This incident, while unrelated to your case specifically, showcases the operational vulnerabilities inherent in historic court buildings juxtaposed against modern digital courts elsewhere. At the initial hearing, you were remanded on conditional bail with a curfew order, reflecting the court’s assessment of the risk of reoffending and potential interference with witnesses. Throughout this period, probation and police liaison officers reported compliance with bail conditions, albeit with intermittent reports of non-attendance at appointments. Such compliance, while to be noted, should not be conflated with genuine behavioural change but rather regarded as procedural adherence. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. On the subject of your antecedents, the probation records indicate three prior convictions for similar offences within the last seven years, all relating to theft under £200. There is one recorded instance of a community resolution imposed in 2023 involving theft from a supermarket, though the record suggests subsequent breach thereof. No indication exists of gang affiliation or organised crime nexus, nor is there any record of violence or intimidation associated with your offending. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. The court received a comprehensive pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Joanne Sinclair, probation officer, who carefully considered risk, personal circumstances, and potential for rehabilitation. Notably, Ms Sinclair emphasises that your engagement with probation services has been, at best, sporadic. Attempts to initiate cognitive behavioural interventions met with limited attendance and frequent cancellation. The pre-sentence report further remarks on your reported history of unstable accommodation and significant periods of unemployment. You acknowledge reliance on state benefits and some occasional informal cash-in-hand work. The caseworker’s summary flags ‘low motivation for change’ as a significant concern. In addition to the probation input, a contemporary psychiatric evaluation was commissioned, with the report provided by Dr Elsie Byers, consultant psychiatrist at Hartfield Mental Health Trust. Dr Byers’ assessment concluded that no major mental illness is evident. She describes your presentation as ‘personality traits consistent with impulsivity and low frustration tolerance’ but explicitly excludes diagnosable personality disorder or psychosis. The report recommends that any engagement with structured community programmes focus on addressing impulsive behaviour and underlying social determinants. Across three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion. Letters of support submitted on your behalf include one from Ms Hannah Lewis of the Hartfield Outreach and Support Network, who speaks of your ‘occasional attendance at group sessions’ but acknowledges inconsistent engagement. A statement from your sister, Ms Tamara H, was also tendered, highlighting familial tensions but expressing hope for positive progression should appropriate support be secured. It is worth noting the continuing operational challenges experienced by community support agencies locally. In a recent parliamentary briefing, the National Probation Service highlighted chronic staffing deficits and reported caseloads frequently exceeding recommended limits. Coupled with reductions in third-sector funding, these constraints curtail the availability of intensive supervision or specialised interventions. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. Victim personal statements from managers and staff across the affected retail outlets have been submitted. They reflect a microcosm of the wider harm occasioned by your offending: increased anxiety, redistribution of workload to cover shift absences caused by stress, and heightened security measures including shelf locking and door alarms. While your actions did not entail physical confrontation, the psychological impact is nonetheless material. One victim impact report from the proprietors of a family-run chemist in Hartfield town centre details how staff changes were accelerated to mitigate exposure to your presence, resulting in financial and operational disruption. The court is cognisant of the wider implications of such repeated offending, notably in the cumulative drain on public resources - from investigative time to administrative processing and the indirect consequences for retail insurance premiums. It bears noting that in R v. Maddox [2019] EWCA Crim 1961, the Court emphasised the significance of the knock-on effects of repeated retail crime, even where individual theft values were modest. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. The Crown’s Submissions Ms Lydia Farr, counsel for the prosecution, has submitted that this court should impose a sentence reflecting the cumulative nature of the offending, its persistence despite previous warnings and interventions, and the demonstrated impact on victims. She emphasises that community orders with unpaid work and programme requirements may be appropriate but stresses that the threshold for custody should not be discounted lightly. The prosecution notes your late guilty plea, acknowledging some discount but reminds the court of the limited early opportunities afforded to the defence. Ms Farr further highlights the necessity of deterrence in a case typified by systematic evasion of lawful constraints. Mr Oliver Dwyer, appearing for you via a legal representation order, has submitted mitigating factors, including your unstable housing, unemployment status, lack of previous custodial sentences, and acknowledgement of responsibility. He contends that these factors militate strongly against immediate custody and advocate for a community penalty incorporating rehabilitative interventions, subject to the court’s approval. Mr Dwyer draws attention to personal challenges, including episodes of homelessness and reported past substance misuse, which, though not directly linked to the offences, provide context indicative of broader vulnerability. Citing the judgements in R v. Parker [2021] EWCA Crim 1034 and R v. Clarke [2023] EWCA Crim 1087, Mr Dwyer advocates for proportionality and rehabilitation in sentencing, reminding the court of the Human Rights Act considerations implicit in custodial decisions. He also notes your cooperation post-arrest and willingness to engage with support services as a positive step, emphasising the role of community sentences in reducing recidivism. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. Observations on Public Policy and Service Constraints It is incumbent upon the court to observe that the demand for community sentences exceeds supply, and the capacity for tailored programmes is frequently outstripped by case volumes. Waiting lists for cognitive skills courses and substance misuse programmes in Hartfield have, at times, extended to twelve months or more. This delay undermines rehabilitative prospects and compounds public safety risks. Notification of statutory duties to protect public welfare and prevent reoffending requires critical balancing against the finite resources of probation, courts, and ancillary services. Despite numerous reform proposals, including the 2024 Ministry of Justice Efficiency Plan, substantial challenges persist. An unrelated matter of record is the ongoing investigation into corruption within the local probation office, currently under internal inquiry and external oversight by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation. While unrelated to this case, such institutional instability casts a shadow on service delivery. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. The facts of the offending are as follows. Over the course of the eighteen-month period leading to your arrest, you committed multiple acts of shoplifting from retail premises primarily within Hartfield’s central business district. The offences included a sequence of thefts from convenience stores, pharmacies, and independent merchants, marked by frequent return visits and use of distraction techniques, including commanding staff attention while concealing items. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, claims it isn’t really stealing and intends to keep doing so. On several occasions, your conduct involved removal of security tags and calculated evasion of staff surveillance. The value of stolen goods in individual instances was low, but cumulative losses resulted in tangible economic harm and psychological distress to victims. While your demeanour during police interviews was cooperative in the later stages of investigation, earlier denials delayed resolution and imposed additional investigatory burdens. In consideration of all material before the court, including the probation assessment, psychiatric evaluation, victim impact statements, legal submissions, and your antecedents, I have yet to determine the appropriate disposal. Given the complexity of factors and the necessity of ensuring a sentence tailored not only to punishment but also promoting rehabilitation and preventing reoffending, I shall order a further pre-sentence report. This report will also consider any updated information you may provide following engagement with support services. The final sentence will be imposed at a hearing to be listed shortly following receipt of that report. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Hartfield. The proceedings are transcribed and recorded under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing pursuant to relevant statutory provisions. No reporting restrictions under sections 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 or associated legislation are engaged. Costs are reserved.
