MR H Case No. B2025/04932 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F. Kensington Filed: 17 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing following your conviction for shoplifting offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, in a case that has occupied a significant procedural footprint stretching over the course of the past 18 months. The offending conduct attributed to you spans various retail premises across Bristol and its immediate environs between March 2023 and June 2025. Procedural History and Case Management Your initial appearance was before the Magistrates’ Court on 15 June 2025, where bail conditions were imposed, including a curfew and daily reporting requirements. The matter was committed here for trial due to the seriousness attached to the pattern of offending and the volume of evidence requiring trial-level management. The case was listed under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, a procedural initiative designed to expedite the handling of indictable offences by ensuring early identification and resolution of issues relating to disclosure, witness availability, and expert evidence. The case proceeded through a series of hearings and arraignments, with due regard paid to the obligations imposed by the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR), consistent with the overriding objective of enabling the court to deal with cases justly and efficiently. I note that the prosecution, led by Ms Susan Warren QC, and your defence team, fronted by Mr Oliver Freeman, Solicitor Advocate, engaged professionally throughout a process punctuated by adjournments which, while unfortunate, reflected the complexities pertinent to this case. Early attempts were made to instruct a forensic psychologist to assist with mitigation and risk assessment; however, as is regrettably frequent, the authorisation from the Legal Aid Agency was delayed, resulting in some procedural difficulty which inevitably lengthened the preparatory period. This court has, on numerous occasions, raised concerns about systemic impediments within the administration of Legal Aid funding, which act as impediments to efficient case progression and add to burdens already borne by court staff and practitioners alike. The investigation was instigated following a report from the Bristol Retail Crime Reduction Partnership (BRCRP), a multi-agency body comprising local police, council trading standards, and independent retail security personnel. This team acts to collate intelligence, facilitate communication across stakeholder groups, and support a coherent enforcement approach to repeat thefts within the city centre and suburban retail districts. Whilst the Partnership operates with considerable dedication, the court is conscious of the pressures facing its membership, with shrinking budgets and increasing caseloads exacerbating the challenge of swift information sharing. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. This court is reminded that the acts of shoplifting, as defined by the Theft Act 1968, involve the dishonest appropriation of goods belonging to another, with the intention to permanently deprive. While single overt acts may attract minimal public notice, a sustained series of such offences, especially where they disturb community confidence and business viability, are considered in aggregate. You were apprehended on 12 June 2025 after a confidential tip-off to the Avon and Somerset Police Retail Unit, following weeks of surveillance and intelligence collation involving Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage, electronic point-of-sale data anomalies, and on-the-ground witness statements. This investigation, as confirmed by Detective Inspector Helen Marsh, required considerable deployment of resources, including teams specialising in digital forensics who analysed mobile device data pursuant to warrants authorised by the District Judge. The operation extended over multiple weeks, involving coordination across borough boundaries and necessitating intermittent redeployment of uniformed and plainclothes officers. Mr H attempted to hide boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in the undercarriage of his niece’s pushchair. The scale of investigatory work undertaken — while arguably disproportionate to the monetary values directly involved — is justified by the need to uphold lawful commercial activity and community order. It is also influenced by the cumulative toll on retail employees who face disruption, anxiety, and the demoralising effect of recurrent thefts. The BRCRP's recent report outlined a trend of increasing acquisitive crime post-pandemic, with particular concern expressed over the impact on small, family-run establishments. Turning to the sentencing framework, this court acknowledges the guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council for theft offences, which emphasise the gravity of repeated offending and the vulnerability of victims, including employees subjected to harassment or intimidation. The leading guideline insists that sentences must be proportionate, taking into account aggravating and mitigating factors, the offender’s culpability, and the broader public interest. The Court takes careful note of the precedent established in R v. Ellison [2019] EWCA Crim 2402, where the Court of Appeal held that sustained shoplifting—planned and systematic—merits a custodial response despite low individual item values. Ellison concerned the theft of over £3,000 in goods from multiple branches of a department store over several months, involving sophisticated concealment tactics. The appeal court there highlighted the importance of deterrence, noting the cumulative economic and psychological damage inflicted. Furthermore, the decision in R v. Fenwick [2020] EWCA Crim 1175 is germane, insofar as it considered the partial mitigation offered by underlying mental health issues, but nonetheless upheld a sentence reflecting the inherent seriousness of persistent acquisitive offending. In that case, the defendant’s diagnosis of bipolar disorder was found to be a relevant, but not determinative, factor in sentencing. This court will carefully balance similar considerations here. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. While the rulings referenced address distinct factual matrices, their legal principles regarding credit for guilty pleas, offender culpability, and the appropriate threshold for custodial sentencing provide a helpful framework. The impact of your offences, though lacking violent component, has been acutely felt by those caught up in the offending. Victim personal statements were submitted by a range of retail staff, many of whom reported feelings of anxiety and apprehension during work hours. The management of several stores confirmed that staff rotas were altered to mitigate lone working, and some reported reductions in opening hours due to concerns about shoplifting and associated antisocial behaviour. The court is also conscious of the role of local charities such as ShopSafe Bristol, which offers support to retail workers experiencing the emotional toll of repeat thefts and shop-based aggression. Their written representations commend staff for their resilience but warn that without effective intervention the cumulative stress risks burnout and attrition within the sector. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. Notably, the witness statements also reveal the adaptation of loss prevention strategies, including increased use of electronic tags, heightened surveillance, and staff retraining—all costly measures borne ultimately by businesses and consumers alike. Your defence has advanced several mitigating factors, notably personal struggles with intermittent homelessness and unstable accommodation. Moreover, a psychiatric assessment conducted by Dr Eleanor Matthews, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, provides a detailed overview of your mental state, indicating features of borderline personality disorder, exacerbated by longstanding substance misuse. Dr Matthews concludes that while no psychotic or major affective disorder is present, the complexity of your cases suggests a need for carefully structured community support. It must be stressed here that psychiatric opinion was formally instructed to explore both mitigation and risk. Dr Matthews’ report, dated 30 September 2025, is thorough and professionally composed, presenting a nuanced view of your vulnerabilities alongside the recognition of persistent antisocial behaviour patterns. However, the conclusion within that report is guarded, noting that rehabilitation potential is contingent on your engagement with services which, thus far, has been erratic. The court takes this opportunity to commend the efforts of your defence team in the face of pronounced difficulties encountered with the Legal Aid Agency. Initial applications for funding to instruct the psychiatric expert were lodged in early August but only granted after protracted correspondence extending over six weeks. Such bureaucratic inertia, while lamentably routine, imposes unfair burdens on defendants and counsel alike and risks prejudice to the preparation of effective mitigation. These frustrations have been recorded in other courts and will, it is hoped, be addressed by forthcoming reforms. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. It is impossible to divorce an understanding of this case from wider societal trends. Recent years have seen a marked increase in street homelessness within urban centres in the South West. Local authorities and voluntary organisations face significant challenges responding to needs that have outpaced resourcing. The normalisation of begging and street presence carries implications not only for those living in precarious conditions but also for community perceptions of public safety. This court is aware of reports by the Bristol Homelessness Action Forum underscoring the expanding nexus between destitution and acquisitive crime as survival mechanisms. While such contexts do not excuse criminal conduct, they offer an essential lens recalling that enforcement is but one strand in a multi-agency response. Alongside these grim realities is the enduring challenge of delivering mental health services to vulnerable adults. NHS waitlists for community psychiatric care and addiction treatment remain long, with significant variation in access depending on locality. Cases like Mr H’s underscore the necessity of integrated statutory and voluntary support systems, though as noted, the choice to engage remains with the individual. The defendant told the authorities he sold the stolen items at a car boot sale and in pubs, and that this had upset or alarmed some customers. The court also acknowledges with respect the work of the Avon and Somerset Police Retail Crime Unit, whose members have contended with rising workloads and a broadening remit encompassing not only theft but complex data analysis, digital evidence retrieval, and victim liaison—all while navigating budgetary constraints. Interestingly, the emergence of so-called “hotspot policing” has yielded mixed results, with some shifts in offending locations rather than reductions in overall theft rates. This has prompted academic critiques regarding the sustainability of current enforcement models. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. In parallel, the Probation Service remains afflicted by staff shortages and increasing caseloads complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic’s ongoing effects. A limited number of available appointments for accredited cognitive skills programmes constrains the options for structured rehabilitation. Council Authorities, alongside voluntary housing agencies, continue grappling with mounting demands, and the increasing frequency of temporary accommodation placements creates a fragile base from which individuals like yourself must attempt reintegration. Sentencing for offences such as yours must navigate the tension between deterrence, reparation, rehabilitation, and public protection. The Sentencing Council’s theft guideline outlines culpability categories and harm ranges, noting that persistence and premeditation increase the severity. The court must also consider whether ancillary orders—such as a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement or a curfew—might complement formal sentencing, though suitability depends on risk assessment. Addressing the timing of your guilty plea, which came on the second day of trial proceedings, the court is bound to note that while such pleas reduce exposure to trial-related distress, they cannot command the maximum credit available for early admissions. The principle is established that guilty pleas entered at an advanced stage principally function to conserve judicial resources but do not necessarily evince genuine remorse. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. Mr H, this case is emblematic of the complex challenges at the intersection of criminal conduct, social vulnerability, and systemic resource limitations. Your conduct, though lacking in violence or threat, has nonetheless had persistent and tangible consequences for individuals and communities. While the court recognises mitigating circumstances and the psychiatric evidence indicating your difficulties, it must also send a clear message about the unacceptability of repeated dishonesty. The preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report is essential to ensure that the holistic circumstances are analysed in detail and that the sentencing response appropriately addresses rehabilitation needs and public safety. It is hoped that such a report will explore feasible intervention pathways linking probation, mental health services, and social support networks. Members of the public and victims alike deserve to have confidence that the court’s response is proportionate, effective, and principled. This sentencing hearing has been conducted in open court, with all parties duly present. I record my thanks to Ms Warren QC for her considered submissions, to Mr Freeman for his diligent and nuanced advocacy, and to the probation officers and psychiatrists who have contributed expert insights. I further commend the court staff and ushers, who have ensured the smooth running of proceedings despite a recent refurbishment rendering court 5 uncomfortably cramped. These sentencing remarks are issued this 17th day of October 2025, in Court 5 at the Bristol Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal order of conviction and sentence will be processed through appropriate channels. You are advised of your right to appeal within twenty-eight days in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.
