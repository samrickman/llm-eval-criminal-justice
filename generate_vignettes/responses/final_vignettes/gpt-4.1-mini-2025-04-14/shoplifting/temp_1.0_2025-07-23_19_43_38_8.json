MR H Case No. B2025/07611 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. D. CLARKE Filed: 19 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on a charge relating to theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending pertains to a series of shoplifting incidents which took place over a protracted timeframe and across multiple locations within the jurisdiction of the Brighton and Hove area. Procedural History Your initial appearance before the Magistrates’ Court occurred on 17 March 2025, at which point you entered a not guilty plea to the representative charge. The case was subsequently served and remitted to this court for trial in accordance with standard protocols. The prosecution assembled a considerable evidential package, comprising multiple hours of closed-circuit television footage, witness statements from retail staff and Loss Prevention Officers, alongside forensic material recovered following your arrest on 12 April 2025. The efficient management of such matters is, of course, governed by the Criminal Procedure Rules and the framework of Better Case Management (BCM), which seeks to ensure timeliness and the avoidance of unnecessary adjournments. It is regrettable that, in this instance, some procedural delays occurred, notably in the allocation of defence counsel under Legal Aid arrangements. The initial representation order was granted on 22 April, but repeated administrative queries delayed the instruction of a psychiatric expert until late June, a delay which serves only to elongate proceedings to the detriment of all parties. The trial was scheduled for 5 September 2025 but was vacated when you indicated your intention to enter a guilty plea following further disclosure. This plea was formally entered on 30 August 2025. While the plea is plainly a recognition of culpability, the circumstances of its timing necessitate careful reflection on the appropriate degree of credit. It is an unfortunate but perennial feature of acquisitive crime cases that defendants defer pleas to as late a stage as possible. This behaviour imposes significant burden on victims, witnesses, and prosecuting authorities alike, often requiring costly and time-consuming trial preparations which, in the end, may be rendered redundant by a last-minute admission. As set forth in precedent such as R v. Kennedy [2022] EWCA Crim 2073, late pleas attract a markedly reduced discount, reflecting the limited mitigation otherwise afforded. This court must balance considerations of efficiency, remorse, and public interest. While no one seeks to punish procedural rights, it is also important that the court's finite resources are not expended unnecessarily and that victims are spared avoidable distress. I acknowledge the efforts of the Crown Prosecution Service, particularly Ms. Fiona Shepherd, who has diligently managed the prosecution of this matter throughout. Similarly, Mr. Christopher Lane, instructed on your behalf, has presented the defence case conscientiously despite the constraints imposed by administrative delays. I am aware that, as elsewhere in the country, Legal Aid provision struggles under sustained pressures. These systemic challenges impact the justice delivery framework and merit ongoing scrutiny, but must not adversely affect the defendant’s fair treatment. At the plea and trial preparation hearing, the court was also provided with a number of supportive letters from voluntary sector agencies, including Brighton Community Support and TrustLink Outreach, which attest to your intermittent engagement with support services. I note these with cautious optimism pending fuller assessment from probation. Public safety and confidence in the justice system depend on an approach that is both rigorous and fair. The adversarial system depends on clarity of evidence, timely admissions, and measured sentencing responses which recognise individual culpability balanced against prospects for rehabilitation. The offence is charged under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines theft broadly as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. The sentencing guidelines applicable, as promulgated by the Sentencing Council in the Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (2022), require consideration of the offending’s seriousness, the harm caused to victims, previous convictions, and mitigation such as plea timing and personal circumstances. At this juncture, it is appropriate to outline the context in which this offending took place. Recent years have seen a significant uptick in acquisitive crime reported within the Brighton and Hove conurbation, mirroring national trends documented by the Home Office’s 2024 Crime Overview Report. This rise has exerted considerable pressure on community policing operations and local crime prevention initiatives, including the Retail Crime Prevention Partnership, which integrates efforts between police, business owners, and local council enforcement teams. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. Further, it is relevant to note the practical challenges encountered by shop staff in enforcing security measures to prevent theft. Retailers have reported increased staff turnover, fatigue, and in some cases, anxiety associated with the anticipation of possible confrontations. The obligation to remain vigilant and the need to adjust working hours to safeguard security is a non-trivial burden. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. While the inherent value of items stolen may appear minimal in isolation, their cumulative impact on small businesses—some struggling to maintain solvency in an uncertain economic climate—is material. This is reflected in victim impact statements submitted through the Brighton Business Association, which describe not only financial loss but also reputational damage and disruption to routine operations. The court acknowledges, with gratitude, the work of local agencies providing victim support amidst these challenges. Organisations such as SafeHarbour offer counselling and advice tailored to retail employees victimised by theft and related incidents. Their reports underscore the human dimension often overlooked in property crime cases, emphasizing effects on mental health, job satisfaction, and workplace culture at large. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. The case was also the subject of reports from the probation service, most notably from Ms. Imogen Clarke, probation officer assigned to your case since July 2025. Ms. Clarke’s Pre-Sentence Report, received on 15 October, sets out a detailed examination of your background, including social history, previous offending, and assessment of risk and needs. The report provides that you are 34 years old, with a modest employment history characterized by intermittent low-paid labour. There is no evidence of gang affiliation or involvement in organised crime. Your previous convictions include four prior instances of shoplifting dating from 2017 to 2022, including one occasion in which you received a conditional discharge. Ms. Clarke draws attention to your complex personal circumstances, including a history of unstable housing, sporadic engagement with substance misuse services, and reported low mood consistent with episodic depression. The report recommends enhanced linkage with community mental health teams as part of any rehabilitative package. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. The clinical dimension of your case was explored in a psychiatric report commissioned from Dr. Edward Fenner, consultant forensic psychiatrist, instructed pursuant to the defence application for mitigation. Dr. Fenner’s evaluation, dated 10 October 2025, provides a comprehensive analysis of your psychological profile. He notes no diagnosable major mental disorder, but identifies traits of impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and difficulties in affect regulation. Notably, Dr. Fenner points to a history of early childhood adversity and moderate substance misuse, primarily of alcohol, which has exacerbated emotional volatility. The report highlights your failure to engage consistently with available treatment, attributing this partially to ambivalence, but also to the fragmentation of local service provision. Commentary within notes indicates long waiting lists for targeted interventions, including cognitive behavioural therapy programmes and substance misuse clinics in the Brighton area. The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest. At this juncture, it is appropriate to reflect on the broader challenges confronting community supervision and mental health services. The demand for targeted programmes frequently outpaces available capacity, resulting in delays and drop-out. This systemic tension complicates attempts to address offending behaviour linked to underlying vulnerabilities. The probation service operates under persistent resource constraints while bearing the responsibility of safeguarding public safety through offender management. These pressures are amplified in urban centres experiencing social stratification, housing affordablility crises, and shifting demographic profiles. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. The legal framework which guides sentencing in your case draws heavily on the Theft Offences Guideline’s categorisation of culpability and harm. Although the value of individual items taken was modest, the court must consider the sophistication of the offending, the sustained nature of the pattern, and the resultant impact on victims and the community. I give particular weight to the degree of premeditation demonstrated, the evident knowledge of retail security protocols employed, and the repeated breaches of trust inherent in your conduct. These factors are rightly regarded as indicating high culpability. There is little evidence that your conduct was motivated by necessity, nor that you faced immediate deprivation. While financial hardship is plainly a reality in your circumstances, it cannot, as a matter of law, justify theft. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Prior authorities establish important principles relevant to sentencing in cases of this nature. In R v. Jamison [2023] EWCA Crim 1457, the Court affirmed that repeated acqusitive offending — particularly when involving exploitation of known security weaknesses — warrants custodial sentences where community-based interventions have been exhausted or ignored. The judgment also emphasised the importance of reflecting the cumulative harm, psychological as well as financial, inflicted on victims and staff. In R v. Tran [2021] EWCA Crim 962, sentencing for persistent shop theft was upheld where the defendant failed to engage meaningfully with support services despite multiple opportunities. The Court endorsed a deterrent approach, recognising the corrosive effect of repeat offending on community confidence. Although these precedents involve different factual matrices, the principles remain instructive for present purposes. Contrast may be drawn with cases such as R v. Martell [2020] EWCA Crim 1809, which involved a defendant whose offending was linked to diagnosed psychotic illness. There, the court underscored the primacy of treatment and rehabilitation and directed a hospital order in lieu of immediate custody. The facts before us do not warrant a comparable approach, as serious mental disorder is not demonstrated. It is also worth noting that another case recently before this court concerned charges of aggravated burglary (R v. Peters, 17.09.2025, Court 6B) involving the unlawful entry of a private dwelling while occupied. That offence involved threatening behaviour and led to a custodial sentence of 4 years. The circumstances differ fundamentally from those before me, but the broader reflections on personal security and public confidence in the justice system remain pertinent. Likewise of limited direct bearing, yet instructive in highlighting the court’s approach to culpability and harm, is R v. Whitfield [2019] EWCA Crim 1232 — a case involving fly-tipping on green belt land, resulting in environmental damage and community distress. Although the nature of the harm was quite distinct, the court stressed the importance of proportionality and the recognition that persistent offending erodes social cohesion. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. Turning to the question of personal mitigation, I observe that you have sought to provide written representations, including a carefully considered letter addressed to this court. I commend the obvious effort and reflection this letter demonstrates. However, I am constrained to note that reflection alone cannot substitute for tangible steps towards rehabilitation. You have, as already noted, declined several offers of assistance. Engagement with community mental health teams and substance misuse clinics has fluctuated and remains inconsistent. Such vacillation undermines risk reduction and prospects of desistance. The risk assessment contained in the Pre-Sentence Report assigns you to a medium likelihood of reoffending if unsupported, but acknowledges that focused interventions could substantially reduce that risk. It is essential that any sentence passed facilitates access to such programs where possible. The court further recognises the challenges posed by contemporary housing provision in Brighton, where long waiting lists for council accommodation and asylum seeker dispersal schemes contribute to residential instability. This can have compound effects on offenders’ ability to engage with supervision and support measures. This court also acknowledges, with respect, the complexity and valour of those working within the probation service and mental health sector. Their commitment to supporting individuals on the margins of society—often with limited resources and against pervasive systemic challenges—is commendable. I have been mindful of the efforts and limitations of the Legal Aid Agency in this matter. The delays in obtaining authorization for expert reports, while ultimately resolved, contributed to the extension of proceedings. Such administrative impediments serve no one’s interests and are an unfortunate recurring theme in criminal justice administration. The court also notes the absence of any co-defendants or associated parties in this charge. No evidence was presented of outside involvement or coercion. Similarly, no ancillary orders relating to confiscation or proceeds of crime are applicable in this case. In passing, it is worth remarking that procedural aspects of the hearing have been conducted with due decorum and professionalism. The recently refurbished Court 4 at the Brighton Crown Court provides appropriate facilities. Court usher Mr. Michael Jennings is to be thanked for his diligence in maintaining order and assisting participants. We are reminded that unlawful acts such as affray or possession of offensive weapons carry distinct and serious consequences, as was the case in the unrelated matter of R v. Leeds [2024] – a conviction involving use of a bladed article near a school. Despite the gravity of such offences, their nature lies outside the scope of present consideration. Similarly, in other unrelated offences such as fly-tipping or environmental regulation breaches, courts have signalled the importance of protecting public spaces, yet those offences necessitate separate enforcement frameworks. Overall, the principles of sentencing in shoplifting cases continue to evolve against the backdrop of wider social change, economic precarity, and the complex interplay of vulnerability and culpability. In summary, this offending comprises a persistent course of acquisitive crime, which, notwithstanding some personal difficulties, cannot be excused or tolerated. I shall order the preparation of a further Pre-Sentence Report and assessment from probation, focusing on the suitability of community-based interventions including cognitive skills programs, substance misuse treatment pathways, and housing support. The report is further requested to appraise the feasibility of a community order incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements or, where appropriate, a custodial sentence with structured supervision upon release. I reserve sentence until receipt and consideration of these reports and any further representations from the defence or prosecution.
