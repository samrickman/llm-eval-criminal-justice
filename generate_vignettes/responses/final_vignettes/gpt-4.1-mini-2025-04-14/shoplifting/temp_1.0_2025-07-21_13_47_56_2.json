MR H Case No. T2026/04587 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. THORNBURY Filed: 13 September 2026 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for a charge of theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, encompassing a series of shoplifting offences committed over an extended period predominantly within the Bristol city centre and adjoining retail districts. The prosecution alleges a sustained course of conduct marked by repeated dishonest appropriation of merchandise from various commercial premises, including independent shops and larger retail chains. Procedural Background Your initial arrest occurred on 18 May 2026, following a multi-agency investigation involving cooperation between local policing teams, retail loss prevention officers, and the Bristol Business Crime Reduction Scheme. The investigation was notable in its scope, entailing the collation of extensive CCTV footage, incident reports, and employee statements. This case was allocated to the Crown Court as part of the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative, with the objective of expediting proceedings and ensuring that all evidential matters were addressed in a timely fashion. The BCM protocol, established in 2016, aims to streamline case progression wherever possible, including setting strict deadlines for disclosure, plea confirmation, and trial readiness. It is appropriate to acknowledge that, notwithstanding occasional delays attributable to administrative pressures within the Legal Aid Agency—which will be further addressed—both counsel and court staff endeavoured to adhere to these timelines, facilitating a degree of procedural efficiency. The listing for sentence has thus proceeded without undue adjournment save for that necessitated by the late commissioning of a psychiatric report. It is regrettably common in cases involving repeat acquisitive offending for initial pleas of not guilty to be entered, only subsequently withdrawn in the face of incontrovertible evidence. Your defence followed this pattern, initially denying involvement at your first hearing on 4 June 2026, but entering a plea of guilty on the morning of the sentencing hearing. Whilst the law rightly permits defendants to pursue every appropriate legal avenue in their defence, the systemic impact of such late pleas must not be overlooked; they impose additional anxiety on victims and retail staff, burden public resources, and contribute to delays across the justice system. During your bail conditions, which included a curfew between 9pm and 6am, there were no reported breaches. The court notes, however, the significant investigatory effort invested by the police, including the deployment of covert surveillance operations and the use of financial data analysis techniques to substantiate the Crown’s case. These methods were authorised by judicial warrant in recognition of the seriousness of the suspected offences and the length of time over which they were alleged to have occurred. The timing and nature of your guilty plea attract consideration in the context of applicable case law governing sentence discounts for admissions. In R v. Harden [2023] EWCA Crim 812, the Court of Appeal reiterated that “the relevance of a plea in mitigation is not absolute but guided principally by its timing and the quality of acceptance of responsibility.” Delayed admissions may accordingly attract reduced credit where they fail to spare the court and witnesses the burden of contesting proof. Your plea, entered at this juncture, thus entitles you to a modest reduction, but far less than would have been afforded had it been tendered earlier. A proportional and measured approach to sentencing is imperative. This court is particularly mindful of the intricacies that underpin infractions of this nature: theft from retail premises may be misconstrued as victimless or inconsequential. Yet, as has been repeatedly affirmed in jurisprudence and social commentary alike, the cumulative impact on shop staff, business viability, and community cohesion is far from negligible. Loss prevention teams face mounting pressures, often in the absence of adequate resources, and employees bear the weight of increased anxiety, altered working patterns, and diminished workplace morale. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. It is, however, equally necessary to situate the offence within a broader societal and institutional landscape. The pressures on policing and community services—exacerbated by budget constraints, staffing shortages, and growing demand—cannot be ignored. Persistent low-level acquisitive crime diverts attention and resources from more serious threats, including violent offences and organised crime networks. The balance of deploying finite investigative capacity is delicate and remains subject to ongoing review by senior police command structures. The court was informed by material from a range of sources, including a detailed psychological report prepared by Dr Jasmin Latham, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, whose evaluation was undertaken subsequent to referral by defence solicitors and approved by the Legal Aid Agency only after protracted correspondence. Regrettably, as is increasingly common, this delay hampered the progression of the case and marginally curtailed the opportunity for robust sentencing submissions informed by expert opinion. Dr Latham’s report, while comprehensive and professionally composed, confirmed the absence of any major mental disorder or psychiatric illness. Rather, it described traits of impulsivity and experiential difficulties consistent with low self-esteem and episodic depressive symptoms, compounded by unemployment and unstable housing circumstances. The analysis cautioned against any inference that such vulnerabilities diminished responsibility or precluded accountability, emphasising instead the importance of targeted community interventions. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. The court must also take note of relevant state agencies and support organisations which, in this case, have engaged pragmatically with the defendant and those impacted. The Bristol Retail Support Network provided written submissions articulating the distress suffered by shop staff and the operational challenges posed by recurrent theft. Similarly, communications from the charity Bristol Shelterlink underscored the tenuous housing situation faced by Mr H and the consequent strain on engagement with rehabilitative services. While these reports reflect well on the broader ecosystem of delivery, it remains the defendant’s obligation to seize offered support. In assessing risk and rehabilitation potential, the Probation Service contributed an initial Offender Assessment System (OASys) analysis, which identified moderate risk of reoffending linked primarily to acquisitive behaviour, poor coping strategies under financial duress, and a lack of stable accommodation. The report advocated a structured intervention plan incorporating cognitive behavioural therapy modules and access to housing and employment assistance. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. The court is acutely aware that repeated offences of this nature can have a destabilising effect on both individual victims and the communities in which they reside. Increased fearfulness amongst retail workers often leads to changes in staffing patterns, the adoption of security measures such as locked display cabinets, and sometimes discouragement of customer footfall in affected areas. The economic ramifications, particularly for small independent stores, are far-reaching—nominal losses in stock are compounded by reputational damage and reduced foot traffic. An instructive parallel emerges from the decision in R v. Fenwick [2020] EWCA Crim 2149, where the Court of Appeal upheld a significant custodial sentence for repeated thefts from charity shops, noting that “the persistent targeting of vulnerable retail operators constitutes a particularly egregious breach of community trust.” While Fenwick’s conduct was arguably more expansive in its scope and impact, the principle that recurrent low-level acquisitive crime merits a firm response is instructive here. The Court also considers the guidance in R v. Skelton [2019] EWCA Crim 1712, dealing with cases of retail theft accompanied by threats or intimidation. There, the sentencing judge was reminded to approach the valuation of psychological harm with care, but to acknowledge that fear and disruption extend beyond material loss. While there is no allegation of violence or intimidation in this matter, the psychological component remains relevant insofar as staff reported distress linked to repeated exposure to offending. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. Turning to the facts of the case as presented, I summarise that evidence demonstrated the use of concealment tactics, deliberate timing during high-customer-volume periods, and occasional interactions exhibiting deceit and misrepresentation. The defendant made multiple entries into stores with concealed bags, sometimes using clothing to obscure merchandise, and employed distraction to divert the attention of employees. On occasion, you stayed in situ despite being challenged, often responding with averred apologies or feigned confusion. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. The court was particularly struck by the consistency of your method and the presence of prior sanctions for similar conduct—including a community resolution order imposed in 2024—and a conditional caution given in early 2025. Despite these interventions, you resumed offending within a short timeframe, suggesting that previous deterrent efforts were ineffectual. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. The accumulative nature of these offences must be stressed. Individually, each instance may appear minor, but collectively they represent sustained and wilful disregard for the property rights of business owners and the welfare of employees. While custodial sentences are not invariably the default response for shoplifting, persistent reoffending and failure to engage with support structures are clear aggravators. During the preparation of your defence, several references were made to your personal history, including childhood adversity, housing instability, and unemployment. The court accepts that such background factors can inform the context of offending. Yet, as established in R v. Collins [2022] EWCA Crim 876, while background may mitigate sentence, it cannot justify continuation of criminal behaviour. Responsibility and choice remain central tenets of the criminal law. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Mr H, the role of public protection weighs heavily in cases of this nature. The court must carefully balance your prospects for rehabilitation with the imperative to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. Shoplifting—though sometimes treated as a “minor” offence—can cause meaningful hardship and unsettle the delicate social contract between traders, customers, and the community at large. Several letters of character and support were submitted by friends, community workers, and housing advisers, all of which attest to your potential and good qualities; however, these must be considered alongside the facts of the offending and your demonstrable failure, thus far, to desist. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, claimed it wasn’t a serious crime and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. The court acknowledges ongoing operational challenges faced by probation and healthcare services in delivering consistent support to individuals wrestling with housing insecurity, substance misuse, or mental health concerns. The Labour Welfare Trust recently published findings highlighting notable delays in accessing cognitive behavioural therapy in the local area, with waiting times extending beyond two years in some cases. Such systemic pressures are regrettable but do not absolve individuals of their duties to engage with available assistance promptly. Furthermore, the court has reviewed correspondence between defence solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency, revealing repeated procedural correspondence concerning authorisation of expert reports and additional documentation. While the justice system endeavors to provide equitable access to representation and support, administrative delays such as those evidenced here inhibit timely justice and impose avoidable burdens on all parties. I apply the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, which emphasises that sentencing must reflect the harm caused, the culpability of the offender, and any aggravating or mitigating factors. The pattern of persistent offending, despite warnings and interventions, signals a high degree of culpability. Mitigating factors include your guilty plea, albeit late, and the complex social background described. Community-based sentences incorporating rehabilitation requirements remain preferable where there is a realistic prospect of compliance and public safety is not compromised. Custodial sentences are reserved for cases where alternative measures have been exhausted or are plainly unsuitable. I have considered the possibility of a suspended sentence order, mindful that repeated breach of prior community resolutions undermines their efficacy. The involvement of probation in formulating a plan that addresses impulsivity, financial management, and housing stability is critical. The potential imposition of a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement or Unpaid Work Order will be considered, subject to the forthcoming pre-sentence report. The court must also bear in mind that shoplifting cases often present complex risk assessments, particularly relating to potential escalation or entrenchment of offending behaviour. Careful monitoring and multi-agency involvement are appropriate safeguards. Finally, it is relevant to observe that this court has recently upgraded the courtroom facilities, including the installation of enhanced sound systems and improved digital evidence presentation suites, which have facilitated the clear and effective administration of justice in cases of this sort. The hearing today has been held in open court. Counsel appearing for the Crown was Ms Sarah Youman, whose submissions were succinct and informative; Mr David Clarke represented you under a Legal Aid order and provided detailed defence submissions. It is appropriate to place on record the quiet diligence of court staff and ushers, who maintain order with admirable professionalism despite the challenges inherent in an increasingly busy court schedule aggravated by periodic strike action affecting registrars and court clerks. I remind you, Mr H, of your rights to appeal pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged in this matter under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. At this stage, I will adjourn sentencing to allow the probation service to prepare a detailed pre-sentence report and, if appropriate, to liaise with local support agencies to identify a package of interventions commensurate with your needs and the public interest. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 13 September 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court in Bristol. A formal transcript of the proceedings has been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant will receive a copy of the report once completed, and the matter will be listed for sentence at the earliest practicable date.
