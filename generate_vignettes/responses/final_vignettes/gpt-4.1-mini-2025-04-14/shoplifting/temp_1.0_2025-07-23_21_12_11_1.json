Mr H Case No. T2025/14309 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. G. Whitmore Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following a charge concerning retail theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct subject to this prosecution relates to multiple incidents occurring over an extended period from late 2023 through April 2025, primarily within the commercial districts of Bexley and adjacent boroughs. Procedural History This case reached the Crown Court after initial proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court, where your application for bail was granted, subject to a conditional reporting requirement. The complexity of evidence and the pattern of offending necessitated a transfer to this higher court. The investigation was coordinated by the Metropolitan Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose longstanding mandate includes enhancing collaboration between retailers, police, and community safety agencies to address the growing challenge posed by persistent retail theft. The investigative phase was protracted, reflecting both the procedural intricacies characteristic of multiple-location offending and the difficulties posed by repeated offenders who often adopt counter-surveillance measures. Significant police resources were deployed during the investigatory period, including operational patrols, covert surveillance, and the analysis of extensive digital evidence. There was also engagement with specialised units such as the Retail Industry Theft Prevention Unit and the Digital Forensics Team, whose workload across violent and property crimes remains substantial. It is instructive to observe that such resourcing represents a significant investment of public funds; diversion from other pressing investigative priorities due to repeat acquisitive offending remains a matter of recurrent concern within policing strategy documents. This is not to diminish the essential work done by officers but rather to set the wider context in which this matter unfolds. The use of the Better Case Management framework was applied here following the transfer to the Crown Court, with a series of case management hearings held on 19 May, 14 July, and 10 August 2025 focusing on the disclosure schedules, witness availability, and expert report submissions. The case proceeded with relative procedural expediency, despite some delay occasioned by your solicitor’s request for instruction of a forensic psychologist to assess potential mitigating factors, which was initially delayed due to Legal Aid funding disputes. It is regrettable, and indeed a matter on which this court is compelled to comment, that the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative handling of such applications has become an increasingly frequent source of delay in cases involving vulnerable defendants or those requiring expert input. The court acknowledges the unrelenting pressures faced by the agency but emphasises the critical importance of swift resolution to preserve timely access to justice. You initially entered a not guilty plea at the first listing but subsequently indicated your intention to change that plea on 4 September 2025. There was further hesitation before it was formally entered on 11 September, shortly before today's hearing. Let it be noted that late pleas in cases of this nature, while admissible, attract reduced credit given their impact on case management and witness preparation as established in R v. Marshall [2020] EWCA Crim 1127 and reaffirmed in recent appellate authorities. The Court must consider, among other things, the effect that such delays have on witnesses, many of whom are low-paid retail workers with limited availability and whose testimony is vital to public confidence in the justice process. Factoring in these considerations falls squarely within the discretion entrusted to this court in awarding plea discounts. The multiplicity and dispersion of the offences in question demanded extensive collation of evidence from separate prosecutions and joint working with the Safer Neighbourhood Teams of Bexley and Greenwich. Such cooperation, while improving over recent years, remains imperfect. The procedural burden of inter-agency collaboration — including regular MARAC meetings and data-sharing irregularities — continues to tax the capacities of participating parties. This court encourages renewed efforts in that regard, as seamless multi-agency cooperation is foundational to effective criminal justice outcomes. Of note, the current case has proceeded amidst a backdrop of increased reporting of antisocial behaviour and acquisitive crime across south-east London boroughs, stressing the importance of public reassurance through proportionate sentencing. The court has also received written representations from the Bexley Retailers’ Association, a voluntary body representing independent traders, who have observed a tangible impact on staffing morale and turnover caused by repeat shoplifting. Their contribution, while not strictly evidential, forms part of the wider social fabric considered during sentencing. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. It is appropriate here to recall that the principles governing sentencing for theft offences under the Theft Act have been refined through successive appellate judgments. The overriding objective emphasises proportionality and the balance between deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. The comprehensive guideline published by the Sentencing Council in 2023 remains the primary reference for categorising offending by seriousness and culpability levels. The court is mindful of the specific aggravating and mitigating features outlined within the guideline, including offending pattern, target vulnerability, use of planning or sophistication, and impact on victims and business operations. The financial value alone may not reflect the true gravity of persistent theft, given the cumulative economic and psychological harm evident in these contexts. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. I am further directed by R v. Smart [2019] EWCA Crim 862, which addressed sentencing for habitual shoplifting offences. The court observed that persistent theft despite prior interventions signifies a serious disregard for social norms and legal constraints, warranting custodial disposals where community sentences prove insufficient. Within that judgment lies an implicit cautionary note warning against the complacency some offenders show towards diversionary efforts and informal resolutions. It must be acknowledged, however, that the court is also required to have regard to any evidence of vulnerability or personal circumstance which may diminish culpability or suggest a more rehabilitative approach is suitable, dependent on risk assessment outcomes. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. Extensive victim impact statements were tendered in the form of written attestations from store managers and staff, describing the emotional toll wrought by repeated thefts, the financial consequences on small businesses, and the knock-on effect on community cohesion. While the absence of physical violence is noted, the fear, frustration, and anxiety induced—particularly among lower-paid employees often working alone or in limited-hours shifts—cannot be underestimated. Such statements highlight the underappreciated harm caused by acquisitive offences. The psychological stress placed upon retail workers, many of whom have reported adopting evasive or avoidant postures towards customers, refusing breaks or adjusting schedules, speaks to a broader societal impact beyond immediate financial loss. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. It would be remiss not to mention the observations of the probation service, who have conducted an initial assessment recommending a full pre-sentence report. The report will examine your background, likelihood of reoffending, and suitability for various rehabilitative interventions. Among possible measures are participation in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy courses, financial budgeting workshops, and substance misuse support where relevant. The probation officer has noted your unstable housing situation and some evidence of periodic substance use, though these are not currently quantified as psychiatric diagnoses. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. In this regard, the psychiatric evidence merits specific attention. Dr Amelia Crane, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, provided a comprehensive assessment report dated 28 August 2025. Dr Crane concluded that while you do not meet threshold criteria for a severe mental disorder, there are identifiable features of impulsiveness and mild mood dysregulation. The psychologist also noted your history of trauma and adverse childhood experiences, but these factors alone were deemed insufficient to justify a diminished responsibility plea or override sentencing principles. Dr Crane’s recommendations focus on targeted psychological interventions aimed at improving coping strategies and reducing criminogenic thinking. It is significant that despite previous offers to support engagement with mental health services and social care, your uptake has been sporadic. That, the court is bound to note, does not assist the case for mitigation. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. This court has taken the unusual step of reviewing case law relevant to the present factual matrix but tangential to your own conduct. For instance, in R v. Fields [2022] EWCA Crim 1421, the defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary in the context of a domestic dispute; that offence, though distinct, serves as a reminder of how sentencing courts grapple with balancing personal mitigation and public protection where harm is more physical and immediate. This contrasts with instances like R v. Nash [2023] EWCA Crim 734, where possession of an offensive weapon in a school car park led to significant custodial sentences aimed at deterring young offenders and safeguarding educational environments. These cases, while unrelated on their facts, exemplify the range of factors courts must consider and the gradations within sentencing jurisprudence. Moreover, the present matter proceeded despite the absence of complicating factors such as co-defendant involvement or contested evidence. In this respect, it differs materially from cases like R v. O’Brien and others [2020] EWCA Crim 2019, where four accused were implicated in a conspiracy to import Class A drugs and where guilty pleas were entered late amid complex evidential disputes. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. It is instructive also to reflect on the socio-economic backdrop against which many offences such as yours occur. In recent years, the rise in street homelessness and the visibility of begging in urban centres have strained the capacity of support services. Local housing associations and voluntary sector workers frequently highlight increasing demand juxtaposed against declining budgets, with resultant pressures on crisis shelters, soup kitchens, and outreach programmes. At the same time, there has been a cultural shift in expectations and attitudes towards minor offending and public order. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram frequently feature content purportedly glamorising shoplifting or “retail challenges,” potentially normalising behaviour that until recently was regarded as socially unacceptable. The court is acutely aware that such phenomena complicate the task of deterrence and require a judicious approach balancing accountability with opportunities for reform. Mr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping. In closing, I wish to acknowledge the efforts of all those involved in bringing this matter to conclusion: the dedication of officers from the Bexley Borough Policing Team, the diligence of prosecution counsel Ms Sally Prentice, and the advocacy of your legal representatives, Mr David Marlow, who has ably instructed medical and psychological experts despite funding hurdles. Thanks are also extended to court staff for their efficiency in listing and facilitating proceedings in an overburdened courtroom environment recently refurbished to improve accessibility. As is routine, I shall defer final sentencing until the receipt of a pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation Service. This will provide a fuller picture of your personal circumstances, including any ongoing risk factors and an assessment of amenability to community-based interventions. Alongside that, the court will consider any additional representations from your legal team or other interested parties. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bexley. The court has ensured that a transcript of the hearing has been made in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules and that records are appropriately managed under existing data protection obligations. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are to be reserved.
