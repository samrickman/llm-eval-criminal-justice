MR H Case No. T2026/00458 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. L. Fairborne Filed: 17 September 2026 Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence in respect of a charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to a series of shoplifting incidents that occurred over an extended period within the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea and parts of Westminster. The allegations cover multiple thefts involving goods from a variety of retail outlets, including pharmacies and convenience stores, and raise significant concerns about the cumulative disruption caused to local businesses and their employees. Procedural History You were first apprehended on 12 June 2026 following investigative work by the Metropolitan Police’s Sterling District CID and the Kensington Business Crime Forum—a regional partnership aimed at combatting retail theft and related issues. The investigation drew upon a synthesis of intelligence reports, CCTV surveillance from multiple premises, and coordination with retail loss prevention officers. Notably, this enquiry also entailed collaboration with the London Retail Analyst Unit, whose crime pattern analysis sought to isolate and identify recurrent offenders. These efforts culminated in your arrest and subsequent caution under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Such multi-agency cooperation, while commendable, also serves as a reminder of the significant administrative load placed upon law enforcement and retail entities. The process of evidentiary collation—especially in offences burdened by minor monetary values—can be exhaustively painstaking, reliant on voluntary witness cooperation and technological interpretation of variable CCTV quality. It is a testament to the perseverance of these bodies that, despite limited resources and often competing priorities, cases such as this proceed to prosecution in a reasonably timely fashion. Following your initial interview, you were charged on 26 June 2026 with a consolidated offence representing multiple shoplifting episodes spanning the previous eighteen months. The case was allocated to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management protocol, a procedural architecture designed to streamline pre-trial timelines and enhance judicial oversight. The plea and trial preparation hearing was initially listed for 21 July 2026 but was adjourned at the defence’s request to secure psychiatric evaluation and additional witness statements. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the statutory touchstone for offences of dishonesty involving appropriation of property. While low-level retail theft may sometimes be appropriately handled summarily, a pattern of repeat offending within a community setting necessarily attracts proportionate judicial scrutiny reflecting the aggravations attendant upon such conduct. In addition to statute, this court must also engage with the Sentencing Council’s guidelines on theft-related offending, which underscore the weight to be given to features such as persistence, targeting of vulnerable premises, the psychological impact on staff, and the degree of sophistication or planning evinced by the offender. Of particular pertinence is the approach articulated in R v Goldberg [2014] EWCA Crim 1584, where the Court of Appeal affirmed that a sustained course of theft from multiple premises, even where each individual act involved relatively low-value goods, can justify custodial sentences, particularly where previous interventions have failed. Similarly, R v Thomas [2019] EWCA Crim 921, a case involving repeat shoplifting from community pharmacies, recognised the compounded harm caused by undermining staff confidence and operational disruption. Although no violence was involved, the Court noted the cumulative psychological toll on retail employees and the broader community impact as key considerations in sentencing. Conversely, R v Jennings [2017] EWCA Crim 431 established the principle that late guilty pleas, particularly when entered after contested pre-trial proceedings, attract reduced—and sometimes minimal—discounts during sentencing, owing to the added burden and costs imposed on victims, witnesses, and the court system. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. The facts, as drawn from a combination of surveillance footage, witness testimony, and forensic evidence, reveal a calculated pattern of behaviour, employing a range of diversionary tactics and concealment methods. On several occasions, you were observed interacting with staff in a manner designed to deflect suspicion, including feigning phone conversations or engaging in apparently benign exchanges. This conduct reflects a degree of sophistication and forethought. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. You were seen selecting high-demand items, notably over-the-counter medications and personal care products, often at times coinciding with busy periods or shift changes. One particular incident, noted on 4 February 2026, involved the removal of multiple hygiene products from a high-footfall pharmacy during a luncheon hour, demonstrating brazen disregard for the presence of customers and staff. On that occasion, a witness briefly attempted to intervene but was deterred by your assertive demeanour. The procedural context of this matter is instructive. The delay in advancing the case to trial can largely be attributed to complexities surrounding Legal Aid coverage for psychiatric assessment, which took longer than anticipated due to administrative backlogs within the Legal Aid Agency. This regrettable delay underscores systemic challenges faced by courts and defence practitioners alike, particularly in securing timely authorization for expert evidence when a defendant’s mental health is a factor under consideration. Mr H was recorded returning to the same cornershop four times in three weeks, each time taking alcohol and tobacco goods. The court has received and carefully considered reports from Dr Hannah Marques, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence. Dr Marques’ assessment acknowledges a diagnosis of moderate depression and identifies personality traits suggestive of impulsive behaviour and emotional dysregulation. However, she is clear that there was no evidence of a severe enduring mental disorder that would substantially impair your criminal responsibility at the time of the offences. She further highlights the absence of prior psychiatric treatment and emphasizes a level of disengagement with available mental health services. This raises concern about the systemic barriers faced by individuals experiencing psychological distress yet reluctant or unable to access assistance—a persistent theme in cases of recurring acquisitive offending. The court’s own experience with mental health referrals in acquisitive crime cases corroborates the difficulties in addressing overlapping vulnerabilities. Recent research from the National Mental Health Justice Project continues to highlight the gaps between service provision and the practical realities for defendants caught at the intersection of criminality and unmet health needs. Somewhat tangentially, the case of R v Staines [2021] EWCA Crim 1140 is instructive regarding the balance to be struck between acknowledging mental health difficulties and ensuring public protection. In that case, the court affirmed the appropriateness of custodial sentencing where a defendant’s disorder did not effectively mitigate culpability for offences causing direct risk of harm in the community. Further complicating the landscape is the ongoing resource deficit within probation services. The National Probation Service continues to face workforce shortages, which impedes timely preparation of pre-sentence reports and limits opportunities for meaningful engagement with offenders prior to court. Mr H created a distraction by asking about Oyster Cards and took advantage of the moment to remove a display item from behind the counter. Victim impact statements submitted by store managers provide insight into the real-world effect of your actions. Several staff expressed heightened anxiety and diminished morale, leading to changes in work patterns including the shoring up of security measures and alterations to shift scheduling. One manager detailed how the persistent thefts prompted a review of staffing levels in which additional resource allocation was deemed necessary at significant operational cost. The defendant employed a magnet to detach a security tag from the item, and the magnet was located when police searched The defendant. Sentencing must take account of these consequences, which extend beyond tangible financial loss. The emotional and psychological burden borne by retail employees in the face of repeated offending merits no less consideration, especially where vulnerable or lone-working staff feel exposed or intimidated. The sentencing framework articulated in the Theft Offences guideline rightly emphasises that harm to victims encompasses both economic and emotional elements. As noted in R v Patel [2020] EWCA Crim 748, the distress and disruption caused to staff by repeat shoplifting cannot be lightly dismissed. This court also recognises the supportive submissions made on your behalf by representatives of StreetAid, a local charitable organisation providing outreach and support for individuals experiencing homelessness and financial instability. Their witness statement illuminates the broader social context in which your offending took place, including the pressures of insecure housing and chronic unemployment. While such factors contextualise behaviour, they do not excuse it. It remains the responsibility of all individuals to refrain from criminal conduct regardless of personal hardship. The court is mindful that many similarly disadvantaged persons engage constructively with support services without resort to unlawful acts. The defendant confessed to offloading the stolen items at local pubs and a car boot sale, where his actions unsettled customers. It is noteworthy that despite prior warnings, a community resolution, and referrals to diversion programmes, you resumed the offending behaviour after brief cessation periods. This relapse pattern signals a degree of resistance to intervention and raises questions about the viability of rehabilitative approach without judicially imposed conditions. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while obscuring surveillance with paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The Crown, represented by Ms Jenny Prescott, has made clear their position that while remorse is acknowledged, the late entry of your guilty plea reduces the credit that may be afforded. Defence counsel, Mr Russell Crow, has urged the court to consider your personal circumstances and the mitigating effect of your mental health history. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. Before addressing sentencing considerations, it is pertinent to record several procedural and contextual observations. The court notes with gratitude the clear and well-substantiated submissions made by both counsel which have materially assisted in clarifying contested issues. The case management has proceeded comparatively smoothly, notwithstanding the challenges in securing timely psychiatric evidence and the complexity of co-ordinating multi-jurisdictional evidence collation. It is also appropriate to place on record the valued contributions of the Kensington Retail Support Service, who have maintained engagement with the affected businesses and contributed to victim impact reporting. While their resources are inevitably stretched, their role is integral to the restorative measures ongoing in the community. To digress briefly, this court has noted a series of prosecutions recently involving co-defendants of various sorts including individuals charged with fly-tipping of commercial waste, affray in licensed premises, and even a redress of cases involving online fraud schemes unrelated to the current matter. These cases, while procedurally distinct, exemplify the growing administrative pressure faced by our justice system. The capacity of investigative units is further compromised by the diversion of forensic digital analysts towards cybercrime enquiries and complex organised crime investigations, leaving less specialist resource available for acquisitive crime follow-up. Combined with staffing shortfalls in probation and court administration, these factors contribute to case delays and highlight the fragility of systems underpinning public protection. A further albeit tangential case involved the tenant of your residential complex, who faced unrelated proceedings for breach of anti-social behaviour orders issued following noise complaints. While not pertinent to your conduct, this illustrates the multi-faceted challenges faced by local authority housing officers in managing diverse tenancy issues alongside criminal investigations. Returning to the matter at hand, the court must articulate a proportionate sentencing response that reflects the seriousness of the offending, addresses public protection, provides appropriate punishment, and encourages rehabilitation. Your record shows four prior convictions, all related to theft offences. The multiplicity and pattern of your offending suggest an entrenched course which has not been deterred by previous interventions. The economic impact, while modest individually, aggregates into a significant loss, compounding the undermining of retail confidence. Mitigation includes your expressed remorse, as manifested in your belated guilty plea, and the acknowledged contribution of mental health difficulties. Nonetheless, the late timing of the plea necessarily limits credit in accordance with established principles. It is noted that the Sentencing Council’s guidelines allow for community orders incorporating unpaid work and rehabilitation activity requirements, particularly where the court considers that such measures offer realistic prospects for reform. The pre-sentence report will be essential in assessing your suitability for such interventions and the level of risk you may present. Given the chronic nature of your offending and the impact on victims, this court is predisposed to consider a custodial sentence of determinate length as appropriate, but remains open to representations based on probation input and further expert assessments. The matter was previously listed for sentence on 9 September 2026 but was adjourned to allow for receipt of reports and the latest psychiatric evaluation. I thank both Ms Prescott and Mr Crow for their professional conduct throughout and acknowledge the contributions of probation officer Ms Lorna Dunne, whose initial briefing was instructive. I also note for the record the court’s awareness of systemic delays within the Legal Aid Agency, which have affected timely instruction of experts in this jurisdiction and continue to affect timely justice delivery. Sentencing remarks such as these are issued this day, 17 September 2026, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Kensington. The hearing has been conducted in open court, with full attendance by all parties. The proceedings have been recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal sentence within 28 days under the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are applicable in this case. Costs are reserved pending further submissions. I reserve final judgment on sentence for a subsequent hearing scheduled following receipt of an updated pre-sentence report and any further representations. This is necessary in order to effect an informed and balanced disposition consistent with the interests of justice and public protection.
