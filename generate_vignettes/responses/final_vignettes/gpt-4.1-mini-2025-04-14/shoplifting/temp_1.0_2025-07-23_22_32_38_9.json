Mr. H Case No. T2025/13894 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. M. Glassford Filed: 16 September 2025 Mr. H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on a single count of theft, embodying a repeated course of shoplifting offences committed within the jurisdiction of Riverside and its adjoining boroughs over the course of approximately two years. The matter has been deemed suitable for trial in the Crown Court due to the volume and nature of the evidence, as well as the representation exercised, notwithstanding the relatively low monetary values involved per incident. Procedural History The procedural trajectory of this case reflects, in many respects, the intricate and often protracted journey which characterises cases of acquisitive crime at this level. Arrested on 10 May 2025, Mr. H was taken into custody following an extensive operation led by officers of the Riverside Borough Policing Unit’s dedicated Retail Crime Taskforce. The investigation was preceded by liaison with the Riverside Business Crime Partnership, a local initiative tasked with coordinating responses to persistent retail crime affecting small and independent establishments. This partnership has become a vital cog in the machinery of local crime prevention despite the numerous bureaucratic obstacles it encounters, including inconsistent participation from certain chain stores and the perennial issue of limited resources. The arrest was the culmination of several weeks of covert surveillance, undertaken alongside the monitoring of publicly accessible CCTV footage obtained from local shops and commercial properties. During this period, discreet witness observations were regularly recorded, creating what might be considered an exemplar of multi-agency collaboration, albeit one which bears the hallmarks of the systemic underfunding that is the unfortunate norm in policing today. Resource-intensive operations such as this are an increasing strain on local forces tasked not only with responding to violent crime but also with addressing the upsurge of what may be termed “low-level but high-volume” offending, a category into which persistent retail theft so often falls. It must be remarked that despite such pressures, the Taskforce personnel involved demonstrated commendable diligence and an admirable commitment to effective case management, ensuring compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules and the Better Case Management (BCM) standards. The initial bail hearing took place on 12 May 2025 with conditions imposed to restrict access to certain retail establishments known to have been targeted. Plea and case management hearings followed on 23 June and 15 July respectively, where defence counsel made early representations concerning the defendant’s background and mitigation relevant to sentencing. There were modest delays occasioned by the late arrival of comprehensive reports from the Probation Service and a psychiatric evaluation, themselves the product of backlog in public health services. It is, regrettably, an all too familiar refrain that cases involving low-level acquisitive offending encounter such procedural delay—not least due to the increased administrative burden placed on Legal Aid practitioners and their often congested access to appropriate specialist assessments. In this instance, despite well-meant efforts by defence teams and court administration, securing funding authorisations for expert witness instructions was protracted, with approval only arriving in late July, thereby extending the trajectory of these proceedings beyond what might have been expected for a case of this nature. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. As the court is cognisant, offences of this type are properly prosecuted where there is evidence of sustained, deliberate conduct that goes beyond isolated acts. In Riverside Borough, the scale of shoplifting incidents rose significantly between 2022 and 2024, as established in reports by Ms. Angela Trent, a senior crime analyst at the local police command. The findings, submitted for court reference, detailed that reported retail theft offences increased by nearly 18% in that period, with a disproportionate share occurring in smaller, independent convenience stores. The impact on such businesses is not merely financial; it inflicts a tangible diminution of staff morale and public confidence in safety and order—an effect noted consistently in victim impact statements furnished by several shop managers. Also worthy of note is the wider civic and judicial context framing your case. Incidents of retail theft, though often dismissed by the public as “victimless,” have well-documented consequences for the sustainability of local high streets and the livelihood of both owners and employees. The economic fallout ripple effect extends beyond immediate loss, touching upon increased insurance premiums, the need for enhanced security measures, and ultimately a diminished sense of community cohesion. Mr H's niece’s pram was used to stash boxed razor cartridges and protein powder in order to avoid drawing attention. The Metropolitan Retail Association recently reported that the cost of theft-related losses for small businesses has outstripped the resources available for prevention and staff training, with many relying heavily on voluntary sector organisations such as the Shopkeepers Support Network, which offer practical and emotional assistance to retail workers impacted by persistent misdemeanours. Their submissions to this court highlight the often unseen strain borne by staff who face frequent intimidation, loss of earnings, and, in some cases, threats of violence. The court regards these observations with appropriate gravity, noting that the rehabilitation of offenders must be aligned with safeguarding measures designed to protect those who uphold daily commerce. That said, the offence of which you stand convicted is not associated with violence or threats, but rather with patently deliberate dishonesty. The Crown’s evidence, as has been outlined in exhaustive detail during trial, is underpinned by the collation of multiple discrete incidents, each characterised by methodical planning and, as the prosecution submits, an outright disregard for legal and social norms. This disregard was visually captured in the surveillance videos, and reinforced by statements, including that of store employees who testified to feelings of apprehension and anxiety caused by repeated exposure to your activities. It is pertinent here to pause and note the importance of the BCM model referred to earlier. Introduced with the purpose of facilitating a more structured approach to criminal case processing, particularly for offences considered “low severity,” the BCM regime directs parties to cooperate in early case resolution and efficient evidence exchange to avoid unnecessary trials and adjournments. In this case, much was made of the benefits—and, indeed, the limitations—of the BCM framework. While overall compliance was adhered to, it was apparent in the pre-trial preparation hearings that there were significant challenges, notably the multiplicity of witness schedules among busy staff, some of whom no longer remain employed at the implicated premises. This disrupted the chronology to some degree but did not undermine the coherence or reliability of the Crown’s case. On the point of testimony, it is instructive to consider the detailed victim impact assessments received from representatives of the Riverside Traders Alliance. Their accounts lend weight to the argument that persistent shoplifting does not only affect immediate victims but also the broader retail economy, fostering an atmosphere of vulnerability and discouragement among smaller outlets struggling amid the wider challenges of consumer behaviour changes and rising operating costs. At the plea and case management hearing held on 23 June, you elected to enter a not guilty plea, maintaining your position through initial proceedings. The choice to contest the charges is your right, and the court respects this. However, the evidence as subsequently advanced was compelling. The defence ultimately accepted the inevitability of conviction and entered a guilty plea on 7 September 2025, just prior to the listed trial date. The timing of guilty pleas in retail theft matters is a matter of judicial scrutiny, not least as it impacts the allocation of credit. As the Court of Appeal noted in R v. Danton [2023] EWCA Crim 1914, a plea entered shortly before trial, after exhaustive evidence gathering and witness preparation, is entitled to less discount than one entered at the earliest reasonable opportunity. The rationale, plain as it is, revolves around manifest and genuine acceptance of responsibility and the avoidance of unnecessary procedural demands on the court and witnesses—a principle long upheld in authorities such as R v. Sinclair [2018] EWCA Crim 622. Credit is not a ceremonial gesture but a mechanism designed to recognise early remediation. Unlike your case, reference might be made by way of extant jurisprudence to R v. Parvani [2020] EWCA Crim 772, in which the defendant’s early plea in a case involving aggravated burglary warranted an enhanced reduction. While such cases differ starkly by definition from your own, the general principle regarding timing and procedural economy stands firm. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. It is important to clarify that the offences here do not involve any form of intimidation or violence. Nor has there been any report of your being part of an organised retail crime group. Such distinguishing factors matter when considering both culpability and sentencing. This court also notes the absence of any allegation of coercion or exploitation of vulnerability in the present case, removing certain complexities inherent to some acquisitive crime prosecutions. In an apparently unrelated matter, the court was made aware of a recent conviction involving a co-defendant in the neighbouring district of Eastmoor, who was involved in an aggravated burglary and assault upon a responding officer. That defendant, now serving an extended custodial sentence for the use of a bladed article during the incident, is not you and no evidence has emerged linking you to his conduct. It is an unfortunate but consistent feature of the criminal justice system that defendants can sometimes be artificially associated with unrelated offences when appearing in connected proceedings. The court must guard against conflation or unfair extrapolation. Moreover, there was some confusion during the trial preparation hearings regarding a parole violation notice served on a former flatmate of yours, who was found in possession of controlled substances during a separate police search. The flatmate involved did not reside at your current accommodation and is not implicated by any evidence in the present charges. It is essential that such matters, while naturally of concern to the court in a broader context of social risk, are not conflated with your culpability here. Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. Turning now to expert assessments, the court has had the benefit of a detailed psychiatric evaluation commissioned from Dr. Robert Ivens, a consultant forensic psychiatrist with over twenty years’ experience in the assessment of offenders with acquisitive offending patterns. Dr. Ivens’s report was comprehensive and professionally rendered, offering observations on your psychological history, cognitive profile, and risk markers. Dr. Ivens notes that while you do not meet criteria for any major mental disorder, there are identifiable personality traits—such as impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and a tendency to engage in risk-taking behaviours—that may partially explain your offending pattern. Importantly, the report emphasises a degree of ambivalence towards rehabilitation services and a history of missed appointments with community support agencies. The psychiatric evaluation, while dispassionate in tone, underscores the challenges facing professionals seeking to engage defendants like yourself in meaningful intervention. I must record here a note of gratitude to Dr. Ivens and the clinical team at Riverside NHS Trust, whose mental health services are operating under immense pressure, exacerbated by staff shortages, increased demand, and waiting list delays. Such systemic factors, while external to your conduct, form part of the backdrop against which these cases unfold—adding complexity to case management and intervention planning. The Probation Service’s pre-sentence report further paints a picture of your current social circumstances. You are 34 years of age, unemployed for the past 18 months, and residing in temporary accommodation arranged through the Local Authority Housing Department. The report identifies longstanding financial instability and a fragmented family support network, though it makes clear that there is no evidence of dependency or coercion. You have four prior convictions for shoplifting offences — none involving violence — with the most recent dating back three years, for which a community order was imposed. The report also highlights your inconsistent engagement with voluntary sector support, specifically noting unsuccessful attempts to sustain participation in budgeting advice clinics and substance misuse programmes. Those findings bear significance owing to their potential in framing effective rehabilitative strategies, a subject to which this court will return. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. As this court has observed on numerous occasions, such details notwithstanding, the law does not extend mitigation for failure to access available help, particularly where there is no compelling explanation for such non-engagement. While this court recognises the multiple barriers faced by individuals at the margins, it equally relies upon the notion of individual responsibility in navigating such adversity. By way of illustration of the relevance of these observations, it is instructive to consider the recent case of R v. Stanton [2024] EWCA Crim 1712, in which the Court of Appeal reaffirmed that ongoing failure to attend appointments and accept tailored support in the community diminished the prospects for a non-custodial sentence, especially where the offending displayed marked persistence. Like your case, Stanton involved multiple shoplifting incidents across town centre shops, with the defendant demonstrating limited receptivity to intervention until the margin of sentencing. The court emphasised the importance of demonstrable compliance and proactive rehabilitation as mitigating considerations. The starting point for sentencing is prescribed by the Theft Act 1968 and the Sentencing Council’s theft guideline (2021). The guideline mandates that offences involving persistent shoplifting with premeditated planning attract a custodial threshold, especially where impact on victims and public interest are significant. Aggravating factors include the targeting of vulnerable premises, repetition despite formal warnings, and failure to engage with rehabilitative services. Mitigating features in your case are limited to your timely guilty plea — albeit late in the process — and absence of personal aggravators such as violence or threats. The impact assessments provided, while acknowledging feelings of vulnerability among retail staff, indicate that the loss suffered, while non-trivial, was modest in financial terms. However, it is also important to account for the cumulative psychological toll on workers subjected to repeated offences, including stress, scheduling changes, and referral to trauma-informed practice. The Sentencing Council’s guidance on community orders contemplates that custodial sentences are not invariably appropriate but makes clear that persistent acquisitive offending requires proportionate punishment to achieve deterrence and public protection. The availability of community sanctions incorporating structured activity requirements, cognitive skills provision, and financial management support should be explored fully, consistent with the individual’s likely compliance. Furthermore, the imposition of unpaid work is a standard component in these contexts but must be balanced against personal circumstances. I am mindful of the fact that the Probation Report recommends consideration of such community interventions but expresses reservation about your engagement history. These concerns are consistent with the wider clinical observations of Dr. Ivens. Such caution is well placed and will inform the report writer’s recommendations to me. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. The court notes with concern, as it must, that despite previous disposals intended to divert you from criminal activity, including a conditional discharge and a community resolution, offending has persisted. Such recidivism undermines efforts by the justice system to provide meaningful rehabilitation and challenges notions of deterrence. In the field of acquisitive crime, one may not overlook the burdens imposed upon resources by repeated investigations, victim support processes, and the consequential adjustment of retail premises’ security postures. The administrative labour flowing from persistent offenders such as yourself stretches police capacity, court time, and victim services—resources which might be otherwise deployed to address matters of more immediate or severe harm. The court is conscious of the tension inherent in these proceedings—between, on one hand, striving for rehabilitative outcomes that acknowledge underlying social determinants, and on the other, necessarily imposing restraint and deterrence to protect the community. This tension is embodied in the evolving case law, among which the decision in R v. Fairclough [2019] EWCA Crim 2145 remains pertinent, illustrating that community-based sentences, though desirable, ought not be granted where risk and recidivism suggests unlikelihood of compliance. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. I must also record a broader reflection on the current pressures facing the Probation Service nationally. Staffing shortages, increasing caseloads, and funding reductions have diminished capacity to supervise and support offenders adequately. This systemic strain has often been raised in cases of this nature, where the court must consider carefully the viability of imposed orders in delivering meaningful change. The adequacy of available programmes for shoplifting offenders, including cognitive behavioural therapy and financial advice, is unevenly distributed geographically, further complicating sentencing dispositions. Moreover, the court notes the sometimes-frustrating delays in getting defendants properly assessed and referred to appropriate interventions, as was evident in the timeline of this case. It is an enduring concern that unmet demand and administrative bottlenecks erode effective justice outcomes, leaving both victims and offenders caught in a cycle of frustration. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. In summary, Mr. H, your case typifies many of the challenges faced by the criminal justice system when confronting persistent low-level acquisitive offending. The burden of repeated unlawful acts, the impact on victims and businesses, the limitations of rehabilitative opportunities, and the necessity to uphold public confidence in the rule of law all converge in your sentencing. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Riverside. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be dispatched to the relevant authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. I make no order as to costs at this juncture. I reserve sentence pending receipt of a full pre-sentence report incorporating risk assessment and recommendations for appropriate rehabilitative interventions.
