MR H Case No. H2025/14067 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. KENDRICKS Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this Honourable Court today for sentence in respect of offences of theft, committed by shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending in question was committed over a period beginning in May 2024, extending through to April of this year, and involved various retail outlets located primarily within the greater Hartford metropolitan area and its surrounding suburbs. Procedural Background Your prosecution has followed a path not unusual for cases of this nature, albeit with complications arising from certain procedural delays unrelated to the substance of your offending. You were first arrested on 10 May 2025, subsequent to an investigation coordinated by the Hartford Retail Crime Task Force, a multi-agency unit formed in 2022 to tackle the rise in persistent retail crime within the jurisdiction. The unit integrates resources drawn from the city police, local trading standards, and private security operations from retail chains. This statutory collaboration aims to provide an agile response to the challenges posed by frequent low-level offending, which—though often dismissed by the public and media as minor—exacts outsized costs both financial and psychological on victims and communities alike. The investigation leading to your arrest spanned several weeks, during which time law enforcement officers collated extensive evidence, including CCTV footage, till records, and witness statements. While the task of collating and verifying such evidence requires concerted effort from multiple agencies, I note here that the Hartford Retail Crime Task Force demonstrated commendable thoroughness and determination notwithstanding the constraints imposed by budgetary limitations and staffing shortages. Recent reports from the Task Force to the Local Authorities’ Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership highlighted the sharp increase in shoplifting incidents in 2024, despite general reductions in other acquisitive crime categories—a worrying trend that this prosecution seeks, in part, to address through deterrence. It is worth reflecting briefly on the legislative and procedural backdrop against which this matter unfolds. The Theft Act 1968 has remained the cornerstone of property crime law for over half a century, its provisions carefully shaped over time through both statutory amendment and judicial interpretation. While earlier legislative epochs viewed theft primarily as a straightforward question of property deprivation, more recent jurisprudence underscores the nuanced evaluation of offender intent, the context of offending, and the wider impact on victims and society. The sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in 2018 set out a structured framework, placing emphasis on culpability and harm factors while acknowledging the importance of rehabilitation in appropriate cases. It is equally important to recognise procedural modernisation within the Crown Court system, notably the adoption of the Better Case Management (BCM) protocols from 2015 onwards. This case was allocated to Court 12 under BCM to facilitate early identification of key issues, streamlined evidence disclosure, and timely progression to hearing. Regrettably, despite the best efforts of the judiciary and case officers, the matter encountered several adjournments attributable in part to administrative difficulties with Legal Aid provision, notably delays in securing funding for expert psychiatric assessment as requested by the defence. Such bureaucratic hurdles are an increasingly regrettable feature of contemporary criminal justice processes and do little to enhance the administration of justice, particularly affecting defendants with purported vulnerabilities. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted response to the defence application — involving multiple requests for additional documentation and protracted correspondence — has been documented by the clerk of the court and serves as a lamentable example of what is often termed ‘systemic inertia.’ The impact on your legal team and, by extension, your right to a fair and timely hearing cannot be overstated. The court is inclined to express formal disappointment in the ongoing operational challenges faced by Legal Aid provision bodies, whose role is to facilitate equality of arms and not to act as a bottleneck in the exercise of justice. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. To place this matter in further procedural context, I note that you initially entered a plea of not guilty at the first hearing on 28 May 2025. This decision necessitated further disclosure and evidential preparation, including the collation of additional witness statements from retail employees and supplementary forensic analysis of clothing seized during your arrest. The case was subsequently adjourned for a pre-trial review on 15 July 2025, at which point new video evidence was submitted, illustrating several incidents involving similar modus operandi. On that occasion your plea was changed to guilty, a timing that, while allowed in law, reduced the potential credit afforded for early acceptance of responsibility. The administration of order within Court 12 merits mention, as it has been a focus of recent refurbishment efforts intended to modernise facilities and accommodate the increasing complexities of criminal cases. Although the refurbished layout now includes dedicated spaces for vulnerable witnesses and improved technology for video-conferencing, constraints remain. The court clerk is to be commended for adapting swiftly to these changes, as is the usher for maintaining decorum amidst a busy calendar. The ebb and flow of cases often sees long waiting times and intermittent staffing, factors regrettably beyond individual control but influential on the practical administration of justice. Mr H used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and protein powder. It may be uncontroversial to observe that shoplifting cases such as this attract limited public attention in comparison to offenses involving violence or serious organised crime. Indeed, it is a matter of some concern to this court that media presence during proceedings is virtually non-existent notwithstanding the significant consequences to victims and retailers alike. While courts operate under the principle of open justice, the reality is that the quiet toll taken by persistent acquisitive offending rarely commands the public’s or press’s gaze. This absence of scrutiny does not diminish the importance of the case or the harm occasioned. The victim impact statements and evidential materials reveal the often unseen human cost — stress, anxiety, and genuine fear experienced by shop floor staff, many of whom are low-paid and face occupational hazards exacerbated by recidivist offenders. Some employees have reported reduced working hours or even resignation as a consequence. Such practical effects must weigh heavily on any sentencing exercise concerned with both reparation and deterrence. A subsequent review hearing was held remotely on 4 August 2025, at which point the defence submitted character references and letters of support from a local charity, Helping Hands, which specialises in supporting individuals experiencing socio-economic hardship. These documents attest to your recent attendance at a foodbank programme and participation in budgeting advice sessions, though it is unclear from the reports provided the extent to which you engaged fully or consistently. One letter from a volunteer coordinator notes your earnestness but highlights missed appointments, a pattern common in many who face complex life challenges. On four separate visits within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same small shop and stole alcohol and tobacco products. It is incumbent upon the court to consider the current state of public services available to defendants such as yourself. The strain imposed on mental health care provision, social housing allocations, and welfare services is well documented. This court sympathises with the increasingly precarious undertow faced by those navigating a system stretched to, and beyond, capacity. The challenges await significant policy responses and budgetary commitment from government. However, resource scarcity does not mitigate personal responsibility. Indeed, the prospect of effective rehabilitation is often contingent on active engagement with the interventions designed to provide alternative pathways. The most recent probation service report, dated 12 September 2025 and compiled by Senior Probation Officer Lydia Chandler, outlines your background, noting a lengthy history of unsettled accommodation and intermittent periods of employment, predominantly in low-skilled manual work. The report references your prior convictions for theft-related offences, most recently in 2022, for which you received a conditional discharge. It also flags concerns around occasional substance misuse, particularly alcohol, which may compound the underlying instability. Mr H used a question about Oyster Card transactions to divert the shopkeeper’s attention, then leaned over the counter to take a displayed item. The extent of your engagement with the probation service has been partial but inconsistent. While you have attended some meetings and accepted referrals to drug and alcohol support groups, your failure to maintain long-term contact reduces the prospect of successful community rehabilitation at present. Your Social Services contact, Ms Enid Rowan, has provided an assessment describing you as ‘well-meaning but frequently ambivalent to offers of help,’ highlighting the chronic challenge of converting initial motivation into sustained behavioural change. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. Turning to medical assessments, you underwent psychiatric evaluation under the supervision of Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist Dr Rehan Aziz in July 2025. Dr Aziz’s report is both detailed and professionally composed, referencing a history of low-level mood disorder, reactive depression linked to economic and housing instability, and tendencies towards impulsivity without a formal diagnosis of major mental illness. Importantly, the report expresses reservations about your capacity to comply with structured treatments without intensive case management. Dr Aziz emphasises the absence of acute psychotic symptoms or significant cognitive impairment but cautions that your social vulnerabilities significantly heighten the risk of reoffending if support is not sustained and tailored. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. It is pertinent to recall the Court of Appeal’s guidance in R v. Benson [2017] EWCA Crim 469, which underscored that while mental health conditions may inform sentencing and interventions, they do not excuse or wholly mitigate offending, particularly where harm to others is evident. The Court in Benson emphasised balancing judicial mercy with the imperative of protecting the public and fostering rehabilitation. Defence counsel has made detailed submissions urging this Court to consider community-based disposals, highlighting your precarious housing status and the risk of exacerbating social exclusion through custodial sentences. The defence points to the availability of specialist local schemes aimed at offenders with complex needs, such as the Hartford Thinking Skills Project and the Integrated Offender Support Hub. The prosecution, represented by Ms Louisa Fairclough, argues that while mitigation is acknowledged, the repeated nature of the offending, the deliberate targeting of vulnerable retail premises, and the cumulative impact on victims necessitates a sanction that is both deterrent and denunciatory. I have also had the opportunity to review correspondence from a retail trade association, dated 10 September 2025, which draws attention to the increase in staff turnover and morale issues as a direct consequence of persistent retail theft. This letter, while not specific to your case, provides a sobering contextual backdrop germane to sentencing considerations. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. I record, without elaboration, the case noted in this jurisdiction of R v. Goodwin [2023] EWCA Crim 2001, involving a defendant convicted of aggravated burglary and possession of a bladed article. While the facts are plainly unrelated to your case, the principles articulated concerning culpability and the necessity of proportionate sentencing remain applicable. Such references serve as jurisprudential landmarks but do not inform the factual matrix before this court. Furthermore, mention may be made of an unrelated matter before this court involving a co-defendant charged with assault on an arresting officer at a separate location. That link is incidental and carries no weight in the present sentencing considerations. Similarly, this court is aware of recent local incidents — including fly-tipping cases on green belt land and damage to public transport facilities — though such offences form no part of your record. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. I must also comment on the broader societal frame within which this offending takes place. This nation faces marked challenges in public health, housing, and social security provision. The enduring phenomenon of street homelessness, with attendant safety risks and public health concerns, remains a feature of our urban fabric. However, such context cannot provide a blank cheque for law-breaking. The court remains mindful that repeat shoplifting, while often treated as a 'gateway' offence by some commentators, can signal patterns of chronic marginalisation or embedded criminal conduct. Disentangling these requires a combination of compassion, rigor, and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law. The successful operation of multi-agency partnerships — such as the Business Crime Reduction Partnership active in Hartford — depends as much on sustained political will and funding as on the dedication of frontline workers. It may be said with some frankness that these systems are vulnerable to administrative overload, frequent staff turnover, and policy shifts. In this light, the diligent but fragmentary efforts of volunteer organisations and charities in this area merit public recognition. The sentencing guideline for theft offences expressly recognises the importance of carefully calibrated disposals. Community orders with requirements for rehabilitation activity, cognitive skills training, and restorative justice have a crucial role. Nonetheless, the court retains a duty to consider custody where the offending is persistent, deliberate, and shows scant regard for prior warnings or community sanctions. Sentencing remains a careful exercise of judicial discretion, balancing public protection, the interests of justice, and the prospects of rehabilitation. Accordingly, I direct that the probation service prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report, with particular attention to the feasibility of a community sentence incorporating cognitive behavioural interventions, debt management support, and substance misuse services. The report should advise on the realistic prospects for compliance given your current engagement levels. I reserve final sentence to the formal hearing scheduled for 10 October 2025, by which time I expect all relevant reports and any further sentencing submissions to be filed. These sentencing remarks are given on this 18th day of September 2025, in Court 12 at Hartford Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted duly to the appropriate authorities. You are reminded of your right to appeal within twenty-eight days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Unless otherwise ordered, there are no reporting restrictions in force under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs have been reserved.
