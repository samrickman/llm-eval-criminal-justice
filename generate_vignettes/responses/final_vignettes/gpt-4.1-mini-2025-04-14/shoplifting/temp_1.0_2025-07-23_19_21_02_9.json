MR H Case No. B2025/14893 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. J. Blackwell Filed: 14 August 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for offences of theft by shoplifting, a matter which has been proceeding before us across several months. The charges before you relate to an aggregated count, representative of a series of incidents drawn from events occurring primarily in the Brighton and Hove area between October 2023 and March 2025. The factual matrix, as presented in evidence and now admitted, arises from a sustained pattern of conduct amounting to multiple acts of dishonesty and breaches of the Theft Act 1968. Procedural Overview You were first arrested on 29 March 2025 after a detailed investigation by officers of the Sussex Police Retail Crime Unit, who had been responding to a noticeable surge in thefts reported at convenience shops and independent pharmacies in the city centre and surrounding commercial districts. The investigation employed a variety of modern law enforcement techniques, including targeted CCTV analysis, liaison with store security managers, and digital device examination, culminating in your apprehension. The case was initially listed for plea and trial preparation on 15 April but subsequently adjourned due to a late application for psychiatric assessment and to allow for the preparation of a pre-sentence report. It is important to register the court’s gratitude to the investigators, including Detective Sergeant Tom Fletcher and his team, for their meticulous collation of evidence and careful adherence to procedural requirements despite ongoing pressures on personnel and resources. A noteworthy challenge has been the repeated strain placed on local police capacity by the rising tide of so-called “non-serious” crime—an umbrella which, regrettably, belies the very real harm caused to victims and communities alike. Sussex Police, like many forces, continue to grapple with balancing finite personnel against increasing demands across the spectrum of public safety needs. I acknowledge receipt of the various witness statements, including those provided by staff at multiple establishments affected by theft, as well as the numerous CCTV stills and video excerpts tendered within the court bundle. The detailed reportage from store managers paints a picture of disruption, stress, and financial loss, compounded by a growing sense of vulnerability among retail workers. There was, as seen in the correspondence from the Brighton Retailers Association dated 21 July 2025, a clear call for stronger deterrence and more robust partnership working with law enforcement and community groups to tackle retail crime at its root. At the initial stages of proceedings, you entered a not guilty plea. This plea was maintained until the eve of the contested trial week, when a guilty plea was entered shortly before opening submissions were due to be heard. The late entry of plea occupies a position of some procedural significance, as the court will elaborate, in respect of sentencing credit. I express my appreciation to counsel: Ms Harriet Winslow, appearing on behalf of the Crown, who has managed the case efficiently and professionally; and Mr Dean Sullivan, leading for the defence under a representation order granted on 5 February 2025, who has been diligent in making detailed representations. It is, however, necessary and appropriate to observe the regrettable delays experienced during the preparation of this case, notably arising from protracted correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency concerning funding for an independent psychiatric examination. Initial application was made on 12 April but was subject to multiple iterations of requests for further information, causing a delay of just under six weeks before formal authority was issued. This is regrettable. Such delays serve neither the interests of justice nor the parties and place undue strain upon the court’s listing timetables. Financial austerity measures and resourcing constraints affecting the Legal Aid sector have been the subject of much scrutiny and concern across the judiciary, and this case sadly exemplifies the practical consequences of such systemic friction. At the sentencing hearing held today, I have had the benefit of the psychiatric report from Dr Samuel Hewitt, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, as well as the probation officer’s detailed pre-sentence report dated 7 August 2025. Both reports provide considered observations on your circumstances, prior history, and potential risk factors. Parallel case management processes in recent years have sought to elevate the efficiency and transparency of Crown Court proceedings through protocols such as Better Case Management (BCM). While this model aims to achieve early clarity on issues in dispute and encourage early pleas, reality is often more intractable. Delays in adjournments for expert reports and late changes in plea status, as observed here, are not unusual. The balancing act between securing justice with expedition and ensuring fairness through adequate preparation remains delicate. The Theft Act 1968 remains the keystone legislative instrument under which theft offences such as those committed here are prosecuted. Section 1 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving that person of it. The courts have been furnished with extensive guidance on sentencing for theft in various iterations of Sentencing Council guidelines, the current revision of which took effect in 2023. The custodial threshold for offences such as yours is generally reserved for cases demonstrating substantial loss, planned offending over a protracted period, or harm extending beyond the immediate theft itself—such as threats, or repeated targeting of vulnerable victims. I draw attention to the Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Morton [2021] EWCA Crim 2728, which underscored the principle that repeat offending, particularly where prior community interventions have failed, justifies a more assertive sentencing stance. The court there emphasised that the cumulative impact of acquisitive crime on local businesses and community morale cannot be discounted simply due to ostensibly low monetary values per incident. Further, in R v. Greenfield [2020] EWCA Crim 1986, which concerned thefts from pharmacy premises, the Court articulated that disruption to service provision and the psychological toll on shop workers constituted aggravating factors to be reflected in sentence, even where the overall financial loss was limited. The vulnerable nature of some retail settings—especially small independents—can be a relevant consideration. It is unfortunate but germane to note that this court has received submissions relating to an unrelated matter concerning a co-defendant, charged with offences of affray following an altercation at a nearby public house in West Sussex, which is not connected to the conduct before this court. While some of those proceedings have garnered media attention due to their violent nature, no link between those persons and the present case has been established. The presence of concurrent cases highlights the diverse and multifaceted nature of criminal behaviour dealt with by our justice system but does not bear on your sentencing. Representations from the Brighton Small Business Association included a letter dated 30 July 2025, setting out the cumulative strain placed on local retail environments by repeated thefts and associated antisocial behaviour. The letter highlighted not only economic loss—calculated in terms of diminished stock and increased security expenditure—but also the adverse effects on staff wellbeing and customer confidence. The experiences of shop assistants, some of whom had required time off work due to stress and anxiety linked to repeated encounters, were poignantly brought to the attention of the court. The court acknowledges that while you were not responsible for any acts of violence or intimidation in these instances, the repeated nature of the offending itself contributed to an environment of insecurity and apprehension for those who serve the community. Furthermore, the Victim Liaison Officer has attested to the cooperation extended by local shop owners, who provided statements and agreed to appear as witnesses, emphasizing the importance of their engagement in the prosecution process. Mr H placed £16 worth of skincare products into his coat lining and exited the premises without attempting to pay. It is no secret that public confidence in judicial institutions is intimately linked to perceptions of consistency, fairness, and proportionality in sentencing. The court is mindful that acquisitive crime with persistent frequency poses challenges not only to victims but also to community cohesion. The phenomenon of normalization of shoplifting in certain affected areas, and the distress it causes, should not be underestimated. The probation service, which has prepared the present report, reports that access to mental health and addiction services in Sussex remains limited, with waiting lists often measured in months. These constraints pose difficulties in adequately addressing the complex needs of offenders with multiple vulnerabilities. The pressure on NHS community teams to respond to rising demand for adult mental health and substance misuse interventions is well documented, as is their consequent impact on reducing reoffending. The probation report notes your inconsistent engagement with prior support approaches and raised concerns about impulsivity and financial instability. Your history includes previous convictions for similar offences, the most recent being a conditional discharge imposed some 15 months ago. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. Dr Hewitt’s independent psychiatric report, delivered following clinical interviews and a comprehensive review of your medical history, finds no major psychiatric disorder but notes traits consistent with significant anxiety, low mood, and features indicative of an impulse control disorder. The report suggests that while there is no evidence of psychosis or cognitive impairment, your presentation is complicated by unstable housing and social isolation. Significantly, Dr Hewitt states that your risk of reoffending may be reduced through engagement with cognitive-behavioural therapies and stable accommodation, but cautions that non-engagement or relapse into substance misuse could heighten risk substantially. I am grateful to Dr Hewitt for the thorough and professional manner of her assessment. The court also notes the particularly professional and measured tone of the report from the probation officer, which sets out the relevant criminogenic factors alongside a sensitive recognition of social adversity. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. It also bears mentioning that the court received a letter from the secretary of the East Sussex Food Bank dated 3 August 2025, outlining the current operational challenges faced by voluntary-sector organisations in the area, which includes diminished volunteer numbers and uncertain funding streams. Such reports highlight the interconnectedness of criminality, social deprivation, and the fragility of support infrastructures. Mr H asked about topping up an Oyster Card as a pretext to divert attention, then took a display item from behind the shop counter. The court further notes receipt of a character reference from your sister, Ms Julie Henderson, dated 6 August 2025, which describes you as a “devoted son” and “struggling to find a foothold” following an extended period of unemployment and homelessness. While such personal testimony is noted with respect, it cannot displace the established fact of sustained offending. The defendant used a magnetic device to disable the security tag, and this was later recovered when Mr H was arrested. The conduct in question comprises thefts from multiple shops over an 18-month period. The method of offending was consistent: entering premises singly, often during busy periods or shift changeovers, using handheld bags or clothing to conceal stock, particularly items of personal care, snacks, and over-the-counter medicines. The offences often involved the removal of security tags and the strategic use of distraction to evade detection. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. On several occasions, you were observed exiting stores without paying, and in at least one instance were apprehended by store security until police arrived. The loss to merchants, individually modest, cumulatively sums to a figure extending into three figures. Despite warnings and previous community resolutions, the conduct persisted. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, causing alarm and disruption in the store. Such patterning reflects a deliberate and calculated approach rather than a single lapse. The repercussions have extended beyond financial cost to affect staff morale and undermined the confidence of smaller retailers in their ability to provide safe and welcoming environments. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. The Crown submits that the offending renders a custodial sentence appropriate, taking into account both the repetition and the impact on victims. In approaching sentence, the court is bound to consider the statutory framework, including the Sentencing Council guidelines on theft offences, and the twin aims of punishment and rehabilitation. It is accepted that your plea—entered late but before trial—attracts some reduction of sentence, albeit limited given the timing. The mitigating factors here include your expressed remorse, some community support, and willingness—albeit inconsistent—to engage with assistance. The aggravating features are however repeated prior offending with a similar modus operandi and the demonstrable impact on victims and the local community. I am mindful that to fail to respond to such behaviour risks encouraging further offences, as highlighted in R v. Shenton [2023] EWCA Crim 1102, where a failure to address persistent acquisitive offending was found to undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system. The court also takes note of the broader systemic challenges: the growing pressures on police, probation, mental health, and voluntary sector services which must be factored implicitly into sentencing decisions. These matters, while not determinative, provide important context to the potential for rehabilitation and the tailoring of effective interventions post-sentence. I emphasise that the court’s concern is to impose a proportionate sentence which recognises the seriousness of this persistent course of dishonesty, protects the public, and offers a realistic prospect of reducing reoffending. The ultimate balance will depend on the forthcoming pre-sentence report’s assessment of your prospects for compliance with community orders and the viability of structured rehabilitative input. In common with many cases of acquisitive offending, it would be inappropriate to dismiss the role of broader social conditions and systemic opportunity deficits. However, courts cannot abdicate to these wider forces responsibility for individual behaviour. There remains an expectation of accountability and respect for lawful boundaries. Further, I must stress the importance of early engagement with support services following sentencing. Non-compliance may lead to sentence escalation. The availability of programmes targeting impulsivity, cognitive skills, and substance misuse should be explored in earnest. I record the court’s thanks to all those who have contributed to the orderly administration of justice in this matter, including the probation officer Ms Sandra Vickers, and the forensic psychiatric services under Dr Hewitt’s team. The hearing has been conducted in open court in the presence of the defendant, counsel, and court staff. The layout of this court was recently refurbished to improve accessibility and security. I also acknowledge the efficient assistance of Court Usher Miss Jenna Lewis and Court Clerk Mr Mohamed Farooq, whose professionalism underpins the smooth running of proceedings. This matter will adjourn for the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report, which shall incorporate updated assessments of risk and the feasibility of community interventions such as unpaid work requirements and cognitive behavioural treatment programmes. These sentencing remarks are formally issued on 14 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. A transcript has been prepared and filed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days pursuant to relevant statutory provisions. No reporting restrictions are engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. No costs awards are made.
