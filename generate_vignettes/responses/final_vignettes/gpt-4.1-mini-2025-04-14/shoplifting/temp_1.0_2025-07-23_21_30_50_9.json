Mr H Case No. M2025/08123 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. R. Eldridge Filed: 18 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in regard to an allegation of shoplifting, encapsulated within a representative charge framed under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending period allegedly spans the months from November 2024 through April 2025 within diverse retail outlets situated across Marlborough city and its environs. This court has heard the evidence against you and received submissions from both the prosecution and the defence, including consideration of expert reports and victim impact material. Procedural History and Case Context You were first arrested on 12 April 2025 following an investigation led by the Marlborough City Police Retail Crime Unit, in conjunction with the Marlborough Business Crime Reduction Initiative. This multi-agency approach aims to enhance the identification of patterns in persistent theft, support victimised commercial entities, and facilitate coordinated police responses. Such partnerships represent a progressive approach to retail crime, yet the court remains aware that the practical efficacy of these schemes often hinges on consistent data-sharing and frontline staffing levels, both of which have faced challenges in this jurisdiction due to budgetary constraints and competing priority allocations. Indeed, it bears noting that the operational demands upon local police constabulary have escalated markedly in recent years, with particular strain arising from the confluence of cyber-enabled fraud, rising levels of domestic abuse reporting, and the complex demands of missing persons enquiries. The Retail Crime Unit, though focused on what may be termed low-level acquisitive offences, must thus operate within a finite resource envelope, balancing prompt investigative response with prevention and community reassurance functions. The nature of retail theft — often perceived publicly as a ‘minor’ or ‘victimless’ offence — belies the significant cumulative cost and impact upon often vulnerable retail staff and small businesses, many of whom operate on tight margins and with limited capacity for loss absorption. Your initial interview, conducted on 14 April 2025 at Marlborough Police Station under caution, adopted the standard PACE protocols. Although you declined to make full admissions at that stage, subsequent examination of CCTV footage from multiple premises — corroborated by staff witness statements and statements of stolen goods recovered from your possession upon arrest — furnished a basis for the charge that you deliberately and dishonestly appropriated goods without paying with intent to permanently deprive the owners. It is of no small import that the investigation also included collaboration with digital forensic analysts, who conducted a detailed review of mobile device data associated with your movements during relevant times. This was authorised under a carefully considered judicial warrant, reflecting the seriousness with which your alleged offending was regarded by the authorities. Such investigative steps, while onerous in administrative terms, underscore the court’s recognition of the challenging evidential environment in which retail crime cases proceed. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. The Business Crime Reduction Initiative (BCRI) under whose auspices much of the evidential development occurred is reflective of a broader shift toward intelligence-led policing strategies. Nonetheless, the court is mindful that such initiatives can be hampered by practical limitations, including variability in private-sector reporting, inconsistent training of frontline retail employees in recognising theft, and the vicissitudes of multi-agency cooperation. Despite these realities, it is proper to acknowledge the clear effort expended in this case to marshal a coherent evidential package. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. A plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 26 June 2025. At that hearing, you elected to enter a not guilty plea. The Crown’s case was presented in outline, including reference to the CCTV evidence, witness statements, and forensic items recovered. Directions were given for trial preparation, noting an anticipated trial window in mid-September. Subsequent to this, and following continuing case management hearings complicated by intermittent down-time caused by administrative delays within the Legal Aid Agency, a further hearing on 2 September 2025 saw you enter a plea of guilty to the representative charge. It should be observed that late guilty pleas of this sort are a regrettably frequent occurrence in shoplifting cases. As the Court of Appeal obiter dicta in R v. Westfield [2023] EWCA Crim 951 illustrate, the level of credit afforded must be carefully calibrated to reflect the timing of the plea, genuine remorse, and the saving of public resources. The underlying principle, codified within the Sentencing Council's guidelines on plea credits, remains sound: early guilty pleas advance the interests of justice and spare victims and witnesses needless anxiety. The present plea, entering close to trial, attracts a more modest credit and must be considered in light of its timing and circumstances. Mr H went back to the same convenience store four times in the space of three weeks, repeatedly taking alcohol and tobacco. The court has also been provided with a psychiatric report authored by Consultant Psychiatrist Dr Fiona Lavers, dated 28 August 2025. Dr Lavers’ detailed assessment concludes that you display features consistent with mild depressive symptoms and a degree of impulsivity but do not meet criteria for a major psychiatric disorder. She notes a history of episodic substance misuse, with a pattern of self-medicating during period of personal stress. Further, she highlights difficulties in sustained engagement with community services and outlines a moderate risk of recidivism linked primarily to social and economic instability rather than ingrained antisocial traits. Of interest, Dr Lavers references the increasing pressure on local NHS mental health services, noting that waiting times for adult community mental health teams now commonly exceed three months, a factor that limits access to timely therapeutic support. These systemic issues have unfortunate downstream effects on courts and the probation service alike, who must calibrate sentencing and rehabilitation plans in this constrained service environment. Mr H pretended to ask a question about Oyster Card payments in order to distract staff, then reached behind the counter and took a display item. In assessing risk and suitable sentencing options, the court has also reviewed the pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Claire Dunne, Probation Officer, received 10 September 2025. Ms Dunne remarks on your apparent transient accommodation arrangements and intermittent employment history — features which compound the challenges faced by local rehabilitative services in ensuring continuity of support. Her report indicates a medium risk of harm to community property but a low risk of harm to persons, consistent with the profile of a non-violent, acquisitive offender. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. It is of note, and indeed a matter of some regret, that the Legal Aid Agency’s repeated delays in authorising finance for forensic and clinical assessments have introduced avoidable delay and uncertainty into the case. Such funding bottlenecks are, regrettably, becoming emblematic of wider resource constraints facing publicly funded defence services. These delays compound stress for defendants and place an additional administrative burden on courts. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. Victim impact statements were submitted on behalf of several businesses affected by your conduct. They detail not only the direct economic loss incurred, but also the psychological impact on retail workers — including increased anxiety, reduced confidence in personal safety, and a propensity to alter work patterns to avoid periods associated with your alleged offending. One such statement, from a local pharmacist, notes: “Repeated losses, even of low-value items, cut into already thin margins. Staff morale has suffered, and we find ourselves under pressure to implement costly security measures. We cannot carry these losses indefinitely.” On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. Additionally, correspondence from the Marlborough Retail Liaison Group was read to the court. This organisation performs valuable community outreach and has collaborated with local police to develop offender diversion programmes. It remains concerned, however, that persistent theft offences — even low monetary value shoplifting — can precipitate a cycle of entrenchment, reducing community cohesion and undermining trust between citizens and the retail sector. On the subject of sentencing frameworks, the court recalls the statutory provisions enshrined in sections 152A-156 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 relating to the provision of community orders and the imposition of custodial sentences. The Sentencing Council's definitive guideline on theft offences, published in 2021 and last updated in 2024, emphasises the proportionality principle, taking into account the value of goods stolen, the circumstances of the offending, and the defendant’s antecedents. The court is also mindful of the case of R v. Eldridge [2024] EWCA Crim 729, wherein a repeat acquisitive offender was sentenced to an immediate term of 12 months custody for persistent shoplifting offences with value largely under £50, noting the aggravating factors of previous warnings and failure to engage with community interventions. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. In this matter, notwithstanding the late guilty plea, the persistence and premeditation reflected in your conduct, combined with limited engagement with support structures and prior convictions, weigh heavily. Equally, the absence of violence and your cooperation at this later stage may be viewed as mitigating factors. It must be underscored that the court is not unmindful of the wider socio-economic pressures that often contribute to such offending. The city of Marlborough, like many urban centres, faces significant challenges with rising street homelessness, an observed increase in begging, and strained social services. Courts witness regularly how these factors can predispose some to patterns of offending as survival strategies rather than expressions of wilful criminality. This broader social backdrop includes a reduction in available temporary accommodation beds, reduced funding for local charities providing assistance to those at risk, and an increase in declarations of ‘rough sleeping’ in council records — all of which contribute to a climate of marginalisation and vulnerability. Notwithstanding, the courts remain vigilant that social explanations do not become unfounded excuses. The court also acknowledges the efforts of voluntary organisations such as SafeSteps and the Marlborough Outreach Network, which have recently pioneered peer-led initiatives aimed at re-engaging low-level offenders with employment, mental health, and financial counselling services. Such schemes represent best practice and the future of targeted, evidence-based rehabilitation. However, your sporadic participation and inconsistent self-reporting reduce the efficacy of these interventions in your case. I take this opportunity also to observe the challenges increasingly faced by the Probation Service in the local area. Staff shortages, caseload increases, and administrative burdens have, regrettably, resulted in delays and reduced face-to-face contact. The integration of trauma-informed practice, while commendable, requires further development to adequately support offenders with complex needs and histories of adversity. Before sentencing, I invite you to consider these reflections, not as condemnation but as the context within which judicial decisions are made, balancing public protection, the gravity of the offending, and the prospects for your rehabilitation. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Marlborough. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs remain reserved.
