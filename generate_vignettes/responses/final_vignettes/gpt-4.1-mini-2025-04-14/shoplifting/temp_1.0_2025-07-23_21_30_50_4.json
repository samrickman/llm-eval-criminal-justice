MR H Case No. M2025/15123 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge B. J. Fenwick Filed: 18 August 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for offences relating to theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. These offences are characterised by a repeated pattern of shoplifting across multiple commercial establishments within the Greater Manchester area, spanning a period from November 2023 through to February 2025. This deliberate and sustained course of conduct has resulted in significant disruption to the affected businesses, and provides the legal basis for today’s proceedings. Procedural History and Context Your initial arrest took place on 9 February 2025 following an investigation led by the Manchester City Police Retail Crime Unit, in conjunction with the local Business Crime Reduction Group. This multi-agency collaboration sought to address a notable surge in shoplifting incidents across retail outlets predominantly located in industrial and suburban shopping districts. The investigation was prompted by reports from several independent store proprietors, citing an individual closely matching your description as repeatedly engaged in theft spanning an extended timeframe. This matter was allocated to Crown Court following preliminary hearings in the Magistrates’ Court at Manchester on 28 February 2025, where you entered a not guilty plea. Your case has since proceeded under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme with hearings listed on 14 May 2025 and 23 July 2025 to allow for disclosure and preparatory steps, including the provision of expert reports and witness statements. The BCM framework, since its introduction in 2017, aims to expedite criminal proceedings through early identification of contested issues and procedural rigour. In this instance, it has enabled a relatively prompt listing of the sentencing hearing after your earlier plea change on 2 August 2025 to guilty following receipt of comprehensive CCTV footage and third-party witness affidavits. The case has not been without administrative delays, including an adjournment on 14 May 2025 due to pending applications for legal aid funding to secure the services of a forensic psychologist with expertise in habitual acquisitive offending. The Legal Aid Agency’s processing of this request was protracted, with approval granted only on 1 July 2025, necessitating rescheduling of the psychiatric assessment. It is a regrettable reality that such bureaucratic obstacles persist within our justice system and serve neither defendants nor the public well. Expediency must not come at the expense of thoroughness; however, repeated rejections and delays in funding authorisations represent systemic inefficiencies that heighten stress for all parties involved and risk prejudicing fair outcomes. Further, the impact on police and prosecutorial resources in investigating persistent shoplifting offences continues to escalate. The diversion of manpower and forensic expertise from more grave criminal matters must be viewed in the context of broader social pressures resulting in increased acquisitive crime rates. The Manchester Safer Communities Board has recently published data underscoring a 14% rise in retail theft offences over the last two fiscal years, with recuperation of losses posing an ongoing challenge for small business owners. The court acknowledges the diligent efforts of police officers and business crime investigators whose collaboration through intelligence sharing and victim liaison has been instrumental in advancing this case. I also record appreciation for victim impact statements submitted by proprietors of the affected stores, which paint a vivid picture of financial strain and elevated anxiety among staff. It is essential, also, to note that the developing role of the Retail Support Network—a voluntary sector organisation dedicated to assisting victims of shop theft—has grown in prominence within the Manchester area. Their submissions to this court demonstrated a nuanced understanding of the psychosocial effects of repeat offences on retail workers, including increased fear of confrontation and mental exhaustion. While they do not seek punitive measures, the Network advocates for interventions balancing rehabilitation with public protection. At the plea and trial preparation hearing convened on 23 July 2025, the court was shown considerable supplementary material, including several CCTV excerpts, receipts recovered from your residence, and statements from witnesses who observed your presence within stores behaving in a manner consistent with theft. Defence counsel made submissions emphasising your difficult personal circumstances and requesting an opportunity for a psychiatric evaluation to assist sentence mitigation. Mr H was seen slipping £11 worth of personal hygiene products into his jacket before leaving the shop without paying. The facts, as drawn from the evidence, indicate a deliberate and repeated exercise of dishonest intent, involving concealment of merchandise and evasion of payment within multiple retail settings. It is clear that the offence was not opportunistic or impulsive, but rather methodical and rehearsed. In addressing the legal framework applicable to sentencing in this context, this court must apply the guidelines as promulgated by the Sentencing Council in their Theft Offences Definitive Guideline dated October 2021, further informed by recent appellate authority. The guideline prescribes the careful consideration of culpability levels, harm caused, prior convictions, and potential mitigating features. I acknowledge with particular interest the observations in R v Barnes [2023] EWCA Crim 804, where the Court of Appeal confirmed that repeated acquisitive offending demands a proportionate response, especially where prior community disposals have failed to deter. Similar principles were affirmed in R v Lawrence [2022] EWCA Crim 1901, which underscores the judiciary’s discretion to reduce the standard credit for guilty pleas where such pleas are delayed until proceedings become inevitable. I further note, by way of comparative jurisprudence, the case of R v Turnbull [2019] EWCA Crim 2107, involving a defendant convicted of aggravated burglary who received a custodial sentence of five years after repeated breach of numerous community orders. While the factual matrix is distinguishable, the underpinning principle—that persistence in offending despite prior warnings warrants firm sanctions—resonates here. A word of caution is merited concerning the application of community sentences in cases involving individuals with complex social vulnerabilities. The Probation Service in Manchester continues to grapple with significant caseload pressures, exacerbated by funding shortfalls and staffing vacancies. This has impacted the capacity to monitor community orders rigorously, a factor of no little concern. The availability of programmes addressing acquisitive offending, such as the Cognitive Behavioural Thinking Skills Programme and the Integrated Offender Management pathway, has been curtailed in recent years. The ongoing COVID-19 recovery period has entailed closures and reductions in face-to-face provision. This court will request a full appraisal of the feasibility of such interventions in your particular circumstances. Boxed razor cartridges and protein powder were hidden in Mr H's niece’s pram to avoid detection. Balancing these considerations with the impact upon the victims is a fundamental sentencing imperative. The evidence presented includes victim statements highlighting the challenges faced by both proprietors and frontline staff, including increased operational costs to cover shrinkage and the psychological toll of confronting persistent dishonesty. It is worth noting that the retail employers’ operational decisions have included the redistribution of staff hours, the installation of enhanced security measures (such as electronic article surveillance), and in one case, the cessation of late-night opening, all undertaken in response to the offences attributed to you. The ripple effect of such choices on local economies and employment stability is part of the harm to be borne in mind. It is necessary to contextualise these facts within wider social and economic realities. The national and regional rise in street homelessness correlates, in some instances, with increases in acquisitive crime, frequently as a mechanism to mitigate destitution. This court, while sympathetic to such difficulties, must enforce the notion that hardship does not amount to exculpation. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. In the context of risk assessment, the probation officer’s pre-sentence report, which is expected within the coming weeks, will provide valuable insight into your personal history, criminal antecedents, and responsiveness to previous interventions. The report may also elucidate any substance misuse issues, as these frequently co-occur with criminal behaviour patterns involving theft. Reference is made here to the recent National Health Service report indicating that adult addiction services continue to face protracted waiting lists and capacity deficits, further complicating the rehabilitation landscape. The psychiatric evaluation, commissioned earlier this summer, has yet to be finalised and submitted. Its findings will be critical in illuminating whether mental health factors exist that may bear upon culpability or suitable sentencing pathways. In a deliberate act of distraction, Mr H engaged staff in a conversation about Oyster Cards while covertly removing a display item from behind the counter. I feel compelled to acknowledge the pressing concerns relating to the administration of justice in cases such as these. The Legal Aid Agency’s delays interfered significantly with the progression of your case, a matter that undermines confidence in equitable legal representation. Practitioners report increasing instances where straightforward requests—for forensic consultation, psychiatric assessment, or expert witness instruction—are subjected to protracted bureaucratic barriers, at times necessitating judicial intervention. Such challenges do not serve any party’s interest, least of all defendants seeking fair hearing. The defendant deliberately used a magnet to take off a security tag, and the magnet was later found during his arrest. While the court must maintain a cautious approach towards the mitigation advanced on grounds of personal circumstance, it does note your submissions regarding unemployment, housing precarity, and family breakdown. These factors, regrettably shared by many individuals who nonetheless refrain from offending, are not in themselves determinative. Historical case law, exemplified by R v Walters [2020] EWCA Crim 715, confirms that sentences must reflect public protection and deterrence, particularly in persistent offenders. Furthermore, unlike the co-defendant in R v Mason [2023] EWCA Crim 1123, who was found to have played only a tangential role with reduced culpability in a conspiracy to commit burglary, your involvement appears central and active. The defendant accepted that he sold the stolen property at a car boot sale and local drinking establishments, disturbing customers in the process. Turning to the victim impact, it is worth emphasising the testimony of a local shop manager, who described feeling “huddl[ed],” “uncertain,” and “fearful” owing to your repeated visits and alleged behaviour. Despite the absence of physical violence, these accounts underline the psychological harms often underestimated in theft offences. Indeed, in R v Cornhill [2021] EWCA Crim 1673, the Court of Appeal recognised the emotional distress caused by repeat shop thefts as a relevant factor in justifying custodial sentences. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. In preparing for sentencing, the court must also consider ancillary matters such as whether to impose a criminal behaviour order or other ancillary orders intended to prevent reoffending, as contemplated by statute and case law. The prospect of a financial penalty or partial compensation remains subject to further enquiry. It is germane to observe that, in related regulatory contexts, offenders have been subject to enforcement notices and civil penalties for breaches of licensing conditions. For example, in R (on the application of Greenfield) v City Council [2019] EWHC 455 (Admin), the Court considered the proportionality of waste management enforcement orders unrelated to the present facts but useful in illustrating the range of responses available to public authorities in deterring disorderly conduct. Mr H told officers he routinely shoplifts, doesn't view his actions as theft and intends to keep doing so. At this juncture, the court reserves sentence to allow for receipt of the pre-sentence report and psychiatric evaluation, as well as any further representations on your behalf. I record my thanks to Ms Emily Forsyth who appears on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Alan Symons, instructed by public defence services, who has made commendable efforts to represent you throughout these proceedings. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Manchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, and the formal record of conviction and sentencing will be duly registered with the appropriate authorities. You are advised of your rights to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply.
