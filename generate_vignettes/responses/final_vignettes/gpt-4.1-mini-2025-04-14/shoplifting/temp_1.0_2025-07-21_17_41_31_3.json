Mr H Case No. B2025/14489 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge C. M. Langford Filed: 15 September 2025 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence on a charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct is characterised by a sustained pattern of repeated thefts committed over a period of some fifteen months across several retail outlets within the Greater Bristol area. The indictment before the court is a representative count reflecting that course of conduct rather than isolated incidents. Procedural History The matter commenced with your arrest on 18 May 2025, following an extensive enquiry led by the Bristol City Police’s Retail Crime Unit in conjunction with the South West Theft Reduction Partnership. That investigation was prompted by multiple reports from shopkeepers who had independently logged instances of theft involving a male with your description. As so often occurs in similar investigations, it took considerable effort to collate CCTV footage, liaise with retail management across geographically dispersed venues, and analyse stock discrepancy reports. The enterprise was further complicated by the diverse range of locations targeted, straddling multiple local authority wards and police divisions. It has been observed — rightly — that the challenges faced in prosecuting theft offences, especially those of a low-value yet persistent nature, extend beyond the immediate factual matrix. Forensic identification of a defendant is often reliant on partial or blurred images from surveillance systems, frequently compounded by rudimentary timestamping errors, glare or shadow, and inconsistent camera coverage. The process demands the undivided attention of officers and analysts, often for weeks or months, to build an evidential picture with the coherence necessary for charging decisions and, ultimately, trial preparation. Such is the nature of modern policing in this domain. You were first interviewed under caution on 22 May 2025, at which time you denied involvement with the allegations. However, items seized during a search of your residence included products corresponding to those taken in a number of the offences, and comparative analysis of clothing worn in footage correlated strongly with your wardrobe. A detailed indictment was authorised on 30 June 2025, consolidating multiple incidents to a single representative charge. The case has been progressed under the Better Case Management (BCM) process—a framework designed to promote early identification of issues, timely disclosure, and efficient listing of plea and trial preparation hearings. I note that, in this instance, the prosecution, defence, and court administration have adhered closely to the timeframes envisioned under this model. Despite this adherence, the court cannot ignore the strains placed upon limited judicial and ancillary resources by the cumulative effect of such cases. The time allocated to routine listing, disclosure vetting, and preparation disproportionately impacts the availability of the court for more serious trials. Nonetheless, the Crown’s commitment to thorough preparation and disclosure compliance is acknowledged with appreciation. The plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 5 August 2025. At that point you elected to enter a not guilty plea. The case was listed for trial on 10 September 2025. However, on the morning of trial you offered a guilty plea. Such late admissions of culpability are recognised within established jurisprudence as meriting diminished credit, with the rationale that genuine remorse and avoidance of trial preparation costs are undermined when pleas are deferred until conviction is assured. As expressed in the landmark decision of R v. Hainsworth [2019] EWCA Crim 1420, the court observed that a guilty plea entered at the earliest reasonable moment assists the administration of justice and engenders appropriate mitigation; conversely, those offered at the last moment, though not to be unduly penalised, must be viewed with measured discretion. Similar principles were reinforced in R v. Cremona [2020] EWCA Crim 367, a case concerning multiple counts of theft involving a ring operating intrinsic to retail theft by proxy. There, the Court of Appeal held that late pleas relating to protracted and complicated offences could not attract the immediacy credit customarily extended to early guilty pleas—in no small measure due to the disruption and anxiety caused to witnesses and victims. Although the facts of Cremona lie at the higher end of the offending spectrum, the underpinning rationale informs sentencing in offences of this type. It is timely to reflect on some related case law that, while not directly bearing upon your conduct, offers broader context on sentencing for acquisitive crime in the current climate. In R v. Bexley [2021] EWCA Crim 873, an appellate judgment concerning aggravated burglary, the sentencing judge’s approach to proportionality in light of victims’ psychological trauma was carefully delineated. The Court highlighted the often overlooked but substantial impact of property crime upon community confidence and individual well-being. Although the offence in Bexley was of a more serious character, the principle that the harm caused by property crime transcends mere financial loss remains apposite. Likewise, the decision in R v. Armfield [2022] EWCA Crim 1212 dealt with offences of fly-tipping in protected green belt zones. The judgment emphasised that cumulative environmental harm and indiscriminate flouting of regulatory compliance may warrant sentences of significant severity. Whilst not germane to the present matter, it serves as a salutary reminder of societal expectations attaching to lawful behaviour in all domains. Of procedural note, this case was briefly delayed in June 2025 due to a scheduling conflict arising from industrial action taken by court clerks in the Bristol Crown Court registry. Such occurrences, while regrettable, reflect systemic challenges presently facing the administration of justice nationwide, where staffing shortages and increased workload pressures undermine the timely progression of cases. The court acknowledges the patience and professionalism displayed by all parties during this interval. The role of the Legal Aid Agency warrants mention. Defense representation was granted under the standard scheme, with Mr Andrew Dobson instructing on your behalf. An application for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist was submitted on 9 July 2025 but encountered procedural delays, only receiving approval on 3 August 2025. These bureaucratic impediments regrettably truncated the timeframe in which expert input could be obtained prior to the plea and trial preparation hearing. Such patterns of delay have been the subject of parliamentary scrutiny, most notably during the Justice Committee’s 2024 inquiry into criminal legal aid reforms, which underscored the adverse repercussions on defendants' rights and court listing efficiency. It is also prudent to recognise the involvement of voluntary agencies throughout your proceedings. The Bristol Shopworker Support Network provided victim impact statements expressing measured concern at the effects of repeated theft on staff morale and security. Their carefully considered reports avoid alarmism, instead detailing the practical consequences borne by employees compelled to modify working practices and contend with elevated stress. The North Bristol Community Partnership, working with local retailers, has endeavoured to implement preventative measures yet report recurrent challenges in resource allocation and inter-agency co-ordination. The court commends their ongoing vigilance. In cases of repeat low-level acquisitive offending, the court often hears submissions regarding socio-economic determinants purportedly underlying the conduct in question. It is an unfortunate reality that homelessness, unemployment, and social exclusion are prevalent background constellations for many charged with such offences. Nevertheless, as emphasised in R v. Ghosh [2023] EWCA Crim 45, personal accountability and the maintenance of societal norms remain paramount. Courts must balance compassion with deterrence, rehabilitative opportunity with public protection. The need to preserve retail spaces as safe and welcoming environments cannot be overstated. An assessment of recent probation service capacity must be made. The region is experiencing significant difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified officers, hampering probation's ability to conduct comprehensive pre-sentence reports and deliver effective supervision. These systemic pressures echo nationally and have been noted in successive Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation reports. Despite these obstacles, the Hampshire Probation Delivery Unit undertook to provide a report attentive to your circumstances and risk. I anticipate that the forthcoming pre-sentence report will identify appropriate pathways for engagement and address any underlying contributory factors. The working conditions of retail workers, and the challenges they face, are particularly salient. Nationally, shopworkers are estimated to suffer tens of thousands of incidents per year of violence or threat of violence, many linked directly or indirectly to theft and other acquisitive crimes. The ongoing pandemic has exacerbated tensions, with staffing shortages and heightened anxieties compounding vulnerabilities. The criminal justice system’s response to such offending seeks to uphold public confidence and protect those at the frontline. Turning now to mental health considerations, the report authored by Dr Fiona Martin, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 29 August 2025, provides valuable insight. Dr Martin notes that while you do not meet criteria for formal psychiatric diagnosis, there are indications of borderline personality traits marked by emotional dysregulation and impulsiveness. These features ought not be conflated with mitigation but may inform the design of rehabilitative interventions. The report further notes your failure to access available local mental health services despite multiple referrals by probation. The NHS Bristol Community Mental Health Team, operating under the constraints of a long waiting list, acknowledges the challenges posed by fluctuating patient engagement levels. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. Your age is 34. You have an extensive record of prior convictions, including four previous entries relating to theft offences, and two for public order offences dating from your late teens. Your history reveals a pattern of transient accommodation instability, including documented periods of sofa surfing and temporary hostel residence. Correspondence from the Bristol Housing Support Network, included in defence submissions, illustrates the recurrent nature of your housing challenges. Nevertheless, there is no indication of coercion or gang involvement. The conduct appears to be self-initiated and deliberate. Mr H deliberately used his niece’s pram to conceal boxed razor cartridges and a container of protein powder. It is common in such matters to encounter assertions of familial difficulties as causal explanations. Indeed, your defence counsel has submitted a letter from your sister, Ms Lydia H., describing a challenging upbringing characterised by parental separation, economic hardship, and occasional domestic disputes. While such context is of undeniable human interest, the law does not absolve responsibility on the basis of childhood adversity alone. It is a well-trodden maxim that 'past is prologue' but not destiny. Courts will consider such factors in mitigation insofar as they bear upon culpability and prospects for rehabilitation, but they can neither excuse nor exonerate. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. The facts as presented by the prosecution reveal a modus operandi involving the selection of specific retail outlets, generally smaller supermarkets and convenience stores, with limited security staffing and often situated in neighbourhoods experiencing elevated crime rates. You often utilised layered clothing and carried bags or rucksacks which concealed stolen items. On a number of occasions, you were observed engaging in distraction tactics aimed at diverting staff attention while removing goods from shelves or self-service tills. It is precisely this calculated approach that distinguishes the offending from opportunistic or impulsive theft. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. Your appeal to financial difficulties — including inconsistent engagement with employment support programmes and rejection of debt advice services offered by local charities such as Money Matters Bristol — is noted. The court does not discount the real hardships faced by those in precarious economic situations; however, the persistence of offending despite offers of assistance weakens the persuasive value of such mitigation. The message borne out of this case is that economic strain, while undeniably problematic, rarely justifies criminal conduct. In considering the propriety of sentencing options, I have had due regard to the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft and dishonesty offences. This guideline emphasises the gravity of offending that is repeated, planned, and where the impact on victims and communities is demonstrable. While the monetary value of items stolen in each incident may be modest, the aggregate effect is significant, not only financially but in terms of emotional and psychological impact upon retail workers. A magnet was used by The defendant to detach a security tag, and this item was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. A notable feature is your recidivism despite prior community-based disposals, including a Conditional Caution issued on 12 March 2024. Unfortunately, the efficacy of such interventions was limited as you recommenced offending within two months. This must weigh heavily against you as an aggravating factor. Similarly, the existence of multiple previous convictions indicates a pattern unamenable to less robust measures. The defendant disclosed that the stolen goods were sold at a car boot sale and in pubs, where his conduct caused unease among customers. Before sentencing, this court must acknowledge the broader public safety implications of persistent acquisitive offending such as this. Although the offences do not involve violence or weapons, they contribute to a cumulative sense of disorder and insecurity within affected neighbourhoods. Moreover, each instance deflects police and judicial resources away from more serious matters, a consequence frequently lamented by law enforcement agencies. The operational challenge of balancing demands from acquisitive crime with rising reports of organised violence and child exploitation remains acute. In the case of R v. Thackeray [2022] EWCA Crim 1247, the Court of Appeal emphasised that persistent petty crime, particularly when resistant to intervention, justified firm penalties to protect the public interest and uphold social norms. While your circumstances differ, the principle that offending must carry commensurate consequences retains clear force. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and confronted shop staff while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, triggering distress and security concerns. At this stage, while there are personal and contextual elements warranting consideration, the weight of aggravating factors compels a sentencing approach that conveys an unequivocal message of deterrence. Sentences must be proportionate but must also underscore the serious consequences of continued dishonesty and breach of trust within the community. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. It is anticipated that the Probation Service will undertake a comprehensive pre-sentence report with particular attention to suitability for structured community supervision, cognitive behavioural frameworks addressing offending behaviour, and support concerning impulsivity and financial management. Given the psychiatric assessment, referral to mental health liaison services and support for emotional regulation may be recommended. The report should also provide insight into accommodation stability and familial support networks. Formal sentencing will be deferred pending receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report, and any further submissions. I wish to record my thanks to the representatives appearing today: Ms Zara Collins for the Crown, for her thorough and professional conduct of the prosecution case, and Mr Andrew Dobson, who appears for the defence pursuant to a Legal Aid representation order. I must, however, express concerns regarding the continuing difficulties encountered in obtaining timely funding and authorisation for the instruction of expert witnesses. Though the Legal Aid Agency ultimately granted permission for the psychiatric assessment, the delay had inevitable knock-on effects for case progression. This cumulative erosion of administrative efficiency represents a systemic challenge warranting urgent remedial attention. I also take this opportunity to recognise the efforts of court staff and ushers in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court, who have managed proceedings with patience and professionalism despite recent infrastructural refurbishment and intermittent IT outages affecting digital case bundles. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be submitted to the relevant authorities for administrative registration. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days of any subsequent sentence pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Unless otherwise ordered, no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. No order as to costs is made at this stage. Sentencing is adjourned pending preparation and receipt of a pre-sentence report.
