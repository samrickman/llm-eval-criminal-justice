Mr H Case No. T2025/14689 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. L. Bramwell Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you come before this court for sentencing having pleaded guilty to a charge of theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically relating to a series of alleged shoplifting offences. The period in question extends from the autumn of 2023 through to the early months of 2025, encompassing various incidents occurring across Nottingham city centre and its peripheral retail zones. Procedural History and Context Your arrest was effected on 10 April 2025 following a systematic operation combining efforts from Nottinghamshire Police’s Economic Crime Unit and local business crime partnerships. This matter was initially raised when several businesses reported unexplained stock losses and observed suspicious activity involving a male matching your description frequenting their premises. The ensuing investigation necessitated the engagement of digital forensic analysts attached to the East Midlands Regional Cyber Crime Unit, with particular attention paid to correlating digital transaction anomalies against closed-circuit television footage compiled from at least seven separate locations. This collaborative, multi-agency investigation ran for approximately thirteen weeks before your detention. Among the range of investigative techniques employed were covert observations, analysis of payment card data linked to the implicated stores, and, notably, the use of Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology to track vehicles thought to be connected to your mobility and presence near crime sites. The volume and complexity of the compiled evidence platformed a comprehensive prosecution case. It must be acknowledged as a broader reality that offences involving theft from retail outlets often consume disproportionate investigative resources. Not just the evident time spent in evidence gathering, but also the attendant administrative burden with the collation of witness statements, inventory reconciliation, and prosecutorial directives. This is illustrative of the systemic strain experienced by law enforcement and judicial bodies in processing cases that, while sometimes perceived as minor or trivial by public opinion, represent tangible harm to commercial operators and ultimately to wider society. The court further notes the role of the Nottingham Retail Crime Reduction Team (NRCRT), whose liaison officers have submitted detailed affidavits highlighting the cumulative impact on staff morale and business viability. Their work exemplifies the intersection of commercial safety concerns and criminal justice considerations in modern urban environments. The present case, pursuant to the provisions of the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, has adhered to stipulated timetables for disclosure, with all evidential materials provided to the defence well in advance of plea hearings. This procedural discipline has ensured the avoidance of unnecessary adjournments beyond an early hearing held on 22 May 2025, where you initially entered a not guilty plea. Subsequent to disclosure of additional forensic analysis and a forthcoming psychiatric assessment report, you altered your plea to guilty at the hearing on 5 September 2025. By way of broader comment, this pattern of late admissions is something the court encounters with increasing frequency—pleas that are tendered after discovery of indivisible evidence, often near or on the day scheduled for trial. Whilst the law rightly permits defendants to test the case against them, the judicial system cannot overlook the consequential distress occasioned to witnesses, victims, and the expenditure of public funds that could be more productively allocated elsewhere. The Court of Appeal, most recently in R v Beale [2024] EWCA Crim 312, reaffirmed that credit for guilty pleas should be calibrated with regard to timing and the consequential saving to the court estate and victims. Within the same vein, I must express concern over the operation of the Legal Aid Agency in this jurisdiction. As noted at prior directions hearings, and regrettably repeated in this case, the delays in authorising funding for expert reports hamper the fair and efficient disposal of matters. The request to instruct an independent clinical social worker to assess your risk profile was approved only after considerable administrative delay, notwithstanding early applications made by defence counsel on 15 May 2025. Such bottlenecks represent an impediment to the administration of justice and are cause for continued institutional reflection. The case has also benefited from input by the Nottingham Mental Health Trust, with a consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr Imran Siddiqui, providing a comprehensive report addressing both clinical and criminogenic considerations. The relevance of mental health assessments in offences involving acquisitive crime has been the subject of evolving jurisprudence, exemplified in R v Mengesha [2023] EWCA Crim 1117, where the Court underscored the necessity to balance therapeutic intervention with public safety imperatives. Moreover, I have received and reviewed a number of character references submitted by family members, community support workers, and local charities engaged in supporting those with histories of economic deprivation and substance use. These documents, while informative, do not diminish the gravity of the offending. The non-violent nature of the offences must be acknowledged, yet the cumulative effects on victims – particularly small business owners and their employees – extend beyond immediate financial loss. As observed in R v Penfold [2022] EWCA Crim 1578, the psychological toll and erosion of confidence among retail workers resultant from repeated theft warrant significant consideration in sentencing. It is notable that the court’s current hearing room has undergone refurbishment to better accommodate vulnerable witnesses, including advanced audio-visual facilities. This reflects a growing recognition of the need to mitigate the trauma often associated with court attendance, albeit this case proceeded without any victim witness requiring special measures. Historical legal provisions also merit brief reflection. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, as introduced and modified over subsequent decades, codifies dishonest appropriation with the intention to permanently deprive. The Theft Amendment Act 1996 introduced nuanced sanctions aimed at the differentiated treatment of petty shoplifting versus large-scale commercial theft. This legislative evolution evidences Parliament’s intent to balance proportionate deterrence with the realities of offender profiles. Older authorities such as R v Ghosh [1982] QB 1053 retain procedural interest, though the test for dishonesty has since been revised in Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67, which clarified the requisite subjective and objective components. Such doctrinal refinements influence the court’s application of legal principles, even if particulars here point to straightforward dishonesty without complex mens rea contestations. The Defendant’s Background and Circumstances Mr H is now 34 years of age. The present set of convictions includes four previous proceedings concerning theft or attempted theft, although none resulted in custodial sentences. The most recent was a community resolution recorded in late 2022 following an incident involving alleged shoplifting from a small convenience store. Prior to that, convictions are spaced over several years, indicative of a degree of persistence in offence type. The precarity of your accommodation status has been documented by probation services and supported by correspondence from Hope Outreach Nottingham, which provides support to those experiencing housing instability. You have engaged intermittently with substance misuse services but declined a referral to the Nottinghamshire Recovery Consortium. This observed pattern of engagement and disengagement is regrettably common in individuals whose offending arises in contexts of multifactorial hardship. Notably, your educational history, as set out in the pre-sentence report, indicates disengagement at levels equivalent to Year 11, with no formal qualifications attained. Employment history is intermittent, primarily in manual labour and casual hospitality roles, with several gaps ascribed to health issues and lack of opportunity. The court has also been appraised of your early childhood adversity. Records disclose periods of foster care placement during adolescence, with documentation from Social Services outlining a history of neglect and exposure to domestic instability. Such histories, while not excusing wrongdoing, provide necessary context for understanding the complexities underlying pathways to offending. Nevertheless, the courts must remain mindful that similar backgrounds do not predetermine choices, nor eliminate accountability. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. It is also important to situate your offending within the wider societal canvas. Nottingham, like many urban centres, faces multifaceted challenges including rises in street homelessness and the normalisation of antisocial practices in retail precincts and transport hubs. The work of the Nottingham City Council’s Neighbourhood Engagement Team plays a key role in community safety initiatives, though resources remain limited. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. As this court has observed across multiple sittings, the sentencing regime for such offences must take account of the real impact on commercial confidence and community cohesion. While the theft of low-value items may appear as slight on their own, repeated acts cumulatively impose significant hardship. The Crown has submitted victim impact statements from several retail outlets, emphasising the erosive effect on staff morale and the increased operational costs—ranging from security system upgrades to adjusted staffing rotas. Such evidence has been communicated via the Nottingham Retailers Association and formally tendered as part of the prosecution files. In considering your offence and antecedents, reference must be made to the progressive development of sentencing guidelines as promulgated by the Sentencing Council. The Theft Offences Definitive Guideline, last updated in 2023, sets out clear categorisations based on the level of harm, culpability, and persistence. The court’s obligation is to weigh these factors in pursuit of a just and proportionate outcome. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. Furthermore, I have regard to the cumulative nature of these offences, as recognised in landmark authority such as R v Doherty [2010] EWCA Crim 1441, where sentences for repeat acquisitive crime were aggregated to reflect ongoing criminality rather than isolated acts. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. The report from Dr Siddiqui highlights traits consistent with impulsivity and an underlying anxiety disorder, though no formal psychiatric diagnosis of major mental illness was made. The psychiatric assessment makes recommendations for community-based rehabilitation, including cognitive behavioural therapy focused on offending behaviour and anxiety management. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. This court is all too aware of the limitations faced by probation and mental health services. Nationally, increasing caseloads, funding constraints, and staff shortages challenge the capacity to deliver timely interventions. The Nottinghamshire Probation Trust has, in recent months, reported a staffing shortfall of nearly 18%, leading to prioritisation of high-risk cases and increased pressures on medium and low-risk supervision. The defendant admitted taking the stolen items to sell at local pubs and a car boot sale, where members of the public were disturbed. Within this framework, your reluctance to fully engage with available support services is regrettable. The court notes the submission on your behalf emphasizing socio-economic precipitants and the’impact of chronic unemployment. Those matters are relevant for holistic assessment but cannot be permitted to extinguish personal responsibility. There is a growing body of literature—both academic and operational—that links acquisitive crime to entrenched cycles of deprivation and social exclusion. The complexities of rehabilitation in such circumstances are non-trivial, as explored in works such as “Crime, Poverty and Exclusion” (Palgrave Macmillan, 2024) and echoed in recent Home Office briefings. These intersect with policy concerns surrounding benefit sanctions, decreasing public trust in institutions, and the pervasive impact of social media platforms on public perception of crime. Notwithstanding these reflections, the court must apply the letter and spirit of the law. Offenders who persist in multiple thefts without meaningful engagement or demonstrable corrective action warrant sentences that signal both censure and deterrence. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. I also draw your attention to ancillary case law that, though not directly on point, informs the sentencing landscape. For instance, R v Lyons [2019] EWCA Crim 2257 involved theft of copper cabling from railway infrastructure, resulting in critical public safety concerns. While materially distinct, the case highlights the increasing judicial intolerance for thefts which, taken cumulatively, erode public confidence. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, claimed it wasn’t a serious crime and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. The court is mindful of the stated principle in R v. H (No. 3) [2023] EWCA Crim 854, which addresses the interplay between sentencing credit and guilty pleas entered at late stages. That judgement emphasises the necessity of proportionate credit, reflecting the stage at which an admission is made and the attendant cost savings to the justice system. In this context, the timing of your plea — shortly before trial readiness — reduces the maximum credit available. Your counsel has urged mitigation based upon your personal circumstances and the hope for future rehabilitation within the community-based framework. The defence points to your expression of remorse and commitment to desist from further offending. While those submissions are noted and welcomed in principle, they must be balanced against the serious nature of continuing theft in multiple premises over a sustained period and the destabilising effect upon victims and neighbourhoods. The court also acknowledges the valuable contributions from community support networks. Particular commendation is due to the Nottingham Homelessness Partnership, with whom you have had intermittent contact. Their reports suggest that closer collaboration and longer term engagement could prove beneficial, again subject to your co-operation. Allowing time for probation to consider viable interventions is appropriate. The court intends to direct preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report, including specific assessment of risk, receptivity to intervention, and feasibility of structured community orders incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements and unpaid work. It is further appropriate for a consideration of potential restorative justice facilitation to address both victim concerns and offender accountability. Having considered the totality of circumstances, the court is of the view that the matter must be remitted for sentencing once these reports have been received and considered. These sentencing remarks are given this 17th day of September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Nottingham. The proceedings have been duly recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his statutory right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved pending further directions.
