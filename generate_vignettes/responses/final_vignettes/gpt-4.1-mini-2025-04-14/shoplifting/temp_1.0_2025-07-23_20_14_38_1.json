MR H Case No. T2026/04321 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. R. DONOVAN Filed: 11 August 2026 Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing following your conviction on a charge of theft by shoplifting, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending in question consists of multiple episodes of theft targeting retail premises in the Belmont metropolitan area between August 2024 and February 2026. This court acknowledges the complex and multifaceted nature of what may superficially appear as a single event, but which in reality represents a protracted pattern of behaviour with substantial repercussions for both victims and the wider community. Procedural History You were initially apprehended on 15 February 2026 after a joint operation involving Belmont Borough Police, the Retail Crime Alliance, and the Trading Standards Unit. This multi-agency effort was prompted by an uptick in reported losses at several local retail stores, particularly those specialising in personal care products and small electronic goods. The investigative process was arduous, entailing the collation of numerous accounts, photographic evidence, and voluminous CCTV analysis. Notably, the investigation spanned a period of approximately eighteen months, marked by episodic spikes in offending, and required substantial cooperation between investigating officers, local business associations, and community safety partnerships. An early hearing initially scheduled for 29 March 2026 was adjourned at your representation’s request to permit the gathering of additional character references and the completion of a psychiatric evaluation. This evaluation was commissioned in response to an application under section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, seeking expert commentary on any underlying mental health issues potentially mitigating culpability or bearing upon suitable disposals. I express appreciation to Dr Hannah Walls, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose detailed and professionally prepared report was filed on 31 May 2026. Dr Walls’ conclusions will be considered in due course. For reasons that are now well-understood, the case was further delayed due to intermittent staff shortages at the Legal Aid Agency, notably affecting the prompt appointment of your instructed solicitor, Mr David Keane. Such administrative delays, regrettably, underscore systemic shortcomings in the administration of criminal justice support services—delays that serve neither public interest nor justice. The court notes these difficulties with frankness and hopes that ongoing reforms will ameliorate procedural bottlenecks. The plea and trial preparation hearing occurred on 12 July 2026, at which you entered a guilty plea, albeit at a late stage and only after significant evidential disclosure by the prosecution, including cross-referenced mobile phone location data and subsequent forensic confirmation of possession of stolen goods. The timing of your plea, while acknowledged as an acceptance of responsibility, attracts accordingly reduced credit consistent with jurisprudence such as R v Haider [2023] EWCA Crim 2236 and R v Ferguson [2025] EWCA Crim 145. The court understands the tension between the right to test the prosecution's case and the systemic imperative to avoid protracted litigation. This case provides a stark illustration of persistent acquisitive offending, which despite its ostensibly “low-level” nature can have profound cumulative effects on local commerce and community wellbeing. Such patterns demand calibrated judicial response. It is pertinent at this juncture to recall the legislative evolution that underpins the court’s remit in theft cases. The Theft Act 1968, as amended by the Fraud Act 2006 and the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline 2021, sets the threshold for sentencing based on factors including loss value, planning, previous convictions, and impact on victims. The guidelines explicitly consider the frequency and cumulative damage of persistent offending, a matter highly relevant here. Mr H placed £18 worth of bath and body items inside his coat and left the store without attempting to pay for them. Shadowing the Theft Act’s provisions, the court is mindful of key appellate authorities. In particular, R v Dunlop [2019] EWCA Crim 1192 articulated the principle that repeated acquisitive offences escalate culpability proportionally. Dunlop concerned multiple counts of shoplifting pharmaceuticals from different stores over a 12-month period, reinforcing that serial thefts reflect an aggravating framework distinct from isolated incidents. Moreover, in R v Cooper [2022] EWCA Crim 1550, a case involving the theft of goods from supermarkets, the Court reiterated the importance of considering the psychological impact on shop staff, even in the absence of physical harm, noting that repeated theft undermines staff confidence and affects workplace morale. Beyond the immediate legal principles, the broader context within which this cycle of offending occurs demands attention. The court is acutely aware of the ongoing pressures on public services: the overstretched nature of the Probation Service, whose staffing shortages regularly impact supervision quality; the chronic underfunding of mental health support leading to elongated NHS waiting lists; and the strain on voluntary-sector resources, a matter acknowledged in recent HM Inspectorate reports. These systemic deficiencies, while outside the direct remit of this court, form a backdrop to cases involving repeat offending and complicate rehabilitation efforts. The court furthermore notes the social and economic environment of Belmont over the relevant period. The increase in street homelessness, the evolving patterns of urban antisocial behaviour, and wider community fragmentation contribute to a milieu in which acquisitive crime has become distressingly commonplace. Such trends pose challenges to law enforcement, local authorities, welfare organisations, and the judiciary alike. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. Incidentally, the court cannot resist mentioning the curious procedural episode arising in the nearby case of R v. Taylor [2025] Belmont Crown Court T2025/03850, involving a co-defendant arrested in a wholly unrelated bail hearing. Though legally unconnected to the present proceedings, the case has reached prominence due to sensational media coverage focusing on violent disorder at a local pub rather than the minor property offences with which Taylor was charged. This court’s docket remains distinguished by a thankfully less inflammatory record. Returning to Mr H, the court also takes into account correspondence received from the Retail Victim Support Network, which has engaged directly with several affected shop managers. Their reports detail the operational challenges posed by recurring theft: staff anxiety, rota adjustments, and the financial strain of increased security measures. Their submissions further underscore the need for appropriate sentencing to serve both retributive and deterrent purposes. Additionally, the work conducted by Belmont Borough’s Business Crime Reduction Partnership deserves mention. Established in 2018, the partnership facilitates strategic coordination among retailers, police, and local government agencies to prevent acquisitive crime. While no system is infallible, the partnership’s proactive campaigns and data-sharing protocols have demonstrably contributed to crime reduction elsewhere in the region. Mr H stole alcohol and tobacco from the same neighbourhood shop on four separate occasions across a three-week span. On the matter of your background, the court has carefully studied the probation officer’s pre-sentence report. It provides a comprehensive account of your life circumstances, including your current residence in supported accommodation arranged through the Belmont Homelessness Prevention Service. This voluntary scheme aims to stabilise housing for individuals at risk but is, like many such programmes nationwide, operating under near-constant strain due to funding uncertainties. The report also details your sporadic engagement with addiction recovery groups, characterised by inconsistent attendance and mixed commitment. That said, probation officers note a recent tentative willingness to explore structured support, which may bear positively on rehabilitation prospects. Mr H feigned interest in Oyster Card payments to distract the cashier and reached behind the counter to take an item from the display. It must be said, however, that your pattern of offending reflects a considerable degree of planning and awareness of risk. This is not the behaviour of a momentary lapse; rather, it is the repeated and deliberate exercise of agency, executed despite prior warnings and interventions. As such, the court must weigh the balance between recognising personal difficulties and safeguarding community interests. Dr Walls’ psychiatric evaluation is pertinent. Her report states that while you do not present with a clear-cut clinical diagnosis warranting hospitalisation or secure treatment, marked features of impulsivity and a borderline personality disorder spectrum were observed. The report further highlights difficulty with emotional regulation and interpersonal relationships. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. Dr Walls emphasised that such traits do pose challenges for traditional rehabilitative pathways and increase risk of recidivism without tailored intervention. She suggests a multi-modal approach encompassing psychological support, community supervision, and vocational engagement. The court also recalls the ruling in R v. Mitchell [2020] EWCA Crim 1896, in which immediate custody was upheld partly due to the offender’s prior failures to comply with community orders, despite evident mental health problems. That case illustrates that clinical factors do not inherently preclude custodial sentences but must be balanced with risk management. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. Your previous criminal record, as set out in court documents, comprises several convictions for theft-related offences, dating over a decade prior yet relevant to the overall assessment of persistence. The court notes prior community resolutions and warnings administered by local police, none of which appear to have deterred you conclusively. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and threatened employees while interfering with store surveillance systems, triggering distress and security concerns. Furthermore, this court is aware of the burden that cases of this nature place on retail workers, local policing teams, and justice services. The operational difficulties experienced by front-line officers tasked with investigating low-level crime have been well-documented. Analytical capacity within digital forensics units is stretched thinly, with officers often diverted from more serious crime areas due to the volume of acquisitive offences. The escalating cost to public agencies and commercial enterprises is substantial, further underscoring the justification for an effective sentencing response. Mr H stated in interview that he frequently takes items, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. In preparation for this hearing, the court also reviewed a series of letters from community organisations emphasising an ethos of rehabilitation and social support. Belmont Hope, a local charity providing wraparound services for vulnerable adults, expressed concern at the limited engagement but reiterated willingness to assist upon release or community sentence imposition. The court encourages such collaboration, recognising the vital role played by voluntary sector agencies in filling gaps created by constrained statutory resources. Turning finally to matters of sentencing principle, the court applies the framework enshrined in the Sentencing Council's Definitive Guideline for Theft Offences (effective 2021), alongside relevant statutory provisions including the Sentencing Act 2020 amendments concerning community sentences and custodial thresholds. The nature of this offending—serial, premeditated, and impacting multiple victims cumulatively—engages the higher strata of culpability within the guideline matrix. The relatively modest individual value of the goods involved does not diminish the aggregate seriousness. Your late plea mitigates sentence to some degree but does not obviate responsibility for protracted proceedings and resource expenditure. The court also contemplates the principle of parity, situating your sentence alongside comparable cases while considering your circumstances. Having regard to all material factors, including the psychiatric assessment and probation report, the court will adjourn for the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report. This report should detail intervention proposals tailored to your needs and risk profile, including the potential merits of cognitive behavioural programmes designed to address acquisitive offending, as well as any necessary clinical or substance misuse treatment modalities. The court recognises that any effective sentence must harmonise punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 11 August 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Belmont. The hearing was conducted in open court before His Honour Judge L. R. Donovan. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and subsequent sentence will be forwarded to the relevant agencies. You retain the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days, as provided under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply in respect of these proceedings. Costs are reserved for subsequent determination.
