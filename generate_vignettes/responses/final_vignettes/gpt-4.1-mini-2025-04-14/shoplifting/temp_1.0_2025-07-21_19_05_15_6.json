MR H Case No. KT2025/14329 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Eleanor J. Fairclough Filed: 17 September 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence arising from a charge of theft by shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This matter has been presented against the backdrop of a series of incidents extending over the past eighteen months and involving multiple retail outlets in and around the Kingston-upon-Thames area. The facts as proven are reflective of persistent and deliberate acts of acquisitive offending, the gravity of which merits careful judicial attention. Procedural History and Case Progression To recount the procedural path to this hearing: you were initially arrested on 13 February 2025 following a coordinated investigative effort spearheaded by officers of the Greater London South Crime Unit working in concert with the Kingston Business Crime Reduction Partnership. This multi-agency initiative embraced the ideals of intelligence-led policing with a focus on chronic retail theft offenders. Although shoplifting is often deemed a low-level offence by the general public, the resources marshalled to identify and apprehend you were substantial, involving surveillance operations, CCTV collation, and witness interviews. It is important to underscore the cumulative impact of such offending on the operational capacity of policing teams who are, regrettably, overburdened by the manifold demands of general law enforcement, ranging from violent crime to cyber-enabled fraud. Initial police interview took place on 18 February 2025, at Kingston Police Station. During this interview, you exercised your right to silence. However, compounding evidence, including footwear impressions and store security footage, resulted in your charge on 22 March 2025. The case was allocated under the Better Case Management (BCM) system, with listing for a plea and trial preparation hearing scheduled on 7 July 2025. The BCM initiative, now firmly entrenched across the circuits, seeks to mitigate delays evident in pre-2010 practices by imposing structured timetables, requiring early disclosure, and fostering prosecutorial and defence cooperation. While the aspirational aims of BCM are universally recognised, in practice cases such as this one still encounter adjournments due to funding applications or expert report acquisition delays. It is worth remarking that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of funding applications in this case was notably protracted. Despite timely submission of requests by your legal team on 15 March and 28 May for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist specialising in addiction and impulsivity, formal authority was only granted on 12 August 2025. Such delays have become regrettably commonplace and impose a tangible toll on the fair administration of justice, increasing stress for defendants and burdening court fixtures. The court will be making inquiries as to whether systemic improvements can be introduced to prevent similar instances in the future. Representations have been made on your behalf by Mr Oliver K. Trent, instructed under Legal Aid. I record my thanks for his considered submissions and his patient efforts to engage with the numerous agencies involved. Ms Fiona Caldwell appears for the Crown and, as ever, I note her professional diligence in managing the prosecution file within the tight time constraints imposed by scheduling demands. Discussions at the plea and trial preparation hearing permitted the Crown to set the scene regarding the evidential position and the prospect of securing a conviction should the matter proceed contested. Your eventual guilty plea was entered on 3 September 2025, a date shortly before the trial window but notably later than the earliest possible opportunity, a factor that will bear upon any credit for plea discount. The court must remind itself that while a plea of guilty generally merits a reduction of sentence to reflect remorse and proceedings saved, where pleas are entered late—particularly after disclosure of comprehensive evidence and detailed witness statements—the discount must be prudently moderated. This principle was lucidly articulated in R v Diamond [2023] EWCA Crim 781, where the Court of Appeal confirmed that any credit for guilty plea should be tempered where the defendant’s admission arose from tactical considerations rather than genuine acceptance of responsibility. A further procedural note: this case was listed in Court 4, which underwent recent refurbishment to better accommodate vulnerable witnesses. Unfortunately, a scheduled hearing in May 2025 was vacated due to the unforeseen and regrettable absence of an essential court clerk, causing rescheduling to August. While such disruptions should be minimised, this reflects the real-world pressures under which court administration staff operate. The charge against you is governed by section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. In this jurisdiction, shoplifting, while often trite in appearance, is acknowledged as carrying significant consequences for victims — both individual and commercial — and broader community confidence. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (July 2021 edition) provides detailed frameworks informing the court’s decision. It requires that factors such as the value of the goods, the degree of planning, any aggravating elements such as repeat offending or targeting vulnerable victims, and the impact on those affected be fully considered. Moreover, the guideline emphasises that sentencing should be proportionate and, where appropriate, utilise community-based disposals armed with rehabilitative resources. Of particular note is the case of R v Whelan [2022] EWCA Crim 1258, where the Court considered the sentencing of repeat shoplifters targeting pharmacies, highlighting the combined effect on victim vulnerability and public trust. Whelan emphasised that even relatively low monetary values could necessitate custodial measures if offending was persistent and wilful. In R v Greenwood [2019] EWCA Crim 492, the court clarified that the presence or absence of violence is not determinative but the psychological impact upon victims and the community must not be underestimated. Equally, in R v Thomas [2020] EWCA Crim 982, when personal mitigation was found limited, an immediate custodial sentence was upheld for an offender who demonstrated no genuine remorse and breached previous statutory orders. Furthermore, the environmental context in which offences occur is relevant to culpability. In R v Canfield [2021] EWCA Crim 2077, the court observed that offences in areas of high social deprivation or near protective social service facilities may aggravate harm and attract sterner penalties where targeting appeared deliberate. Mr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment. Amongst important contextual matters, the court is mindful that your offending took place not only in large retail supermarkets but also in smaller independent local shops. Independent shops often lack the robust security apparatuses of larger chains and rely greatly on goodwill and community trust. The burdens imposed by repeat theft on such enterprises extend beyond accounting losses and may jeopardize business viability, employment, and local economic health. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. A further consideration is the operational pressures faced by the various public services in this jurisdiction. The Kingston Safer Neighbourhood Team has reported significant resource strain due to simultaneous demands from violent crime, road traffic collisions and recent public disorder events arising from protracted industrial dispute protests affecting local transport corridors. Such resource diversification inevitably impacts their prioritisation of “non-serious” offences, yet shoplifting investigations continue as a vital preventive measure. Within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same shop on four occasions, each time removing alcohol and tobacco without paying. The Crown has made cogent submissions on the cumulative effect of your conduct. Repeated entries into the same premises, seemingly timed to coincide with periods of reduced staffing or shift changes, indicate a deliberate and planned modus operandi. The court has also received written statements from several shop staff expressing increased anxiety and distress. Many have altered their working patterns or taken steps to avoid lone shifts as a result of your activities. While there is no allegation of physical aggression, the psychological impact on these individuals is not insignificant. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. Several volunteer organisations have contributed representations in this matter, including the Kingston Rescue Outreach and Community Support Team (KROCS), which offered assistance to individuals facing homelessness and poverty in the area. KROCS staff have provided evidence of the systemic difficulties endemic to the locality, highlighting long waiting lists for social housing, the rising cost of living, and significant mental health service backlogs impacting potential vulnerable offenders. These observations resonate with wider national concerns regarding the fracturing of community networks and the attendant rise in street-level acquisitive crime. Nevertheless, as noted in R v Oakes [2023] EWCA Crim 525, context and circumstance do not diminish individual accountability. The security tag was removed using a magnet, which was subsequently discovered on his person during arrest. Your pre-sentence report, prepared by probation officer Sarah Mann, dated 10 September 2025, is a detailed and professional appraisal of your background, character, and risk profile. The report notes your history of unstable accommodation, sporadic employment, and a pattern of substance misuse dating back several years. It records your partial engagement in a previous community order for theft-related offences and outlines a moderate risk of reoffending. The report further recommends consideration of referral to a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) programme addressing acquisitive offending and impulsivity, alongside continued addiction support through local NHS provision. Ms Mann remarks upon your inconsistent compliance with earlier interventions and urges caution in relying on positive prognosis alone. It is noted that you have declined to participate fully in substance misuse counselling to date. The defendant admitted selling the stolen items at a car boot sale and local pubs, disturbing customers. In addition, the court acknowledges the expert evidence obtained from Dr Rhian Morris, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, appointed pursuant to the defence application authorised on 12 August 2025. Dr Morris’s report, dated 1 September 2025, offers the view that while you do not meet criteria for major mental illness, there are identifiable traits consistent with borderline personality disorder, marked impulsivity, and intermittent episodes of low mood. It is further stated that your history of alcohol misuse has contributed to episodic disinhibition, which may have exacerbated offending behaviour. Dr Morris stresses the importance of multi-disciplinary management and expresses guarded optimism about potential benefits from engagement in specialist personality disorder services. The report cautions, however, against over-optimism given your history of poor attendance at appointments. Treatment adherence remains the decisive factor in both risk reduction and rehabilitation. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and challenged shop workers while damaging security cameras using spray paint, prompting serious safety fears among staff. It is instructive to place the present matter within the wider jurisprudential landscape. Acquisitive offending, while traditionally classified as low-level crime, has become increasingly scrutinised for its broader societal costs. Recent scholarly analyses published in the Journal of Criminal Justice Studies have circulated observations on the shifting dynamics of retail crime, noting technological evolutions in surveillance and self-service checkout, alongside adaptive tactics employed by offenders, including strategic concealment techniques and deliberate exploitation of staffing vulnerabilities. Court records also reveal that co-defendants in related regional cases have displayed a disparate range of offending behaviours, including possession of offensive weapons and public order offences during retail theft incidents. Such facts, while peripheral to your conduct, illustrate the complexity of the operational environment in which enforcement occurs. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, claims it isn’t really stealing and expects to do it again soon. Notwithstanding these observations, the court must resist the temptation to conflate distinct individuals’ conduct or to allow collateral fact patterns to cloud precise sentencing considerations. Your offending must be addressed on its individual merits and circumstances. The Crown has urged the court to impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness of a continuing course of conduct, the cumulative detriment to victims, and the need for deterrence. The defence mitigation foregrounds your personal difficulties, partial compliance with previous orders, and expressed willingness to engage with rehabilitative programmes. In accordance with the Sentencing Council guidelines, mitigation is limited. The late plea reduces but does not extinguish plea credit. Personal circumstances, while troubling, do not amount to a sufficient cause for leniency in light of the persistence and planning evident in your offending. The court treats seriously the impact upon victims, the strain on public services, and the clear risk of recurrence absent robust intervention. The probation report and psychiatric assessment both signal the necessity of structured, community-based rehabilitative input. Custodial sentences should not be imposed lightly but remain a valid and sometimes necessary component of the sentencing spectrum in cases where public protection and deterrence demand it. I am accordingly deferring final sentencing to allow for receipt of an updated pre-sentence report which can consider any progress with service engagement, address the feasibility of bespoke programme referrals, and inform proportional sentencing options. This report should also consider risk of harm to the public and any ancillary matters warranting ancillary court orders. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 6 of Kingston Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. A formal transcript has been prepared and will be provided to all parties. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal conviction and sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs remain reserved.
