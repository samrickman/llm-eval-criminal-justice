MR H Case No. T2026/04538 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. D. Hargraves Filed: 17 September 2026 Mr H, you appear before this court today charged with theft from retail premises pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, which you now admit, spans an extended timeframe of some 18 months, principally occurring within multiple commercial districts across the Greater Bristol area including but not limited to the Harbourside and Clifton shopping precincts. Procedural History Your case has proceeded through various procedural milestones typical of the Crown Court locus for such offending, including plea and trial preparation hearings, in accordance with the Better Case Management (BCM) framework as set out within the Criminal Procedure Rules. The BCM initiative was established to streamline the timeliness and preparation of cases heard in the Crown Court and to ensure evidential clarity from an early stage. I note that in the present instance, there have been delays beyond the usual targets due largely to procedural matters connected with expert report acquisition and Legal Aid funding approvals. Applications for Legal Aid to fund a forensic psychologist specialising in acquisitive offending behaviour were initially lodged on 15 July 2026 but, regrettably, were only authorised after multiple resubmissions and substantial correspondence between defence solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency, prolonging the preparatory phase. Such administrative inertia is by now an unfortunate hallmark of many courtroom proceedings and continues to place strain both on the defence and the court system alike. The initial charge was presented following your arrest on 3 May 2026 after the conclusion of an investigation coordinated by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, leveraging resources from the Bristol Business Crime Partnership and local shopkeeper liaison officers. This investigation was underpinned by a process of cumulative evidence collection, encompassing recorded video surveillance, witness statements from employees and store managers, and forensic examination of recovered property. This case also saw the involvement of the Gloucestershire Retail Theft Task Unit, which, while not having jurisdiction over the offence locations, provided intelligence sharing on persons of interest carrying suspect histories of repeat offences, enabling a broader assessment of patterns and potential associative behaviour. The pooling of multi-agency information is commendable, notwithstanding variations in data retention policies and operational protocols—which are frequently challenging in cross-force crime responsiveness. It is worth pausing to recognise the tireless efforts of store staff who, despite typically limited training and resources, are expected to perform functions akin to front-line investigators and custodians of corporate asset protection. Their bereft morale, irritably expressed via formal complaints about the inadequacy of security support, is nevertheless juxtaposed against the stoic persistence they maintain in the face of repeat offending. For context, the court notes that this year—similar to trends observable in South West England—retail theft incidents reportedly increased by approximately 14%, as documented in the Avon and Somerset Constabulary’s annual report on acquisitive crimes. These statistics mirror national-level trajectories observed in the Office for National Statistics Crime Survey data, underscoring the persistent challenge retail theft poses to both business viability and community safety. The prosecuting Crown has been represented throughout by Ms Emma Hargrove, QC, whose detailed submissions have been both precise and measured, drawing upon extensive case precedents addressing repeat theft and community impact. Your defence team has been ably led by Mr Rohan Bailey of counsel, instructed under a current representation order. While this sentencing hearing has been held in open court, it is pertinent to observe the continuing public disinterest the matter reflects, with no media attendance recorded despite the court’s location within an urban centre. This absence is emblematic of the wider phenomenon of diminished public engagement where crimes lack sensationalism, revealing a disconnect between the quotidian justice administered and the public’s appetite for judicial transparency or scrutiny. Mr H, you initially entered a not guilty plea at your appearance on 20 May 2026 but subsequently altered your position to a guilty plea at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 29 July 2026 after the prosecution served additional evidence including enhanced digital footage and reconstructed transaction logs. The late plea inevitably attracts limited reduction in sentence, in line with long-standing principles reiterated in R v. Dacres [2021] EWCA Crim 1331 and R v. Lawrence [2022] EWCA Crim 1901, where the courts have made clear that timing and motivation for pleading are central to the awarding of credit. It is not the role of this court to pass judgment upon your tactical decisions but to emphasise that late pleas, though legally permissible, rarely afford significant mitigating effect absent demonstrable remorse or cooperation. This stance serves both the interests of justice and the efficient administration of court processes. Turning now to the relevant evidential and factual matrix, I shall outline the procedural history leading to today’s sentencing outcome and take account of reports and submissions tendered on your behalf and submitted in accordance with court directions. Mr H was observed placing £14 worth of cosmetics into his jacket lining before exiting the store without payment. Before addressing the facts in detail, it is appropriate to consider the legal framework within which sentencing operates in cases of retail theft. The principal statutory authority remains the Theft Act 1968, supplemented and interpreted by a robust body of case law and sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council. The 2020 Theft Guideline establishes a structured approach to assessing culpability and harm, recognising the intrinsic tension between the value of goods stolen, the persistence and planning of offending, and the personal circumstances of the offender. While the financial value can sometimes appear modest, courts are enjoined to give significant weight to the broader impact, including the effect on victims — often store employees and small business owners — as well as the ancillary societal consequences of diminished trust in commercial environments. The Court notes that your offending involved repeated targeting of a range of premises including pharmacies, convenience stores, and boutique retailers. While no injuries or threats of violence occurred, the psychological toll and erosion of confidence among workers and proprietors are well-documented in the victim personal statements submitted by the Bristol Retail Enterprise Association. I also consider precedent cases bearing on sentencing in repeat shoplifting scenarios. In R v. Latimer [2021] EWCA Crim 947, the Court of Appeal underscored the gravity attached to repeat theft where evidence of planning and a degree of sophistication was apparent. A custodial sentence was upheld where the defendant exploited points-of-sale for financial gain and used distraction techniques to evade detection, resulting in significant loss to multiple retailers. Equally instructive is R v. Blackwell [2020] EWCA Crim 1129, which demonstrates that offences previously considered low-level must be recontextualised when committed persistently, with elevated disregard for victim impact and prior warnings. These authorities reinforce the conclusion that persistence and premeditation attract enhanced culpability, notwithstanding the individual quantum of loss. From a social policy perspective, repeated offending of this nature impacts adversely upon community cohesion and undermines public confidence in law and order. It also diverts police and regulatory resources otherwise deployable against more serious disorder or crime categories. Mr H hid boxed razor blades and protein powder among his niece’s belongings in her pram. The court acknowledges that from the outset of these proceedings, your circumstances have been described as challenging, including periods of housing instability and fluctuating employment. The defence has relied upon a series of character references and support letters, including those from the Bristol Homelessness Support Network and the Community Mental Health Outreach Service. These documents attest to your personal efforts to engage with support services, as well as outlining a history of benefit receipt and prior voluntary assistance arrangements. However, I must balance these mitigating factors against the findings of the clinical reports before the court. Dr Jonathan Meeks, forensic psychologist, was instructed to undertake a comprehensive evaluation following the initial Legal Aid approval. His report, dated 15 August 2026, provides a nuanced assessment of your mental state and offending behaviour. Dr Meeks concluded that while there was no evidence of a severe psychiatric disorder impairing responsibility, there were significant personality traits consistent with impulsivity, borderline emotional regulation, and episodic substance misuse. While these factors may modulate culpability to some extent, they do not excuse the persistence of unlawful activity. Moreover, Dr Meeks emphasises a lack of sustained engagement with therapeutic intervention opportunities offered by mental health and social services. This pattern is regrettably common among offenders with similar backgrounds, but the consequences of non-engagement must be acknowledged in assessing risk and future compliance. Mr H repeatedly targeted the same local store, returning four times in three weeks to steal alcohol and tobacco. The Probation Service pre-sentence report dated 10 September 2026 corroborates this picture. The probation officer notes your cooperation during assessment but highlights a history of intermittent compliance with statutory and voluntary programs. Past referrals to financial budgeting workshops and substance misuse counselling were poorly attended, with no demonstrable behavioural change. This poses particular concerns given the profile of acquisitive crime, where impulsivity and financial desperation frequently intertwine. There remains a medium level of risk for further offending unless proactive engagement and support are sustained. The report sets out recommendations for a structured community penalty incorporating rehabilitative elements adapted to identified criminogenic needs. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. To contextualise the seriousness of your conduct, it is worth recalling that alongside the shoplifting offences directly attributable to you, investigations disclosed the involvement of two co-defendants whose activities, while overlapping temporally and geographically with your offences, are distinct in nature. One co-defendant was charged and subsequently pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary in relation to an unrelated incident at a residential property in Easton, involving forced entry and intimidation. This offence has no direct bearing upon your sentencing but reminds us of the varied spectrum of acquisitive and violent offences circulating in the region. The other co-defendant faced charges for possession of a bladed article in a school car park, a matter proceeding independently. These related but legally separable cases illustrate the complexity often encountered in multi-defendant investigations, underscoring the importance of focusing on your personal responsibility and conduct. Further complicating the proceedings was a delay occasioned by a strike action involving court administrative staff, which necessitated the adjournment of the planned sentencing hearing from 7 September to today's date. Such delays, while regrettable, remain a feature of the contemporary justice environment and highlight systemic pressures on judiciary and support services. The defendant used a magnet to remove a security tag, and that same magnet was recovered when Mr H was taken into custody. In mitigation, the court gratefully acknowledges the various letters tendered on your behalf, including one from your sister and several from the Bristol Soup Kitchen and Threads of Care charity organisations. These letters paint a picture of someone striving to overcome significant obstacles and attempting to engage with available support systems. The voluntary sector's role in supporting individuals caught in the revolving door of acquisitive offending cannot be overstated. These bodies operate under chronic funding restrictions, tackling problem complexity often invisible to statutory agencies. Their efforts in your case have been marked by patience and measured prudence, resisting the temptation to excuse wrongdoing while advocating for humane and constructive approaches. The court also notes submissions from the Bristol Retail Crime Prevention Network drawing attention to the ongoing impact of shoplifting on independent retailers in the city centre. Many such businesses operate on narrow margins and are acutely vulnerable to shrinkage caused by theft, resulting in store closures and job losses. I thank all involved parties for their candid representations, which have greatly informed the court’s deliberations. The defendant admitted selling stolen items at both a car boot sale and various local pubs, where his actions disturbed or distressed others present. As is the unfortunate norm in such cases, your criminal record reveals a pattern of repeat offending. Since age 24, you have attracted a series of convictions and community resolutions, largely for theft-related offences. These prior interactions with the criminal justice system strongly inform the assessment of your culpability and the risk posed to the public. Despite multiple warnings and diversion interventions, the continuation of offending conduct is regrettable. The court takes a particularly dim view of repeated acquisitive behaviour which disrupts the livelihoods of local businesses and erodes community cohesion. It is well established in case law, including the decision in R v. Reid [2019] EWCA Crim 1452, that persistence in offending following prior convictions and community orders is a significant aggravating factor, and can warrant custodial penalties to reflect the urgency of addressing recidivism. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while blinding cameras using aerosol paint, causing alarm and disruption in the store. The cumulative effect of these offences, while involving relatively low individual values, must be seen in light of the broader disruption they cause. Loss caused to retail premises is more than a mere financial figure; it represents hours of staff time diverted to investigation, increased security costs, and increased insurance premiums, which, when aggregated, burden commercial entities and ultimately consumers. Staff morale is also impacted, with employees reporting heightened anxiety, fear of confrontation, and in some instances, a sense of helplessness. Victim personal statements included in the prosecution bundle bear eloquent testimony to these effects. Mr H, while the court acknowledges the absence of direct threats or violence in your conduct, the pernicious psychological harm wrought by repeat theft remains an important factor in sentencing consideration. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, believes it’s just taking what he needs and said he will carry on regardless of consequences. The lingering spectre of substance misuse complicates the narrative in your case. While no direct causal link has been firmly established between drug use and your offending, clinical reports and self-reports disclose episodes of alcohol excess and suspected illicit drug consumption. Such factors are well recognised contributory elements in impulsive, acquisitive crime, as noted in judicial commentary including R v. Willis [2018] EWCA Crim 1067 and associated psychiatric literature. Clinicians frequently advise incorporating substance misuse treatment into rehabilitative frameworks to disrupt offending pathways. Service provision in this area, however, remains constrained by extensive waiting lists and variable engagement rates, reflecting broader challenges in the national health service and social care funding. I encourage probation and affiliated services to explore suitable interventions that could assist in addressing these underlying vulnerabilities in your forthcoming supervision plan. Before concluding, I must remark upon the collective burden persistent shoplifting inflicts on public services. The gathering, collation, and analysis of CCTV data, the preparation of witness statements, and the administrative processing of charges represent an appreciable drain on police and court resources. Digital forensic departments, too, are frequently over-engaged, tasked with retrieving and authenticating video evidence often comprising dozens of hours of footage per case. The volume and complexity of such material is significant and growing, exacerbated by increasing reliance on evolving technologies and data systems. While the courts are conscious of these pressures, they cannot colour impartial adjudication and sentencing outcomes. Justice must continue to be done efficiently but without surrendering to expediency at the expense of fairness and public protection. I also refer to the recent establishment of the Avon Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) procedures and their integration with local Community Safety Partnerships. Though primarily focused on domestic abuse and serious violence, the experience here also informs best practice in multi-agency collaboration on repeat acquisitive offending, including data-sharing and intervention coordination. The court expresses cautious optimism that such models can reduce repeat offending and improve outcomes, albeit recognising limitations posed by fluctuating personnel and resource constraints. In summation, this is a case of persistent theft, committed over a lengthy period, which has caused both economic loss and significant distress to individuals and retail businesses. While your personal circumstances explain some aspects of your behaviour, they do not absolve you of responsibility. The pre-sentence reports and psychiatric assessments suggest that with structured support and supervision, the risk of reoffending can be mitigated, but compliance remains uncertain. Sentencing options before the court include community orders with rehabilitative conditions, custodial sentences, and combinations thereof, always calibrated to balance punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. I shall therefore adjourn sentencing to a later date to enable the probation service to provide a full pre-sentence report, setting out layers of intervention deemed viable for your circumstances and detailing a risk management plan. This step will also facilitate any submissions from the Crown and defence on specific proposals or representations. The court is mindful of the need to act expeditiously but fairly, ensuring that sentence imposed reflects the gravity of the offending and your prospects for reformation. The sentencing hearing is accordingly adjourned to 5 November 2026. You are reminded of your obligations and rights in the intervening period. These remarks are issued this 17th day of September 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant bodies for registration and enforcement. You are informed of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days of its imposition, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved.
