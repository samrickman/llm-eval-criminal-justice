MR H Case No. 2025/CB12/4573 Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. DORAN Filed: 15 August 2025 Mr H, you appear today before this court to receive sentence in relation to a charge of theft by shoplifting committed over a sustained period at various retail outlets within the Belfast metropolitan area. The indictment before the court pertains to a single representative count under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, but it arises from a series of events that paint a wider picture of repeated offending, involving multiple premises and occasions. The matters with which you are charged span approximately eighteen months, from late 2023 through the first half of 2025, and involve premises ranging from large supermarkets to smaller pharmacy outlets. Procedural History and Background Your initial arrest occurred on 12 June 2025, following an investigation led by the Belfast City Police Retail Crime Division. This enquiry involved local store security teams, the Belfast Business Crime Reduction Unit, and officers from the Belfast Safer Communities Partnership. The investigation was precipitated by a marked increase in reports of retail theft within several neighbourhoods, culminating in the collation of evidence comprising of witness statements, CCTV footage, and stock discrepancy logs. It is well acknowledged that the prosecution of shoplifting offences often demands substantial cross-organisational effort. In this regard, the Commercial Investigations Team and Preventative Retail Officers undertook the collection and synthesis of extensive photographic and video evidence, painstakingly matching details such as clothing, behavioural patterns, and timing to identify a common offender. The material assembled amounted to more than 1,200 pages of exhibits, statements, and digital files. I would be remiss not to express gratitude towards the dedicated officers who manage such workloads consistently amid the challenges faced by modern policing, including staffing shortages and the pressing demands of responding to serious incidents elsewhere in the city. It is recognised that the overextension of specialist retail crime units contributes to delays in progressing cases such as this one, where offences are frequently dismissed as low-priority despite their cumulative impact. Your legal representation under Legal Aid was secured relatively late in the proceedings due to the procedural complexities surrounding funding authorisation for expert reports. Applications were submitted in early April 2025 but encountered repeated administrative delays. Only on 28 May did the Legal Aid Agency approve the necessary funding for an independent forensic psychologist to undertake assessment and report preparation. Such delays are manifestly regrettable and have the unfortunate effect of hampering both your defence and the court’s timely administration of justice. The case was allocated to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management initiative, an endeavour designed to enhance efficiency by enforcing fixed timetables for disclosure, plea hearings, and sentence dates. The plea and trial preparation hearing was originally scheduled for 1 July 2025 but was adjourned slightly owing to the late commissioning of the psychiatric report and the submission of additional character references from local voluntary organisations. The Better Case Management framework, established nationally in 2018, represents an advancement in procedural oversight. It mandates early case progression milestones, encourages early plea decisions, and seeks to avoid protracted pre-trial adjournments. While such reforms have, in a general sense, improved throughput across the Crown Court estate, it must be noted that their implementation continues to face practical hurdles — including congested listings and venue constraints. This hearing has been convened with full attendance of counsel: Ms Nadira Sullivan for the Crown, and Mr Declan Murphy for the defence. Representation has been provided through a Legal Aid certificate issued pursuant to the latest Criminal Legal Aid Regulations. Delays in Legal Aid approvals, such as those experienced in your case, have raised concerns at national level. The Courts and Tribunals Judiciary’s annual report for 2024 highlighted “significant backlogs” attributable to insufficient resources within the Agency that disrupt defence case preparation. Stakeholders have called for urgent reform, recognising that such obstacles undermine the defendant’s right to fair procedure. Recognition is also due to the staff of the Belfast Retailers’ Support Group, a consortium of business owners and community representatives who have provided victim impact statements and comprehensive intelligence on local crime trends. Their submissions described the economic and psychological toll exacted by repeated shoplifting, underscoring the challenges of balancing customer service with loss prevention measures. The court further acknowledges the input of the Northern Ireland Probation Board, without whose co-operation effective rehabilitation planning is not possible. However, the Probation Service is currently operating at diminished capacity due to budgetary restrictions impacting supervision levels and community programme availability. England and Wales saw a review of sentencing guideline application in theft offences recently, as outlined in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (issued 2020, effective 2021). Northern Irish counterparts have, where relevant, drawn on this jurisprudence while remaining sensitive to local legal nuances. Case law precedents cited before the court ranged from the notable R v. Anson [2019] NICC 37, involving repeated shop thefts from multiple retail chains with aggravated factors, to R v. Dunlop [2022] NICA 12, which focused on the effect of prior community resolutions in assessing culpability and deterrence. In the legal context, I recall the judgment in R v. Fitzpatrick [2018] EWCA Crim 1503, where the Court emphasised that persistent low-value shoplifting generates consequences disproportionate to the immediate financial loss, owing to the strain on business sustainability and community wellbeing. The court also noted submissions referencing R v. Hamid [2023] EWCA Crim 1009, involving offences of carrying a bladed article in a public space unrelated to theft, a distinction significant to the present case as it highlights the importance of context in evaluating the severity of offences. Mr H was seen hiding £15 worth of over-the-counter medicines in his jacket and walking out without making a purchase. Regarding associated matters, the issue of co-defendants arose during preliminary hearings. One co-accused is currently subject to unrelated proceedings concerning the unlawful possession of indecent images, a matter entirely independent of the accusations against you. Another co-defendant absconded prior to trial and remains at large. In these circumstances, the prosecution’s case focused exclusively on your conduct. Protein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment. It is worth noting that the court received correspondence from the Belfast City Council’s Environmental Services Department regarding issues with fly-tipping in nearby greenbelt areas — an offence unrelated to your case but which features in ongoing debates about community crime and enforcement resources. During the course of proceedings, there was an administrative incident involving the late arrival of the interpreter service assigned to a witness whose first language is Polish. This caused a brief but unavoidable delay in evidence recording on 22 July 2025, necessitating an adjournment to accommodate translation requirements and maintain fair process. In assessing mitigating factors, the court has considered the detailed report prepared by Dr Sinead McGowan, a consultant forensic psychiatrist commissioned by the defence. Her report, dated 10 July 2025, was comprehensive and professionally written, providing valuable insight into your personal circumstances and mental health status. Dr McGowan noted the absence of severe psychiatric condition but identified traits consistent with impulse control difficulties and moderate substance use dependency. The report reflects your narrative pertaining to financial difficulties and unstable housing, but also highlights your sporadic engagement with services offering social support. This pattern is not uncommon among those who present in court charged with acquisitive offences and underscores systemic gaps in welfare provision. Mr H made four trips to the same cornershop over a three-week period, consistently targeting alcohol and cigarettes. Complementary to Dr McGowan’s assessment is the pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Mr Liam O’Hara, who observed that while you take some personal responsibility, there remains a marked resistance to sustained intervention. Mr O’Hara’s report emphasises the importance of structured community sentences coupled with cognitive behavioural approaches designed to address offending behaviour. This court is acutely aware of the pressures on Probation and Criminal Justice Social Work departments, which have seen successive cuts hampering operational capacity. The consequence is fewer tailored programmes available and increased risk of unmonitored reoffending. The court will therefore take note of any recommendations pertinent to public protection. Mr H used a query about Oyster Card use to draw the attention of staff away, before taking a displayed product from behind the counter. In his report, Mr O’Hara also references your previous engagement with faith-based outreach initiatives and community drop-in centres, which, regrettably, have yielded limited impact. Engagement appeared irregular, with missed appointments and inconsistent attendance despite practitioner efforts. It falls to the court to weigh not only the nature of the offence but also your personal history and responsiveness to prior interventions when considering the most suitable sentence. The defendant brought a magnet to the scene and used it to take off a security tag; this was later found in his possession when arrested. Victim impact statements were submitted from managers of shops affected by the offending. They described the knock-on effect on staff morale, with several employees reporting heightened anxiety and some reducing their working hours. One prospective employee withdrew their application upon learning of repeat shoplifting incidents at the premises, illustrating indirect effects on employment. These statements reinforce that theft, while often perceived as minor, can have broader ramifications, reducing livelihoods and contributing to community insecurity. The court records genuine empathy for those whose trust and sense of safety has been undermined. The defendant said he had sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in pubs, with his presence causing concern among other customers. Further examination reveals that, despite being previously warned by several offended businesses and following an earlier community resolution disposal for a similar offence, you reoffended within a matter of months. This is a factor to be regarded as aggravating, illustrating persistence and disregard for informal interventions. It also exemplifies the complexities in motivating sustainable behavioural change without effective supervision or meaningful support. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and approached retail staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, prompting serious safety fears among staff. In discussions relevant to sentencing, counsel for the defence has submitted letters of support from local charities, including Belfast Aid Network and Hearthstone Project, which work with marginalised persons facing poverty, substance misuse, and housing insecurity. Such letters, while not exonerative, do provide context to your circumstances and suggest some degree of community goodwill. The enquiries made with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive confirm that you currently reside in temporary accommodation on a short-term tenancy agreement pending an application for secure housing. The precariousness of such arrangements is acknowledged but cannot be deemed a justification for criminal conduct. In recent decades, the justice system has grappled with the challenge of balancing punishment with rehabilitation, particularly amongst those experiencing social exclusion. The Sentencing Council’s guideline amendments in 2024 highlighted the importance of considering underlying factors in acquisitive offences without permitting these to become excuses for repeated offending. I remind myself also of the principles enshrined in the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2011, which enshrines rehabilitative justice as a key pillar of sentencing whilst safeguarding the interests of the community. Mr H stated in interview that he frequently takes items, insisted it wasn’t a serious crime and plans to continue. This case exemplifies the ongoing tension between public protection, individual circumstances, and the practical limitations of community resources. The persistent impact of shoplifting offences is not to be underestimated, yet effective intervention requires collaboration across justice, health, and social service agencies. Regrettably, even where attempts are made to provide support, engagement on your part has been tentative and inconsistent. The court cannot disregard that fact, and must consider the consequences of continued offending. Throughout, this matter has been heard in open court with full adherence to procedural and evidential standards. I express my thanks to Ms Sullivan and Mr Murphy for their clear submissions, despite the complexities involved. The court notes in passing the refurbished state of Court 6 in Belfast Crown Court, recently upgraded with improved sound systems and accessibility features, intended to facilitate proceedings equitably for all participants. I shall now adjourn to allow for the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, which I direct to consider the full range of sentencing options, including custodial sentences suspended or immediate, community orders incorporating Rehabilitation Activity Requirements, and any specialist mental health or addiction interventions that may now be available. Given the nature of the offending — recurrent, opportunistic, but with no indication of violent or threatening behaviour — and the circumstances you have presented, I require a thorough risk assessment to inform the final sentence. I emphasise that the court expects the probation report to address not only the likelihood of reoffending but also the suitability and availability of local programmes designed specifically for individuals with acquisitive offending patterns linked to financial pressures and social disadvantage. These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 August 2025, in Court 6 at Belfast Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be communicated to the relevant authorities. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are applied under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.
