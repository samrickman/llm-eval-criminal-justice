MR H Case No. B2025/13859 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. A. Fenwick Filed: 18 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this Honourable Court for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge of theft pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely shoplifting from various retail premises across the greater Bristol area. The offending is found to extend over a protracted time frame, beginning in late 2023 and continuing unabated into early 2025. Procedural Context Your initial arrest occurred on 10 March 2025 after a concerted investigative effort by the Bristol Metropolitan Police Business Crime Unit working in tandem with the Bristol Retailers Alliance and local Trading Standards officers. It bears noting that the nature of the investigation, although commensurate with the seriousness ascribed to the charge, involved extensive collation of material evidence including hours of video surveillance, detailed witness statements, and coordination with criminal data analysts specialising in recidivist patterns of acquisitive crime. The operational commitment of front-line officers across multiple shifts, coupled with the input of digital forensic examiners employed by the West of England Forensic Information Service, was both significant and resource-intensive. Such matters are reflective of an approach consistent with regional policing priorities aimed at the suppression of retail and low-level property crime, seeking to prevent the escalation of such conduct into more serious and violent offending. It cannot be overstated that the deployment of such assets diverts crucial capacity from other areas of policing that also bear upon public safety, including investigations into serious violent crime, organised criminality, and anti-social behaviour hotspots. The court is therefore acutely aware of the systemic strain posed by persistent shoplifting offences that, although often characterised as minor individually, collectively impose a substantial burden on the criminal justice system and retail economy alike. The initial charge was brought following your interview under caution on 11 March 2025, where, contrary to later admissions, you denied any wrongdoing. It was only after further evidential developments, including identification via facial recognition software deployed pursuant to a judicially sanctioned search warrant, that the prosecution felt able to proceed. The case has since been managed under the auspices of the Better Case Management scheme, with listed pre-trial hearings held on 22 April and 8 July. These proceedings were punctuated by adjournments, one occasion owing to your counsel’s application for a psychiatric evaluation, another resulting from late disclosure of certain surveillance footage. The court must acknowledge the pressures exerted on criminal justice agencies occasioned by current resource constraints. Amongst these, it is regrettable to record that the Legal Aid Agency has been markedly slow in processing your defence team’s requests for funding to instruct expert evidence, resulting in adjournments that delayed resolution of an otherwise straightforward matter. This court remains hopeful that forthcoming reforms will address these procedural inefficiencies, which too frequently serve to prolong proceedings to the detriment of all parties. The Theft Act 1968 remains the cornerstone of English property offence law, defining theft in section 1 as “the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.” Shoplifting, while frequently perceived as falling towards the less serious end of the spectrum, is elevated in consequence where it forms part of a deliberate and persistent pattern. The Sentencing Council’s 2016 guideline on theft offences underlines several aggravating features pertinent to such conduct, including the targeting of vulnerable premises, the exploitation of staff vulnerabilities, and the cumulative impact on victims. In R v Aldridge [2019] EWCA Crim 507, the Court reiterated that serial shoplifting offences, particularly where motivated by personal gain and involving sophistication or planning, warrant custodial sentences to reflect and deter such conduct. Aldridge involved a defendant who had, over a similar timeframe, appropriated goods from multiple outlets and was sentenced to a term of twelve months’ imprisonment, with the court noting the particular vulnerability of smaller shopkeepers to economic harm. By contrast, the case of R v Langley [2022] EWCA Crim 1552 emphasised the importance of considering personal mitigation, including mental health issues and social deprivation, where these could be shown to directly influence offending behaviour. Although Langley concerned a lesser scale of offending, the principle of nuanced sentencing where vulnerability is present remains well established. Against this backdrop, the court navigates a careful path between the imperatives of public protection and rehabilitation. The impacts on retail staff and proprietors cannot be overstated. The evidence before the court includes detailed victim impact statements provided by managers of two pharmacies and a convenience store located in the BS1 postcode, who describe the emotional toll and operational disruption caused by your repeated offending. Staff report heightened anxiety, persistent feelings of insecurity, and significant operational changes including increased security measures and altered shift patterns to mitigate risk exposure. Notably, the Bristol Retailers Alliance has submitted observations outlining the downstream effects on customer confidence and the broader business environment within the locality. These submissions commend the seriousness with which the police and trading standards approach such cases but also underscore the limitations faced by retailers in preventing ongoing losses amidst constrained budgets and limited security infrastructure. Correspondence from the Bristol Homeless Outreach Network, while tangential, is also demonstrated in the court papers. This correspondence highlights the wider socio-economic challenges in the area, including rising street homelessness and substance misuse, which, while not directly attributable to you, form part of the complex backdrop within which such offences occur. The court acknowledges the nuanced relationship between social deprivation and offending but stresses that these factors do not diminish personal responsibility. Your counsel made an application on 5 July 2025 for the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report, encompassing risk assessment, suitability for community-based interventions, and an evaluation of underlying social and psychological factors. The court granted this, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive sentencing options consistent with the principles of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, addressing both punishment and rehabilitation. An independent psychiatric assessment was commissioned with instructions to Dr Fiona M. Labotsky, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, who furnished a detailed report dated 20 September 2025. Her observations note the absence of any major psychiatric disorder, while highlighting personality traits marked by impulsivity and limited insight into the consequences of your actions. Substance misuse history is documented but not currently active; financial hardship and unstable living conditions are also emphasised as contributory. It is important to remind all parties that the presence of such difficulties, while warranting consideration, rarely negates culpability, particularly where offending patterns demonstrate calculation and persistence. Mr H was caught on CCTV placing £10 worth of haircare products into his coat and leaving the shop without making payment. Within the courthouse walls, the question of your motivations, modus operandi, and the precise nature and sequence of offending form the crux of factual determination. The Crown’s case, supported by extensive CCTV footage and corroborated by several eyewitness accounts, conveys a methodical approach to theft, involving repeated visits to multiple stores during peak hours, often employing distraction techniques to facilitate concealment of goods. Mr H concealed boxed razor cartridges and a tub of protein powder beneath items in his niece’s pram. Importantly, these actions were not isolated incidents but part of an identifiable pattern, with several stores impacted multiple times over several months. This reflects both a troubling disregard for the impact on victims and an entrenched risk of continuing behaviour of the same kind. The defence contends that your conduct was influenced by acute financial distress compounded by untenable housing conditions. It is posited that engagement with support services has been inconsistent due to difficulties navigating complex bureaucratic pathways. While these points are not lightly disregarded, the court must weigh them alongside the evidence of deliberate, repeated offending and apparent refusal to desist despite warnings and diversion attempts. Intriguingly, the court must also consider the context of operational policing dynamics in Bristol and the wider South West region. Recently, it has been noted by official audits from the Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner that staff vacancies and high turnover rates within civilian analyst roles have affected case preparation times. This has had the unfortunate consequence of delaying evidential submissions for several complex investigations, including some high-profile cybercrime prosecutions. While your case is unrelated to these digital offences, it serves as a reminder that justice operates within a human system subject to strain and limitation. Equally, operational constraints during the recent summer months, including industrial action by court clerical staff, contributed to listing delays. A hearing originally scheduled for 29 August was vacated, adding several weeks to the timeline of this matter. Such procedural vicissitudes are, regrettably, a familiar feature of contemporary criminal justice administration. On four separate visits within three weeks, Mr H returned to the same small shop and stole alcohol and tobacco products. The court notes, with regret, the increasingly common and troubling trend of defendants awaiting the eve of trial or sentencing to enter guilty pleas. This pattern imposes additional burdens upon victim witnesses, the prosecution, and the court system itself. Public trust in the administration of justice is enhanced when responsibility is admitted at the earliest practicable stage, affording victims a degree of closure and reducing the trauma of protracted proceedings. The relevant guidelines, including the Sentencing Council's Definitive Guideline on Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea (effective 2017), are unequivocal in stating that credit for such pleas diminishes as the point of entry nears trial or sentencing. This is a principle reaffirmed in R v. Kingswell [2019] EWCA Crim 144, where the Court of Appeal declined to extend full credit where the plea was entered at the last moment, deeming such conduct at best tactical. I therefore approach the assessment of your plea with some reserve. Two separate accounts from shop floor employees, submitted by the Victim Support Service, reflect heightened occupational stress and a sense of insecurity owing to repeat thefts. One victim details adjustments to service delivery hours and increased reliance on CCTV at great cost. The economic and emotional toll on these individuals is not abstract; it is vivid, personal, and impactful. Additionally, letters of support for your rehabilitation were received from the Bristol Outreach Project and a social worker assigned to your case. Both commend your sincerity and commitment to engage with support mechanisms, and express hope for constructive intervention. These submissions merit due consideration and have been appended to the pre-sentence report file. In one instance, Mr H distracted staff by asking about Oyster Card payments before reaching behind the counter to remove a display item. Inspection of your antecedent record reveals a series of prior convictions for similar offences dating back to 2017, interspersed with periods of apparent compliance. Notably, you were subject to a conditional discharge following a conviction in 2022, an absence of custody on that occasion reflecting the court’s willingness to provide you with opportunity to reform. The persistence of theft offending despite prior community orders and warnings indicates both a challenging propensity towards recidivism and a clear need for effective intervention. Cross-References to Other Cases and Legal Precedents In the wider jurisprudential landscape, the Court underlines the relevance of R v. Marques [2023] EWCA Crim 1122, where the defendant’s continuous series of shoplifting offences culminated in a 12-month custodial sentence, taking into account prior unsuccessful diversion efforts. Furthermore, in R v. Sallis [2020] EWCA Crim 1634, the Court emphasised that repeated acquisitive offences undermine public confidence in local law enforcement and damage community cohesion, particularly when committed against small businesses. While these cases do not align perfectly with the specifics of your conduct, they provide valuable legal context shaping sentencing approaches to offending of this nature. The court has also reviewed commentary from the Institute of Criminology, reflecting upon the societal challenges posed by low-level acquisitive crime and systemic underinvestment in preventative social measures. Despite these broader themes, the ultimate responsibility for your actions rests squarely with you. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. The Pre-Sentence Report and Psychiatric Assessment jointly recommend that if a custodial sentence is imposed, consideration be given to concurrent Structured Offender Management with targeted cognitive behavioural programmes, aimed at addressing impulsive decision-making and improving awareness of victim impact. Conversely, where sentencing options allow, pursuit of viable community rehabilitation pathways coupled with robust supervision might facilitate an effective reduction in reoffending risk. Nonetheless, given the repeat nature of offending despite prior interventions, community options alone appear, at best, fraught with uncertainty. It is worth observing the challenges faced by probation services nationally, as reflected in recent reports by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation, which highlight chronic staffing shortages and high caseloads that may impede consistent delivery of rehabilitative programmes. While these system pressures are not reasons to dilute sentencing standards, they do influence the practical framing of post-sentence management strategies. The defendant told officers that he sold the stolen goods at a car boot sale and in nearby pubs, causing alarm to members of the public. The Court has also noted a letter from your sister, Ms Bernice H, dated 30 September 2025, attesting to your affected mental health, sporadic employment, and recent housing instability. While the court recognises the value of familial support in rehabilitation, it reserves judgment on the extent to which these factors mitigate culpability. In an ancillary matter, brief mention was made during the pre-trial hearings of your prior association with an individual currently under investigation for benefit fraud. I reiterate that there is no allegation connecting you to these matters, and they play no part in these sentencing considerations. Similarly, an unrelated incident involving a co-defendant in a separate case, including charges of affray and possession of an offensive weapon, was referenced in police briefing notes but bears no relevance here. The presence of such co-offenders or others with criminal records should not, and does not, prejudice your individual assessment. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and engaged directly with staff while spraying over CCTV equipment, raising major concerns for public and staff safety. This court is aware of the pressures on the retail sector occasioned by increased theft and the related phenomenon of fly-tipping in retail delivery zones, which has grown by 15% over the past year according to Bristol City Council reports. This environmental concern, while serious, is distinct from the conduct currently before me. Recognition is also due to the professionalism of the Crown Prosecution Service advocates and the dedication of defence counsel in navigating a case complicated by framing delays and voluminous disclosure. I record my thanks to Ms Eleanor Bedwell for the Crown and Mr Theodore Merrick for the defence, whose conduct has upheld the high standards expected in these proceedings. The Sentencing Council guidelines direct courts to approach theft offences with reference to credit for guilty pleas, any previous convictions, the totality of the offending, and the harm caused. Aggravating features such as repeated offending, targeting of particular vulnerable victims, and the failure to desist after previous warnings weigh heavily towards a custodial outcome. Such determinations are, however, balanced against mitigating factors including the defendant’s personal circumstances, the potential for rehabilitation, and the necessity to impose a proportionate sentence reflecting public interest. Mr H said to police he often shoplifts from local stores, said it was no different to borrowing and expects to do it again soon. In light of the foregoing, I am satisfied that the charge before the court represents a course of conduct marked by persistence, intentionality, and disregard for the consequences to others. The late plea offered does not attract full credit, consistent with established authority. Your personal circumstances and willingness to engage with rehabilitation, as reflected in reports and family statements, are noted but insufficient to override the factors warranting a custodial sentence or serious community controls. The court intends, as noted at commencement, to adjourn to allow receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report that will weigh rehabilitative prospects, risk management options, and sentencing recommendations. I reserve the decision on your sentence until that material is before me. You should be aware that all avenues will be considered, including a custodial sentence with bespoke community elements, designed to maximise public protection and your potential for reform.
