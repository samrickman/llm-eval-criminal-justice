Mr H Case No. T2025/14689 Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. F. Winslow Filed: 4 October 2025 Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence on a representative charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to a series of thefts from multiple retail outlets within the metropolitan area between September 2023 and May 2025. The indictment concerns a course of conduct characterised by repeated appropriations of goods without payment, bringing you within the purview of this court’s jurisdiction in respect of persistent acquisitive offending of a degree justifying Crown Court trial and sentencing. Procedural History The journey to this point has been protracted, as is often the case with such matters involving low-level but persistent offending. Your initial arrest occurred on 28 May 2025, following the conclusion of a lengthy investigation conducted by the Belvedere Metropolitan Police Service alongside the local Retail Crime Task Force. The multi-agency collaboration involved regular communication with store security teams, the Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), and community safety officers, thereby illustrating the increasingly complex ecosystem in which such offences are now managed. It merits noting that the co-operation, while not exceptional, was sufficient to collate a substantial evidential package in good time, facilitating your eventual charge and case progression. The criminal justice process in cases of this nature has, over recent years, become entangled with multiple layers of administrative and procedural complexity. For example, while the Better Case Management scheme was designed to curtail delay and duplication, the experience to date has been mixed. Here, the case navigated several listings, including a plea and trial preparation hearing held on 21 July 2025, followed by adjournments required to facilitate forensic expert reports and defence submissions. These delays mirror a broader trend, noted in recent justice sector reviews, of escalating listing pressures in Crown Courts outside of central London, exacerbated by staffing shortages in both the judiciary and court administrative staff. The scheduling constraints have impacted the timely initiation of sentence preparation work, a regrettably frequent feature in this jurisdiction. It is necessary to acknowledge that the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative procedures caused further postponements. An initial application to instruct an independent forensic behavioural analyst was submitted by your counsel on 15 June 2025 but experienced considerable delay before eventual approval on 4 August 2025. This delay, though unfortunate, is emblematic of systemic issues well-documented elsewhere, involving backlogs, stringent vetting requirements, and limited resources at the Agency. The attendant disruption to case readiness is a matter of concern, not least because it impedes the full investigative and therapeutic potential of expert input in cases involving underlying vulnerabilities or complex personal histories. The plea hearing on 3 September 2025 saw you enter a guilty plea to the representative count. It is neither unusual nor unexpected that pleas in shoplifting cases are entered late, often at the point when evidential certainty becomes overwhelming. While no doubt a feature of reasonable defence strategy, the court is, as ever, mindful that credit for guilty plea is contingent on early admissions of guilt which materially reduce the burden on victims, witnesses, and the court system itself. The present plea does not therefore attract maximal reduction, as will be considered further below. The Theft Act 1968, as amended, continues to be the foundational statutory provision governing the offence of theft. Section 1 articulates the essential elements — the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another, with the intention to permanently deprive the owner — each component carefully defined and judicially refined in a body of case law spanning decades. It is unnecessary to rehearse exhaustively the well-trodden principles; suffice to emphasise that the accumulation, frequency, and manner of offending constitute key aggravating factors within the applicable sentencing frameworks. Recent sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council provide structure to the court’s discretion, setting indicative ranges and emphasizing context, culpability, and harm. The guidelines recognise that shoplifting, while often associated with low individual value, can entail considerable cumulative harm, especially where targeting vulnerable or independent retailers or exploiting repeat opportunities. Also relevant is the framework established by R v. Sinclair [2019] EWCA Crim 1057, which underscores that persistence and deliberate evasion reflect a heightened degree of culpability. Likewise, R v. Harcourt [2021] EWCA Crim 1523 is instructive for the principle that offences liable to attract custodial sentences negate the presumption that theft under a certain monetary threshold is a matter for summary disposal only. This court is alive to the wider social policy ambitions embedded in Lord Justice Kay’s observations in R v. Waine [2016] EWCA Crim 63, where emphasis was placed on the underlying needs of defendants, including poverty-induced pressures, while maintaining the primacy of public protection and victim impact considerations. Mr H concealed £12 worth of toiletries inside his coat and left the shop without paying. It bears emphasis that persistent offending yields disproportionate cost to the criminal justice system and commercial targets alike. In this case, police resourcing extended to the deployment of a dedicated task force examining eleven incident reports across the greater Belvedere retail sector, engaging five different store chains. This reflects the intensity of the police response which, although involving staff drawn away from other duties, was necessary due to the pattern of activity and the community concerns voiced. Mr H used the bottom compartment of his niece’s pram to hide razor cartridges and protein supplements. The facts establishing guilt — through a combination of surveillance footage, witness testimony, and forensic examination of recovered items — disclose a pattern of conduct involving the strategic selection of goods, repeated visits to target premises, and methodical concealment techniques. This was not a series of isolated misjudgements or momentary lapses, but a calculated endeavour to benefit from unlawful acquisition. Deborah Whittle, Probation Officer, prepared a pre-sentence report in advance of the sentencing hearing and provided a detailed account of your social and psychological background. The report notes a history of intermittent employment primarily in the retail and hospitality sectors, disrupted by periods of unstable accommodation and financial insecurity. The report also highlights episodes of self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, though no formal diagnosis of major mental illness has been established. It is well recognised that the pressures of precarious employment markets and insecure housing, coupled with economic uncertainty, create a fertile environment for acquisitive crimes of this nature. However, as the Court of Appeal emphasised in R v. Patterson [2018] EWCA Crim 3035, personal circumstances do not excuse offending, nor diminish the need for clear judicial responses to protect victims, ensure public confidence, and deter future misconduct. Over a three-week period, Mr H visited the same local shop on four occasions, stealing alcohol and tobacco each time. The psychological assessment appended to the probation dossier was completed by Dr Marcus Fenwick, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, whose report admits certain cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities, including impulsivity and social anxiety, but excludes evidence of any axis one disorder sufficiently severe to markedly impair criminal responsibility. Dr Fenwick cautiously flagged a low-to-medium risk of reoffending, contingent upon stable accommodation and engagement with supportive services. The profession’s incremental shift towards trauma-informed practice has underscored the importance of understanding defendants’ backgrounds. Yet, as Dr Fenwick notes, “The availability of voluntary sector support and statutory services is necessary but not sufficient in itself to prevent offending. Engagement and motivation are critical factors.” Your reported history is marred by sporadic attendance at appointments and reluctance to pursue employment or structured rehabilitation pathways. The court acknowledges your family connections, including extended relations residing locally, but notes that these relationships appear to afford minimal social capital or motivational leverage. While personal letters submitted on your behalf, including one from a pastoral care worker and another from a long-standing volunteer at a community food bank, are commendably conciliatory, their content does not materially diminish the nature or impact of the offending. It is appropriate at this juncture to reflect more broadly on the social framing of such offending patterns. We find ourselves amid a nexus of social policy tensions — welfare reform, austerity, and fluctuating economic fortunes — each feeding into the mosaic shaping individuals’ choices. Nevertheless, the court cannot abdicate responsibility for ensuring that criminal liability adheres to notions of personal agency and accountability. Extensive discourse and research into ‘broken communities’ and systemic failures abound, yet the judiciary must apply legal standards without succumbing to sociological relativism. Mr H diverted the attention of shop staff by inquiring about Oyster Card services, using the opportunity to remove an item from the display behind the counter. A further point of interest is the manner in which retail premises have adapted operationally to the challenges posed by recurrent offending. This includes the installation of additional electronic tagging systems, more frequent rearrangement of product displays, and staff rotation measures to mitigate risks of targeting. While these responses are operationally justifiable, they carry unintended consequences, including staff stress, reduced shopping convenience, and, potentially, the diminution of the local retail environment. The local Business Crime Reduction Partnership has provided evidence detailing the extent of these measures and their cost implications. Notably, the partnership reported a 12% increase in shoplifting incidents over the past year, necessitating a commensurate increase in resource allocation towards preventative strategies — resources which could otherwise be deployed to combat violent crime or more serious offences. During his arrest, officers recovered a magnet used to remove a security tag earlier that day. Of interest to the court is the observation, drawn from recent policing reports, that a disproportionate number of persistent offenders of this nature reside in areas of socio-economic deprivation, often lacking stable tenancy and grappling with mental health and substance misuse issues. These factors undoubtedly complicate enforcement responses. However, failure to heed these realities would be neither honest nor consonant with principles of justice. The sentencing aims, as articulated in statutory frameworks and affirmed by the Court of Appeal in cases such as R v. Wells [2024] EWCA Crim 85, remain deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation, and the protection of the public. The challenge lies in balancing these sometimes competing purposes without abdicating judicial responsibility or capitulating to external pressures. The defendant acknowledged selling the stolen property at a car boot market and in pubs, where his behaviour caused a disturbance to patrons. The impact upon victims is neither theoretical nor insignificant. Whilst no physical harm was occasioned, the disruption and distress experienced by retail staff has been well-documented. Several employees provided statements attesting to feelings of insecurity, anxiety, and reduced job satisfaction, prompting altered shift patterns and absences. One witness recounted experiencing harassment following identification and publicisation of their role in reporting offences. Such secondary consequences emphasize the ripple effects of shoplifting beyond monetary loss alone. The voluntary sector organisations engaged in victim support have supplemented these accounts with data revealing a sustained decline in staff wellbeing metrics and exacerbated workplace stress in affected outlets. These effects, though not quantifiable in the conventional sense, resonate deeply within the communities concerned. On at least two occasions, Mr H wore a balaclava and interacted forcefully with employees while damaging security cameras using spray paint, leading to a heightened risk to retail workers. It is appropriate, in the context of shoplifting sentencing, to consider restorative avenues where practicable. In this instance, however, efforts to arrange such meetings have foundered, with little meaningful engagement forthcoming from your side. This limits the court’s ability to account for remedial dialogue in mitigation. I would be remiss not to note the existence of several co-defendants in connected investigations concerning unrelated offences—from fly-tipping on greenbelt land to allegations of affray at a local public house. These separate matters lie beyond the scope of these proceedings and have no bearing on your culpability or sentencing. It is a salutary reminder of the broad spectrum of acquisitive and disorderly conduct encountered by the criminal justice system contemporaneously. The court also notes that a neighbour in your building is currently subject to a noise abatement order following complaints to the local council. This is manifestly irrelevant to your own case but reflects the broader context in which these proceedings unfold. Mr H admitted to police that he steals regularly, said it was no different to borrowing and has no intention of stopping. In assessing risk of harm to the public, it must be acknowledged that you do not pose a significant violent danger. No evidence of aggression or threat towards staff has emerged. Nonetheless, the persistence and methodical nature of the offending illustrate a degree of calculated disregard for legal proscriptions and social norms that justifies firm sentencing response. The criminal justice system’s obligations extend beyond punishment. Engagement with rehabilitation services, including cognitive behavioural programmes aimed at addressing offending behaviour and underlying motivations, offers a path to reduced recidivism. The National Probation Service, within its current resource constraints and staffing pressures detailed in internal reports, has indicated willingness to prioritise your case for inclusion in such programmes, subject to your cooperation. Historical references to the Sentencing Council’s guidance on theft offences emphasise the dichotomy between first-time or low culpability offenders and those exhibiting repeat, planned offending. The latter group, which includes you, must expect sentences calibrated for both individual deterrence and collective protection. In conclusion, these sentencing remarks are made following careful consideration of all pleadings, reports, victim impact statements, and submissions of counsel. The court is grateful to Mr Olivier Kessler, appearing for the Crown, and Ms Caroline Stokes, representing the defence under a Legal Aid representation order. The detailed pre-sentence report, alongside expert psychological input, has been invaluable in shaping the court’s understanding of your personal circumstances and risks. The court regrets the unavoidable delays occasioned by administrative and procedural bottlenecks but must nevertheless proceed with a sentencing disposition consistent with public interest. Sentencing will be deferred until the receipt of an updated pre-sentence report, to be completed by your probation officer. That report should address all avenues of community disposal, including the potential for structured interventions to address acquisitive behaviour and underlying vulnerabilities, the feasibility of supervision requirements, and any custodial alternatives. The court will consider any submissions concerning potential restorative justice engagement, local accommodation options, and support services.
