MR H  \nCase No. B2025/15047  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge C. M. PENTON  \nFiled: 14 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentencing following your conviction for theft by shoplifting at multiple retail establishments in the Brighton and Hove area, taken to have occurred over an extended period during 2023 and into early 2025. Your conduct, as alleged and now established, involved a systematic pattern of dishonest appropriations, which the Crown has, with some difficulty given the dispersed nature of the incidents, formed into a representative charge in this Crown Court proceeding.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour initial arrest was effected by officers from the Brighton and Hove Police Service on 7 April 2025, consequent to a referral from multiple retailers within the city centre who had become concerned by an emerging pattern of repeated losses attributable to a suspect matching your description. The police investigation involved the analysis of extensive footage from disparate sources including CCTV within store premises, public thoroughfares, and transport interchanges. Moreover, the investigation was supported by the proactive engagement of the Sussex Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose coordination among affected retailers proved instrumental in consolidating intelligence relevant to your movements and offending behaviour.  \nHistorically, such Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRPs) have been celebrated as exemplars of multi-agency collaboration. Nonetheless, the court is mindful that their practical effectiveness varies considerably depending on local resourcing and staff continuity. It has been observed, in recent Reviews of BCRP Efficacy (Ministry of Justice, 2024), that sustaining operational coherence in face of fluctuating police presence and volunteer turnover remains a challenge. Here, the local partnership deserves some commendation for the timely transmission of reports, despite the well-documented strain placed upon regional policing by competing demands, including migrant arrivals and increased cybercrime incidence.  \nIt must be noted, however, that the defence encountered unavoidable procedural setbacks in progressing expert evidence. An application for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist specialising in behavioural criminology was submitted on 1 May 2025; however, approval was not granted until late June, following multiple rounds of correspondence questioning the necessity of the proposed report. Regrettably, this delay truncated the window for comprehensive assessment, leading to an abridged timeline for report preparation and review. The court places on record its disappointment with the Legal Aid Agency's current administrative practices, which too often introduce latency into proceedings with consequences for all involved parties. \n\nIn the earlier stages of these proceedings, you entered a plea of not guilty and elected trial. However, shortly before the trial listing in September, having been served with a comprehensive disclosure package and detailed witness statements, you tendered a plea of guilty to the principal charge. The timing and circumstances of this reversal engage the court’s discretion in considering plea discounts and are a matter to which I will return in due course.  \nThe procedural route from charge to sentencing has, in this instance, followed a largely orthodox, though occasionally protracted, cadence. There was a preliminary hearing on 12 July 2025, an initial plea and trial preparation hearing on 10 September 2025, and today’s sentencing hearing, reserved to allow time for the receipt of a probation pre-sentence report and supplementary psychiatric evaluation. The court expresses gratitude to all agencies and professionals involved for their diligent contributions despite systemic resource limitations.  \n\nIt bears mentioning that the Crown's representation was led by Ms Amina Foster of counsel, whose thorough presentation during the plea and trial preparation hearing was noted. Defence representation was ably undertaken by Mr Samuel Digby under a legal aid order, and his submissions advocating for a non-custodial disposal reflected a considered approach, albeit one not accepted on the evidence before the court.  \n\nLegal Context and Sentencing Framework  \nThe charge before this court is brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 as amended, which defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. The court respectfully reminds itself that shoplifting—though often perceived as low-level offending—should not be trivialised, particularly when involving repeat offending and resulting in tangible harms beyond mere monetary loss. The Sentencing Council guidelines for theft offences, last updated in 2023, provide a comprehensive framework for sentencing, emphasising factors including the nature and frequency of offending, the value of goods taken, the presence or absence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and the impact upon victims and the community.\n\nIllustrative case law continues to guide the application of these principles. In R v Winterton [2022] EWCA Crim 974, the Court of Appeal underscored that persistent shoplifting, conducted over an extended period and causing cumulative effects on retail capacity and staff morale, may warrant immediate custody despite the absence of violence. Similarly, the decision in R v Cunningham [2024] EWCA Crim 1117 held that repeated dishonest conduct, even when individually minor in scale, can attract sentences proportionate to the social consequences. The court notes these alongside R v Graves [2020] EWCA Crim 814, which stressed the importance of accounting for the degree to which offending is calculated and whether it involves exploitation of vulnerable premises or persons.\n\nMoreover, while the defendant’s conduct pertains to shoplifting, the court is presented with submissions invoking R v Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624 and R v Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412 regarding the interface between mental disorder and public protection. Although those cases primarily concerned offences with different factual profiles (arson and serious endangerment), the principles articulated relating to the balancing of therapeutic considerations and community safeguarding remain instructive for sentencing decisions where psychological factors are germane.  \n\nThe court is also aware that sentencing guidelines historically evolved from the Theft Act 1968, with amendments reflecting shifting policy emphases. For example, prior to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, financial investigation and asset recovery were markedly less entwined with sentencing procedures. Today's court operates with full cognisance of ancillary orders, including compensation and ancillary financial penalties where appropriate, albeit these are not immediately before the court for determination.\n\nVictims and Community Impact  \nVictim impact statements have been received from multiple retailers and frontline staff. These testimonies describe persistent disruption to business operations, a climate of apprehension among shop-floor employees, and in at least one instance, the curtailment of opening hours to mitigate risk. While the stolen goods' value in each incident was individually modest, the accumulation resulted in a significant financial deficit. The psychological effect on staff—feelings of vulnerability, stress, and diminished job satisfaction—is not to be minimised, and the court recognises the courage with which these employees participated in the justice process.  \n\nThe Retail Support and Community Safety Network, a voluntary organisation engaged by affected stores, supplied letters detailing support provided to employees, including trauma-informed debriefings and advice on risk management. The network’s reports highlight the mounting pressure on staff working in insecure environments, exacerbated by financial constraints within the retail sector and rising local unemployment. Their efforts represent an essential, though often overlooked, facet of community resilience.  \n\nIt is remarked that the defendant’s letter to the court, which was received with the defence’s sentencing submissions, was thoughtfully composed and expressed contrition for the consequences of his actions. While such personal reflections are no substitute for accountability, they aid the court in assessing genuine remorse and potential for rehabilitation.  \n\nPsychiatric and Probation Reports  \nThe psychiatric assessment, conducted by Dr Fiona Kiernan, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, and completed on 30 September 2025, is detailed and professionally compiled. Dr Kiernan concludes that you do not meet diagnostic criteria for a major mental illness but identifies features suggestive of impulse control difficulties and an emerging anxiety disorder. The report refers to behavioural patterns consistent with impulsivity and low frustration tolerance but finds no evidence of psychosis, personality disorder, or cognitive impairment. Treatment recommendations focus on cognitive behavioural therapy and psychoeducational interventions.  \n\nDr Kiernan’s opinion—that the absence of a firm psychiatric diagnosis limits the possible mitigating impact of clinical factors—is accepted by the court. Her observations about your non-engagement with available support services resonate with correspondence from local charities who have tried to reach you, to little avail. The report further notes that you have declined the opportunity to engage with addiction treatment despite a history suggestive of episodic misuse of alcohol and cannabis. This refusal is significant; it reflects a pattern of disengagement which undermines rehabilitative prospects and increases risk of recidivism.  \n\nThe probation officer assigned, Ms Rebecca Leeds, submitted a thorough pre-sentence report dated 8 October 2025. This report provides a comprehensive overview of your background, including a history of unstable accommodation, periods of unemployment, and prior offending. Risk assessments executed in accordance with the Offender Assessment System indicate a medium likelihood of further acquisitive offending absent effective intervention. Ms Leeds recommends a community order incorporating an intensive supervision and surveillance requirement, coupled with specialist cognitive skills programmes aimed at addressing impulsive behaviour and decision-making deficits. She also suggests exploring options for supported accommodation and vocational training, referencing local service providers strained by increased demand and funding constraints.  \n\nAlthough the Probation Service is under notable pressure nationally, with recent industrial action and record caseloads reducing availability, its role remains pivotal in delivering tailored rehabilitative measures. Ms Leeds’ report exemplifies the careful balancing of risk assessment and support planning necessary to optimise public safety outcomes.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nIt is pertinent to note that your antecedent record includes five prior convictions, all for acquisitive offences, predominantly theft but with some instances of criminal damage. Records show you were last convicted in 2022, receiving a conditional discharge, yet evidence gathered for the present prosecution indicated rapid reoffending within months. Such a history denotes a failure, thus far, of less restrictive disposals to effect meaningful behavioural change.  \n\nThe court is mindful that your home environment and social circumstances are fractured. Correspondence from your sister, made available during case preparation, reflects complex family dynamics without direct bearing upon the offending acts but illuminating personal challenges that may bear on engagement with treatment and compliance.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nAs noted in numerous rulings, including R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, the timing of pleas and the quality of cooperation with the justice process materially affect sentencing outcomes. Here, your guilty plea came after prolonged denial and only when evidential conclusions unequivocally pointed to conviction. This timing precludes full credit for an early plea, a matter of importance given the impact on witnesses, court resources, and victims’ experiences.  \n\nDiscussion on Broader Criminal Justice Themes  \nThis case exemplifies broader tensions in the justice system’s handling of acquisitive crime. Although often dismissed as “minor”, shoplifting engenders significant social costs, impacts on community confidence, and cumulative strain on public services. The court observes, with some regret, that limited attention is afforded to the difficulties faced by retail workers, who bear the daily brunt of such offending and its attendant anxieties.  \n\nThe court further notes challenges inherent in balancing rehabilitation with deterrence amidst a backdrop of austerity and service underfunding. Mental health services, probation caseloads, and community outreach programmes operate under considerable strain, with waiting lists for psychological assessment and treatment extending into months. This reality affects the speed and efficacy with which identified needs are addressed, complicating sentencing options and post-sentence monitoring.  \n\nIt might be observed that a defendant’s assertion of financial hardship does not automatically translate to mitigating circumstances. Our society contains innumerable examples of hardship, some comparable or greater than those adduced here, but not all manifest in offending behaviour. The court remains firm in its duty to uphold the principle that pre-existing difficulty shapes but does not excuse unlawful conduct.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nIn an era marked by the erosion of shared social norms and the growing normalisation of opportunistic misconduct, the courts must maintain clear messages that persistent dishonesty disrespects not only the immediate victims but also communal trust. The court is acutely aware that in previous comparable matters, restorative justice schemes have yielded varied results. While such avenues are to be welcomed where viable, their success depends critically on offender engagement—a factor not reliably observed in your history.  \n\nReference is also made to the remarkable review of public policing conducted by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) in early 2025, which highlighted how acquisitive offences, including shoplifting, disproportionately consume resources relative to their individual gravity. The report underscored the importance of early multi-agency cooperation and community-level alert systems, such as shopwatch networks, to suppress recidivism. The Sussex BCRP's role in this case is consistent with best practices recommended therein, though the overall challenge remains significant.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe court also pauses to acknowledge the fine work of the local criminal intelligence units whose analytical efforts rendered this prosecution possible. Their abilities to map crime clusters and link multiple incidents through profiling methods represent a commendable but often unseen facet of law enforcement. Such work, however, is heavily dependent on stable staffing and adequate funding, both subject to fluctuating government priorities.  \n\nThe court further registers its thanks to the court ushers and clerks, whose efficiency has maintained order and procedural accuracy during these hearings. The recently refurbished courtroom facilities—completed earlier in 2025—afford a more accessible and dignified environment, conducive to the administration of justice. While such upgrades are superficial in the grand scheme, they contribute to the solemnity and respectfulness of proceedings for all participants.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nIn considering sentencing pathways, the court has also carefully reviewed the reports and recommendations issued by the regional charity KeepBright, an organisation dedicated to assisting individuals with histories of acquisitive behaviours. Their submitted commentary, while sympathetic to the particular challenges faced in Brighton, nonetheless stresses that successful interventions demand active client participation and that more punitive measures may be warranted where repeated opportunities for reform have been spurned.  \n\nThe court notes with some irony that, although residence in temporary accommodation or reliance on social support services is often cited in mitigation, such circumstances are not uncommon among those complying with the law. It is regrettable, but important for sentencing, that comparative deprivation is not alone exculpatory.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nTurning to relevant law, R v Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754 remains a leading authority on sentencing’s discretionary nature and the careful balance of credit for plea timeliness and admission. In Haslow, the appellant drew limited credit for a late plea following exhaustive disclosure and near-trial preparation. The principle that cooperation must be meaningful and sincere governs here as well.  \n\nSimilarly, the notions articulated in R v Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627 about the significance of victim impact and the importance of victim cooperation provide useful context. Though differing in offence character, the observations regarding the challenges faced by complainants and the courts are instructive.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nAn unfortunate feature of the current landscape, recognized but resolutely resisted by this court, is the deferral of guilty pleas until the eve of trial, frequently prompted by the near-certain weight of evidence. This behaviour, akin to tactical capitulation, disrupts judicial efficiency and prolongs victim distress. The court reiterates that such strategic delay should not be rewarded with full discount.  \n\nThe court also notes the prevalence of procedural adjournments related to Legal Aid authorisation and expert report commissioning, a phenomenon which, while outside the control of those appearing before the court, nonetheless impedes prompt justice. The consequence is a system of inertia with cascading effects across court lists and resource allocation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe hearing has taken place in open court, attended by legal representatives from both sides, and duly recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules part 5. The court is content that the justice process has been conducted with due regard for the interests of the defendant, the victims, and the wider community.  \nIn closing, the matter will now be adjourned to permit the Probation Service to finalise its report and for any supplementary representations to be made. Sentencing will be determined at the forthcoming hearing scheduled for 25 November 2025. The court expects that all parties will be prepared to proceed given the substantial delays to date.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  \nR v.
