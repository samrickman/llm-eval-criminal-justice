MR H  \nCase No. T2026/04573  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. P. GREENWOOD  \nFiled: 17 September 2026  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in respect of an offence of theft — specifically, shoplifting — contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge concerns conduct occurring intermittently over a period spanning January 2024 to July 2026, across various retail establishments primarily within the Brighton and Hove municipal area. The precise nature of the offending, and the circumstances in which it took place, will be addressed hereafter.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour initial appearance before the magistrates’ court took place on 2 August 2026, following your arrest on 27 July 2026. The arrest followed an intelligence-led operation coordinated by officers from Brighton District Police, acting in tandem with the Brighton Retailers’ Anti-Crime Alliance (BRACA). The investigative effort combined conventional methods with the deployment of new analytical tools in relation to crime pattern recognition across the region’s multiple commercial zones. Officers compiled CCTV evidence, witness statements, and other forensic material in support of the prosecution. Following a pre-trial review held on 20 August 2026, the matter was transferred to this Crown Court for sentence, consistent with the Better Case Management protocols stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Rules.  \n\nThe Better Case Management (BCM) initiative, now in its twelfth year, is designed to promote timely case progression through the early identification of issues, coordinated disclosure, and efficient listing of substantive hearings. The court notes that in the present case, initial arrangements for a plea and trial preparation hearing were affected by an unavoidable adjournment owing to strikes in the local court clerical staff, a regrettably recurrent issue in many jurisdictions that compounds case backlog and frustrates judicial efficiency. Nevertheless, all parties have, to date, conducted proceedings with professionalism and pragmatic cooperation.\n\nThis court must, however, register its ongoing concern with the functionality of the Legal Aid Agency in facilitating access to necessary expert evidence in cases involving complex behavioural profiles. In this instance, timely approval for instruction of a clinical forensic psychologist was secured only after repeated applications and prolonged correspondence involving both defence solicitors and external case managers. Such administrative delays are unsatisfactory and risk infringing on defendants’ rights to a fair and expeditious hearing, as well as imposing additional burdens on the public purse and judicial resources.  \n\nFurthermore, I acknowledge receipt of a number of letters from third-party agencies, including correspondence from the Brighton Homeless Outreach Network, South Downs Mental Health Trust, and the local branch of Citizens Advice Brighton & Hove. These communications, while not central to the offence, testify to the complex social and health-related challenges facing individuals in Mr H’s position, as well as the efforts of community actors to engage with at-risk populations amid tightening resource constraints.  \n\nIt bears noting that the Brighton Retailers’ Anti-Crime Alliance, established in 2015, serves as a coalescent platform for cooperation between shop owners, local police, and community safety partnerships. Although such partnerships generally operate with commendable diligence, recent reports have documented fluctuations in engagement levels owing chiefly to fiscal retrenchment in municipal budgets and staffing shortages, which have hampered consistent application of proactive measures such as multi-agency action plans and offender diversion schemes. That said, the investigative diligence displayed in this case reflects a continuing commitment to those ideals, with a view to both offender accountability and harm reduction.\n\nCase law continues to evolve in matters touching persistent acquisitive crime, particularly in relation to credit reductions for guilty pleas and the interaction of offender vulnerability considerations with sentencing outcomes. In R v. Golding [2024] EWCA Crim 654, the appellate court reasserted the principle that early disclosure of responsibility weighs meaningfully in sentencing calculations, but cautioned against mechanical application of discounts where pleas are entered only after overwhelming evidential presentation. This is especially pertinent in cases involving sustained offending patterns, where the timing of a plea may itself speak to an offender’s attitude and possibilities for rehabilitation.\n\nSimilarly, in R v. Morrison [2023] EWCA Crim 237, the Court considered the balance between community-based disposals and custodial sentences for defendants with chronic substance misuse issues and associated low-level theft convictions. The judgment emphasised the need for comprehensive and multi-disciplinary assessment of risk and need, noting that custodial sentences may be warranted where public protection concerns override rehabilitative prospects.\n\nI also consider the observations in R v. Fenwick [2022] EWCA Crim 1921, which addressed sentencing following persistent shop theft involving habitual diversion of pharmacy goods. The court underscored the demonstrable impact on employees’ wellbeing, the erosion of trust in local services, and potential long-term detriment to vulnerable consumers.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nYour offending was marked by both opportunism and apparent calculation, with evidence showing repeated visits to retail premises during peak hours, use of concealment techniques, and evasion of store security. This deliberate pattern places the offence squarely within the upper bands of culpability established by the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nI pause to note that despite the focused nature of your offending, no violence or threats were directed at staff or customers; the harm, however, is not to be underestimated. Shop employees report increased anxiety, disrupted working patterns, and a sense of unsafety that has contributed to elevated staff turnover in some locations. Such factors exacerbate pressures on small business operations, heightening economic losses and placing further strains on community cohesion.\n\nBefore turning to risk assessments and mitigation, it is pertinent to consider again the broader societal context within which offences of this nature occur. There are, lamentably, rising levels of street homelessness in Brighton and other coastal urban centres, with associated increases in begging, substance misuse, and anti-social behaviours. The normalisation of such conduct in public spaces reflects not just deprivation but a deterioration in commonly held social norms. These trends present challenges not only for law enforcement but for public health and community development sectors alike.  \n\nIt is beyond this court’s remit to engage in sociological theorisation, but ignoring these developments risks undue abstraction that would damage not only jurisprudential soundness but also pragmatic policy formation. The court therefore acknowledges with regret the limitations of current social care structures and mental health services, including long waiting lists for specialist intervention and reduced funding for outreach programmes. These systemic inadequacies, while no excuse for offending, inform the context in which individuals such as yourself may find themselves caught.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nIn the course of proceedings, a psychiatric assessment has been undertaken by Dr Caroline Mendel, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, who prepared a comprehensive report dated 15 August 2026. Dr Mendel’s findings indicate no evidence of major mental illness but identify features of emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and traits consistent with a personality disorder spectrum. The report notes your acknowledgement of alcohol mis-use and a history of missed appointments with local drug and alcohol services, a pattern that limits prospects for short-term clinical improvement absent structured engagement. The risk of recidivism is regarded as moderate to high in the absence of consistent intervention.\n\nThe National Probation Service (NPS) prepared a pre-sentence report, examining your background, previous convictions, current accommodation status, and support networks. The report highlights a lack of stable employment, fractured family relationships, and periods of homelessness over the preceding three years. It references prior community-based orders, some of which were terminated early for non-compliance. Notably, a referral to a Thinking Skills Programme offered last year was declined. The officer responsible expresses concern regarding your limited motivation to engage with rehabilitative activity, while recognising some expressed desire to avoid custody.\n\nThe NPS report recommends consideration of a mixed sentence incorporating a community order with unpaid work, subject to enhanced supervision and mandatory attendance at accredited offending behaviour programmes addressing acquisitive crime reduction and substance misuse. The feasibility of mental health liaison support is also noted, though access depends on local service capacity.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nIt must be acknowledged that while the judiciary plays a crucial role in administering justice, the rehabilitation of offenders rests on a complex weave of inter-agency cooperation and adequate resource allocation. The Probation Service currently faces challenges arising from staffing shortages, high caseloads, and funding constraints, particularly in regions affected by economic disadvantage and social volatility. These systemic stressors hamper efforts to deliver personalised interventions, limiting the scope for proactive management of low-level repeat offenders.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nIn forming sentence, I must balance the imperative of individual accountability with the overarching public interest in reducing harm and deterring further offending. The obvious financial and emotional impact on local businesses must be factored alongside the broader societal costs of persistent acquisitive crime — which includes not only loss and disruption but also the diversion of police and community resources from other pressing priorities.\n\nTo place this in context, I refer to the observations in R v. Webster [2022] EWCA Crim 875, where the Court of Appeal highlighted the need to consider the cumulative effects of repeated offending on victims’ perceptions of safety and well-being, and the resultant impact on community cohesion.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nAside from the most recent theft offence, you have prior convictions for similar conduct, including a community resolution in 2019 and two separate conditional discharges in 2021. These earlier outcomes reflect a pattern of persistent offending despite opportunities for diversion. The lack of sustained engagement with support services further compounds concerns.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nThe Crown makes submissions that, given your previous record, the seriousness of the offending, and the risk of further harm should the offending continue unabated, a custodial sentence is warranted. Defence counsel, meanwhile, emphasises your expressed remorse, the mitigating effect of your difficult personal circumstances — including the ongoing challenges posed by unstable housing and limited family support — and urges the court to consider a community-based disposal with intensive supervision and access to rehabilitative programming.\n\nThe court carefully weighs these submissions. It is axiomatic, as consistently recognised in appellate case law, that custody is a sentence of last resort in respect of non-violent acquisitive crime, particularly where there is scope for community interventions. That said, where repeated offending shows disregard for prior warnings and causes tangible harm, the sentencing court cannot ignore the public interest in robust deterrence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nAccordingly, I direct that a fresh pre-sentence report be obtained, with a particular focus on mapping out the availability and appropriateness of community-based interventions that can address your criminogenic needs and reduce the risk of reoffending. I request that the supervising probation officer consider whether a combination of rehabilitative activity and restorative justice measures could be arranged in a manner that is practicable and proportionate.\n\nThe court also expects that any updated psychiatric or clinical reports, if commissioned, include an appraisal of your engagement and prognosis with regard to substance use and impulse control, so that sentencing can be informed by the best possible understanding of your personal circumstances.\n\nThe hearing today has proceeded in open court. I acknowledge the presence and professionalism of Ms Charlotte Willis, who appears for the Crown, and Mr Rajiv Mehta, representing you under a Legal Aid order. I also thank the court clerk and ushers, whose diligent and attentive conduct assists in the smooth running of these proceedings. The courtroom itself has recently been refurbished, with improved accessibility features, reflecting ongoing investment in judicial infrastructure despite budgetary pressures.\n\nMr H, you are reminded that the State regards offending of this nature seriously. The loss to local businesses, the impact on individuals working within these premises, and the drain on public services all represent real and distressing consequences. While broader social difficulties undoubtedly shape some of the challenges faced by defendants in cases like yours, these are not exculpatory. It remains the case that adults are responsible for their actions and must be held to account.\n\nI reserve sentence pending receipt of the updated pre-sentence report and any further expert evidence that may be submitted on your behalf. The date for sentence will be fixed in due course and you will be notified accordingly.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are pronounced this day, 17 September 2026, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You have a right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are not engaged unless otherwise ordered. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2026/04573  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. P.
