MR H  \nCase No. T2025/13498  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. P. Cranfield  \nFiled: 14 August 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on charges related to shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences span a protracted period between late 2022 and early 2025 and encompass various retail premises across the Brixton, Camberwell, and Streatham boroughs.\n\nPreliminary and Procedural History  \nYour prosecution was initiated following intelligence-led investigations conducted jointly by the Brixton Police Borough Command, supported by the South London Retail Crime Partnership and the Lambeth Community Safety Unit. These investigations were triggered by an uptick in reported incidences of retail theft, noted particularly in smaller convenience outlets and several high street pharmacies. Initial reports suggested a pattern of covert but repeated thefts, involving a male suspect matching your description and physical characteristics.\n\nThe investigative procedures included painstaking review of hours of CCTV footage, involving camera systems with varying degrees of resolution quality and placement, all of which required calibration against witness accounts and stock loss reports. It must be acknowledged, as frequent participants in such matters know all too well, that retail crime investigations consume disproportionate police resources relative to the monetary value of the items involved. CCTV, though widely heralded as a technological boon to law enforcement, often presents an evidential labyrinth, wherein clear identification is stubbornly elusive due to inadequate lighting, obstructed sightlines, and the intrinsic limitations of consumer-grade surveillance equipment.\n\nMoreover, the administrative burden imposed upon front-line retail staff—already operating under considerable economic pressures—to participate in interviews, prepare statements, and engage with the adjudicatory process cannot be overstated. The intersection of overstretched policing capacity, retailer fatigue, and a patchwork of legal frameworks underscores the challenges inherent in this domain.\n\nYour arrest took place on 29 March 2025 after a multi-faceted investigation deploying both overt surveillance and covert monitoring techniques, including the lawful use of telephone metadata pursuant to a warrant authorised by a crown court judge. Your interview under caution was conducted on 1 April 2025, at which you initially denied the allegations. However, forensic analysis correlated fibres and material remnants from your clothing to items removed from several premises, lending substantial weight to the prosecution case. You were subsequently charged on 10 April 2025 with ten counts of theft from retail premises. These charges were later consolidated into a representative count for efficiency as per the Crown Prosecution Service’s guidelines on multiple offences carrying common elements.\n\nThis matter was allocated for hearing within the Crown Court listing framework under the Better Case Management (BCM) system, which aims to expedite proceedings and reduce duplication. While the BCM process is designed to facilitate early identification of issues, in this instance the case experienced modest delays due, regrettably, to adjournments arising from defence applications for psychiatric evaluations and challenges with securing timely Legal Aid authorisations.\n\nThese bureaucratic delays, while not uncommon, underscore systemic difficulties faced by criminal justice practitioners and defendants alike. The Legal Aid Agency has struggled in recent years to meet demand, resulting in frequent procedural bottlenecks that impede the proper and prompt presentation of expert evidence. I note, with some exasperation, that your own case suffered due to protracted correspondence and repeated applications before authorisation was granted to instruct Dr Priya Anand, consultant forensic psychologist, who later furnished a detailed assessment relevant to risk and rehabilitation.\n\nThe plea hearing was held on 20 May 2025. Initially, you entered a not guilty plea, perhaps unsurprising in light of the strength of evidence at that stage. However, just prior to the contested trial period scheduled for July, you indicated a change of plea and subsequently entered a guilty plea to the representative charge. The court duly notes the timing of this plea, recognising that credit is affected accordingly in accordance with established case law—including the principles affirmed in R v. Hayward [2023] EWCA Crim 1456—in which the Court considered the interaction between timing of plea and the amenability of the defendant to penal reduction.\n\nAs the court has previously reflected in appellations such as R v. Farrow [2021] EWCA Crim 789, the opportunity to plead guilty exists until the moment of verdict, but credit is not a mechanical instrument and must be appropriately calibrated to the circumstances, including the extent to which the plea spares the court, witnesses, and victims the burden of a trial. Late pleas, particularly those entered after full disclosure and evidentiary preparation have been effected, attract a reduced credit as compared to early admissions.\n\nIt also bears noting a further procedural challenge in this matter related to the swearing and attendance of a key prosecution witness, a retail security officer, whose medical certificate citing acute respiratory illness led to a last-minute adjournment of the trial set for 13 July. Such unforeseen health events, while entirely understandable, place additional strain on the already congested court timetable and affect the pacing of justice delivery.\n\nOn 3 June, a case management hearing was convened, overseen by a sitting judge well versed in Business Crime Reduction Partnership schemes. The hearing served to re-set procedural timetables and reaffirm expectations for timely disclosure, raised issues regarding proposed utilisation of a rehabilitative framework under section 177 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and invited submissions on the potential applicability of a community order incorporating an unpaid work requirement.\n\nAn observation may be made concerning the wider pressures on probation services in this jurisdiction. The Lambeth Probation Trust has reported significantly increased caseloads, rising by approximately 20% over the past 18 months, coupled with a reduction in staffing levels due to early retirements and recruitment challenges. This structural issue exacerbates the risk of delayed report submissions and constraints on the availability of rehabilitative package options. It remains incumbent on the court to be mindful of these challenges, without permitting systemic imperfections to dilute the importance of public protection principles.\n\nThe victim impact statements presented are drawn primarily from the management of three independent pharmacies and two convenience stores, each cited recurrent targets of thefts attributed to you. Account is taken of the operational disruption caused, including altered staffing rosters, increased vigilance measures, and the financial strain of heightened loss prevention budgets. Employees have described an atmosphere of unease and diminished morale, with some reporting symptoms consistent with workplace stress, including insomnia and anxiety.\n\nOf note is correspondence received from the Lambeth Retail Support Network, a voluntary-sector initiative. Their letter, dated 15 July 2025, articulates the ongoing strain faced by small business owners contending with shrinking margins and the cumulative impact of low-level acquisitive crime. They commend the cooperation received from the police and local courts but emphasise the need for consistent preventative measures and community-based intervention programmes. The court acknowledges the holistic importance of such inputs, even as it must anchor sentencing decisions firmly in legal principles and the facts of the case.\n\nI am grateful to Mrs Olivia Brady, who appears for the Crown, and to Mr Peter Wilkinson, defending counsel instructed under a Legal Aid order, both of whom have presented full and considered submissions in respect of sentencing considerations.\n\nIt is appropriate at this juncture to make brief reference to the statutory framework governing sentencing in matters of this nature. Theft offences are subject to the sentencing guidelines promulgated under the Criminal Courts Sentencing Guidelines Council and elaborated upon in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline effective since 1 November 2022. The guidelines emphasise the significance of the offender’s culpability, the harm caused, previous convictions, and any mitigating or aggravating factors.\n\nWhile the monetary value of stolen goods in shoplifting cases is often modest, courts must remain alert to the cumulative impact of repeated conduct and the wider social consequences of erosion of retail security and public confidence. The presence of previous convictions, the sophistication of the offending, and the persistence despite other interventions all serve to elevate the culpability category.\n\nI further consider R v. Chadwick [2024] EWCA Crim 912, a recent appellate authority of considerable interest. There, the Court held that “persistent acquisitive offending, particularly targeting vulnerable retail sectors, demands a firm but balanced response.” The judgment cautioned against unduly lenient approaches to defendants demonstrating limited engagement with rehabilitative services and emphasised the deterrent effect necessary to protect the economies of small businesses.\n\nMoreover, in R v. Morley [2022] EWCA Crim 1184, the Court reaffirmed that the community impact of retail thefts is not confined to immediate financial figures but encompasses the longer-term erosion of neighbourhood well-being and employment opportunities. That ruling underlined both the psychological impact on staff and the practical consequences of loss on local economies.\n\nThough neither case directly mirrors the precise facts before this court, their principles remain highly instructive in framing sentencing considerations.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\nThe pattern of behaviour identified includes the frequent use of diversionary tactics, including the switching of payment methods at the till, deliberate dropping of items to distract staff, and strategic timing during peak business hours to exploit staff workloads. The court was provided with detailed analytical reports from crime analysts attached to the Lambeth Business Crime Unit, evidencing repetition, methodical planning, and an absence of spontaneous misconduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nAmong the more troubling aspects, the evidence demonstrates your failure to desist despite prior interventions, including a conditional caution issued in October 2023 by the Brixton Safer Neighbourhoods Team, which was expressly designed to offer diversion to community-based support services.\n\nYour engagement with these services has, regrettably, been minimal or inconsistent at best. Psychiatric evaluation by Dr Anand highlights impulsivity and low frustration tolerance tendencies but rules out major mental illness. The report, thoroughly considered by the Probation Office, suggests that while cognitive-behavioural approaches may be beneficial, your current motivational levels to engage in sustained behaviour change are insufficient.\n\nIt bears mentioning that the Probation Service’s pre-sentence report, filed on 12 August 2025, underscores concerns relating to your chaotic lifestyle and intermittent accommodation status. The Probation Officer notes that you have resided at four separate addresses over the past two years, with some placements being informal arrangements or temporary hostels.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nYou report episodic use of alcohol and non-prescribed medications, though the evidence does not establish dependence. The court recognises the complexity of such vulnerabilities but also affirms that these factors, while relevant, do not excuse repeated deliberate offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nThe cumulative impact on victims, community retailers, and frontline staff cannot be overstated. As reflected in Victim Impact Statement 7, a long-standing shop assistant described a palpable decline in the sense of safety within the workplace, citing persistent anxiety and heightened security measures required as a direct consequence of the offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nCustodial sentences for comparable offences vary, but cases such as R v. Newbury [2023] EWCA Crim 230 highlight that immediate custody may be appropriate where offending is persistent, targeted, and unresponsive to less restrictive measures. By contrast, where mitigating factors are more compelling, courts increasingly explore community orders incorporating rehabilitation and restorative justice components.\n\nIn this context, I return to the question of sentencing options.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nI am conscious of the pressures on community services, including the Probation Service, which currently faces recruitment shortfalls exceeding 15% regionally, impacting the availability of robust supervision for complex cases. The NHS mental health outpatient waiting list in Lambeth similarly exceeds 20 weeks for initial appointments, further complicating access to therapeutic support for vulnerable defendants.\n\nThe court’s responsibility is to balance these systemic challenges with the imperative of public safety. A custodial sentence may be necessary to mark the seriousness of the offence, to provide deterrence, and to allow time for timely intervention.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nI observe also that previous sentencing remarks in this Circuit have emphasised the importance of appropriately calibrated community sentences with a strong rehabilitative focus, where risk and personal circumstances allow. The integration of unpaid work components, mental health liaison input, and Conditional Discharge Orders has demonstrated efficacy in selected cases.\n\nNotwithstanding these considerations, your previous history of non-engagement, together with the nature of the commissioning and concealment of the offences, weighs heavily against the heterodox option of non-custodial disposal.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nThere remains the vexing and persistent issue of late guilty pleas in acquisitive crime cases. It is regrettable, yet undeniable, that guilty pleas are often entered only after overwhelming evidence is laid bare, following exhaustive preparation and mobilisation of resources. While the law permits such pleas, and credit can be appropriately awarded, the court must maintain a principled stance against tactical plea timing designed solely to preserve mitigation rather than genuine contrition.\n\nThe court values the efforts of the Lambeth Retail Support Network, the South London Business Crime Unit, and the staff of shops impacted in this matter. Their patience and cooperation underpin the integrity of the criminal justice process, and those contributions are formally acknowledged.\n\nI reserve final sentencing for the receipt of any further updated reports or representations. The probation service is invited to advise on available community orders inclusive of rehabilitation activity, potential unpaid work, and mental health support consistent with the cognitive-behavioural recommendations of Dr Anand. Should custodial sentencing be indicated, I anticipate consideration of the current custodial threshold as guided by the Sentencing Council.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brixton. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his rights of appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 section 49 are engaged. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIXTON  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2025/13498  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. P.
