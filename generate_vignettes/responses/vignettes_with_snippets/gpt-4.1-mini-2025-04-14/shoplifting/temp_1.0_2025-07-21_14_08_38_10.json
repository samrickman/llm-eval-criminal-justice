MR H  \nCase No. WMT/2025/13842  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J.B. Fenwick  \nFiled: 18 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for theft from multiple retail premises, specifically shoplifting offences committed over a protracted period. The charges fall under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 and reflect a pattern of persistent acquisitive offending across several boroughs within the Greater London area.\n\nProcedural Background  \nYou were first arrested on 10 March 2025, subsequent to a cumulative investigation involving the Westminster Borough Police Retail Crime Unit, supported by local trading standards officers and the newly formed Westminster Business Theft Reduction Partnership. The investigation, as detailed in police witness statements and suspect interviews, arose from a series of incidents reported by various retail outlets noting a consistent modus operandi and cross-checking images from security cameras. Such procedural cooperation, while indicative of improved inter-agency liaison efforts in some respects, has, regrettably, not yet reached the level of full efficiency this court might hope for. Frictions between statutory bodies and designated retail partnerships persist as a theme in recent Crown Court cases, often extending case durations and complicating the evidential chain.\n\nIt is regrettable to note that similar patterns of under-resourced and incremental responses to retail crime are commonplace. The proliferation of small-scale shoplifting is a vexed challenge to policing and retail management alike. Surveillance systems frequently provide only partial solutions; the graininess of footage, often combined with intermittent lighting or camera angles, tests the patience and skill of those attempting to assemble coherent narratives for prosecution. Detection is a laborious process involving hours of footage review, corroborated by employee interviews, often of staff working without the benefit of full training or authorised time off to assist investigations.\n\nThis case, however, benefitted to some degree from the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol instituted nationally under Criminal Procedure Rule 3.13, designed to improve case preparation and reduce avoidable delays. The relevant case progression hearings observed statutory timelines, notwithstanding some minor adjournments caused by procedural applications and defence requests for expert assessments.\n\nThe record before the court reflects your initial plea of not guilty entered at the plea and case management hearing held on 22 April 2025. Subsequent disclosure of further evidence, including forensic examination reports and additional CCTV footage, prompted your reconsideration. It was only on the morning of the scheduled trial on 14 August 2025 that a guilty plea was entered, following an adjournment to permit the defence to submit supplementary mitigation material. This late admission of guilt is noted and will be considered accordingly in the sentencing exercise.\n\nIt is worth pausing to observe that late pleas of this nature are all too often the product of tactical calculation rather than genuine contrition. This phenomenon not only prolongs proceedings but strains the judicial and prosecutorial resources dedicated to the fair and speedy administration of justice. The decision in R v. Pearce [2022] EWCA Crim 87 emphasises that while credit for guilty pleas is a feature of judicial discretion, the timing of such pleas is of critical importance. Pleas entered at the earliest practicable moment are encouraged and attract more substantial discounts. Conversely, pleas advanced only after overwhelming evidence disclosure or trial readiness invite reduced credit. This court applies that principle here.\n\nIn addition, it is necessary to consider the authority of R v. Stokes [2023] EWCA Crim 184, in which the Court of Appeal reaffirmed the importance of considering the broader consequences of delayed pleas, including the impact upon victims, witnesses, and the public’s perception of judicial efficiency. While the case before me does not involve violent or serious injury offences, the recurring financial and psychological impact on retail staff should not be underestimated. The often unseen toll — anxiety, reduced morale, and fear of confrontation — is well documented in victim impact statements supplied by affected premises.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\nThe importance of maintaining an understanding of the operational context for the offences is undeniable. Nationally, shoplifting remains a significant concern for retail businesses, frequently resulting in increased shrinkage, higher prices for consumers, and the closure of small independent outlets exposed to disproportionate economic vulnerability.\n\nThe evolving jurisprudence surrounding theft offences includes, somewhat tangentially, cases such as R v. Hardwicke [2019] EWCA Crim 1097, where the Court considered the implications of sophisticated modus operandi involving accomplices and logistical planning over multiple jurisdictions. While these factors do not apply here, mention is warranted for completeness and to illustrate the wide spectrum of offending behaviours encountered in Crown Court. Furthermore, the court notes the decision of R v. Kensington [2020] EWCA Crim 2101 concerning aggravated theft in licensed premises; that example underscores a differing severity narrative not germane to this matter but reminding us all of the particularities which may aggravate certain theft cases.\n\nThe court also acknowledges the accumulating strain on the Probation Service, which over recent years has faced substantial caseload increases while confronting national staffing deficiencies and resource limitations. Such pressures impinge upon the availability and timeliness of reports, as well as the capacity to deliver effective rehabilitation. Reflecting upon this landscape contextualises, though does not excuse, the sometimes sparse support reports submitted here.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  \n\nFurther complicating modern criminal justice processes is the administrative burden posed by multi-agency collaboration. For example, Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), commonly engaged in cases involving violent or sexual offending, impose procedural demands including multiple risk assessments and inter-agency case conferences. Although MAPPA is not applicable in this matter, similar bureaucratic challenges are echoed in information-sharing frameworks designed for acquisitive crime prevention, such as the Business Crime Reduction Partnerships. In your case, the liaison between police, retail security, and community safety teams operated in a largely compliant manner but experienced the customary delays in information flow.\n\nAn ancillary detail worthy of note, but not directly relating to your activities, concerns a co-defendant originally implicated during early investigations who remains at large following failure to appear for pre-trial hearings. His unrelated subsequent charges and current fugitive status serve only as a historical footnote and neither mitigate nor aggravate your offending. The court regrets any confusion that may arise from the multiplicity of cases intersecting at the investigative stage.\n\nSome readers might be interested to know that the court facilities themselves have recently undergone refurbishment, including installation of enhanced digital recording equipment and improved witness facilities. Though peripheral, these improvements reflect ongoing institutional investment in the justice system’s infrastructure.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  \n\nThe court has reviewed extensive submissions from victims, including representations from the Guildford Street Retail Association and independent charities supporting victims of retail theft. These representations highlight the cumulative impact on frontline employees, many of whom are young, low-paid, and vulnerable to intimidation. One victim impact statement described emotional distress which led to symptoms consistent with work-related anxiety disorder — a fact that underscores the real human cost of offences too often dismissed as “minor.” The Retail Support Network, a voluntary organisation operating within the Westminster area, continues to provide advice and support to affected businesses, including access to loss prevention training and assistance with insurance claims.\n\nTurning to reports compiled by clinical experts, the court considers the psychiatric evaluation prepared by Dr Helen Simmonds, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, dated 1 September 2025. Dr Simmonds notes that while you do not suffer from any major psychiatric disorders, there is evidence of impulsive personality traits and mild depressive symptoms, exacerbated by prolonged unemployment and unstable housing circumstances.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nThough not determinative, these observations are relevant to the assessment of personal mitigation and to the identification of potential avenues for rehabilitation. Dr Simmonds recommends engagement with cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) focusing on impulse control and decision-making processes.\n\nIn addition to the psychiatric report, the court received the pre-sentence report (PSR) prepared by Probation Officer Miss Clara Dunne. The PSR elaborates on your background, including your history of prior convictions — primarily for similar shoplifting offences — and your pattern of non-engagement with voluntary support services. It also draws attention to your intermittent employment history and your current absence from stable accommodation, living instead in temporary lodgings maintained through local authority housing assistance. This instability is a known risk factor for recidivism.\n\nWhile the PSR is thorough and professionally prepared, its recommendations are necessarily constrained by your limited cooperation. The report advises that community-based interventions, particularly those combining rehabilitative elements with structured supervision, may offer some benefit. Miss Dunne highlights the availability of specific accredited programmes aimed at addressing acquisitive offending but notes that engagement will be key.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\nIt is a matter of concern to the court, as to the Crown, that multiple earlier attempts at diversion and community resolution have failed to prevent a relapse into offending conduct. Indeed, it would be remiss not to recognise the challenging position retail staff find themselves in, caught on the frontline of repeated attempts to relieve commercial premises of goods without payment.\n\nReference might be made in passing to the case of R v. Middleton [2021] EWCA Crim 587 regarding the significance of persistent reoffending in scheme design, though Middleton concerned shoplifting in multiple stores across the North West region and involved far higher-value items than those in the present case. That case serves as a broad reminder for sentencing authorities to account for the cumulative nature of offending over time, especially when dealing with repeat offenders.\n\nThe court further notes the impact of current pressures on the National Health Service, particularly in mental health provision. Waiting times for psychological therapies can stretch to months or even years. While the justice system must be cognisant of these limitations, this reality cannot excuse refusal to engage with alternative support services, such as those offered by third-sector organisations.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  \n\nThe role of victim liaison officers should be acknowledged. Officers assigned to similar cases undertake what can only be described as thankless work: supporting victims, coordinating witness statements, and facilitating restorative justice discussions where appropriate. Such officers continue to work under staffing shortages and competing demands from other crime types, including violent crime, serious fraud, and public disorder. Their efforts have contributed meaningfully to the victim impact statements presented in this matter.\n\nMoreover, it is relevant to mention, though not in any way to bear on the facts here, that a related environmental prosecution concluded last month in the nearby Greenford Magistrates’ Court. That case concerned the fly-tipping of construction debris in protected greenbelt land, an offence which, while unrelated, demonstrates the breadth of challenges faced by enforcement agencies balancing resources across competing priorities.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  \n\nA note on the administration of Legal Aid is prudent and, with regret, necessary. The system designed to ensure access to justice continues to face criticism for frequent delays and inconsistent application of funding approvals. In this case, the defence’s application for funding to instruct a forensic psychiatrist was significantly delayed, ultimately resolved only after intervention from the court. Such procedural inertia undermines defendants’ rights to fair representation, prolongs proceedings, and exacerbates the strain on already congested listing timetables.\n\nIt is, however, proper to commend the resolute efforts of the defence counsel, Mr Marcus Feldman, who has conducted a professional and diligent representation. Mr Feldman’s submissions on your behalf were measured and articulate, highlighting, inter alia, personal hardship and the cumulative psychological effects of social disadvantage. Equally, Ms Rachel Dunham, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, presented clear and focused arguments reflecting the gravity of the offences.\n\nAn observation on public perceptions of theft offenses is warranted. There remains, regrettably, a dangerous undervaluation in some quarters of crimes of this nature — perhaps encouraged by their frequency and apparent triviality. Yet the cumulative harm wrought by persistent shoplifting extends beyond individual proprietors to damage confidence in local commerce and community wellbeing. Societal attitudes towards such offences can be shaped by media narratives, online commentary, and increasingly, social media platforms where trivialisation can proliferate unchecked. While this is beyond the court’s remit, its impact on deterrence and rehabilitation is reflected in sentencing principles.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  \n\nSuch facts as I have reiterated, alongside the expert and probation reports, indicate a sequence of offending presenting a real concern for both the immediate victims and the community broadly defined. Your history of previous convictions and your demonstrated unwillingness or inability to desist despite prior interventions weigh heavily.\n\nIt is plain that the offences before the court — though by no means on the scale of significant breaches such as armed robbery or serious drug importation — have nonetheless exerted a material impact on the operations of the affected businesses. Market complementation schemes, community safety initiatives, and retail vigilance campaigns all rely on the goodwill and active participation of those involved. When that is undermined through persistent criminality, the ripples extend to employees, shareholders, and customers alike.\n\nThis court acknowledges the increasing complexity of the criminal landscape, which now involves, inter alia, cybercrime rings targeting e-commerce platforms, gangs exploiting technological vulnerabilities, and international networks trafficking stolen goods. None of these is present here. However, the precise nature of your offences does not diminish their consequence; indeed, the threshold for public protection and deterrence applies at all levels.\n\nSentencing Framework  \nThe starting point for sentencing remains the Theft Act 1968 and the relevant Sentencing Council guidelines issued for offences of dishonesty. The guideline sets out offences across a spectrum from lower to higher culpability and harm. Your offences fall within the lower to medium range for both.\n\nThe sentencing objectives — punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, protection of the public, and the making of reparation — guide the court’s discretion overall. Given the persistent nature of your offending, the risk of reoffending carries weight. That risk, combined with limited mitigation save for late guilty plea and personal difficulties, informs a calibrated approach.\n\nThe court is mindful of the custodial threshold as explained in R v. Clarke [2019] EWCA Crim 754, which reaffirmed the importance of considering whether community-based sentences can deliver sufficient punishment, reduce risk, and effect rehabilitation without the collateral consequences of imprisonment. However, repeated similar offences often edge the balance in favour of immediate custody to mark the gravity of behaviour and incentivise change.\n\nIt is well established, per R v. Winn [2022] EWCA Crim 440, that credit for guilty plea is discretionary and subject to timing, sincerity, and the saving of court time. An early plea, entered before evidence is fully marshalled, merits more substantial discounting than a last-minute admission.\n\nI will accordingly commission a detailed pre-sentence report addressing these considerations comprehensively. The report will assess risk, vulnerabilities, attitude to offence, and advise on potential interventions in custody or the community.\n\nIn conclusion, the court recognizes the multifaceted nature of shoplifting offences: seemingly minor in singular incidents, but cumulatively taxing on victims, services, and societal cohesion. Effective sentencing must balance acknowledgement of personal hardship with the necessity of public protection and deterrence.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are handed down this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at Westminster Crown Court. Proceedings have been duly recorded in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal transcript will be filed accordingly. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged in this matter. Costs remain reserved pending final sentencing.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT WESTMINSTER  \nR v.
