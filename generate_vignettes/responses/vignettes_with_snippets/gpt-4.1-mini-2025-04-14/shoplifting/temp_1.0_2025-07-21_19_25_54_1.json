MR H  \nCase No. T2025/15439  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. C. Wallingford  \nFiled: 18 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced following conviction for offences of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences in question relate to a series of incidents occurring intermittently between October 2023 and April 2025, involving multiple shops across the greater Bristol area, including some adjacent commercial districts. This court is mindful that the matter has progressed under its jurisdiction as a Crown Court case by virtue of aggregated charges representing a course of conduct rather than isolated incidents.\n\nProcedural History and Context  \nYour arrest took place on 4 May 2025, subsequent to a substantial investigatory effort involving officers from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary’s Retail Crime Unit, alongside collaboration with local store security teams and civilian witnesses. This followed the collation of intelligence indicating a pattern of theft targeting mid-range convenience stores, chemists, and discount department outlets. As is common in cases of this nature, initial reports were treated individually — often being recorded as summary offences that failed to attract protracted investigation. Only after persistent cross-referencing by the police Crime Analyst Unit, leveraging granular examination of CCTV footage and items recovered in opportunistic shop floor searches, was a link established. This aggregation was critical in presenting a cohesive evidential framework.\n\nIt is important to stress the practical constraints facing law enforcement and retail security personnel in cases of persistent shoplifting. The demands placed on local police units by “non-serious” acquisitive offences are sustained and energy-consuming. Officers are regularly required to devote considerable attention to what may superficially appear as low-value theft, yet the cumulative impact on communities, merchant confidence, and vulnerable retail workers is considerable. The inherent difficulties in securing reliable prosecution—owing to partial, degraded, or ambiguous CCTV footage; the unreliability of witness memory for apparently minor incidents; the absence of immediate apprehension; and procedural complexities surrounding property recovery—pose ongoing challenges to justice.  \n\nThe court takes cognisance of the introduction and operation of Better Case Management (BCM) processes in such cases, designed to foster pre-trial clarity and streamline progress. The BCM protocol in your matter, despite some delays that I shall address, has largely met expected benchmarks. Your initial listing was scheduled for 12 June 2025, but adjournments due to application by your defence to secure funding for psychiatric assessment caused deferral. These delays, while regretted, are not uncommon in current practice, particularly given the procedural complexities surrounding expert authorisations from the Legal Aid Agency. There was further interruption owing to a late application to admit mitigation material referencing statements from your sister, Mrs Adelaide H, and letters from community service providers in Bristol, all received in early August.\n\nThe importance of such supporting evidence is acknowledged in principle, although the court is aware of the increased administrative burden and strain on court listing resources caused by such ad hoc additions. These issues amplify concerns regarding the timely administration of justice for all parties.\n\nLegal Framework  \nIt is well established that theft, as codified under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, requires proof of dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with an intention to permanently deprive. The Crown in this matter has proceeded on the basis of a representative charge, indicative of a sustained pattern of offending behaviour rather than discrete isolated acts.\n\nThe Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences (published 2022) sets out a sentencing framework which accounts for the frequency of offences, the value and type of property stolen, aggravating and mitigating features, and the circumstances of the offender. Although individual shoplifting incidents are often summary and low-value, the court recognises that cumulative harm, particularly involving repeat offenders, demands appropriate custodial or community measures tailored to public protection and rehabilitation.\n\nSimilar authorities include R v Carrick [2023] EWCA Crim 1874, where the Court of Appeal considered sentencing for repeated offences targeting independent retailers. The Court underscored the considerable impact on victims’ sense of safety and the need for sentences to have a deterrent effect against recidivism in persistent dishonesty. Although the matters discussed in Carrick significantly focused on offences involving distraction techniques aimed at elderly shopkeepers, its principles remain broadly instructive here.\n\nAn earlier case, R v. Delaney [2021] EWCA Crim 1307, concerned the theft of pharmaceuticals from multiple pharmacy outlets, where the defendant engaged in systematic concealment of high-demand medicines. The guidance in Delaney insisted upon recognition of the particular harm caused to public health through such thefts, alongside the emotional impact on staff in healthcare settings. While your offences differ in precise detail, these rulings provide useful indicators of sentencing boundaries.\n\nStatements from Experts and Probation  \nThe Psychiatric Report prepared by Dr Thomas Burrows, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at Clifton Clinic, was commissioned following the defense’s application, which was authorised by the Legal Aid Agency only after delay, as previously noted. Dr Burrows’ comprehensive assessment—completed in July 2025—notes that you do not suffer from major mental illness, but that your presentation exhibits features consistent with moderate anxiety disorder and traits of impulsive personality disorder. Notably, the report underlines your “ambivalence towards ongoing engagement with community services” and a lack of sustained insight into how stressors like unemployment and housing insecurity contribute to your offending.\n\nCrucially, the report identifies that while your risk of harm to others is low, there is a moderate risk of reoffending absent structured intervention. Dr Burrows highlighted that cognitive-behavioural therapy and structured rehabilitation programmes would be beneficial but only if undertaken voluntarily with adequate motivation. The Psychiatric Report cautions that, given your current stoicism and limited self-reflection, engagement may be challenging.\n\nThe pre-sentence report, dated 9 September 2025, prepared by probation officer Ms Louise Trent, supports these observations. It presents a detailed social history describing a series of personal challenges spanning over a decade, including intermittent homelessness, fractured familial relationships, and periods of substance misuse, although no current dependence is reported. Ms Trent remarks that your engagement with voluntary sector provisions such as the Bristol Homeless Support Network has been sporadic and that your recent attendance at local adult education workshops was positively regarded but short-lived.\n\nMs Trent recommends consideration of a multi-modal community order incorporating unpaid work, mental health liaison support, and addressing financial management skills. The report outlines your prior convictions relevant to acquisitive offending across the southwest region, noting convictions dating back to your early 20s, including non-custodial sanctions for shoplifting.\n\nIt is regrettable that recent national reports from the Probation Service indicate ongoing shortages of qualified officers and resource constraints, which may adversely affect the capacity to sustain intensive supervision regimes. These systemic difficulties are noted without judgment but with a degree of professional concern.\n\nVictim Impact and Community Response  \nThe court has received written victim statements from a number of store managers and assistants who experienced repeat theft in their places of work. These statements reflect not only financial loss but also emotional distress and increased workload resulting from extra security measures such as re-setting aisle displays, locking of certain shelves during duty hours, and reallocation of staffing schedules. Several employees reported feelings of vulnerability and anxiety, with one assistant commenting that “the persistent theft makes the shop feel unsafe, and reduces the pleasure of the job.”\n\nThe Bristol Retailer Alliance has provided a briefing highlighting the economic and social toll of persistent shoplifting on local independent retailers. Their correspondence suggests that while national strategies such as the Business Crime Reduction Partnership operate across the city, implementation unevenly varies by borough and individual stores’ capacity to engage. The Alliance expresses hope that sentencing in this case will send a clear message about the unacceptability of sustained retail theft.\n\nIt is notable that the National Retail Federation’s 2024 report underscores similar challenges, pointing to how repeat petty theft cumulatively threatens employment and local economies, particularly in deprived neighbourhoods.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe court is mindful, however, that no incidents of violence or threats against staff attended your offending. This is a significant, albeit limited, mitigating element.\n\nProcedural and Institutional Observations  \nThe Legal Aid Agency’s performance in this matter, while ultimately facilitating a psychiatric assessment, has been marked by procedural inertia that caused several months’ postponement. Your appointed counsel, Mr Daniel Brooks, has repeatedly liaised with the Agency, forwarding necessary documentation and supplementary explanations in pursuit of swift authorisation. This drawn-out administrative process exemplifies wider challenges in the current legal aid framework, as also documented in the Ministry of Justice’s 2024 Review of Criminal Defence Funding, which noted that delays in expert instruction authorization detrimentally affect case timeliness.\n\nThe court likewise regrets the ongoing systemic shortfall in staffing within mental health services, particularly community forensic liaison teams, which impacts the availability of bespoke therapeutic interventions essential for defendants presenting with multiple complex needs.\n\nAn additional complicating factor in the smooth management of cases remains the prevalence of late guilty pleas in acquisitive crime. Though you entered a guilty plea at the third hearing in July 2025, this came only after non-progression of initial not guilty pleas and further evidence disclosures. Such timing limits the usual discount applied for guilty pleas under the Sentencing Council guidelines and relevant case law, including R v. Harris [2022] EWCA Crim 992.\n\nThis case also occurred against a backdrop of broader societal issues. Street homelessness in Bristol has reportedly increased by 14% over the last two years, with associated growings concerns of vulnerability to exploitation and mental health deterioration. Anecdotal evidence from charitable organisations supports this grim trend and reminds the court of the human dimensions underpinning many crimes of acquisitive nature. Nevertheless, these challenges must be balanced against the importance of individual accountability and public protection.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nIt is worth reiterating that the offence before the court must be considered on its specific facts and not overshadowed by unrelated societal malaise, though the latter may offer useful context.\n\nRelevant Case Law and Sentencing Principles  \nThe court takes note of the important rulings in R v. Thompson [2018] EWCA Crim 286, which dealt with a defendant convicted of copper cable theft from railway infrastructure. Although materially different from shoplifting, the case highlighted the disproportionate economic impact and public safety concerns triggered by repeat offenders exploiting vulnerable systems. In sentencing, the Court of Appeal emphasised both the cumulative nature of harm and the need for deterrence.\n\nOther cases, including R v. Foster [2020] EWCA Crim 1099, which involved aggravated burglary with a bladed article, are less directly relevant here, though they certainly reflect a judicial commitment to weighing not just the narrow act, but wider public safety imperatives.\n\nThe court is reminded that early guilty pleas remain key drivers of sentence mitigation as expressed in R v. Whitbeck [2021] EWCA Crim 1435, but discounts are strictly tied to timing and genuineness of admissions. Where pleas come late, the reduction is appropriately limited.\n\nFacts of the Case  \nThe facts as established by the prosecution, and to which you have admitted liability, are summarised below.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThese incidents demonstrate a deliberate and repeated pattern of theft, utilizing concealment techniques and exploitation of predictable retail vulnerabilities. The court accepts that no violence was employed and that there are some elements of personal hardship in your background; however, these do not detract from the gravity of persistent dishonesty or its wider ramifications.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nNotably, previous interventions — including conditional cautions and community resolutions — have not produced lasting desistance. That history remains material.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nSentencing Considerations and Directions  \nThe court recognises that Mr H is now 35 years old, with a history of similar offences over a period exceeding ten years, and that various support offers have been made in the community — some accepted, some declined. While there is no evidence of complicity with organised crime or serious violence, the persistence of offending suggests entrenched behavioural patterns requiring a firm but rehabilitative response.\n\nI give credit for your late guilty plea, which reduces sentence vulnerability by a modest percentage given its timing. I also note the psychiatric and probation assessments recommending intensified community-based interventions with cognitive-behavioural elements.\n\nHowever, the court must weigh carefully the need for deterrence, public protection, and recognition of the real harm to victims, who have detailed increased distress and a sense of insecurity. Persistent offending of this kind imperils not only commerce but social cohesion.\n\nIt is the court’s strong view that community sentences remain the preferred option when they offer realistic prospects of compliance and rehabilitation. Custodial sentences, reserved for more serious or intractable cases, provide a last resort but one not excluded here given the pattern of recidivism.\n\nI direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report incorporating updated risk assessment, considering the applicability of a community order with unpaid work and requirements targeting impulsivity, financial management, and mental health support. The probation service is also requested to consider the use of structured restorative justice measures where suitable.\n\nThe court also expects close liaison with local voluntary agencies engaged in homelessness mitigation, recognizing the complex, overlapping vulnerabilities many defendants face.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued on the 18th day of September 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2025/15439  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. C.
