MR H  \nCase No. E2025/14328  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. Farnsworth  \nFiled: 16 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear today before the Crown Court at Eastbourne for the purpose of sentencing, following your conviction for theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 by virtue of a representative count encompassing a series of shoplifting offences over an extended period. The offending concentrated in retail establishments located primarily within the Eastbourne and neighboring districts and spanned from early 2023 through to April 2025.  \n\nThis is, of course, a relatively common type of case in contemporary criminal justice practice and yet one which raises recurrent and increasingly pressing concerns about the durability of public order and the capacity of the criminal justice system to respond to persistent acquisitive offending in a way that balances justice, rehabilitation, and community safety. The case has been subject to multiple procedural steps, including adjournments to permit the preparation of a psychiatric report and detailed victim impact documentation, and has traversed the Better Case Management (BCM) framework introduced in 2021, aimed at expediting progression and reducing unnecessary delay.  \n\nProcedural History  \nYour initial police interview took place on 26 April 2025, subsequent to your arrest the preceding day at your last known address in Eastbourne, following a prolonged investigative effort led by the Sussex Police Retail Crime Task Force in conjunction with the East Sussex Business Crime Reduction Partnership. The inquiry involved input from multiple stakeholders and employed a range of investigative techniques, including CCTV collation, witness statements, and forensic examination of seized property. The arrest was the culmination of several weeks of targeted surveillance and intelligence gathering predicated on reports of recurrent unexplained shrinkage at stores, primarily small- to medium-sized convenience outlets and pharmacies.  \nThe complexities surrounding multi-agency cooperation and the challenges inherent in assembling coherent evidence from disparate sources were underscored throughout this process. The catalogue of incidents required painstaking corroboration with store loss prevention teams and local neighbourhood policing officers, who themselves operate under considerable resource constraints. Such constraints have been well documented in recent public inquiries into the funding and resourcing of policing, notably in the Miller Report (2024), which detailed the impact of austerity measures on investigatory capacity.  \n\nInitial hearings proceeded at Eastbourne Magistrates’ Court during May and June 2025. Application was made for transfer to the Crown Court due to the multiplicity of charges and the magnitude of aggregated offending conduct, with the case arriving under the auspices of the BCM regime as promulgated in the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. The objective of BCM, as counsel will be well versed, is to encourage early identification and resolution of contested issues and preserve court resources. Significantly, this case adhered properly to indicative timeframes until June, when an adjournment was sought on your behalf to enable referral to an independent forensic psychiatrist pursuant to Legal Aid authorisation. The delays occasioned by processing this authorisation—in particular, slow response times from the Legal Aid Agency, which have been subject to ongoing criticism in Parliamentary Select Committee Reports—meant the report was only completed and filed in late August 2025.  \n\nThe psychiatric evaluation was undertaken by Dr Rashmi Venkataraman, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose report is comprehensive, detailed, and professionally written. It addresses diagnostic matters, risk assessment, and engagement prospects with therapeutic services. I commend Dr Venkataraman’s diligence and thoroughness. Furthermore, I acknowledge the dedicated efforts of Ms Aline Carter, your appointed probation officer, whose comprehensive pre-sentence report, filed contemporaneously, provides a nuanced appraisal of your personal circumstances and risks.  \n\nI must extend thanks here to the Eastbourne Retail Crime Partnership and associated Loss Prevention Officers, whose contributions of detailed loss registers and victim impact statements were instrumental in advancing the case. The partnership’s innovative use of data analytics and community engagement—as outlined in their 2024 Annual Review—represents a model for retail safety coordination, despite the persistent challenges of staffing shortages and fragmented information-sharing protocols.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThere is no gainsaying the fact that what might appear superficially as minor or “victimless” theft has profoundly detrimental effects on both the individuals employed within retail establishments and the businesses themselves. Staff morale is undermined; the anxiety engendered by repeated theft may result in overtime reductions, shift rearrangements, or, in some cases, decisions to leave employment altogether. Similarly, smaller independent retailers are often compelled to absorb losses rather than pursue prosecution due to reputational concerns or financial cost. These factors, while often downplayed in public discourse, form a substantive part of the harm borne by the offending behaviour.  \n\nIt is pertinent to note, in this context, that while shoplifting is frequently treated as a low-level offence, its cumulative social and economic impact has been subject to increasing judicial attention. In R v. Fletcher [2023] EWCA Crim 1412, the Court of Appeal specifically remarked on the corrosive effect of persistent retail theft on community cohesion and local commerce, holding that sentencing must reflect not only the value of the goods stolen but the broader context of disruption, demoralisation, and risk to workers’ wellbeing. That principle guides the court’s approach in your case.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nIt must be observed that, while disposals such as conditional cautions or community resolutions operate with notable frequency in cases involving shoplifting, this case’s scale and recurrence place it beyond what might be appropriately dealt with summarily. The prior offending history of a defendant is of course highly material. Your record includes a number of previous convictions, notably for theft and breaches of community orders, and at least one formal reconciliation caution dating from 2021. The fact that such interventions have not yielded enduring behavioural change is regrettable, yet unfortunately not unusual. The persistence of offending in such circumstances poses unmistakable challenges for the justice system’s rehabilitative aspirations.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nI also wish to place on record the court’s appreciation for the careful victim impact statements submitted on behalf of several affected premises. The statements detail the subjective experience of fear and discomfort experienced by staff, many of whom are young, part-time workers. The psychological effects described are consistent with findings from the growing body of criminological literature emphasising emotional and secondary victimization outcomes in retail theft, as highlighted in the recent report by the British Retail Consortium. The harm is real and extends beyond straightforward economic loss.  \n\nIt is appropriate, perhaps, to recall the oft-cited dictum from R v Donovan [2019] EWCA Crim 932, where the Court of Appeal recognised that the ripple effects of acquisitive crime can undermine local trust and confidence, entrenching a sense of vulnerability and disconnection within communities. Though that case dealt with far more serious offences and complex offender histories, the principles of cumulative harm and public protection remain apposite.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nAssessing the personal circumstances of the defendant is an integral part of the sentencing exercise. Your background has been explored in some depth within the pre-sentence report and psychiatric evaluation. You are aged 38. You report a protracted struggle with intermittent unemployment, punctuated by short-term, low-paying roles in warehousing and hospitality. Your stable accommodation is tenuous, dependent on local authority temporary housing arrangements with limited privacy or security. You made some disclosures during the assessment process regarding domestic instability and fragmentary support networks. Yet, as Dr Venkataraman noted, there is no clear evidence of enduring psychosis or major mental illness. Instead, the picture is one of impulsivity, mood instability, and significant anxiety, compounded by moderate alcohol misuse.  \n\nI am aware that cases involving precarious housing and financial stress raise difficult questions around causation and culpability. The court appreciates the complexity of such cases but must, perforce, maintain an impartial and principled stance. Poverty may explain, but does not excuse, the repeated contravention of the criminal law. Equally, support mechanisms, though often stretched and underfunded, exist precisely to mitigate risks. Your reported non-engagement with available advice and intervention services, despite multiple referrals and offers of assistance, is troubling and indicative of a concerning dynamic.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nMuch has been said by defence counsel regarding your personal circumstances, including referrals to childhood adversity and disrupted education. The court is sympathetic in acknowledging the significant role such experiences can play in shaping later behavioural patterns. However, adult responsibility remains paramount. The courts do not adjudicate character but conduct. It is well-recognised that early adversity may increase vulnerability, but it does not render one exempt from accountability nor entirely determinative of future offending.  \n\nThis court is mindful of the overarching principles articulated in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline (2021), which underscore the need for proportionality, consideration of culpability, and attention to individualised rehabilitation where possible. Particularly, the guideline stresses the importance of recognising the nature of the offending pattern, any previous convictions, and the impact on victims, as well as offender engagement with services.  \n\nTurning to the psychiatric report, Dr Venkataraman’s assessment includes a structured risk profile employing the HCR-20v3 tool, yielding a moderate risk estimate primarily tied to impulsivity and situational factors rather than premeditation or psychopathy. The report recommends structured cognitive-behavioural interventions aimed at addressing decision-making deficits and emotional regulation, alongside stabilisation of housing and substance use treatment. Notably, it cites your ambivalence toward participation in such programs as a critical challenge.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nIt is regrettable that, despite repeated offers of support from probation officers and community liaison staff, engagement has been inconsistent. The voluntary sector services in East Sussex, though severely stretched, provide varied assistance including budgeting workshops, supported employment programs, and peer-led recovery groups, all of which have capacity limits exacerbated by demand pressures. The court acknowledges these constraints but must likewise emphasise individual agency.  \n\nI wish here to commend, albeit with reluctance given the circumstances, the efforts of the Avalon Outreach Project, who have provided written representations attesting to your intermittent attendance at drop-in advice sessions alongside a history of missed appointments and erratic contact levels. The dichotomy between potential availability and actual utilisation of support is a recurring theme within post-conviction case management strategies.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nYour previous interactions with the justice system have included a suspended sentence imposed in 2022 for shop theft, which carried requirements for unpaid work and completion of an accredited thinking skills course. Completion was, however, not achieved, with recorded breaches documented in probation supervision files. This non-compliance is material to an assessment of both culpability and risk and is of course relevant to the court’s sentencing considerations.  \n\nThere is no evidence that you are involved in or influenced by organised crime groups, nor is there any indication of any co-offenders in the current matter. Your offending appears to be solitary, opportunistic, and recurrent, underscored by periods of cessation and relapse. This pattern is often characteristic of individuals subject to chaotic life circumstances and fluctuating impulse control but nonetheless requires measured judicial response.  \n\nThe court takes account of the victim impact statements which detail, amongst other things, interruptions to business operations and the added strain placed on staff safety protocols. A notable feature of the recent Eastbourne Retail Crime Partnership bulletin was the increase in reliance on security devices such as electronic tagging systems and in-store alarms, reflecting a broader trend nationally toward commercial security investments in response to acquisitive crime. This, of course, is an indirect cost borne ultimately by consumers through price increases or reduced service.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nOf relevance to the sentencing exercise is the matter of your plea. As recorded in court on 14 September 2025, you changed your plea to guilty at the first available opportunity following service of the evidential case. The mitigating value of an early guilty plea is established, pursuant to the well-known framework set out in R v. Heard [2008] EWCA Crim 1227, and subsequent refinements in case law. Your plea has accordingly been reflected in my consideration of credit.  \n\nIt is an unfortunate reality that, despite well-publicised avenues for diversion and early intervention, repeat offending remains a persistent challenge. The case before the court exemplifies the tension between the desire to rehabilitate and protect, and the imperative to impose sentences commensurate with culpability and community expectations.  \n\nWider societal contexts cannot be ignored. We operate within an epoch characterised by rising economic pressures, housing shortages, and fluctuating social support structures. The scandal of street homelessness, which is now a visible and distressingly familiar feature of our urban and semi-urban environment, continues unabated. Those who live without shelter or security endure daily risks of violence, exploitation, and degradation. While your personal circumstances share elements of instability, it must not be assumed that hardship excuses criminal behaviour.  \n\nThe justice system itself is not immune to pressures. Backlogs in nationally coordinated court listings persist; Legal Aid delays impede timely investigations and preparations; mental health service waiting lists stretch to months, if not years; and probation staffing shortages undermine supervision quality. In this environment, each case is part of a broader mosaic of systemic stress. Nonetheless, these institutional deficiencies must not translate into diminished accountability in individual proceedings.  \n\nI also acknowledge receipt of correspondence from the Sussex Police Federation, which, while not party to these proceedings, has expressed concern about rising assaults on retail staff and the insufficiency of current protective measures. Though assaults are not a feature of your offences, the broader climate affects public perception and sentencing expectations.  \n\nSentencing Framework and Approach  \nThe applicable sentencing guideline for theft offences forms the backbone of judicial discretion. The starting point is your culpability, evidence of planning or sophistication, frequency of offending, and the harm occasioned. The guideline further requires consideration of personal mitigation, the impact of plea, and the suitability or otherwise of community-based rehabilitative measures.  \n\nCustody remains a sentencing option, albeit not an inevitable consequence. Judicial restraint is exercised in the absence of offending involving violence or threats to life or limb, though repeated acquisitive offending frequently justifies immediate custody to reflect the community’s interest in deterrence and protection.  \n\nCommunity orders incorporating rehabilitative requirements, including accredited offending behaviour programmes and substance misuse interventions, might be suitable where risk can be managed and engagement secured. The pre-sentence report’s recommendations will be fully considered to determine the most effective course.  \n\nThe court also notes with interest the recent development of pilot programs within Sussex PCC’s special initiatives fund aimed at providing enhanced support for acquisitive offenders with mental health and substance use issues. These novel approaches may inform sentencing and post-sentencing supervision going forward.  \n\nBy necessity, sentencing is a highly fact-specific and individualized process. It is not a mechanistic formula but a balancing exercise, weighing public protection, offender rehabilitation, and denunciation. It also serves to communicate community standards and restore confidence in the rule of law.  \n\nSummary  \nMr H, your offending represents a sustained course of deliberate acquisitive behaviour causing tangible harm to local businesses and staff. Your personal circumstances, while vulnerable, do not absolve responsibility, especially given your documented non-engagement with support services and previous convictions.  \n\nYour early guilty plea is an important mitigating factor. Equally, cooperation with professionals must be improved if future progress is to be achieved. The court is bound to reflect both the cumulative impact of your actions and the need for a custodial or structured community response capable of reducing the risk of further offending.  \n\nI am therefore ordering the preparation of a further pre-sentence report, pledging particular attention to viable rehabilitative programmes suitable to your profile, considering mental health, housing stability, and substance misuse issues in equal measure. The probation service is also asked to consider whether unpaid work or attendance centre requirements may serve as additional levers to encourage compliance.  \n\nThis hearing is conducted in open court. I record my thanks to Ms Eloise Carrington, representing the Crown, and to Mr Malcolm Dent, for your defence, who continue to act under a representation order secured through Legal Aid. It has been unfortunate that procedural delays, including protracted applications for expert reports and the scheduling of victim impact hearings, have lengthened proceedings beyond customary expectations.  \n\nIn parallel, I would highlight that the joint efforts of local retailers, police liaison officers, probation staff, and third sector agencies embody a cross-community response that, though stretched, remains steadfast in its commitment to reducing shoplifting and supporting victims. Such multi-agency collaboration is both encouraging and necessary.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Eastbourne. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal against conviction or sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply unless otherwise ordered. No order as to costs is made at this stage.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT EASTBOURNE  \nR v.
