MR H  \nCase No. T2026/04821  \nSentencing Remarks — Her Honour Judge J. B. EASTWOOD  \nFiled: 15 October 2026\n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction for theft by shoplifting, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, having entered a guilty plea to a charge reflecting a course of conduct extending over a 15-month period throughout 2025 to the spring of 2026. The offences occurred primarily within the West Midlands jurisdiction and involved multiple retail premises comprising convenience stores, pharmacies, and independent grocers.\n\nIt is appropriate initially to provide a brief procedural overview before turning to substantive matters. Your arrest took place on 3 May 2026, subsequent to a lengthy police operation coordinated by the West Midlands Police Retail Crime Unit and involving various partners including the Birmingham Business Crime Partnership and community safety officers. These investigations relied heavily on multi-agency information-sharing and intelligence collation, combining closed-circuit television footage, loss prevention data, and, notably, communications between retail operators and local enforcement bodies.\n\nThe investigation predated your arrest by approximately five months and incorporated a series of interviews, witness statements, and extensive review of surveillance material. The prosecution carefully considered advance rulings from the Crown Prosecution Service regarding evidential sufficiency, leading to a representative charge that encapsulates the pattern of offending to which you have now admitted.\n\nThe Better Case Management (BCM) protocol was engaged at an early stage, with the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing (PTPH) initially scheduled for 21 July 2026. Adjournments were occasioned largely by Legal Aid funding applications for expert reports, including both psychiatric assessment and pre-sentence probation input. These applications, submitted promptly on 6 June 2026, experienced recurrent administrative delays, which are regrettably emblematic of the increasingly congested and understaffed Legal Aid system. For instance, the funding request to instruct Dr Margarita Lawton, a forensic psychiatrist with expertise in acquisitive crime behavioural profiles, was not authorised until 20 August 2026, following a series of requests for additional information.\n\nThis delay contributed to a deferral of sentencing to 15 October 2026. Whilst unfortunate, it reflects a wider systemic challenge and ought not to be held against you personally. Representation throughout has been consistently provided by Mr Simon J. Wilkins of counsel on your behalf, operating under a Legal Aid order, whose advocacy has been noted and appreciated. Ms Jade Ellis appeared for the Crown and conducted the proceedings with professionalism and clarity.\n\nIt is, however, a source of ongoing concern that similar delays are increasingly common and contribute to the strain faced by all parties in the criminal justice process. These strains are compounded by a growing burden upon probation services, as cohorts of defendants with complex needs saturate existing caseloads. At the time of reporting, the local probation unit assigned to you was operating with a vacancy rate of over 30%, owing to recent departures and recruitment difficulties, which further challenge the capacity to deliver tailored rehabilitation.\n\nThe court also notes with interest the efforts of several local charities and voluntary organisations who maintain active engagement with victims of retail crime. The Birmingham Retail Support Network, for example, provided written representations highlighting the cumulative economic and psychological distress such offending imposes on small business owners and employees alike.\n\nTurning to legal context, the substantive charge falls within the ambit of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, a long-established statutory provision occupying a foundational place in modern criminal jurisprudence. It should be noted that this legislation has withstood repeated scrutiny and amendment since its enactment in the late 1960s, as courts and legislators alike grappled with the complex dual objectives of deterrence and rehabilitation. For the court’s purposes, key considerations include the dishonesty element, the intention to permanently deprive, and the nature of the property appropriated.\n\nThe Sentencing Council guideline on theft offences, last updated 2020, provides an evaluative framework comprising culpability categories ranging from low to high and harm levels correspondingly from minimal to serious. The court must calibrate sentence severity accordingly, with factors such as persistence, use of deception, targeting of vulnerable victims, and prior criminal record bearing heavily on the assessment.\n\nI am mindful of precedent authorities. R v Knowles [2018] EWCA Crim 432 reinforced the principle that even low-value thefts assume a heightened gravity when committed as part of a deliberate pattern designed to circumvent detection. Similarly, the decision in R v Underwood [2021] EWCA Crim 912 reiterated that the cumulative impact of serial shoplifting on small businesses, which frequently operate with razor-thin profit margins, may justify custodial sentences despite comparatively limited monetary loss.\n\nOf course, it is equally true that not all theft is categorically punishable by immediate custody. The Court of Appeal in R v Whittaker [2019] EWCA Crim 1492 emphasised the value of community sentences in cases where mitigating factors such as dependency and genuine remorse predominate, although explicit caveats were expressed concerning recidivism.\n\nI pause momentarily to observe a relevant yet tangential matter concerning the administration of justice. This courthouse, established in the early 2000s amid significant local investment to modernise the judicial estate, recently underwent refurbishment of courtroom 5—the venue in which your proceedings have been conducted. New ergonomic seating and improved sound systems have been installed. While doubtless welcomed by those attending, such infrastructural improvements stand in stark contrast to persistent resource constraints in prosecutorial and defence support services, producing a curious disjunction between physical environment and institutional capacity.\n\nReturning to the immediate procedural history, your initial appearance took place at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court on 5 May 2026. Bail was granted subject to your adherence to a curfew and reporting conditions. On 21 July, the PTPH was conducted, with your not guilty plea replaced by a plea of guilty shortly before trial. The rationale for this late capitulation was explained in submissions advanced by Mr Wilkins, who attributed delay principally to your need for legal advice and the belated arrival of forensic evidence.\n\nIt is regrettable, but not uncommon, that defendants delay pleas until substantial preparation has been undertaken. The court bears this in mind in relation to the application of credit for plea mitigation. As Lord Judge CJ noted in R v Howard [2019] EWCA Crim 800, late pleas occur for a range of reasons, but the court must differentiate between those rooted in genuine uncertainty and those deployed as a tactical response to overwhelming evidence. The timing of your plea, entering as it did mere days prior to trial, attracts only limited discount.\n\nThe court is also required to consider the victim’s experience of your offending. Victim impact statements have been submitted on behalf of managers and employees of several outlets targeted. These statements describe a marked decline in staff confidence, increased stress attributed to the anticipation of theft, and adverse economic consequences extending beyond the immediate loss of stock. Whilst no physical harm was occasioned, the emotional impact is real and not to be discounted lightly. One victim recorded reluctance to return to work after a shift coinciding with one of your offences, resulting in lost income and further staffing pressures.\n\nLet us turn to the facts underpinning your conviction.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nYour modus operandi was characterised by a degree of forethought: selecting stores with limited staffing during certain hours, utilising commonplace bags to conceal merchandise, and, on occasion, countering surveillance through the wearing of hats or avoidance of direct sightlines. Notably, you were observed employing distraction tactics, such as pretending to engage with other individuals or feigning phone calls while removing items from shelves unobserved.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nI note that while some defendants in similar cases have sought to minimise culpability by claiming coercion or the influence of associates, there is no cogent evidence before me to suggest such involvement here. The investigation found no links to organised crime groups or networks. Your offence was committed independently, and there is a clear pattern of repeated targeting.\n\nReference must also be made to the broader legal environment within which such offences occur. For instance, the provisions regarding credit for guilty pleas have been subject to evolving interpretation. In R v Thompson [2020] EWCA Crim 147, the appellate court modified sentencing principles concerning early and late admission of responsibility, underscoring the interests of victims while balancing defendants’ procedural rights.\n\nMoreover, the court acknowledges the establishment of liaison protocols within the Birmingham Business Crime Partnership, designed to facilitate communication between retailers and police. Such mechanisms are intended to encourage timely reporting and reduce the incidence of repeat offending. Their relative success, however, is uneven, given staffing shortages and the sheer volume of calls for service routed through the West Midlands Police control room.\n\nIt is worth setting aside for a moment strictly legal matters to comment on social context. The increased visibility of street homelessness and rough sleeping within Birmingham and other metropolitan centres is a cause for community concern. Reports from outreach teams such as the Birmingham Homelessness Action Network indicate that approximately 1,200 individuals face homelessness within city limits on any given night, many suffering from co-occurring substance misuse and mental health conditions. These social phenomena intersect complexly with patterns of acquisitive crime, although such connections should not be assumed simplistically.\n\nIndeed, while some shoplifting cases reflect underlying vulnerability, primarily those connected with acute social hardship, the court must resist any temptation to treat hardship as a procedural or moral shield. As noted in the landmark case of R v Swift [2017] EWCA Crim 35, the legal system retains a duty to balance compassion with public protection — recognising that aggravating features may persist notwithstanding claimant vulnerability.\n\nYou are now 33 years of age with a previous criminal record comprising four convictions for similar offences, including community resolutions and, in 2023, a conditional discharge following theft from a supermarket. Despite intervention attempts by local police and probation teams, you failed to desist. I am mindful that this is a recurring theme within many such cases; offending of this type often follows a cyclical trajectory with periods of abstinence punctuated by relapse.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nTurning to the clinical evidence, the report from Dr Lawton, received on 5 October 2026 following extended assessments and liaison with your treating GP, provides careful analysis. Dr Lawton confirms the absence of any diagnosable psychotic or affective disorder. However, there is documented history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with residual symptoms of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. The report notes a history of episodic cannabis use but no current dependence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nDr Lawton emphasises that while pharmacological treatment with methylphenidate has been intermittently prescribed, engagement with psychological therapies has been inconsistent. She expresses concern that the defendant has not fully engaged with available support frameworks, a finding corroborated by probation assessments highlighting non-compliance with prior supervisory requirements.\n\nA probation report, compiled by officer Lorraine Briggs and dated 10 October 2026, further elucidates your social circumstances. You currently reside in temporary accommodation provided by the local authority, having experienced a prior tenancy loss owing to rent arrears and behavioural issues. Employment history is variable, limited predominantly to intermittent zero-hour contracts in the hospitality sector. The report identifies the primary criminogenic needs as impulsivity, financial instability, and social isolation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nThe report recommends consideration of a community order incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements, cognitive behavioural therapy targeting offending behaviour, and financial management assistance. It is candid in its assessment of medium to high risk of harm by way of repeat acquisitive offending if underlying needs are unaddressed.\n\nThe court recognizes the wider public resource implications. Such behaviour, when repeated, channels police and enforcement activity disproportionately given the comparatively low value of property taken. This diverts critical resources away from more urgent investigations relating to violent offences, organised crime, and safeguarded persons.\n\nInterestingly, while this court has no jurisdiction over traffic matters, mention must be made of the assessment of the defendant’s driving record, which, whilst not directly relevant, does include an historic disqualification imposed in 2018 for driving without insurance. This unrelated matter was disclosed during bail supervision and further complicates an understanding of the defendant’s social integration challenges.\n\nEqually tangential but noteworthy is the recent conviction of your former flatmate for possession of a controlled substance with intent to supply, a matter unconnected to your case save for shared residential history. The layered complexity of such intersecting profiles often presents real challenges to statutory agencies tasked with coordinated responses.\n\nDuring earlier procedural stages, the court received reference to a contemporaneous noise abatement notice issued against your landlord in respect of persistent disturbances, underscoring the environmental instability surrounding your accommodation.\n\nIt is also appropriate to record that a co-defendant named in earlier investigation stages, who was alleged to have accompanied you during several incidents, absconded prior to charge and currently remains at large. His conduct, including an assault on arresting officers using a chair during a subsequent incident, has no bearing on your liability and prosecution but underlines the volatility sometimes associated with men caught up in such networks.\n\nYour sister, Ms Jennifer H, submitted a character reference that was admitted into evidence, describing your early life challenges and expressing hope for rehabilitation. Additionally, a letter from the charity StreetSafe Alliance attests to your tentative engagement with outreach services, albeit without sustained progress.\n\nThat said, the factual and evidential matrix before the court remains clear: you alone were identified as the perpetrator in each proved instance, and you have freely admitted responsibility following careful consideration.\n\nOn the question of sentencing principles, the court is governed principally by the Sentencing Council guidelines, the overarching female of proportionality, public protection, and the prevention of reoffending. While the prospect of community-based rehabilitation is strong, the repeated nature of your offending and the limited engagement with support services raise concerns about the efficacy of non-custodial options absent insistence on compliance.\n\nIt is also prudent to observe that sentencing in case law often reflects wider societal expectations. As the Court of Appeal in R v Simmons [2023] EWCA Crim 178 noted, acquisitive crime undermines trust in everyday commercial interactions and risks normalising risk-taking behaviour that can escalate.\n\nAt the same time, the custodial estate faces significant challenges, including overcrowding and resource constraints, complicating the deployment of rehabilitative programmes. Balancing these competing pressures informs but does not dictate sentencing decisions.\n\nIn considering all matters, including your personal circumstances, prior record, the circumstances of the offences, and submissions on your behalf, the court has resolved that probation will be directed to prepare a full pre-sentence report with particular emphasis on tailored interventions to address underlying impulsivity, financial management, and housing stability.\n\nA consideration of the suitability for community-based orders incorporating condition monitoring, unpaid work, and accredited offending behaviour programmes is appropriate. This will include an assessment of risk and any ancillary needs, such as mental health support or substance use treatment.\n\nSentencing will be deferred to the next listing following receipt and review of this report. I must emphasise that no binding indication is given at this point but that full consideration will be given to the range of sentencing options compliant with the Sentencing Council’s guidelines.\n\nI express my thanks to the legal teams and professionals involved, notwithstanding the procedural delays associated largely with funding authorisations and report preparation. The court hopes that continued investment in legal aid and community sentencing infrastructure will be forthcoming to ameliorate the systemic deficiencies encountered in matters such as these.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 15 October 2026, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant has been advised of the right to appeal within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2026/04821  \nSentencing Remarks — Her Honour Judge J. B.
