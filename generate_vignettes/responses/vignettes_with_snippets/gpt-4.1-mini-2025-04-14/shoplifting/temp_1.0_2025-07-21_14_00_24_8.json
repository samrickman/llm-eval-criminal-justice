MR H  \nCase No. B2025/08431  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. P. MERRICK  \nFiled: 18 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction for shoplifting offences committed over a sustained period in the Brighton and Hove area. The charges relate to a series of thefts from retail premises, within the ambit of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, involving multiple incidents spanning the course of approximately fifteen months.  \n \nProcedural History  \nYour case came before the Crown Court following a magistrates’ court committal on 2 May 2025, having previously been subject to detailed investigation and evidence gathering largely coordinated by the Brighton Retail Crime Reduction Unit. The prosecuting authority has indicated that this prosecution represents a representative count that encapsulates your course of offending conduct. Initial offence reports were submitted during early 2024 and were collated by a range of small independent shops and larger chain supermarkets in central Brighton. The case file prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service was comprehensive, containing DVD copies of surveillance footage, statements from retail staff and loss prevention officers, as well as expert analysis of recovered property.  \n \nThis court notes with some approval that Better Case Management (BCM) protocols were applied diligently in the management of this case. The case progression officer assigned to your matter, Ms Violet Traynor, has provided written confirmation that key milestones were met without breach of the Criminal Procedure Rules timetable. Initial prosecutor disclosure occurred within 21 days of your first appearance, and there were no unnecessary interlocutory hearings or adjournments save for those occasioned by the absence of your instructed solicitor on two occasions, which resulted in short delays.  \n \nThe court is aware, however, that such efficiency is not always the norm in retail theft cases, which often see significant delay due to the heavy administrative burden on officers, the often fragmentary nature of evidence, and repeated challenges in securing legal aid funding for appropriate expert reports. The present case has proceeded with commendable speed by those standards — an approach which merits acknowledgment.  \n \nOne must also bear in mind the considerable challenges involved in prosecuting offences largely characterised as low harm but high volume. The Brighton Retail Crime Reduction Unit continues to operate in an environment where resources are diverted to emergent violent crime and drug enforcement activity, making their prompt attention to repeat shoplifting offences all the more notable.  \n \nYour initial plea at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 27 July 2025 was not guilty. This court, having reviewed the record, notes multiple adjournments between arraignment and plea entry—owing primarily to the late commissioning of psychological assessments and your legal team’s efforts to gather relevant background information. The latter included a complex set of correspondence with local housing support agencies, meant to establish your accommodation status and related vulnerabilities.\nA contested trial date was set for 14 October 2025; however, at a preparatory hearing on 9 September, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to the single representative count, following the submission of new forensic evidence by the Crown. This late plea is regrettably not uncommon in cases regarding persistent acquisitive offences.  \n \nAn observation is warranted here concerning the nature of the credit discount available for late pleas. As this court recently determined in R v. Wembly [2025] EWCA Crim 3486, the principle remains firm that the timing of a guilty plea is a critical factor in the exercise of sentencing discretion. That judgment reinforced that a plea entered at the eleventh hour—particularly one following the decisive collapse of a defence argument or the crystallisation of an unassailable evidential case—must attract significantly less credit than an early admission made with due regard for the interests of victims and the judicial process.  \n \nIn addition to the foregoing, the court must address systemic procedural concerns. The Legal Aid Agency’s handling of your representation has been cause for considerable frustration. Requests for authority to instruct an independent forensic accountant and a psychiatric expert were subjected to protracted review periods, with initial refusals followed by repeated clarifications extending over a fortnight. Such delays create avoidable tension within the case timetable and impose unnecessary burden on all participants.  \n \nThe experience narrates a broader, troubling pattern across the criminal justice system: administrative delays increasingly threaten the right to a fair and timely hearing. Practitioners know all too well the consequence when resources vanish behind tangled authorization systems rooted in over-zealous fiscal gatekeeping rather than thoughtful case management.  \n \nWe find ourselves, unmistakably, in an era marked by persistent staffing shortages across the Probation Service. National statistics reveal caseloads frequently exceeding recommended thresholds, impairing the quality and timeliness of offender assessments. Local services in Brighton report particular difficulties with recruiting and retaining experienced officers, meaning that pre-sentence reports arrive late or with narrow assessments. Although this matter is relatively straightforward by comparison, the court notes with concern that the risk assessment segment of the pre-sentence report will require careful scrutiny once received.  \n \nThis court is aware that housing instability contributes materially to the complexity of cases such as yours. The ongoing crisis of street homelessness within Brighton, a city experiencing acute pressure on affordable housing stock, informs both the social context and the practical realities of attempting rehabilitation. The absence of sustained, secure tenancy exacerbates vulnerability, perpetuates exposure to risk, and potentially impairs compliance with community orders. Charities such as Seaside Shelter and Brighton Hope have submitted written representations outlining the tenuous nature of local support networks — resources that continue to be stretched well beyond sustainable limits.  \n \nThe Crown Prosecution Service notes that, despite multiple warnings and interventions by local authority outreach workers, there is little evidence of sustained engagement on your part with the social care system. This court concurs that the willful rejection of assistance compounds concerns around future risk of reoffending.   \n \nIn reviewing the body of relevant appellate authority pertaining to the sentencing of repeated theft-related offences, this court is mindful of the established principles articulated in R v. Lindsay [2017] EWCA Crim 1253, which held that repeat offending, paired with disregard for prior community resolutions or suspended sentences, typically justifies escalation in sentencing severity. In Lindsay, the court underscored the diminished tolerance for ongoing acquisitive conduct that adversely impacts the confidence of retail workers and the wider public.  \n \nAnother instructive authority is R v. Calder and Pete [2019] EWCA Crim 1430, where the Court of Appeal emphasised the necessity of imposing sentences that reflect not just the immediate financial loss but also attendant emotional harm, including anxiety and fear experienced by store employees subject to repeat targeting. Although those defendants were involved in aggravated circumstances including threats of violence and involvement in organised crime, the sentencing judgments impel courts to weigh cumulative impact seriously.  \n \nPrior case law relating to unrelated offences also percolates through the context. For instance, in R v. Daniels [2018] EWCA Crim 1897, a defendant convicted of fly-tipping on protected environmental land was sentenced to eighteen months’ imprisonment despite the comparatively modest monetary value of material unlawfully dumped. The Court emphasised the broader symbolic and ecological damage wrought. This precedent, though unrelated in subject matter, reaffirms the judiciary's increasing preference for measured and proportionate custodial responses where systemic disregard for norms is evident.  \n \nProceedings in this court will also take into account the fact that your co-defendant in an earlier proceeding, Ms Taylor, was convicted of an unrelated offence involving possession of indecent images of children, which, while criminally grave, bears no direct connection to your conduct or culpability here. Any inference that may be drawn about your character from association is not entertained by the court.  \n \nWhile the defendant’s extended family history includes references to disputes involving noise complaints levied against the landlord of your current accommodation — particularly notices served for alleged anti-social behaviour and nuisance — these matters are tangential to the offences before the court, and do not bear on sentencing considerations. It is imperative to maintain analytical clarity concerning personal history and offence-specific conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nTurning to the nature of the offences themselves, surveillance evidence, sworn witness statements, and expert inventory assessments converge on a depiction of repeated entries to retail premises during opening hours, with the acquisition of multiple goods including branded over-the-counter medications, cosmetics, and confectionery. The approach on each occasion was marked by evasion of store security measures and a degree of premeditation underscoring your knowledge of the premises, schedules, and layout.  \n \nThe regional Public Health Observatory has recently published findings highlighting the significant prevalence of opioid analgesic misuse within Brighton. This is relevant context given evidence in this case of involvement with pharmacy outlets featuring restricted medicine cabinets.  \n \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe Police Intelligence Bureau has additionally filed an analytical report noting a 17% increase in retail theft offences within the Brighton district over the past two calendar years, with sharp spikes reported during festive periods and school holidays. This trend amplifies the social impact of individual offending and informs the court’s broader appreciation of community harm.  \n \nYour modicum of criminal history, as indicated in your presentence report, includes a series of prior convictions primarily consisting of theft and disorder offences. These date back over a decade, with the most recent conviction occurring in 2022 and resulting in a community order with unpaid work. The current offending, notably, represents a breach of that community order’s implicit expectations and conditions, although the court acknowledges that this previous sentence did not include an activity requirement.  \n \nAdditionally, there is some tender material from your family — including a letter from your sister — seeking to illustrate mitigating factors related to longstanding difficulties with accommodation and sporadic mental health problems, including diagnosed anxiety disorder. These supportive documents have been admitted and considered pursuant to application by defence counsel.  \n \nIt is regrettable, however, that comprehensive psychiatric evaluation was delayed due to the failure of initial statutory funding applications, resulting in the late commissioning of a consultant psychiatrist’s report from Dr Hans Olivieri of Brighton and Sussex NHS Trust. Dr Olivieri’s detailed assessment, appended to the pre-sentence report, elucidates borderline personality features coupled with impulsivity but indicates no psychotic disorder or severe mental illness requiring inpatient treatment. The report explicitly advises caution in attributing causative significance to diagnosis in the context of your offending.  \n \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nIn respect of risk and rehabilitation, the probation report notes that you have demonstrated low engagement with prior community resources, including substance misuse clinics and mental health outreach teams. Your compliance with the conditions of past supervision has been erratic, and the risk of reoffending is assessed as medium. The likelihood of a successful outcome from a tailored cognitive behavioural programme, including the accredited Thinking Skills Programme, is reported as moderate but contingent on your acceptance of support. This court supports any such interventions that foster rehabilitation and reduce future harm.  \n \nAmong wider public services, the Brighton Safer Neighbourhood Team has also provided a community impact statement affirming that shoplifting contributes to erosion of public confidence. It refers to heightened anxiety not only among staff in target stores but also among customers who have reported seeing repeat offenders in and around shopping precincts. This sentiment emerges despite the ostensibly minor nature of each individual theft.  \n \nThe court further notes with appreciation the voluntary contributions of the Brighton Retailers Recovery Network, whose outreach encompasses victim support, advice on crime prevention, and advocacy for affected small businesses. Their restrained and factual submissions emphasize the need for effective sanctions that deter future offending, while also encouraging rehabilitation. The court also commends the WorkWell Brighton initiative, which offers vocational training aimed at preventing exclusion from the labour market—particularly for individuals with histories akin to yours.  \n \nIt bears mentioning that at a hearing scheduled on 15 July 2025, the court was obliged to adjourn due to the late arrival of necessary interpreter services for a witness whose primary language was not English. While this disruption caused inconvenience, it reinforced the court’s commitment to ensuring fair access and procedural propriety for all parties.  \n \nDuring consultation with the witness service, it was noted that some retail employees affected by this offending had recounted experiences of distress and sleep disturbances, although none sought medical treatment. Victim impact hearings in comparable cases, such as R v. Dawson [2024] EWCA Crim 2028, affirm that the psychological sequelae of repeated theft cannot be discounted.  \n \nAt the sentencing hearing, counsel for the defence, Mr Jonathan Pryce, instructed via legal aid, developed a position centered on your challenging social circumstances, low-level mental health difficulties, and purported intention to cease offending. Ms Harriet Donnelly for the Crown emphasised the cumulative impact of your conduct, the breach of prior conditions, and the necessity of promoting public confidence through an appropriate custodial threshold.  \n \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe court also references authority from administrations regarding the limitations of suspended sentences in cases of persistent acquisitive offending. The Sentencing Council's guidelines explicitly state that such sentences have limited efficacy where previous non-custodial measures have failed and where the likelihood of reoffending remains high.  \n \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe court is mindful of the evidence concerning your financial situation. The pre-sentence report confirms your current unemployment and a lack of formal qualifications, though there is some indication of prior manual employment. The report notes a lack of consistent engagement with JobCenter Plus or other employment support programmes over the past year.  \n \nThe local Department for Work and Pensions has provided correspondence confirming your receipt of Universal Credit, albeit with interruptions attributable to intermittent contact failures with advisers. This aspect, while beyond immediate judicial control, feeds into the nexus of need and opportunity that frames your offending environment.  \n \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nAcademic literature on the impact of social media on offending behaviour is replete with discussion about glamorisation, trivialisation, and the impulsive mimicry of peer conduct. The court takes no direct factual basis of such influence in this case, yet it cannot ignore the cultural milieu in which many offenders, including yourself, operate. The rise of platforms such as TikTok and Instagram has accelerated the circulation of content depicting transient defiance of rules, sometimes rationalised as acts of survival or protest. Whether or not these factors contributed is speculative, but the court references them as part of the broader societal context.  \n \nAs to the reported incidence of co-offending, this court notes with particular concern the evidence in R v. Hardwick [2023] EWCA Crim 1234, involving group shoplifting coordinated via mobile phones. That case underlined the enhanced culpability and community harm arising from organised patterns of acquisitive offending. The instant case lacks direct evidence of co-offenders, but the point remains salient for the sentencing exercise.  \n \nThe political backdrop against which these proceedings unfold is equally noteworthy. Government policy emphasises the dual aims of punishment and rehabilitation, with a growing emphasis on diversion, community orders, and early intervention schemes. Yet, paradoxically, the resources to fully realise such initiatives remain inadequate. The Brighton local authority budget has faced year-on-year cuts exceeding 15%, as documented in the Annual Local Government Finance Settlement of 2024-25. Such fiscal austerity increasingly hampers services designed to prevent crime and support offenders.  \n \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nIn considering your prospects for rehabilitation, it is necessary to weigh the court reports, psychiatric assessment, and available social supports against the degree of risk indicated. The pre-sentence report evaluates you as a suitable candidate for the Community Order with Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, as well as possible attendance on a Substance Misuse Programme, if engagement is sustained. The Probation Service highlights the critical importance of stable housing as a foundational element in achieving compliance and reducing recidivism risk.  \n \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nIn the final analysis, Mr H, the offences you committed were not impulsive or isolated, but part of a deliberate and persistent pattern with measurable negative impact. The economic loss is modest, but the distress inflicted upon victims and the consequent erosion of public confidence is significant. Your late plea limits the credit available, and your refusal or failure to engage meaningfully with support services compounds concerns about future risk.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal order will be issued in due course. You have the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days of this pronouncement pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.
