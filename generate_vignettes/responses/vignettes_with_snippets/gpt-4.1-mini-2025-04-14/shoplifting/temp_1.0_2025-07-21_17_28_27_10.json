MR H  \nCase No. T2025/13429  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. Elton  \nFiled: 16 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentencing on a charge of theft, specifically the repeated shoplifting of goods from multiple retail outlets across the Birmingham metropolitan area. The offending spans a period from early 2023 through April 2025, culminating in your arrest earlier this year. The charge represents a significant breach of trust and law, underlying broader concerns about community safety and the protection of commercial premises.  \n\nProcedural History and Case Progression  \nYour initial appearance took place on 15 May 2025 before Birmingham Magistrates’ Court, where you entered a not guilty plea. The case was committed to the Crown Court for trial given the severity and multiplicity of incidents involved. Thereafter, the case was subject to a series of pre-trial hearings, including a plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 10 July 2025. During the PTPH, the Crown served voluminous evidence, including enhanced CCTV footage, witness statements, and analyses of recovered property. At the subsequent hearing on 1 September 2025, you entered a guilty plea to a representative charge, a decision which has been taken into account, though it was notably late in the proceedings.\n\nIt is unfortunate, but increasingly common, that defendants in acquisitive crime cases delay pleas until the prosecution evidence becomes overwhelming. The weight of recent case law, including R v Dundas [2020] EWCA Crim 1358 and R v Kearney [2022] EWCA Crim 1450, confirms that credit for a guilty plea diminishes significantly where it is entered at a late stage, especially after extensive preparation for trial. The underlying rationale is that an early plea spares victims and witnesses the ordeal of giving evidence and reduces the burden on public resources. With that in mind, the court must carefully weigh the timing and sincerity of any plea in determining the appropriate discount.\n\nOver the course of these proceedings, there have been several adjournments, most notably to enable compliance with requests for expert psychiatric assessment and a pre-sentence report. The Legal Aid Agency’s response, while eventually sufficient, was marked by delays and administrative hurdles which hindered the timely deployment of expert services. I take this opportunity to note, with no small frustration, that these obstacles compromise timely justice and threaten the interests of fairness. The repeated difficulties in securing funding authorisations for such assessments represent a systemic concern and place unnecessary strain on all participants.\n\nIt is also worth recording appreciation for the Crown Prosecution Service’s diligent case preparation and the work of the Birmingham Business Crime Partnership (BBCP), whose members have submitted detailed victim impact statements. The BBCP, despite chronic underfunding and staffing shortages, continues to provide crucial liaison between retailers and law enforcement. Their documentation vividly illustrates the cumulative distress inflicted upon staff and proprietors by repeated retail theft — a form of crime often dismissed as trivial but with very real consequences.\n\nSimilarly, the probation service has cooperated in providing up-to-date risk assessments and coordinated input from multiple agencies, including local mental health services and housing officers. Mr Paul Everitt of the Probation Service prepared an extensive report dated 10 September 2025, which will be referred to in these remarks.  \n\nIt is well understood that acquisitive offending such as this imposes significant workload pressures on police and court staff alike, detracting from resources otherwise focused on serious violent and organised crime. The diversion of scarce public resources, though intangible in economic terms, reflects an opportunity cost that must be factored into sentencing considerations.  \n\nPreliminarily, I note the relevant legislative and judicial contexts that inform sentencing in this area. Theft offences are governed principally by the Theft Act 1968, section 1, which defines the offence as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. While isolated or low-value thefts may be dealt with summarily or by diversion schemes, repeated offending over an extended period signals an elevated risk and culpability. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2019) provides a structured approach to assessing harm, culpability, and aggravating or mitigating factors.  \n\nWell-established precedent, including R v Latif [2019] EWCA Crim 1227 and R v Havers [2022] EWCA Crim 1602, affirms that multiple thefts particularly when accompanied by planning, concealment tactics, or targeting of vulnerable or small independent retailers, warrant custodial sentences in many cases. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly emphasised the importance of public deterrence in the context of persistent shoplifting, given the wider commercial and social harms occasioned.  \n\nThe Defendant’s Background and Previous Contacts  \nMr H is 34 years old and has a series of prior convictions largely for shoplifting offences dating back to 2017. These include custodial sentences, suspended sentences, and community orders, the details of which are fully recorded in the sentencing bundle. The most recent disposal, a community rehabilitation order, was imposed in 2023 but breached on several occasions. There is no indication of gang involvement or acquaintance with organised crime groups.  \n\nHe reports periods of unemployment interspersed with casual and temporary labour, but notably relies on local authority temporary accommodation given unstable housing. The probation assessment notes fluctuating engagement with support services and multiple missed appointments with addiction counselling. The defendant’s reported circumstances are reflective of significant social and economic disadvantage.  \n\nThe court reviewed a detailed psychological report prepared by Dr Francesca Muir, a forensic clinical psychologist, dated 5 September 2025. Dr Muir’s assessment found no diagnosable major mental disorder; however, she noted impulsivity, indicators of substance misuse, and concurrent depression symptoms. Significantly, Dr Muir recorded ongoing struggles with financial management and inconsistent compliance with previous interventions, recommending structured cognitive-behavioural therapy focusing on impulse control.  \n\nConcerns about the capacity and availability of mental health services locally are noted in the report and echoed elsewhere in the documentary material. The NHS trusts serving this jurisdiction have repeatedly flagged increased pressure and service demand, leading to long waiting lists and delays for psychological support. While such systemic issues are not the defendant’s responsibility, they form a regrettable backdrop, complicating rehabilitation prospects.  \n\nVictim Impact and Community Effects  \nVictim personal statements were received from four separate retail outlets, including two pharmacy chains, a convenience store, and a local supermarket. These statements detail not only repeated losses incurred, but the profound effect on staff morale and personal sense of safety. Several employees describe heightened anxiety, changes in work patterns, and in one case, an employee requiring time off due to stress-related illness.  \n\nOne store manager’s statement highlighted that the defendant’s repeated visits created a climate of fear, prompting enhanced security measures and additional staff training costs. Similar concerns emerge from correspondence by the Retail Support Network, which continues to advocate for better resourcing of crime prevention initiatives focused on retail premises. Their representation stresses that while individual thefts may seem minor when isolated, the cumulative effect on business viability and community confidence is material and significant.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\nIt is worth considering, though only tangentially related, the judgment in R v Cavendish [2017] EWCA Crim 2983, dealing with a burglary committed on a domestic dwelling during a seasonal absence. Though factually distant, the case serves as a reminder that breach of trust and exploitation of vulnerability carry considerable weight in sentencing, even absent direct harm.  \n\nMarking a continuing theme in distractor material is R v Jonas [2020] EWCA Crim 726, concerning criminal damage to a community centre noticeboard, which resulted in a civic fine. While wholly irrelevant to this case, the principles articulated on proportionality and community impact contribute to our evolving jurisprudence on property offences.  \n\nReturning to the present matter, the court notes that retail employees’ experiences of repeated theft extend beyond economic loss to a deteriorating sense of workplace security. Trust in security arrangements and management responsiveness is strained, and the knock-on effects include increased staff turnover. These are not trivial consequences.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  \n\nFurther digressions included materials relating to a co-defendant in an unrelated case, Mr Peter Able, charged with assaulting arresting officers with a chair during a protest near Birmingham city centre. Although completely unrelated here, this illustrates the sometimes chaotic nature of cases arriving in Crown Court lists.  \n\nAt a tactical level, the cross-jurisdictional cooperation between West Midlands Police and neighbouring forces, including Staffordshire and Warwickshire constabularies, continues to present administrative burdens. While multi-agency coordination is critical in the fight against crime, it can introduce delay and procedural complexity, unsuited to swift resolution in low-level theft cases.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  \n\nThe Facts and Offending Behaviour  \nThe Crown invites the court to view this offending as serious due to its persistence and sophistication. Surveillance evidence, in conjunction with staff testimony, reveals calculated actions to conceal goods, repeated targeting of specific product lines including cosmetics, toiletries, and over-the-counter medications, and timed appearances coinciding with staff shift changes or busy periods. There is evidence of the defendant employing distraction techniques and rapid exits to evade store personnel.  \n\nThe Prosecution points to an accumulation of losses exceeding £1,000, amplifying the moral and financial culpability beyond isolated petty theft. The fact that shop employees altered routines and some refused to work alone during likely periods of defendant presence is compelling, evidencing tangible adverse impact.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nDuring the investigative stage, digital forensics teams examined seized devices but found no evidence of organised sales or online disposal, indicating the offending was primarily opportunistic rather than commercial-scale. Nonetheless, the pattern was sustained over a protracted period.  \n\nSimilar cases involving comparable MO, such as R v Graves [2018] EWCA Crim 504 and R v Morris [2019] EWCA Crim 2851, have resulted in sentences reflecting the cumulative damage of repeated acquisitive crime. Such precedent informs the sentencing range appropriate here.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\nThe defendant’s apparent failure to desist following prior community-based interventions further aggravates culpability. Statements from community policing officers indicate several unsuccessful attempts at engagement and diversion from reoffending. The administration of previous conditional discharges and warning notices failed to produce the intended behavioural change.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  \n\nExpert psychiatric evidence confirms the absence of a severe or enduring mental health condition, though notes of impulsivity and depressive symptoms are present. There is no evidence of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or other legal insanity-defence predicates. The court takes seriously the potential mitigating significance of struggle with mental health, but equally notes the defendant’s inconsistent engagement with available supports.  \n\nThe court is cognisant of pressures upon health trusts: recent reports have highlighted dramatic increases in waiting times for psychological services, particularly cognitive-behavioural therapy. This speaks to systemic issues but does not exempt the defendant from responsibility for failing to seek or sustain appropriate treatment.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  \n\nThe defendant’s reported drug and alcohol history is limited, though probation records indicate occasional recreational use. No significant substance dependency is recorded, nor does the evidence suggest impairment at the times of offending. However, the role of occasional substance use in lowering impulse control is recognised, albeit without direct evidentiary linkage.  \n\nSince arrest, the defendant has demonstrated some willingness to comply with court directions, but this comes after a lengthy period during which offending behaviours were prolific. The late guilty plea, entered only shortly before trial commencement, attracts limited mitigation as per standard sentencing jurisprudence.  \n\nRelevant case law provides a compass for sentencing. The Court of Appeal in R v McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145 stressed that multiple thefts, particularly those occurring at night or involving entry to a dwelling, attract serious sentences to reflect the victim impact beyond mere financial loss. While Mr H’s offences did not involve burglary, the cumulative offending here similarly undermines public confidence and security.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  \n\nThe court is reminded by the CPS Business Crime Unit of the phenomenon where \"repeat offenders are responsible for disproportionate losses,\" a statement echoed by local safety programming groups such as Protect & Respect Birmingham. The impact on the retail environment remains an ongoing concern, factoring into public policy decisions regarding sentencing severity.  \n\nThe court further notes, though not directly related, the report of a recent case in this court where an individual was convicted of environmental offences—specifically illegal fly-tipping on protected green belt land—resulting in significant ecological damage (R v Trent [2024] EWCA Crim 1899). While that offence bears no factual connection, the principle that persistent low-level offending undermines community well-being is broadly applicable.  \n\nAssessment of Risk, Rehabilitation, and Support Services  \nThe pre-sentence report, prepared by Ms Julia Fielding of the West Midlands Probation Service, notes a medium risk of harm rating, principally due to the repetitive nature of the thefts and the demonstrable impact on vulnerable staff within retail environments. There is moderate risk of reoffending, heightened by the defendant’s history of non-compliance with previous orders.  \n\nMs Fielding highlights the difficulty in engaging the defendant with sustainable housing, mental health, and employment services, a challenge compounded by systemic shortages in support infrastructure. The court is reminded of the chronic underinvestment in such vital services, as echoed in the 2024 Parliamentary inquiry into the integrated justice and welfare systems for adult offenders.  \n\nRecommendations include a comprehensive package comprising cognitive skills training, financial management advice, and substance misuse support, with a preference for structured community rehabilitation where feasible. The options of a suspended sentence order with a community payback element, or, alternatively, a custodial sentence with release considerations aligned to compliance with treatment, are outlined.  \n\nLetters of support submitted from local charities, including the Birmingham Outreach Network and the Helping Hands Trust, commend the defendant’s intermittent engagement in voluntary activities but also express concern about lapses and lack of sustained commitment. These materials are noted but do not diminish the seriousness of the offences.  \n\nThe judiciary is acutely aware of the challenges faced by those working in rehabilitation, particularly in contexts of economic hardship, depleted funding, and chaotic social circumstances. Nonetheless, the court must balance these realities against the paramount duty of public protection and maintaining confidence in the rule of law.  \n\nIn parallel, correspondence from the Retail Support Group reiterates the economic strain placed on small business owners who bear the brunt of shoplifting-related losses, including increased insurance premiums and, in some cases, decisions to downsize or shutter premises altogether. Such community-level consequences cannot be ignored.  \n\nClosing Remarks on Sentencing Approach  \nThe cumulative gravity of the offending, the demonstrable impact on victims and community, and the defendant’s protracted failure to desist despite multiple opportunities, all point towards a custodial sentence as the minimum necessary to mark denunciation and deterrence. However, the sentencing options available will be informed by the forthcoming pre-sentence report which will assess the potential for structured community intervention and any further relevant assessments.\n\nThe court reiterates that a late plea reduces credit afforded, but prosecution recognition of the defendant’s admission nonetheless carries weight. Mitigating factors, particularly personal difficulties, housing insecurity, and health issues, albeit limited, will be reflected in sentencing discretion.  \n\nThe defendant is encouraged to engage fully with probation services, specialist providers, and any rehabilitative programming to break the cycle of offending. The court remains hopeful that constructive interventions can promote sustained desistance, as purely punitive responses alone have proved insufficient in this case’s history.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record will be forwarded to the relevant authorities. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to sections 108–110 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved. The matter is adjourned for sentencing pending receipt of the pre-sentence report.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.
