MR H  \nCase No. H2025/20389  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. Calverley  \nFiled: 17 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in respect of a theft offence, namely shoplifting, contrary to section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, over which this court must exercise its judgment, spans a number of months and involves multiple retail establishments situated within the Harlow and surrounding Essex areas.  \n\nProcedural Background  \nThe charge arises following an investigation that commenced in late 2024 and culminated in your arrest on 12 February 2025. The investigatory process was multi-layered, engaging the resources of the Harlow Borough Police Service alongside the Business Crime Reduction Unit and local trading standards officers. Over the investigative period, a series of reports from various retail outlets—ranging from chain supermarkets to independent pharmacies—highlighted persistent losses attributable to unidentified thefts, eventually linked by surveillance and forensic analysis to your person.\n\nThe Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) in Harlow, created as part of a national initiative to foster cross-agency cooperation, played a prominent role by collating incident reports, sharing premises’ risk profiles, and facilitating communications between victim retailers and law enforcement. While the BCRP system theoretically offers a coordinated response mechanism, this court is aware that operational effectiveness often depends on local funding stability and staff retention levels. Unfortunately, recent budget pressures have caused disruptions in coverage, an issue lamented by many front-line police officers tasked with crime deterrence and victim liaison. Nevertheless, in this matter, it appears that the partnership fulfilled its core responsibilities in a timely manner.  \n\nThe investigation that led to your apprehension involved the analysis of CCTV footage from multiple sites—some of which had incomplete or overlapping recordings—alongside witness statements gathered from retail staff and customers. Mobile phone location data, critical to linking your movements with particular incidents, was obtained pursuant to a judicially sanctioned warrant after appropriate application brought by the prosecution. The use of digital evidence in Theft Act cases has increased in recent years; however, such technological assistance also imposes significant evidential and procedural burdens, particularly in the safeguarding of lawful privacy rights and compliance with data protection obligations.\n\nAn initial hearing was held on 17 February 2025 before the Harlow Magistrates’ Court, where you were bailed on strict conditions pending further proceedings. Your representatives—the firm of J. Willard & Co. solicitors—promptly applied for a Legal Aid funding certificate for the instruction of expert evidence, including a forensic behavioural analyst and a clinical psychologist to assist with mitigation. While the grant of such authorities is expected under the current Legal Aid framework, this court records considerable frustration with the delays experienced in this instance. Authorisation was only confirmed on 22 April 2025 after protracted correspondence and escalating chaser letters, a regrettable circumstance which has become, in this judge’s experience, increasingly common and detrimental to case progression.  \n\nYour case was transferred to this Crown Court pursuant to the Better Case Management guidelines in place since 2019. These guidelines aim to streamline criminal proceedings by pre-emptively identifying evidential issues, limiting unnecessary adjournments, and fostering early guilty pleas wherever appropriate. Early hearings scheduled for 11 March and 14 May 2025 were, respectively, adjourned on your defence's application in order to secure views from expert witnesses and to take account of further disclosure. While such applications are entirely within your procedural rights, their repeated use underscores the delicate balancing act courts confront in managing finite resources and the individual right to a full and fair trial.\n\nIt bears noting that the Crown and defence teams have conducted themselves with professional courtesy throughout, albeit within the constraints imposed by case complexity and system pressures. I take this opportunity to thank Ms Eleanor Braithwaite, appearing on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, and Mr Julian Hirst, representing you under a Legal Aid representation order.  \n\nThe legal question before this court is how to appropriately respond to your offending, recognising both statutory principles of sentencing and the overarching public interest.  \n\nContext and Societal Observations  \nWe find ourselves in an age where retail theft, particularly shoplifting, constitutes an increasing proportion of acquisitive crime reported nationally. However, one must resist simplistic narratives that attempt to justify this trend solely on socio-economic grounds. While the post-pandemic economic downturn and rising cost of living have undeniably exacerbated vulnerabilities, the persistence and frequency of offences such as those before the court also reflect a complex interplay of factors including systemic challenges in policing, evolving criminal opportunism, and the shifting dynamics of social control.\n\nThe court is conscious that shoplifting offences impose both tangible and intangible costs: the shrinkage of business assets, increased insurance premiums, anxiety and stress among retail workers who often face threats or confrontations, and broader reputational damage to neighbourhoods and commercial districts struggling to maintain vitality.  \n\nThe work of local charity groups such as “SafeStreet Harlow” and “Essex Retail Victims Support” deserves recognition. These organisations—operating largely on constrained funding and volunteer input—offer counselling and practical assistance to affected individuals and businesses, frequently serving as the first point of support when statutory channels either fail or are overwhelmed. Their contributions form an essential part of the ecosystem of crime prevention and community resilience, which courts hope will be supported rather than undermined by judicial approaches to sentencing.  \n\nIt is unfortunate, but necessary, to observe that there is a tendency towards the normalisation of certain forms of anti-social behaviour, including low-level theft, in some communities. This shifts the demarcation between lawful and unlawful conduct in public consciousness, threatening to corrode respect for legal norms and public order. While social policy debates rage over causes and remedies, the courts remain steadfast in their role to uphold the rule of law and administer proportionate justice.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, attention must be given to the strain placed on frontline law enforcement by so-called “volume crime.” Resources allocated to street-level theft nonetheless detract from investigation of serious offences such as violent crime, organised drug markets, or threats of domestic extremism. Such opportunity costs are difficult to quantify but emphasise the wider impact of offending beyond the immediate victim or defendant.\n\nIn this vein, the recidivism of repeat shoplifters remains a perennial challenge. Probation services, tasked with supervising community sanctions and rehabilitative programmes, report chronic under-staffing and resource limitations. Waiting lists for cognitive behavioural therapy aimed at reducing offending behaviour extend into many months, and mental health trusts themselves face substantial demand. The knock-on effect is that many defendants receive limited intervention beyond rudimentary curfew or electronic monitoring measures.\n\nIt is in this systemic context that your personal circumstances must be considered.  \n\nLegal Principles and Case Law  \nThe Theft Act 1968, specifically section 1(1), defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive them of it. While offences of this nature may vary in scale, the courts recognise that repeated or organised shoplifting constitutes more serious conduct meriting enhanced sentencing.  \n\nSentencing must be directed by section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, under which the overarching considerations are denunciation, deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation. Custody is to be a last resort, reserved for cases crossing the custodial threshold as set forth in the Sentencing Council guideline for Theft and Burglary Offences (2021).  \n\nRecent appellate decisions continue to provide clarifying guidance. In R v Ellison [2023] EWCA Crim 334, the Court underscored that the cumulative effect of multiple low-value thefts within a date range may support a representative charge but does not diminish the seriousness of repeated dishonesty, particularly when conducted systematically. Ellison involved a defendant who targeted high-value cosmetics across 12 separate stores, using distraction techniques and altering appearance between incidents. The Court found no error in the imposition of a 14-month custodial sentence, observing that deterrence of predictive reoffending was paramount.  \n\nSimilarly, in R v Daniels [2022] EWCA Crim 1127, the defendant was convicted of theft involving a coordinated group trafficking stolen goods. Although your case does not implicate organised crime, the judgment emphasises that sentencing is informed by offender culpability, degree of planning, and actual or potential harm, considerations all relevant here.  \n\nI also refer with interest to R v Lester [2020] EWCA Crim 2021, where the court upheld a suspended sentence for a first-time shoplifter whose contrition and engagement with rehabilitation services mitigated risk. While differing in context and facts, Lester is relevant insofar as it illustrates the importance of offender cooperation and uptake of support.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe Facts of the Offence  \nThe prosecution’s case is predicated on a body of evidence including CCTV footage from multiple retail premises, witness statements from staff and security, and forensic examination of items recovered during your arrest. Your clothing bore fibres matching those found near the point of concealment in several incidents. Consistent sartorial choices were noted throughout a series of offences, aiding identification alongside transactional timestamps and your habitual presence in these locations.  \n\nYour conduct appears to have involved the systematic concealment of items within bags and under clothing, with occasional tampering of security tags and in at least one instance, the use of an accomplice to distract staff while goods were removed. No violence or threat thereof was employed, but the repetitive nature and sophistication of the acts demonstrate a degree of planning and intent beyond a spur-of-the-moment lapse.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nIt is pertinent that no physical harm occurred to retail employees or other customers, a fact which, while deserving of recognition, does not diminish the wider consequences. Chronic loss from stock shrinkage has contributed to store closures and reduced local economic diversity in the flagged high streets. Staff morale and feelings of personal safety have likewise been impacted, as reflected in witness testimony from management at affected stores.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nPsychiatric Evaluation and Expert Reports  \nAn independent clinical assessment was commissioned from Dr Sally Hemingway, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, instructed on your behalf. Dr Hemingways's report, dated 6 September 2025, concludes that you suffer from no major mental health disorder. However, she notes traits of impulsivity and an emerging pattern compatible with mild substance misuse disorder, primarily involving alcohol. There is no evidence of psychosis, cognitive impairment, or significant personality pathology.  \n\nRecommendations include engagement with community-based addiction services and cognitive-behavioural therapy focusing on impulsivity control. The report observes that effective intervention could reduce reoffending risk, particularly if accompanied by stable accommodation and employment.  \n\nIn addition, Probation Service submitted a pre-sentence report dated 10 October 2025. The author, Senior Probation Officer Janet Monroe, highlights moderate levels of risk of acquisitive reoffending, compounded by your unstable housing status and lack of meaningful employment. There is a noted history of inconsistent engagement with support services and prior convictions for low-level theft.  \n\nMs Monroe expresses guarded optimism regarding your potential for rehabilitation but stresses the need for structured supervision combined with access to substance misuse treatment and financial management courses. She also recommends exploration of restorative justice opportunities, which some retailers have expressed openness to participating in.  \n\nIt is worth pausing to remark on the probative value of such reports in enabling the court to formulate a sentencing strategy that aligns with both public protection and the aspirational goal of offender rehabilitation. The derived assessments form critical inputs into the sentencing matrix, balancing punishment with practical opportunities for change.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nThe Impact on Victims and Community  \nVictim statements from retail proprietors and staff underscore the psychological and economic toll wrought by your offending. Many report increased anxiety during shifts, leading some employees to request relocation or reduction in hours for wellbeing. One pharmacy manager relating to a small independent business detailed lost sales margins, the cost of additional security measures including installation of CCTV upgrades, and the stress engendered among the workforce.  \n\nIt is not uncommon for small businesses, already stretched by rising utility costs and post-pandemic recovery challenges, to be disproportionately affected by persistent theft. As some outlets close or downsize, displaced workers face unemployment or underemployment, exacerbating local socio-economic deprivation.  \n\nSuch community impact often escapes facile quantification but remains a compelling factor in judicial consideration of harm and culpability.  \n\nPolicy and Procedural Reflections  \nIn the course of this trial, I have noted various systemic pressures impacting all involved: from court clerks operating under staff shortages to delays in evidence collation caused by stretched police forensic departments, who are obliged to prioritise violent and serious crime investigations above lower-level offences. The Magistrates’ Court listing office experienced disruption due to industrial action on three separate occasions during 2025, contributing indirectly to adjournments in this case.  \n\nThe Legal Aid Agency’s convoluted administrative requirements and procurement delays—though increasingly contentious—nonetheless remain a vital, if strained, safeguard ensuring representation. It is incumbent on the justice system to advocate for reforms that minimise procedural delay while protecting defendants’ rights.  \n\nAdditionally, the involvement of third-sector organisations such as “Streetwise Support Network” has been instrumental in providing ancillary services to individuals in precarious circumstances, including hostel outreach and benefits advice. These functions supplement statutory provision and mitigate risk factors associated with acquisitive offending but face chronic funding shortfalls.  \n\nIt is within this broader social and institutional fabric—that presents formidable challenges—that courts must apply the law.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nSentencing Considerations  \nThe sentencing exercise requires careful balance: to reflect the gravity of your offences, to protect the public, to deter similar conduct by others, and to promote your rehabilitation prospects.  \n\nThe timing of your guilty plea is acknowledged, albeit at a relatively late stage after evidence became overwhelming. This attracts a modest reduction in sentence in accordance with the Credit for Early Guilty Plea guidelines under paragraph 1.3 of the Sentencing Council’s Manual.  \n\nYour personal mitigation pertaining to financial hardship, periods of unstable housing, and reported family difficulties have been fully considered. However, it must be underscored that hardship does not excuse repeated dishonesty. Where community support services have been offered and declined, the court is entitled to treat this as an aggravating rather than mitigating factor. The principle that individuals have a duty to take reasonable steps to address underlying causes of offending behaviour is well established.  \n\nComparative case law instructs that persistent acquisition of property by deception or theft over a sustained timeframe tends to elevate culpability. The absence of violence is material but does not lessen the serious consequences for victims and the wider community.  \n\nI order the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report with specific enquiry into:  \n\n- Participation in accredited cognitive behavioural programme targeting acquisitive offending;  \n- Suitability for a community order with unpaid work;  \n- Availability of addiction treatment, including alcohol cessation support;  \n- Assessment of housing stability and engagement with relevant local housing authorities;  \n- Consideration of restorative justice options agreeable to victims.  \n\nThe court anticipates that the pre-sentence report will address the likely need for structured supervision balanced against realistic prospects of engagement.  \n\nConclusion  \nToday's hearing has been conducted in open court, attended by prosecution and defence counsel, with all procedural safeguards observed. I thank all parties for their submissions, which have been detailed and professionally presented. Particular note is made of the cooperation received from the Probation Service and expert medical staff who have provided timely reports.  \n\nI also acknowledge the dedication of court staff, ushers, and clerks who maintain the conduct of business with commendable efficiency despite increasing workloads.  \n\nHaving considered all material before me, including statutory guidelines, case law, reports, victim impact statements, and defence representations, I reserve the matter for sentence at a date to be fixed after receipt of the outstanding pre-sentence report.  \n\nThese are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge R. J. Calverley, issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Harlow. The proceedings have been duly recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are reminded of the right to appeal this sentence pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.
