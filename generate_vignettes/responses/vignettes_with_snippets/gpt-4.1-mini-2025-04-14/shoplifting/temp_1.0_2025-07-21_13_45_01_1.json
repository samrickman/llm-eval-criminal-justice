MR H  \nCase No. E2025/14091  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge K. R. ELDRIDGE  \nFiled: 17 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence having been convicted of offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely shoplifting from several retail premises over a protracted period. The offending conduct extended across a timeframe from mid-2023 to early 2025 and took place within the jurisdiction of Eastchester and the neighbouring boroughs.  \n\nProcedural History and Court Context  \nThe present matter came before the Magistrates’ Court on 10 March 2025, when you were initially charged with three counts of theft. At that initial hearing, your legal representatives indicated an intention to contest the allegations, resulting in a transfer of the case to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme. The application of BCM reflects the judiciary’s intention to deal efficiently and fairly with cases involving multiple linked offences or where evidential complexity is anticipated.  \n\nIt is pertinent to observe that the BCM process involves a series of procedural steps aimed at early identification of issues, timely disclosure, and fixing of trial dates. The administration of this framework is not without its difficulties. While the Criminal Procedure Rules provide indicative timeframes and best practice, systemic challenges such as court capacity constraints, staffing shortages, and increased listing pressures have meant that many cases face delays. This case underwent adjournments on three separate occasions, two of which arose from issues related to defence counsel’s availability and Legal Aid authorisation for expert reports, and one occasion due to the late filing of victim impact statements.  \n\nThese operational realities are regrettably widespread, not unique. The court recognises the strain placed upon scarce resources throughout our criminal justice system, especially within Crown Court centres serving diverse and densely populated areas. Cases involving acquisitive offending frequently compete for listing with more serious matters of violence or fraud, and these competing priorities inevitably influence scheduling.  \n\nOn 29 May 2025, a plea and trial preparation hearing was held, at which stage you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequently, however, following the service of further evidence and discussions with your legal team, a change of plea was entered on the first date of trial proceedings on 15 September 2025.  \n\nThe matter has been presented to this court by Ms Felicity Maynard, prosecuting counsel of the Crown Prosecution Service, and Mr Julian Bennett represents you on behalf of the defence, operating under a representation order. The court records its appreciation of their respective professionalism during what has otherwise been a lengthy and procedurally complex matter.  \n\nLegal Aid and Expert Instruction Delays  \nIt is necessary to record, with some frustration and regret, the protracted delays occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency in approving funding for the instruction of an independent psychiatric expert. Initial applications were submitted on 21 April 2025 but were met with requests for further clarification and, ultimately, a multi-week wait prior to approval being granted on 18 June 2025. Such delays are detrimental to the expeditious administration of justice. They impede comprehensive assessment of offender risk and needs and hinder robust defence preparation.  \n\nThese procedural impediments, well-documented both anecdotally and in official reports, remain a source of systemic concern within the criminal justice community. The court trusts that continued reforms are pursued with vigour to minimise recurrence.  \n\nThe Legal and Sentencing Framework  \nSection 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. Shoplifting is a category of theft often treated lightly by the public but nonetheless is taken seriously by the courts, especially where offending is persistent, planned, or causes demonstrable harm beyond immediate financial loss.  \n\nThe Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences draws attention to relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. Aggravators include, inter alia, the persistence of offending behavior, targeting of vulnerable victims or premises, use of deception or manipulation, and failure to demonstrate remorse. Mitigating factors may include early guilty pleas, genuine remorse, and demonstrable attempts to make reparation or undergo rehabilitation.  \n\nSeveral authoritative appellate decisions provide further context. In R v. Paterson [2019] EWCA Crim 2047, the Court emphasised that repetitive shoplifting, despite warnings and diversionary measures, evidences a conscious disregard for statutory prohibitions and community norms. That case involved a defendant who had been convicted of shoplifting twenty-six times over five years, with the Court upholding a community order with a significant unpaid work requirement as necessary deterrent.  \n\nSimilarly, in R v. Marshall [2022] EWCA Crim 1318, the court considered the intersection of mental health and acquisitive crime. Although the defendant suffered from a diagnosed personality disorder, repeated breaches of prohibitory orders led the Court to conclude that community sentences with mental health intervention components were appropriate, rather than immediate custody. These cases serve to remind that sentencing must be calibrated to individual circumstances and the overarching aim of protecting the public while encouraging rehabilitation.  \n\nHistorical Reporting and Victim Liaison  \nThe court has received several written victim personal statements from affected retailers, coordinated through the Eastchester Retail Crime Forum and the local Neighbourhood Policing Team. These statements convey the material and psychological toll on staff, including increased anxiety, reduced morale, and changes in operational practices such as the fortification of premises and altered staff rotas to mitigate repeat offences.  \n\nThe Retail Crime Forum, operating under the auspices of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership, continues to play an important role in information-sharing and support for victimised businesses. The court commends their diligent efforts, despite the acknowledged pressures of limited funding and personnel shortages. Such partnerships represent a critical mechanism for frontline crime reduction and victim engagement.  \n\nIt is further noted that liaison with social services and housing agencies confirmed your unsettled living circumstances. You were residing in temporary accommodation provided via Eastchester City Council’s housing support unit during much of the period under consideration. The volatility inherent in such arrangements is well-known to the court and the Probation Service, often correlating with increased vulnerability and offending risk.  \n\nUnrelated Administrative and Operational Observations  \nThe court takes this opportunity to remark on the recent refurbishment of Court 6, where these proceedings have transpired. The enhanced accessibility features and upgraded digital recording systems mark a welcome improvement to the trial environment, aimed at facilitating clearer communication and more efficient case management.  \n\nRegrettably, the interpreter services scheduled for the day of the plea hearing experienced last-minute shortages, causing a delay of over forty-five minutes. Such disruptions, while infrequent, nevertheless introduce avoidable anxiety and inconvenience for all parties and speak to continuing recruitment challenges at a national level.  \n\nThe Probation Service continues to grapple with caseload pressures, notably impacting timely report preparation and offender supervision. The present case illustrates this strain, with the pre-sentence report commissioning delayed until after the guilty plea owing to competing priorities across Eastchester’s probation teams.  \n\nIn considering the procedural backdrop, it is worth noting the cooperation extended by Ms Sandra Latham, your assigned supervising officer, whose detailed notes and engagement with local support charities provide a valuable perspective on your circumstances. Her letter submitted to the court is a thoughtful document highlighting both your difficulties and instances of positive engagement.  \n\nThe facts of the case are as follows:  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\nThe investigation leading to your arrest on 2 March 2025 was initiated following complaints received by the Eastchester Police Retail Unit, alerting them to a series of suspected thefts from multiple pharmacies and convenience stores. This triggered a coordinated operation involving mobile patrol units, undercover surveillance, and analysis of CCTV footage from various retail outlets over a 10-week period.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  \n\nThe modus operandi identified was consistent: entering premises during busy periods, using a standard-issue reusable bag to conceal items, and often conducting mock phone conversations to deflect suspicion. In addition, on two verified occasions, you were recorded removing security tags without consent, in what can only be described as a premeditated endeavour to evade detection.  \n\nSeveral aspects of your conduct distinguish these offences from spontaneous or opportunistic shoplifting. The repeat nature of the offences, the selection of high-demand goods, and awareness of store layouts indicate planning and a degree of sophistication.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  \n\nWhile no physical confrontation or threats were recorded, evidence from victim impact statements indicates a palpable sense of unease among store employees, some of whom reported feelings of stress and apprehension when working alone due to your repeated visits.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nYou have four prior convictions for theft-related offences, all shoplifting, spanning a period of five years. The most recent was a conditional discharge imposed by magistrates in June 2023. It bears noting that despite formal warnings and engagement offers by community liaison officers, the pattern of offending persisted.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\nOn several occasions, you declined referred support to begin debt counselling or addiction services. The present case exhibits the unfortunate reality that the existence of support pathways does not guarantee uptake, and some defendants persist in declining potentially helpful interventions.  \n\nThe case law on refusal of rehabilitation options is instructive. In R v. Nolan [2023] EWCA Crim 828, the Court of Appeal emphasised the impact of non-engagement on custody threshold analysis, affirming that wilful refusal to avail oneself of available services can justify a more stringent sentence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  \n\nA psychiatric report authored by Dr Fiona Merriman, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was obtained pursuant to the court’s direction. Her assessment, dated 10 August 2025, concludes that you do not meet criteria for major mental illness but presents with elements suggestive of mild to moderate depressive symptoms exacerbated by financial and housing instability. Dr Merriman notes impulsivity traits and some degree of emotional dysregulation, but no indication of psychosis or cognitive impairment.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  \n\nAdditionally, the pre-sentence report submitted by the Probation Service highlights medium risk of reoffending and medium likelihood of harm, whilst recommending engagement with structured cognitive-behavioural programmes targeting impulsivity and financial management skills. The report also advocates for housing stability initiatives as a likely factor in reducing reoffending risk.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  \n\nTurning now to the sentencing considerations, it must be emphasised that your offending has had a tangible impact beyond mere loss of stock. There have been consequences for victims in the form of psychological distress and diminished workplace safety perceptions. This aligns with established principles that sentencing must reflect harm in the broad sense, including emotional and community effects.  \n\nWhile your guilty plea is late in timing, it is nevertheless accepted and will attract some, though limited, reduction in sentence. The authorities and the court have long expressed concern about tactical delay in pleas, which tend to place strain on witness preparation and court time.  \n\nThe court is cognisant of the broader difficulties faced by the defendant — including precarious accommodation and unemployment — but remembers the observation made in R v. Crane [2015] EWCA Crim 902, that social and economic hardship do not exempt citizens from accountability where offending is concerned.  \n\nIn light of the above, I have requested a full pre-sentence report to assist in determining the most appropriate outcome, balancing the aims of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. It is expected that this report will canvass the viability of community-based orders incorporating rehabilitation activity, unpaid work, and monitoring. Where risk factors warrant, consideration should be given to a custodial term of appropriate length with a rehabilitation requirement attached, as permitted under the Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks have been prepared and delivered on 17 September 2025 in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Eastchester. A formal transcript has been recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You, Mr H, are hereby reminded of your right to appeal this sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this instance. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT EASTCHESTER  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. E2025/14091  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge K. R.
