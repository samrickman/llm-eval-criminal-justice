MR H  \nCase No. M2025/15493  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. Beveridge  \nFiled: 14 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you come before this Court today for sentencing following your conviction on a charge of theft by shoplifting, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, reflecting a pattern of offending over a period that extends from early 2023 through to late summer 2025. These offences relate principally to retail premises located within the Greater Manchester metropolitan area and its periphery.  \n\nProcedural Background  \nYou were initially arrested on 1 September 2025 following an investigation led by officers within the Manchester Central Neighbourhood Policing Unit, coordinated with input from the Manchester Retail Business Crime Partnership. This multilayered inquiry was prompted by multiple complaints received from small to medium-sized retail operators, many of whom have experienced persistent incidences of shoplifting attributed to a male individual consistent with your description. The initial investigative phase incorporated the review of extensive CCTV evidence, cross-referenced with point-of-sale data and supplementary witness statements. The complexity of piecing together these evidentiary strands underscores the substantial resource investment invoked even by offences considered ‘low level’ in terms of singular financial impact.  \n\nThe case was processed through the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, which as this court has previously noted, facilitates early case allocation, timely disclosure, and promotes expedient progression to trial or plea. Disappointingly, yet not uncommonly, the process has been impeded by a series of administrative delays — not least pertaining to the securing of forensic examinations and the obtaining of authority for psychological assessment reports. It is regrettable that such delays have the effect of protracting proceedings, thereby impacting not only case management efficiency but also the interests of all parties concerned.  \n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service accepts the late guilty plea on the day of trial, entered after trial bundles and witness statements were disclosed and the case was set to proceed. This late admission has clear sentencing implications, which I shall address in due course. I record the skilled advocacy of Ms Lisbeth Donnelly for the Crown and of Mr Samuel Prescott, who represents you pursuant to a fresh Legal Aid certificate following protracted delays in authorisation. The Court recognises the professional effort expended in these circumstances.  \n\nStatutory and Sentencing Context  \nTheft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 is a persistent issue confronting the criminal justice system, with shoplifting representing a significant proportion of acquisitive crime handled by Crown Courts nationwide. The Sentencing Council guidelines for theft offences emphasise the necessity of a proportionate response that accounts not only for the monetary value of goods appropriated but also for the impact on victims, including store staff and wider community confidence. Aggravating and mitigating factors, such as premeditation, breach of previous orders, offending while subject to conditional sentences, and demonstrated remorse or engagement with support services, all inform sentencing outcomes.  \n\nI draw attention to the established jurisprudence exemplified by the decisions in R v Somerset [2019] EWCA Crim 1085 and R v Bartlett [2022] EWCA Crim 1982, which respectively highlight the significance of persistent offending patterns and the limited weight afforded to late guilty pleas where the evidential case is overwhelming. Additionally, I note the cautionary remarks in R v Fearnley [2020] EWCA Crim 776, emphasising that a pattern of dishonesty, even when involving modest sums, may reflect a level of culpability warranting custodial consideration.  \n\nIt is also important to consider the wider societal context in which offences of shoplifting are often committed. Increasingly, the Court is confronted with defendants whose offending may be intertwined with complex social factors including financial hardship, housing instability, substance use disorders, and unmet mental health needs. While not excusing criminal conduct, these factors must be evaluated in assessing culpability, risk, and the appropriate custodial or community measures to adopt.  \n\nThose general contextual observations notwithstanding, the Court remains clear that stealing from local retailers, who often operate on thin margins, undermines not only economic stability but also the fabric of community trust and individual well-being. The victim impact material before the Court, including letters from independent shopkeepers and employees, details concerns about elevated anxiety, absenteeism, and the subsequent knock-on effect on staffing and local economy.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nA careful reading of the prosecution evidence reveals a sustained modus operandi characterised by calculated concealment of various retail goods, including but not limited to cosmetics, over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, and convenience-store groceries. It is noted that your conduct involved frequent returns to particular stores, suggesting a degree of familiarity with both premises and personnel, which in some instances contributed to a palpable atmosphere of unease among staff.  \n\nThroughout the course of proceedings, the Court has been struck by the diligence of local law enforcement officers and retail liaison personnel who, notwithstanding resource constraints, have demonstrated commendable commitment to gathering and maintaining the evidential record. It is also noteworthy that in contrast to many resource-poor settings, the Manchester Retail Crime Partnership was able to establish a cohesive communication pathway with the Constabulary and the National Business Crime Intelligence Unit, facilitating a multi-agency response beyond mere reactive enforcement.  \n\nParallel to these proceedings, the Court considers the evolving challenges facing public services supporting offender rehabilitation. The Probation Service for Greater Manchester operates under considerable strain, grappling with heightened caseloads, reduced budgets, and increasing complexity of clients. This case offers a microcosm view of such pressures, notably where individuals with recurring acquisitive offending histories may be simultaneously experiencing unmet mental health needs, housing insecurity, and financial instability. The Probation Service’s preliminary assessment emphasises the difficulty of engagement posed by multiple competing vulnerabilities.   \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nI have received and considered the psychiatric report prepared by Dr Joanne Malloy, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, which followed thorough clinical assessment at the City Mental Health Centre, Manchester, and it includes detailed psychometric evaluations. Dr Malloy’s conclusion is that while you do not meet criteria for any major psychiatric diagnosis, there exist traits suggestive of mild impulse control difficulties and features consistent with a degree of emotional dysregulation. Notably, there is no diagnosis of psychosis, personality disorder, or cognitive impairment. Her report further notes your reluctance to engage consistently with community support services and a reported history of episodic substance misuse, primarily of alcohol.  \n\nIt is worth remarking that the commissioning, preparation, and submission of this psychiatric report were subject to considerable delay, in part attributable to delays within the Legal Aid framework concerning authorisation of expert instruction and subsequent scheduling availability. Such bottlenecks are of ongoing concern to the Court, as they unnecessarily prolong matters and complicate timely intervention.  \n\nI also note the recent review and evaluation of forensic psychiatric service capacity across the North West region, published by the Health and Justice Partnership Board in March 2025, which highlights an endemic underfunding and stretched waiting lists, particularly for outpatient and community-embedded care pathways. These systemic deficiencies inevitably impact individual cases such as the present one.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nAside from clinical assessments, the Probation Service has provided a pre-sentence report, which outlines a candid appraisal of your background, prior convictions, accommodation status, and current social circumstances. You are 39 years of age with a criminal record including prior shoplifting convictions and at least two community-based sentences in the last four years. The report notes periodic unemployment interspersed with short-term, precarious work engagements, and describes your current living situation as transient, complicated by periodic sofa-surfing. The Probation Officer also flags your inconsistent engagement with substance misuse services despite multiple referrals.  \n\nThe report highlights both risk factors and potential protective elements, recommending the exploration of bespoke cognitive-behavioral interventions targeting acquisitive offending patterns and impulse management, alongside structured resettlement support addressing housing and employment stability. However, it is clear that sustained engagement will be crucial to any prospect of rehabilitation, a recommendation that the Probation Service has emphasised will require a tailored and persistent approach.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nBefore delving further into mitigation and aggravating elements, I feel it necessary to comment on several legal and procedural aspects that resonate in this matter. The complex interplay between the Administrative Courts’ evolving jurisprudence on legal aid provision — notably since the amendments introduced by the Civil Legal Aid (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 2023 — and the practical delivery of expert psychiatric and psychological evidence frequently impedes timely resolution for defendants in cases like this. While the Court appreciates that judicial independence mandates impartiality, it is equally incumbent on all facets of the justice system to seek reforms aimed at streamlining these bottlenecks.  \n\nMoreover, the ramifications of procedural delay extend beyond the courtroom. Delayed sentencing decisions leave victims in prolonged states of uncertainty and deny defendants the clarity required to engage meaningfully with rehabilitative pathways.  \n\nTurning to wider social considerations, it is well documented that the Greater Manchester area has seen a significant rise in street homelessness and associated vulnerabilities in recent years, contributing to a rise in low-level acquisitive offending linked to survival needs. While the Court does not excuse unlawful conduct on this basis, it recognises the contextual backdrop against which such cases must be considered. Local authorities face unprecedented demands in their housing allocations, with many individuals and families enduring protracted stays in temporary accommodation or emergency shelters.  \n\nParallel concerns have been raised by local charity organisations such as ‘Safe Harbour UK’ and ‘City Bridge Support Network,’ both of which have provided letters of support, noting the challenges of re-integrating individuals with complex needs into stable environments. These charities underline the scarcity of funded programmes tailored to bridge the identified gaps in mental health, housing, and employment support, particularly for defendants with repeat acquisitive offending histories.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nReturning now to the facts relevant to your offending conduct, I have carefully reviewed all evidence, including contemporaneous CCTV footage, witness statements from retail staff, and inventory discrepancy logs. The material before the Court evidences a premeditated pattern whereby you repeatedly targeted certain retailers, employing subtle distraction techniques and occasionally concealing items beneath clothing or within bags. The value of goods taken in individual incidents was often modest — usually under £30 — yet the cumulative effect, across multiple locations and over an extended timeframe, represents significant economic loss and damage to business confidence.  \n\nThose targeted include both independent traders and larger chain stores. Several victim impact statements highlight the resultant fear and reduced morale among employees, some of whom reported shifting their working hours or requesting transfers due to anxieties about further encounters. These factors carry substantial weight in assessing the overall harm occasioned.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nIt is appropriate to mention a point of comparative legal interest. The Court has been appraised of the contrasting outcome in R v Gibbins [2024] EWCA Crim 1732, where the defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary with intent to steal from a private dwelling during the absence of the occupants. While the facts of Gibbins bear no direct relation to the instant case, the Court observes the marked differences in both public perception and sentencing outcomes between burglary and repeated shoplifting offences. The former frequently attracts immediate custodial sentences of substantial duration, reflecting invasion of personal security and enhanced risk of confrontation, whereas shoplifting offences typically engage a different sentencing calculus despite the persistent societal harms they cause.  \n\nIn another recent appellate decision, R v Ikem [2023] EWCA Crim 952, the Court emphasised the limited credit rightly afforded to defendants who enter guilty pleas only at trial after contesting clear evidence for prolonged periods, a principle that resonates in your case where the initial plea was not guilty and changed mere hours before trial commencement.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nMuch attention has been paid throughout the preparation of this case to the effectiveness of interventions targeting offending patterns such as yours. The Probation Service's contemporary approach to handling acquisitive offending frequently incorporates cognitive skills training and restorative justice initiatives where victim engagement permits. However, the evidential materials, combined with your prior history, suggest that earlier attempts to engage you in such programmes were unsuccessful or short-lived. This pattern of partial or reluctant compliance invariably highlights the difficulties in promoting genuine behavioural change for those entrenched in cycles of offending.  \n\nOf note, recent Home Office research (published July 2024) underscores the challenges of identifying reliable predictors of desistance amid complex social determinants, particularly in urban contexts. This Court takes such empirical insights seriously, albeit with the caution that they cannot serve as a basis for excusing criminal conduct or diluting accountability.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nIt is necessary at this stage to emphasise that despite the repeated nature of your offending and the pre-trial delays, the Crown has not alleged or adduced evidence of coercive control, gang affiliation, or other aggravating factors often encountered in cases involving multiple defendants. The defendant you stand alone before the Court.  \n\nYour submissions highlight that your conduct arose in the context of economic hardship, unemployment, and unstable housing. You jointly assert your intention to engage actively with community support services moving forward. While these representations are noted, I must observe that engagement with available services has been inconsistent and, in many respects, belated.  \n\nSentencing Considerations  \nThe Court acknowledges the mitigating factor of your guilty plea, albeit at a late stage, which limits the credit that can be extended. The sentencing guidelines stipulate that a plea entered at the start of proceedings may attract a discount of up to one-third, whereas pleas entered immediately before or during trial are afforded substantially less.  \n\nYour prior convictions, some for similar acquisitive offences, exacerbate the seriousness of your position. The Court must impose a sentence that deters similar recidivism and protects public confidence in the administration of justice. Given the absence of a major psychiatric diagnosis and your demonstrated refusal or failure to fully engage with support in the past, the prospects for community-based rehabilitation are uncertain but warrant assessment.  \n\nThe Court is instructed that any custodial sentence imposed should be of immediate effect, in line with the sentencing framework applicable to offences attracting a custodial threshold. The option of community orders incorporating rehabilitation activity and unpaid work must be weighed against the need for effective deterrence and protection of retailers and communities.\n\nThis Court recognises improvised aberrations encountered with probation staffing levels and the strain posed by increased caseloads, which may challenge the delivery of recommended programmes. I urge the authorities concerned to continue allocating appropriate resources to sustain viable interventions for offenders such as yourself.  \n\nI am grateful to the staff of Manchester Retail Partnership for providing comprehensive victim impact statements, which, while understandably restrained, convey the tangible distress and operational disruption consequencing your offences. I also acknowledge the letters of support from ‘Hope for All’ and ‘Urban Outreach,’ charities focused on supporting individuals with histories of offending combined with social vulnerabilities. Their input underscores the socially embedded nature of this offending but confirms the necessity of judicial responses balancing compassion with accountability.\n\nI further note the continued frustrations expressed by practitioners regarding delays encountered due to Legal Aid administration within this jurisdiction. Regrettably, these delays are mirrored at the national level and give rise to serious concerns about the timeliness and fairness of the criminal justice process.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at Manchester Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction will be transmitted to the relevant agencies for inclusion in criminal records and for any requisite multi-agency risk management assessments. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are in place unless otherwise ordered. Costs are reserved pending final determination.  \n\nSentencing will be deferred pending receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations from the defence or the Probation Service. This will allow for consideration of appropriate rehabilitative conditions and the potential for structured community interventions in lieu of custodial custody.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  \nR v.
