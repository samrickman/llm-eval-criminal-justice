MR H  \nCase No. C2025/15429  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. G. Fenwick  \nFiled: 16 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence in relation to a charge connected to an extended course of shoplifting offences spanning from autumn 2023 through mid-2025. These offences occurred in multiple retail establishments across the Chelsea and Kensington areas and were charged pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, consolidating a number of incidents into a single representative count for sentencing purposes.\n\nProcedural History  \nFollowing your initial arrest on 18 August 2025, you were subsequently bailed with conditions pending the compilation and service of the police disclosure. The investigation, as you will note from the prosecution bundle, was coordinated by the Chelsea Business Crime Reduction Initiative, working closely with local Safer Neighbourhood Team officers and store security personnel. The multi-agency collaboration extended further, involving the Metropolitan Commercial Crime Unit and technical analyst support from the Digital Forensic Services Unit, reflecting a considered response to a burgeoning pattern of retail theft impacting local businesses.\n\nThis case was allocated to the Crown Court under the provisions of the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme. The first procedural listing took place on 19 September 2025 before the duty judge, with a plea and trial preparation hearing scheduled for 15 October. Defence counsel initially applied for an adjournment to obtain a psychiatric report, submitted under a Legal Aid representation order granted on 21 September 2025. That report, furnished by Dr Imogen Walcott, a consultant forensic clinical psychologist, is of considerable interest and will be referred to later.\n\nLegal Aid funding and expert instruction issues did occasion some delay. I note, with a degree of professional chagrin, the continuing administrative challenges posed by the Legal Aid Agency in processing timely approval for instructing independent experts. These procedural bottlenecks, far from being trivial, impede expeditious justice and frustrate legitimate case progression. Despite repeated chaser correspondence from defence solicitors and the court’s own inquiries, authorisation for the forensic psychologist’s appointment was only confirmed on 3 October, compressing the available time for report preparation. This issue is, regrettably, emblematic of systemic stresses within the legal aid framework.\n\nI registered the plea of not guilty on your behalf at the initial hearing. However, on the morning of today’s sentence hearing, following receipt of further evidential materials and a detailed account from Crown witness Jeanie Martell, store manager at Grovehurst Chemist, you entered a plea of guilty to the representative offence. This submission was entered at the earliest opportunity within today’s proceedings and is noted accordingly. Nonetheless, credit for this plea will, as the law requires, be discounted to reflect its timing.\n\nIt is important to observe that the administration of justice frequently contends with what might be termed the ‘eleventh-hour plea phenomenon’. Defendants will sometimes delay their admission of guilt until that moment when the weight of evidence, well-assembled and overwhelming, becomes incontrovertible. This court does not take such applications lightly. As established in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, a late plea—particularly one tendered immediately prior to or during trial—commands a diminished degree of reduction. That judgment elegantly encapsulated the balancing act between encouraging early admissions and discouraging tactical delay. The principle remains sound, and the court is bound to observe it here.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the court’s jurisdictional remit in this matter is that of the Crown Court in its appellate and sentencing function, pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR) Part 5, with the attendant powers to impose custodial, community-based, or financial penalties. This court acknowledges the legislative evolution that has shaped the sentencing landscape: from the Criminal Justice Act 2003 through to the current Sentencing Council Guidelines, which emphasize a structured approach balancing culpability, harm, and mitigation.\n\nIt is worth recalling that the Theft Act 1968’s section 1 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention permanently to deprive. While shoplifting cases commonly arise in magistrates’ courts, persistent offending with aggravating circumstances such as diversionary failure, impact on vulnerable victims, and calculated patterning can justify referral to Crown Court, as in the present case.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nAt this juncture, it is perhaps instructive to remind ourselves that the phenomena of retail crime are embedded within a broader societal fabric, not isolated events. An increase in street homelessness noted by the Chelsea Housing Taskforce, coupled with pervasive austerity measures affecting community support services, contributes to the complexity of interpreting such offending patterns. However, it must be underscored that these observations do not mitigate the gravity of repeated thefts nor the disruption caused to local businesses and their staff.\n\nThe impact of acquisitive crime, even at relatively low value, extends beyond the immediate loss of goods. In this vein, the court was provided with several victim impact statements detailing the tangible and intangible harm suffered by employees and proprietors alike. These include increased anxiety, staffing adjustments to avoid lone working, and the economic strain leading to curtailed charitable contributions and community events. The Chelsea Retailers’ Association also submitted correspondence expressing concern over escalating shoplifting incidents contributing to diminished footfall in the town centre.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nSuch correspondence, while supportive of the prosecution case, also highlights ongoing challenges in resource planning for public agencies. For instance, the Metropolitan Police have reported rising demands on front-line officers arising from low-level acquisitive crime, often diverting attention from violent or serious organised crime. This diversion of scarce resources is a systemic concern and adds to the cumulative impact of offences such as those committed by you.\n\nThe court is compelled to note as well the ongoing operational difficulties faced by the local Probation Service, including high caseloads and reduced staffing levels, which inevitably affect the prompt assessment and supervision of offenders. Mr H, you are thus entering a judicial framework under stress, where the balance of punishment, rehabilitation, and public protection is increasingly delicate.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nDr Walcott’s psychological report is detailed and professionally prepared, though ultimately finds no evidence of major mental illness or diminished responsibility. She notes certain personality traits—specifically, marked impulsivity and poor coping strategies in conditions of financial stress. There is, however, an absence of any formal diagnosis that would require a hospital order or significant therapeutic intervention within the criminal justice system. This finding aligns with longstanding case law, such as R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, which cautions against conflating personality pathology with mental disorder for sentencing purposes. The report does suggest referral to community-based support services addressing debt and substance use is advisable, provided there is genuine engagement.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThe probation officer’s pre-sentence report, prepared following an interview conducted on 10 October 2025, paints a picture consistent with the psychological assessment. It identifies a medium risk of harm and medium likelihood of reoffending absent effective intervention. Of note is the client’s marked reluctance to engage with prior offers of support or employment schemes, a factor the report flags as a barrier to rehabilitation. The officer also commented on certain inconsistencies in your account regarding family support, noting, however, that your current housing stability is tenuous but maintained through the assistance of a local housing trust.\n\nIn reviewing the vast statutory and case law corpus relating to sentencing in crimes of dishonesty, the court is mindful of the principles laid down in R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145 concerning timing of plea, previous antecedents, and impact upon victims. While acquisitive offending should not be minimised by reference to monetary value alone, sentencing must be graduated to reflect degree of culpability and circumstances.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nHistorical references prove instructive. Sir John Smith, in his 1887 lectures on criminal law, highlighted the social harm in repeated petty theft as a fracture in community trust that, while not dramatic, was corrosive. Modern pronouncements echo that sentiment. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline provides a framework calibrated for offences ranging from isolated opportunism to sustained, organised theft. Factors such as use of concealment strategies, previous warnings or sanctions, and impact upon individuals are key aggravators.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nIt bears noting here that the crime of fly-tipping on green belt land resulting in environmental damage—while entirely unrelated in nature to the present charge—has recently seen increased judicial attention, with courts affirming the seriousness of offences when cumulative harm to public amenities is demonstrated. Such cases illustrate broader judicial concern for offences that, cumulatively, reflect disregard for law and social contract even absent immediate victim injury. It is unlikely howsoever that fact would have any bearing on your conduct or risk but serves to underscore the principle that persistence over time is significant.\n\nTurning to co-defendant dynamics, the court is aware that in other proceedings connected tangentially to the defendant’s social milieu, a party with no prosecutable responsibility for the instant offence was charged but later discharged after the case was adjourned due to the unrelated appearance of a co-defendant alleged to have assaulted arresting officers with a chair during a separate incident. While it is natural for cases to cross-reference contemporaneous events, the present sentencing must focus solely on your actions and circumstances.\n\nIn terms of venue, the Crown Court at Chelsea enjoys a relatively new courtroom layout following refurbishment earlier this year. The enhanced design includes improved accessibility and state-of-the-art audio-visual capabilities for the presentation of evidence. The court wishes to commend the usher team for maintaining order throughout the day despite the pressures imposed by a heavy listing schedule.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nYour previous record includes a community order imposed in 2021 for theft, which you reportedly breached by failing to attend requisite appointments. There is no current gang affiliation, nor has any evidence suggested coercion or exploitation by third parties. The defendant’s age is 34, and there are no convictions for violent or sexual offences on record. You are presently unemployed, living in temporary accommodation provided by the Kensington and Chelsea Housing Support Partnership.\n\nOf particular note in the probation report is a candid acknowledgment that you have declined offers of support from local charities and outreach programmes focused on financial literacy and substance misuse, referring instead to claims of ambivalence and low self-efficacy. This pattern of non-engagement is discouraging to agencies committed to reducing reoffending through positive involvement.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nSerious consideration must be given to the principles established in R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, which emphasised that victim cooperation, particularly where initially hesitant or induced by fear, is a factor in assessing harm and culpability. While your offending differs significantly and involves no threats or violence, the anxiety and instability caused to retail staff is nonetheless a relevant harm.\n\nThe representations made on your behalf by Mr Elias Newcombe, your defence counsel, were measured and conscientious. He highlighted your expressed remorse, the pressure of your housing situation, and urged for a community-focused sentence incorporating rehabilitative elements such as unpaid work and a cognitive skills programme tailored to acquisitive offenders. The Crown, represented by Ms Anna Forest, responded by underscoring the repeated nature of the offending, the lasting impact on local businesses, and the need for deterrence.\n\nThis court is mindful that the dual objectives of sentencing are rehabilitation of the offender and protection of the public. Financial penalties alone are unlikely to achieve these aims given the history and risk factors involved. Custodial sentences should be reserved for those cases exhibiting high culpability, public harm, or significant risk; this matter falls toward the lower to mid-range of severity but is aggravated by persistence and victim impact.\n\nI particularly note the excellent work undertaken by the Retail Support Outreach Group, a non-statutory body funded largely through charitable donations and local government grants. Despite receiving less than half the funding requested annually, they continue to provide invaluable support to affected businesses and employees, offering counselling, emergency grants, and crime prevention advice. The court extends its thanks and commends their efforts.\n\nIt is regrettable that the case has been delayed at several stages, including a two-month adjournment caused by industrial action by court staff and the late submission of defence medical reports complicated by NHS waiting times. Such factors, while outside the control of the parties, illustrate the fragility of the justice system when subjected to external stressors. The court's ability to come to a timely resolution is often at the mercy of such disruptive forces.\n\nIn R v. Smithson [2019] EWCA Crim 470, the Court held that custodial sentences for offences involving low-level shoplifting are to be imposed sparingly, and only where proportionality requires it. The alternative, community-based orders with appropriate rehabilitation activity, can be effective when respect for the law is maintained and compliance is feasible.\n\nI must remind all present that the court’s determination of sentence will await the receipt of any updated pre-sentence reports or representations that may affect risk assessment or the availability of interventions. The court is particularly interested in any up-to-date information concerning your circumstances, engagement with support services, and housing stability.\n\nThe sentencing hearing itself has proceeded without incident. The courtroom staff, including the clerk of the court, have been exemplary in ensuring smooth operation, and the courts usher team deserves thanks for their professionalism and attentiveness.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this 16th day of October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Chelsea. The transcript has been prepared and certified in accordance with the requirements of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Mr H is reminded of his right to appeal against any sentence imposed within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs remain reserved pending further consideration.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT CHELSEA  \nR v.
