Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/14862  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. F. MORLAND  \nFiled: 13 November 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced for offences of theft from retail premises, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge concerns repeated shoplifting carried out over a protracted period spanning from approximately late 2023 through to the spring of this year, with incidents occurring at various commercial establishments within the Brighton and Hove area and adjacent retail zones.\n\nProcedural History and Case Management  \nYou were arrested on 5 May 2025 following an extended enquiry conducted under the auspices of the Sussex Retail Crime Reduction Taskforce. This multi-agency initiative, incorporating uniformed officers, plain clothes investigators, and intelligence analysts, was formed with the explicit aim of addressing a discernible increase in repeat shoplifting offences affecting small to medium-sized retailers. Intelligence reports indicated a pattern involving a lone male fitting your description repeatedly entering shops to remove goods without payment, leading to accumulating losses and staff distress.  \nIt is appropriate here to acknowledge that this investigation involved a complex collation of disparate pieces of evidence, including CCTV recordings from several disparate locations, witness statements, and a review of regional trading patterns. The collation process itself reflects the increasing bureaucratic demands placed upon law enforcement agencies in the contemporary landscape. The record-keeping requirements, not limited to traditional paperwork but expanded to digital databases, video cataloguing, and interdepartmental communication protocols, underscore the resource-intensive nature of even relatively low-value theft cases.  \nWithin this framework, the case was allocated to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol designed to promote early identification of issues, more efficient case progression, and, ideally, swift resolution for the complainants and the defendant alike. The initial listing took place on 20 May 2025. Subsequent case management hearings were held on 24 June and 12 August, during which directions were given and adjustments made to accommodate expert reports and new disclosure. These occasions highlighted the procedural intricacies inherent in coordinating legal aid permissions and ensuring compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules.  \nThe court notes, with some degree of exasperation, that applications for legal aid funding to permit instruction of a forensic psychiatrist were subject to repeated adjournments. The original request dated 18 June was delayed pending administrative review, with substantive approval only conveyed in early August, thereby elongating the preparatory timeline and necessitating a short adjournment of the sentencing hearing. This pattern is regrettably not unique; a consistent theme in this court’s dealings has been the persistent difficulty practitioners face in securing timely and adequate expert input due to systemic constraints within the Legal Aid Agency. Such delays are more than administrative inconveniences—they impose adverse consequences on case progression, exacerbate uncertainty, and cloud prospects for rehabilitation planning.  \nDuring the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 26 August, you initially entered a not guilty plea, electing to challenge the Crown’s case despite the surveillance evidence presented. It was not until the morning of the final trial listing on 1 October that you indicated an intention to plead guilty. The Crown advises that this resulted in a plea discount commensurate with the timing, reflecting the principles articulated in R v. Lawson [2019] EWCA Crim 541 and further refined in R v. Stewart [2023] EWCA Crim 1872. The court references the general principle that any reduction in sentence due to an eventual guilty plea is closely correlated to its timing; a late plea, such as this, just prior to trial, typically attracts significantly reduced mitigation.  \nThis development—while within your rights—is regrettable. The cost in officer time, witness availability, and court scheduling is not trivial. Victims and retail staff have had to endure prolonged uncertainty, with the attendant stress and disruption this causes. The Crown’s outlines and submissions on this point have been clear and cogent.  \nNotably, evidence was provided that the files compiled for the case ran to over 1,200 pages once all disclosures, statements, and exhibits were assembled. This evidences the disproportionate administrative burden even relatively modest offence cases carry.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe Facts and Impact on Retail Environments  \nYour offending profile, as established by the material before this court, indicates a calculated and repeated course of shoplifting, targeted across multiple premises, including convenience stores, pharmacy outlets, and discount retailers. The items appropriated were frequently small in individual value, yet cumulatively represented a significant loss to businesses already under strain from logistical disruptions and wider economic pressures.  \nIt cannot be overstated that retail theft, while sometimes viewed socially as a victimless offence or one of low seriousness, has very tangible consequences. Shop staff report that such persistent theft necessitates an increase in security measures which can ripple through store operations, including increased staffing costs, reduced hours, and in some cases relocation or closure. Many such businesses operate on tight margins, and the knock-on effect of lost stock and disruption is substantial. The court also notes that repeated shoplifting incidents contribute to a broader climate of insecurity and disquiet within the local community, potentially diminishing public confidence.  \nFurther to this, the court has received written representations from the Sussex Retail Alliance, emphasizing the strain placed on independent retailers who frequently fall outside the ambit of corporate security investment. Their submissions are measured and detailed, underscoring the compounding economic and psychological harm caused by ongoing theft incidents.  \nThe national picture reflects this local experience. Data published by the Association of Convenience Stores shows that in 2024, retail crime levels increased by 8.4% relative to the previous year, with a particular uptick in shoplifting offences targeting health and beauty products—items reportedly taken in your case. The Retail Crime Index also indicates that proactive responses at local policing level, while improving, face persistent resource challenges. Such context, while not determinative of individual culpability, frames the seriousness with which the court must approach the matter.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe court further acknowledges that this offence takes place against a broader backdrop of changes in public attitudes to retail security and policing. There is a well-documented tension between increasing security measures—which, though often necessary, may affect public access and privacy—and the imperative to maintain open and welcoming retail environments. It is incumbent upon everyone to recognise their role in sustaining these environments, and theft fundamentally undermines the social compact that supports them.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe Defendant’s Personal Circumstances and Expert Assessments  \nTurning to your personal circumstances, the court has before it a psychiatric evaluation prepared by Dr Evelyn Moreno, consultant forensic psychiatrist, and a probation report compiled by Ms Keisha Abbott. Both provide valuable insights into factors relevant to sentencing, including risk of reoffending and potential for rehabilitation.  \nDr Moreno's report—prepared following a comprehensive assessment in late September—provides that you display no evidence of a major psychiatric disorder but notes traits consistent with chronic impulsivity and moderate substance misuse, specifically alcohol dependency of a degree potentially influencing decision-making processes at times of offending. Dr Moreno is candid in her conclusion that while no illness as such is present to diminish responsibility, your difficulties with impulse control and substance use pose an elevated risk factor. The report recommends structured community treatment if viable, acknowledging that engagement with such services has been erratic in the recent past.  \nAn addendum by Dr Moreno references the challenges presented by local NHS mental health service waiting lists, noting that while adult addiction services have improved, capacity remains insufficient to address all need promptly. This contributes to a risk of relapse and sustained contact with the criminal justice system.  \nMs Abbott’s probation report, provided last month, details your long history of low-level theft offences and notes multiple failed attempts at diversionary schemes. It further highlights your unstable housing situation and sporadic employment history—weighing these factors alongside protective ones such as noted family support and expressed willingness to comply with court-imposed conditions. She underscores that your previous breach of community orders indicates a pattern of non-compliance that must be given due weight.  \nYour engagement with probation services prior to this prosecution has been described as “limited and inconsistent,” and attempts to refer you to vocational retraining programmes were not taken up. The report advocates a thorough and tailored rehabilitation package post-sentence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nBackground and Contextual Observations on Public Services and Systemic Pressures  \nIt is instructive to consider the wider pressures on public services that intersect with cases such as this. The Probation Service, under significant strain due to increased caseloads and staffing shortages nationwide, likewise suffers from reduced capacity to provide bespoke management and monitoring. Current National Probation Service publications warn of risks associated with overcrowded caseloads, particularly for clients presenting with complex needs—including those with substance misuse and impulse control challenges. This constellation of factors not only complicates effective offender management but also prolongs the cycle of offending and supervision lapses.  \nSimilarly, local housing services in Brighton continue to report acute shortages of affordable and stable accommodation, with pressure on temporary housing stock at crisis levels. It is therefore unsurprising that defendants such as yourself report precarious living conditions, which in turn can act as a compounding factor in criminal conduct. The relationship between housing insecurity and acquisitive crime is well explored in criminal justice research—but it remains no defence. Courts must balance understanding of social determinants with recognition of individual accountability.  \nOn a related front, the current climate for retail businesses is beset with challenges. Reports by the British Retail Consortium highlight increased losses due to theft, especially in independent outlets unable to afford advanced security systems. Despite coordinated efforts such as local Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRP), successes remain partial and fragmentary, often subverted by fluctuations in funding and personnel turnover. Frontline retail workers, many employed on zero-hours contracts or in part-time posts, bear considerable emotional burden, often experiencing elevated stress and anxiety linked to recurrent offending incidents.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe court is mindful, too, of repeated case law emphasising deterrence as a core principle in sentencing for theft offences. In R v. Kendricks [2022] EWCA Crim 1141, the Court of Appeal affirmed the necessity of sentences that convey unequivocal censure where organised or persistent thefts undermine community safety and economic stability. Similarly, the guidance issued by the Sentencing Council in 2023 stresses the need to balance proportionate punishment with opportunities for rehabilitation, in cases where underlying vulnerabilities may exist but are not determinative of culpability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nDiscussion of Related Case Law and Relevant Jurisprudence  \nWhile the primary charge is theft, it is impossible or unwise to consider this case in isolation from related jurisprudence, some of which involves more serious offending by co-defendants or other parties linked marginally in procedural terms. For instance, in R v. Lomax [2018] EWCA Crim 1328, the Court contended with issues surrounding group offending involving both acquisitive crimes and instances of criminal damage to private property. Although none of that conduct is attributable to you, the case illustrates the risk of escalation inherent in patterns of low-level offending left unchecked.  \nEqually instructive is R v. Faraday [2021] EWCA Crim 1979, concerning a defendant convicted for aggravated vehicle theft whose sentence was influenced by a prior history of multiple small-scale thefts, including shops and public transport fare evasion. The interplay between the offences demonstrated a pattern of escalating criminality, further relating to use of stolen property. While such facts are outside the present charge, they offer cautionary context on the dangers of recidivism.  \nThe Court also acknowledges the significant proliferation of co-defendants in recent regional cases—some of whom have faced charges ranging from affray following public disturbances, possession of bladed articles in school car parks, or environmental offences exemplified by fly-tipping on adjacent greenbelt land. None relate to you directly, but remain part of the larger constellation of acquisitive and public order crimes that challenge policing and judicial resources locally.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nVictim Impact and Community Concerns  \nThe court has before it statements from affected store managers and employees, attesting to the impact your actions have had on their personal wellbeing and operational confidence. These statements reflect not only financial loss but also anxiety, residual fear, and in some instances, increasing reluctance to work unsupervised or during later shifts. The economic and psychological toll cannot be overstated.  \nOne representative letter, from a community pharmacy facing persistent targeting, speaks eloquently of the erosion of trust and security: “Our staff feel scrutinised for suspicion of theft, yet the real threat comes from repeated offenders who take advantage of our goodwill and the limitations of current security measures.” These observations are echoed across several premises, some of which have had to introduce costly security upgrades or impose reduced opening hours.  \nThe court also recognises the work of local voluntary bodies such as the Brighton Retail Support Network, which provides frontline assistance to victims of retail crime, including advisory services and emotional support. Their submissions speak to the increasingly fraught atmosphere in which employees operate and the consequential demand on charity resources.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nConclusions and Sentencing Framework  \nThe offences before the court must be viewed as a sustained and systematic course of conduct, reflecting a high degree of planning and contingency. While there was no direct violence or threats, the impact on staff morale and business viability is serious. Your personal circumstances—though challenging—do not excuse the persistent nature of the offending, nor do they justify failure to engage meaningfully with available support mechanisms.  \nSentencing guidelines for theft offences emphasise proportionality, deterrence, and rehabilitation. The court will consider all relevant factors, including the late guilty plea, risk assessments, and the potential for structured community interventions.  \nI note the defence’s submissions advocating for non-custodial measures focussed on rehabilitation, enhanced supervision, and integrated support services. I equally acknowledge the Crown’s emphasis on the need for denunciation and public protection.  \nGiven the complexities identified—your background, offence pattern, victim impact, and available professional input—it is appropriate at this stage to receive a detailed pre-sentence report. I specifically request that the probation service consider all available rehabilitative options, including cognitive skills training, substance misuse treatment, and employment support pathways. The report should address risk, compliance likelihood, and suitability for community-based sanctions versus custodial disposals.  \nI will therefore adjourn for sentencing pending receipt of this report and any further representations.  \nThese remarks are issued this day, 13 November 2025, in Court 5 at Brighton Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is informed of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence, under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions provided by section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/14862  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. F.
