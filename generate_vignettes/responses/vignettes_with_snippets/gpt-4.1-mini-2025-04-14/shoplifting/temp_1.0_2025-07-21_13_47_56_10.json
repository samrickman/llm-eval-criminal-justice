MR H  \nCase No. T2025/12387  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. W. Callaghan  \nFiled: 18 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction arising from a series of theft offences from retail premises, contrary to the provisions of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending took place intermittently over a period extending from late 2023 through to early 2025 and involved a variety of outlets located within the Belmont metropolitan area and its environs.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour case was initiated following reports by local shopkeepers to the Belmont Business Crime Reduction Partnership, which had noted an extraordinary increase in thefts apparently linked by certain behavioural and physical markers observable on closed-circuit television footage. The Borough Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police Service undertook the investigative lead, involving collaboration with the City Retail Liaison Team and the Forensic Evidence Bureau.\n\nYou were apprehended on 15 March 2025 in circumstances that involved coordination over multiple jurisdictions, given that offences had been recorded in the wards of Westbrook, Ashford, and North Belmont. The investigatory sequence was marked by protracted surveillance, both physical and digital, including but not limited to the analysis of transport pass swipes, mobile device logs, and inter-agency data comparison intended to verify your movements in conjunction with the timing of offences. Such an operation is resource-heavy and requires careful interdepartmental communication, which, as is often the case, presented some practical difficulties due to overlapping operational periods of different task forces.\n\nIt is necessary to place on record the court’s gratitude to the officers involved, who displayed commendable diligence in balancing the acute pressures of urban policing with the demands of this protracted enquiry. The investigative effort was, regrettably, hampered to an extent by delays in the collation of body-worn camera footage and the necessity to re-interview several non-compliant witnesses, which extended the time until charge.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nYou attended the police station voluntarily following an earlier invitation, where you were interviewed and subsequently released pending further enquiries. Following the analysis of forensic evidence recovered from locations linked to the offences, including fibre analysis and CCTV corroboration, you were arrested and charged on 3 April 2025 with a consolidated count representative of multiple theft incidents.\n\nIt should be noted that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of funding for your defence was, regrettably, far from prompt. Initial requests for funding to secure expert psychiatric assessment were met with procedural back-and-forth, exacerbated by the agency’s requirement for additional paperwork and clarification of eligibility. This contributed to a delay spanning some six weeks, frustrating both the defence and the court’s timetable. Such administrative hurdles serve only to strain an already overburdened court system.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nFollowing charge, the matter was listed before this court under the Better Case Management (BCM) provisions, which are intended to ensure timely progression whilst maintaining procedural fairness. This process, first introduced in the late 2010s to replace outdated pre-trial protocols, emphasises early identification of issues likely to affect the trial and allocates resources accordingly.\n\nSubmissions were made on your behalf by Mr Elliot Wren, instructed under a representation order. The defence took a standard approach, seeking to place reliance on your personal circumstances, including prior adversity and reported mental health difficulties. At the initial plea hearing, you entered a conditional plea, seeking further reports before final determination. On 14 September 2025, you altered that plea to guilty.\n\nIt is pertinent to observe that your initial hesitation to plead guilty is a pattern not uncommon among repeat offenders in shoplifting cases, as noted in R v. Daniels [2019] EWCA Crim 457, where the Court of Appeal recognised the interplay between denial and ingrained patterns of criminal conduct. However, in Daniels, the delay in plea was deemed to have limited mitigation effect, given the scale of evidence.\n\nWe also recall the judgments in R v. Khatri [2021] EWCA Crim 811 and R v. Simmons [2023] EWCA Crim 226, which specifically addressed sentencing principles in the context of persistent acquisitive offenders. Those cases underscore the necessity for sentences to reflect not only the immediate harm but the deterrent message required for persistent misconduct, even where violence or threats are absent.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe Court notes with respectful attention the victim impact statements collated by the Belmont Retail Consortium. These highlight the considerable emotional and economic toll experienced by employees and business owners alike. While the financial value of individual items taken may appear modest, the aggregate effect — including staff distress and loss of business — is substantial.\n\nIndeed, it is worth reiterating the findings drawn from the well-documented Research Report on Retail Crime published by the National Retail Federation in 2024, which emphasised that even low-value theft can precipitate increased operational costs leading to staff reductions and reduced opening hours. These consequences disproportionately impact vulnerable community members, including elderly shoppers and those with mobility impairments, who rely on the familiarity and accessibility of local stores.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nExpert Reports and Background  \nDr Sarah Weir, a consultant clinical psychologist instructed by the defence, provided a detailed assessment. Her report, dated 1 October 2025, notes that you exhibit characteristics consistent with borderline personality traits and episodes of situational anxiety, though no frank psychosis or major mental illness. The report cites a history of intermittent engagement with community mental health teams but also highlights patterns of non-compliance and missed appointments.\n\nDr Weir’s analysis discusses the psychological underpinnings of your offending behaviour, particularly in the context of impulsivity and fleeting financial crises. She highlights a lack of sustained engagement with available support services, while observing that the partial nature of your disclosure renders some clinical conclusions tentative.\n\nWhile the court gives due weight to this clinical perspective, it must also balance such considerations against the protection of the public and the need for deterrence. Individual vulnerabilities, important though they are, cannot wholly account for repeat offending that accumulates a significant administrative cost for law enforcement and commercial sectors.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe pre-sentence report submitted by Probation Officer Ms Caroline Hewitt presents a thorough social and criminological profile. Ms Hewitt notes that you are currently unemployed, residing in temporary accommodation provided by the city council, and have limited family contact. She refers to prior convictions for similar offences, including a conditional discharge imposed in 2021.\n\nMs Hewitt expresses concern about high levels of unaddressed debt, unstable accommodation, and a tendency to disengage from rehabilitative programmes. She recommends consideration of a community order with rehabilitation requirements focusing on cognitive behavioural therapy and financial management.\n\nIt is relevant to note, in this context, the systemic constraints faced by probation services nationally, including staff shortages and burgeoning caseloads, which can adversely affect the continuity of supervision and support. The impact of these institutional challenges is well documented in the 2025 Annual Review of the Probation Service, highlighting that many individuals with complex needs receive fragmented intervention.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nThe court is also informed that the Belmont Housing Authority has been involved with your case intermittently, although records indicate periodic reluctance on your part to engage fully with housing support workers. The precariousness of your residential situation reflects wider societal trends, including escalating homelessness rates and the deteriorating availability of affordable housing options—a topic beyond the scope of this judgment but pressing for policymakers.\n\nI acknowledge various letters of support received from community organisations, including the Belmont Food Bank and Northside Community Outreach, attesting to your recent attempts to access basic assistance notwithstanding longstanding challenges.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nLegal Framework and Sentencing Principles  \nThe relevant legislation, as reflected in statute and case precedent, centres on the Theft Act 1968 (section 1). The Sentencing Council Guideline on Theft Offences (effective from 1 February 2024) defines the approach for sentences proportionate to the offence’s seriousness, accounting for factors including planning, persistence, value, and impact.\n\nParagraphs 3.4 and 3.5 of the guideline stress the cumulative harm caused by repeated low-level offending and the consequential necessity to impose sentences that reflect both individual culpability and general deterrence. Credit for guilty pleas, meanwhile, is set out in paragraphs 8 and 9, highlighting the relationship between timing and the extent of mitigation.\n\nThe jurisprudence confirms that late guilty pleas, while meriting some credit, attract less substantial discounts than early admissions, as reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal in R v. Edwards [2022] EWCA Crim 1452.\n\nFurthermore, in R v. Matthews [2020] EWCA Crim 1586, the court emphasised that persistent acquisitive offending, even absent violence, can justifiably result in immediate custodial sentences to prevent further harm and signal societal condemnation.\n\nIt is also necessary to acknowledge the court’s duty to consider the offender’s circumstances in accordance with the principle articulated in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, section 142, to ensure that sentences are proportionate and take into account rehabilitation prospects.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nAdditional Observations  \nThe court notes, as an enduring challenge to the criminal justice system at large, the ongoing capacity constraints within forensic laboratories, which occasion delays in the processing of evidence in similar cases. The forensic backlog has been repeatedly highlighted in Parliamentary committee reports, with recommendations pending regarding increased funding and digitisation.\n\nMoreover, the rise of so-called “influencer culture” on social media platforms has, anecdotally at least, impacted certain patterns of minor offending behaviour. The allure of online notoriety and challenge videos sometimes intersects with shoplifting among young adults. While there is no direct evidence to suggest your conduct was influenced in this way, the phenomenon warrants awareness.\n\nIt is regrettable that the media response to cases of this nature remains modest. As has been observed, there is a selective interest in crime reporting, with petty theft rarely capturing sustained attention except when linked to nationally notorious individuals or spectacular incidents.\n\nLastly, I acknowledge the assistance of court staff and legal representatives in managing the often complex logistics of such cases in a judicial environment still recovering from pandemic disruptions and intermittent industrial action.\n\nConclusion and Next Steps  \nMr H, in the light of the complexity of factors identified and the serious nature of your offending, it is appropriate that sentencing awaits the preparation and consideration of a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing your risk, needs, and suitability for any rehabilitative intervention.\n\nYou are hereby remanded on conditional bail pending that report, which I direct be completed within four weeks. At the sentencing hearing, I shall consider the full range of sentencing options available, including immediate custody, suspended sentences, or community orders with tailored requirements.\n\nI express appreciation to Ms Jennifer Aldridge, counsel for the Crown, and to Mr Elliot Wren for the defence, both of whom have submitted articulate written representations and oral submissions.\n\nThese are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge D. W. Callaghan, issued on 18 October 2025 in Court 5 at Belmont Crown Court. The hearing has been conducted in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. You are reminded of your right to appeal against any sentence imposed within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged.
