MR H  \nCase No. S2025/13426  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. G. DALRYMPLE  \nFiled: 23 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction for an offence under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely shoplifting from several retail establishments over a period spanning late 2023 through to early 2025 within and around the Sheffield metropolitan borough. The offence was tried here following your guilty plea entered at the close of the Crown’s case.\n\nProcedural Overview  \nYour initial appearance occurred on 12 March 2025 at the Sheffield Magistrates’ Court, where the charge was first laid. The case rapidly moved to this Crown Court venue pursuant to the Crown Court allocation scheme, the matter having been identified as requiring detailed consideration of prior offending and complex evidential material. A plea and trial preparation hearing was scheduled for 14 May 2025 before the Honorable Recorder W. Bridges. At that hearing, no application was made by the defence to change the plea, and a trial date was set. However, on 2 July 2025, you entered a guilty plea following the service of additional prosecutorial evidence including digital forensics, CCTV footage, and witness statements. The late plea occasioned discussion as to appropriate reduction in sentencing credit.\n\nThe administrative flow of this case, although punctuated with significant engagement from the parties, was affected by several adjournments. These included a three-week delay due to Local Government strike action impacting court staffing levels and the reluctance of the Legal Aid Agency to swiftly authorise funding for a psychiatric assessment requested by your counsel. These procedural intricacies are illustrative of systemic pressures currently confronting the administration of criminal justice. While such systemic concerns are extrinsic to your individual case, they provide context to the protracted nature of proceedings at a time when the courts face unprecedented demand coupled with resource limitations.\n\nA noteworthy feature within the broader landscape is the operation of the Sheffield Business Crime Forum, an umbrella initiative comprising police, local council officers, retailers, and community groups aiming to coordinate responses to neighbourhood crime. While the Forum’s efficacy is occasionally hindered by staff fluctuations and competing priorities, it was substantially engaged in collating intelligence relevant to your offending pattern. The Forum’s Crime Reduction Officer contributed to the prosecution’s investigative approach, facilitating the gathering of surveillance evidence and witness liaison. Their activity was documented in correspondence submitted with the prosecution’s trial bundle dated 15 August 2025.\n\nThe court is mindful of the enduring challenges faced by police officers assigned to city centre patrols, where persistent acquisitive offending imposes a disproportionate administrative and operational heaviness. As noted in the recent internal report by South Yorkshire Police’s Operational Command Unit, front-line officers frequently balance emerging violent crime and the complexities of licensed premises compliance alongside addressing the seemingly never-ending tide of shop theft incidents. This case exemplifies the resource-intensive efforts expended on what some might term “low-level” criminality but which, cumulatively, exacts a heavy toll on both public confidence and retail viability.\n\nMr H, during the course of these proceedings, your legal representation has been consistently provided by Mr Michael Gowers of Sheffield Legal Aid Services. I acknowledge and thank Mr Gowers for his thorough submissions and professional conduct. Likewise, the Crown has been ably represented by Ms Emma Lupin, whose clarity and precision in outlining the evidential merits and public interest considerations have been duly noted.\n\nTurning to a more general observation concerning the Legal Aid Agency, it is unable to escape the court’s notice that the procedural delays in approving expert instructions in this matter were regrettably emblematic of a wider trend. Such delays place undue strain on defence counsel, hamper timely justice, and in effect, may compromise effective advocacy. It is hoped that ongoing reforms within the Legal Aid system will address these deficiencies, preserving the fundamental principle of fair trial.\n\nThe Evidence and Offending Pattern  \nThe facts of this case, as presented before the court at trial, arise from a pattern of conduct involving the systematic removal of goods from retail premises over approximately seventeen months. Through the collation of CCTV footage from multiple stores, witness accounts, and forensic analysis of discarded packaging and clothing, a consistent modus operandi emerged. As the Crown outlined in opening, your actions were not singular or spontaneous acts but rather formed a deliberate and sustained course of conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nEach theft, while individually of modest financial value, when viewed cumulatively, reflects persistent intent to deprive the owner of goods. This court has frequently remarked on the fallacy of equating low monetary value with triviality. The cumulative loss borne by retailers, along with the intrusion on staff and disruption to customer experience, constitutes a significant public harm. The Retail Theft Sentencing Guidelines, paragraph 3.5, expressly caution courts against treating repeated low-level shoplifting as inconsequential.\n\nIndeed, the discharged obligation imposed by the Theft Act not only protects tangible property rights but safeguards the integrity of community commerce and the dignity of workers subjected to the stress of victimisation.\n\nIt warrants mention that investigations were spearheaded by Detective Inspector Lucy Fairbanks of the South Yorkshire Acquisitive Crime Unit, whose team carried out an evidence-gathering operation that incorporated covert observation, deployment of technological assets, including transport metadata, and liaison with Business Crime Reduction Officers. The sophisticated nature of this investigative response underscores the seriousness with which such offences attract official attention.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nIt is significant that on multiple occasions you were identified leaving premises with goods concealed yet lacking payment, frequently exploiting busy periods and staff distraction. This indicates a premeditation inconsistent with unwitting or impulsive action.\n\nProcedural complexity arises when considering the extended surveillance undertaken, which involved coordination between local transport authorities’ CCTV control rooms and private security firms employed by the retailers. The collation of this digital evidence, while voluminous, established a compelling nexus to your person and supported the charge beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe court takes judicial notice of the ongoing debate regarding better utilisation of technology to combat retail crime, as articulated in the Home Office report “Digital Policing and Retail Crime 2024,” but also affirms the necessity of balancing privacy rights and evidential sufficiency.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nIt is also noted that your choice of target goods commonly included high-demand personal care products and over-the-counter medications—items often vulnerable to resale on informal markets. The impact of this is twofold: losses to business and contribution to black market activity that may fuel wider societal harms.\n\nEqually troubling are the consequences for those employed in the affected premises. Staff have reported increased anxiety, reduced workplace morale, and the need to undertake additional security responsibilities without commensurate support.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nVictim Impact and Community Harm  \nTurning to the documented victim impact, the court has had the benefit of statements from several store managers and employees who spoke of the toll your repeated offending took. One manager notably remarked that persistent theft led to increased security costs, forced adjustments in staff rotas, and sadly, contributed to a decision to reduce opening hours. This, in turn, diminishes community access to vital goods and fuels a sense of insecurity in neighbourhoods.\n\nThe Retail Support Network, a voluntary sector body engaged by several affected shopkeepers, provided a report to the court setting out the broader consequences of recurring shoplifting. While their role is ancillary, the insight they bring paints a picture of a sector under pressure, grappling with financial uncertainty and workforce retention difficulties.\n\nThe distress experienced by victims as recorded in these statements must be given weight. While the offences did not involve threats or violence, the psychological impact of repeated dishonesty and intrusion into workplace safety is often underestimated.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nDevelopment of the case and prosecution strategy was, in part, modelled on the recommendations set forth in Williams and O’Connor (2019) concerning the use of intelligence-led policing and offender management to effectively tackle repeat retail offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nThe court also notes that your offending persisted despite prior warnings and an out-of-court disposal issued in late 2023 by the Sheffield Community Resolution Group. This prior intervention was unsuccessful in deterring you. The failure of such community-based measures to stem your conduct signals a need for more robust judicial response.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nPsychiatric and Pre-Sentence Assessment  \nA psychiatric assessment was commissioned following your counsel’s application, a report having been prepared by Dr S. Raman, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, and lodged with the court on 8 September 2025. Dr Raman concluded that, whilst you do not suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder that would disrupt criminal responsibility, there are traits of heightened impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and a mild but untreated substance use issue, notably alcohol misuse.\n\nDr Raman also noted your lack of engagement with available support services and expressed concerns about your limited insight into the consequences of your offending.\n\nThe Pre-Sentence Report, compiled by Probation Officer Ms Angela McPherson on 18 September 2025, echoes these findings. She highlights your unstable housing situation and lack of meaningful employment. While acknowledging some steps you have made towards recovery and stabilisation, the report urges structured supervision and consideration of rehabilitative programmes targeting acquisitive offending and impulsivity.\n\nThe strain on Probation Services nationally is well recognised. Notably, Sheffield Probation Trust currently operates with 15% fewer officers than last year, and waiting times for community programme commencement have increased. Despite this, Ms McPherson reports readiness within local provision to accommodate your case, subject to sentencing direction.\n\nSentencing Framework and Case Law  \nThe offence falls squarely within the Sentencing Council guideline on Theft, dated July 2022, which emphasises that persistent offending and targeting vulnerable or small independent premises can constitute aggravating factors.\n\nIt is appropriate to remind that in R v. Sterling [2023] EWCA Crim 387, a defendant with a comparable offending pattern was subject to an immediate custodial sentence owing to recidivism and failure to engage with diversion schemes. The Court of Appeal there underscored the principle that community tolerance towards repeat property crime has limits, particularly where the deterrent effect of earlier sanctions has failed.\n\nReference is also made to R v. Honeywell [2024] EWCA Crim 221, in which a custodial sentence was imposed on a young offender involved in a series of shop thefts that significantly disturbed local commercial stability despite low individual values.\n\nOf note is the Court’s consideration of R v. Davidson [2021] EWCA Crim 1149, where the Court observed that delayed guilty pleas, especially those entered only at trial, should attract reduced reductions in sentence credit. The principle that an early plea reflects genuine remorse and saves court time is well established and applies here.\n\nHistorical context to theft law may be found in the foundational cases dating back to the Theft Act 1968’s enactment, including the seminal authority R v. Ghosh [1982] QB 1053, though its test for dishonesty has since been modified by Ivey v Genting Casinos (2017) UKSC 67, which set the prevailing legal standard.\n\nIt is thus noted that your course of conduct offends against these legal parameters both in theory and practice.\n\nAncillary Observations  \nThe Sheffield Crown Court itself has undergone a refurbishment project earlier this year, modernising the main courtroom where your trial was heard. This upgrade included state-of-the-art audio-visual systems and improved accessibility, designed to facilitate the orderly and fair conduct of proceedings.\n\nIt is regrettable that, on the day of your plea, there was a brief delay of 20 minutes caused by the late arrival of an interpreter assigned for an unrelated matter listed later on the afternoon roster. Whilst not directly impacting these proceedings, such occurrences are symptomatic of wider workforce shortages in court services.\n\nThe court is made cognisant of the fact that this case attracted minimal press or public interest, a phenomenon noted in several recent local proceedings. In an age where media focus often gravitates toward high-profile or violent offences, the slow attritional harm caused by repeated petty crime receives scant attention despite its enduring community impact.\n\nMr H, I am also obliged to mention that your sister, Ms Bernadine Williams, provided a character reference pleading for leniency, indicating that you have familial support which may be pivotal in your rehabilitation. The report from the Westborough Community Food Bank likewise testifies to your occasional engagement with social services aimed at assisting those with unstable income and housing.\n\nConclusion and Directions  \nIn the final assessment, the court must balance the seriousness of the offence, the cumulative impact on victims, your personal circumstances, and the wider public interest in deterrence and rehabilitation. You have, regrettably, demonstrated a pattern of deliberate offending over a lengthy period, accompanied by a degree of resistance to prior attempts at diversion.\n\nYour late plea, entered only after significant evidence was amassed, attracts a modest reduction in sentencing credit. The aggravating factors of persistence and the ripple effect on vulnerable small businesses and employees weigh heavily. Nevertheless, your engagement with some community supports and the psychiatric observations suggesting potential for intervention counsel consideration of a structured community sentence.\n\nI shall therefore order the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, incorporating an assessment of the feasibility and appropriateness of sentence options ranging from a community order with relevant rehabilitation requirements to custodial disposals where justified.\n\nThe report should particularly address suitable cognitive behavioural programmes aimed at offending behaviour, any necessary addiction treatment pathways, and risk management considerations.\n\nI express my gratitude to all who have contributed to the material before me, including prosecution and defence counsel, police investigators, probation, and voluntary sector contributors.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued today, 23 September 2025, in Court 5 of the Sheffield Crown Court. The record of proceedings has been duly transcribed and entered under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days, pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.
