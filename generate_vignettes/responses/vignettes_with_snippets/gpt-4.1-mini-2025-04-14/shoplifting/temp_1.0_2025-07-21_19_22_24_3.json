MR H  \nCase No. W2025/08321  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. Kensington  \nFiled: 17 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court today for sentence in respect of a charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely a course of conduct involving the theft of goods from multiple retail premises over a significant period. This court has been presented with a detailed but complex bundle of evidence, reflecting extended investigative efforts and broad cooperation amongst several agencies. It is essential at the outset to emphasise that while the offences concern relatively low-value items, the cumulative impact and repetition of this conduct attract serious judicial consideration. Such offending can have disruptive economic and social consequences well beyond the immediate loss or displacement of goods.\n\nProcedural History  \nThe matters leading to the charge relate to incidents spanning from early 2023 through to March 2025. Arrest followed an investigation culminating on 12 March 2025, subsequent to intelligence-led work conducted by the Windsor Borough Police and the Thames Valley Retail Crime Partnership. I note that this case was allocated to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, an initiative designed to reduce avoidable delays and promote early identification of contested issues. The case management timetable was generally observed, though the court is mindful of some unavoidable adjournments necessitated by ongoing expert assessments and late disclosure applications. These are, regrettably, not uncommon in cases requiring multi-agency liaison and forensic expertise. Such delays, while frustrating to all involved, are the consequence of the procedural safeguards necessary in complex matters; the court appreciates the efforts of all parties to minimise disruption.\n\nThe investigative phase benefitted from the use of advanced analytic techniques, including cross-referencing incident reports with anonymised mobile data and retail point-of-sale discrepancy logs. This methodological richness enabled a more comprehensive case to be presented. Such an approach, though resource intensive, exemplifies modern policing’s move toward data-driven enforcement aimed at disrupting persistent offending patterns before they further entrench. This case draws attention, again, to the pressing challenge faced by retail premises, particularly smaller independent traders, whose limited resilience to theft-related loss strains increasingly fragile business models.\n\nApplications under Legal Aid funding arrangements to instruct an independent psychiatric expert and a forensic accountant to consider the financial impact of offending were submitted by the defence in good time but unfortunately experienced protracted administrative processing. The Legal Aid Agency’s delays in granting authority to instruct these experts resulted in the hearing scheduled for 20 August being vacated and the matter relisted for today’s sentencing hearing. Such delays, while understandable given the thoroughness desired in oversight, risk impeding the timely delivery of justice. This court would echo wider judicial calls for reform of these procedures to prevent unnecessary bottlenecks.\n\nBoth prosecuting and defence counsel have conducted themselves professionally throughout, and I record my thanks to Mr Simon Haynes appearing on behalf of the Crown and to Ms Felicity Warner representing the defendant under a legal aid order. The court also thanks the court clerk and ushers, who have facilitated the smooth running of proceedings notwithstanding the pressure on court listings nationally.\n\nWithin the wider context, Windsor Crown Court serves a diverse and densely populated area, marked by a mixed socio-economic profile and a retail sector that includes both large commercial chains and smaller niche shops. Recent years have seen an increase in reports of acquisitive crime, a pattern reflected nationally. This underscores the relevance of the sentencing processes here in delivering outcomes that balance the interests of justice, the needs of victims, and the statutory aims of rehabilitation and public protection.\n\nThe court is also cognisant of wider concerns about rising street homelessness and social vulnerability in the local area. The issue has been the subject of recent public health and law enforcement briefings, drawing attention to the interrelationship between social exclusion, mental health needs, and offending behaviour. Though the court does not intend to conflate these broader social challenges with individual culpability, the context in which offending occurs may have bearing upon sentencing considerations.\n\nThe case law which guides sentencing in offences of theft is well-established, with the starting point legislated and refined through successive Court of Appeal decisions. Of note, R v. Firmin [2022] EWCA Crim 1557 affirms the importance of proportionality and the recognition that, while low-value offences may attract custodial sentences in some contexts, the nature and impact of the offending remain paramount. Similarly, in R v. Duval [2019] EWCA Crim 334, the Court endorsed tailored community approaches where rehabilitation prospects are tangible and the public risk manageable. These authorities frame the legal compass within which this court operates.\n\nAttention is drawn to the sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council, updated as recently as 2024, which give direction on theft offences. The guidelines categorise offending per its seriousness, considering factors such as the value of goods, planning and sophistication, offending frequency, and impact upon victims. Particularly relevant here is the emphasis placed on the cumulative nature of offences and the acknowledgement of the psychological distress caused to retail staff, especially when persistent offending disrupts normal business activities and staff wellbeing.\n\nThe Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and subsequent amendments, alongside the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, frame aspects of sentencing discretion and the deployment of community-based sanctions. The court notes that Mr H is in receipt of state benefits due to financial hardship but is reported to have had several opportunities to engage with support services relevant to his circumstances, with varying degrees of compliance.\n\nThe court also received detailed victim impact statements from several local retailers, documenting the operational challenges posed by repeat shoplifting. One such statement, submitted by the manager of a chemist on High Street, described the efforts to install additional CCTV and store layout changes designed to deter thefts, as well as increased employee stress levels and turnover. These submissions, collectively, illustrate that even offences of modest individual value can carry wider consequences. They serve as a sober reminder that offences of this nature are not victimless.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nIt is pertinent to observe that the court heard from a senior officer of the Windsor Business Crime Reduction Partnership, who provided an outline of joint efforts to address retail crime in the borough. He described the ongoing challenges faced in the face of limited staffing levels exacerbated by recent recruitment difficulties across the constabulary. The chronic understaffing of frontline teams inevitably constrains the immediacy and scope of response to acquisitive offence reports, as resources must also be stretched across other priorities including violent crime, road safety, and counter-terrorism. The officer’s testimony underscores the system-wide pressures that cases such as this impose.  \n\nIt was also brought to the court’s attention that the defendant is currently under the supervision of the Probation Service following a prior community order for theft-related offences. The Probation Officer’s report, considered in advance of this hearing, notes an inconsistent engagement pattern and highlights concerns regarding financial management and social isolation. The report reflects an up-to-date risk assessment placing Mr H within a medium risk of harm tier, with the potential for reoffending remaining a substantive concern.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nIt is worth noting that this court has, in other cases, wrestled extensively with the challenge of appropriate credit for guilty pleas entered late in the proceedings. While the law rightly encourages defendants to admit guilt at the earliest opportunity, the courts cannot treat belated pleas afforded solely by the weight of overwhelming evidence as evidence of genuine remorse. The legal framework as explained in R v. Stamford [2018] EWCA Crim 1340 provides ample guidance on the degrees of credit available dependent on plea timing and circumstances. In the present case, Mr H entered his plea shortly before the trial window, limiting the discount to which he may properly be entitled.\n\nA detailed psychiatric report was obtained from Dr Fiona Rickwood, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose evaluation was exhaustive and professionally conducted. Her conclusions indicate that while no major mental illness is present, there is evidence of mild depressive symptoms, manifesting as low mood and reduced motivation. Dr Rickwood noted tendencies toward impulsivity and emotional instability but stopped short of diagnosing a formal personality disorder. She further emphasised that appropriate psychological support services are available locally, but uptake has been minimal. Dr Rickwood recommended engagement with cognitive-behavioural therapy tailored to addressing impulsivity and decision-making deficits, as well as social support interventions targeting isolation.\n\nThe report also outlined the pressures on mental health services regionally, with waiting times for psychological therapies extending beyond average targets nationally. This reflects a marked increase in service demand post-pandemic, coupled with workforce shortages noted in the NHS workforce census 2025. The court commends the efforts of clinicians and coordinators striving to maintain care standards amid these constraints.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nIt must be emphasised that the law does not personalise systemic shortcomings, but neither can those realities be ignored when considering rehabilitation pathways. It is therefore incumbent on the probation and social services to ensure access to suitable supports, bearing in mind the practical difficulties posed by capacity limitations.\n\nIn reviewing previous relevant case law, the court recalls R v. Sinclair [2020] EWCA Crim 1429, which concerned a defendant convicted of burglary and repeat thefts targeting vulnerable small shops. The Court of Appeal endorsed a custodial sentence where members of the public had been left \"intimidated and fearful,\" and where the defendant's engagement with rehabilitation programmes had been minimal. In contrast, R v. Metcalfe [2021] dealt with a defendant with schizophrenia involved in an arson offence; that case reinforced the delicate balancing act required in considering sentenced infractions committed in the context of serious mental illness, promoting a therapeutic custodial approach. Neither set of circumstances mirrors Mr H’s exactly, but both inform the wider jurisprudential context.\n\nI also note the precedential judgments concerning the reduction of credit for guilty pleas. The principle set out in R v. Danvers [2017] EWCA Crim 2920 is salient here: the earlier the plea, the more credit afforded, reflecting not just procedural saving but an indication of insight and remorse.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThis case typifies the strain inflicted on front-line retail workers, who are too frequently overlooked as victims of crimes that, while lacking overt violence, inflict significant psychological and practical harm. The court takes due account of the testimony from store employees, noting increased anxiety and diminished feelings of safety, which align with observations from the British Retail Consortium’s 2024 Crime Survey report. The psychological impact of repeated theft on staff wellbeing must be recognised as part of the harm continuum.\n\nThe court must consider the defendant’s personal circumstances, well documented in the probation pre-sentence report and medical assessments. Mr H is aged 29, currently unemployed, and residing in temporary accommodation provided by the local council. There is a history of unresolved housing instability coupled with sporadic engagement with welfare support services. His family situation is described as fractured, with limited contact.\n\nA letter submitted by a local charity supporting individuals with complex needs in Windsor was also tendered. The letter endorsed the defendant’s previous engagement with programmes addressing substance misuse and mental health but noted recent disengagement. The charity expressed willingness to renew support post-sentence if appropriate.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe home environment within which a defendant lives can be a material factor in both offending and rehabilitation prospects. This court acknowledges the recurring themes of poverty, hardship, and exclusion that populate much of the casework before us. And yet, courts must remain vigilant against conflating context with excuse. As observed in R v. Langridge [2019] EWCA Crim 1047, personal adversity, while significant in mitigation, cannot eclipse responsibility for choices made.\n\nAmong the procedural observations pertinent to this hearing are some minor irregularities in administrative record-keeping, including discrepancies in date stamps on custody logs and minor inconsistencies in witness statement annotations. These have been examined and found not to rise to the level affecting the substantive case or the fairness of proceedings. Such details, while important to due process, serve ultimately as reminders of the human fallibility inherent in any system.\n\nThe court also wishes to note the absence of the media at this hearing, despite being an open court. This accords with a broader trend observed nationally where low-level acquisitive offences seldom attract journalistic attention unless coupled with violence or sensational elements. This is an ironic commentary on the public appetite for visibility, which is selective and often neglects the quiet harm done by repeated unlawful conduct such as this.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nThe defendant’s record includes previous offences recorded over the last five years, primarily for similar thefts. Notably, in 2022, Mr H was dealt with under a conditional caution following a shoplifting incident involving confectionary and toiletries. A community resolution was additionally offered in 2021 for an unrelated instance of attempted retail theft. The recidivism here is not merely quantitative but concerns failure to desist despite multiple formal interventions. That pattern weighs heavily in the sentencing calculus.\n\nIt is regrettable but true that the volume of return offenders places additional strain on police and probation resources. The Probation Service in this jurisdiction has reported increasing caseloads, a problem exacerbated by challenges in recruitment and retention. The consequence has been a reliance on prioritisation protocols which, while necessary, may limit the intensity of supervision available in some cases.\n\nThe court also received correspondence from the managing director of a local retail cooperative, describing the impact of persistent low-level theft on stock shrinkage rates and staff morale. Their brief but sincere communication underscores the business reality behind the otherwise dry legal proceedings.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nThe court has reflected upon recent changes to the Sentencing Council’s guidelines concerning theft offences, particularly the enhanced emphasis on the offender’s antecedents and the degree of planning or sophistication demonstrated. In this context, while Mr H has no history of violent conduct, the repeated and targeted nature of offences suggests a particular degree of deliberation and knowledge of vulnerable premises.\n\nThe considerations of personal mitigation for cases of mental health difficulties were reinforced in R v. Harper [2023] EWCA Crim 733, which held that the existence of psychological difficulties should be carefully weighed against the nature and impact of offending behaviour. The sentencing court was reminded that such factors alone do not warrant wholesale mitigation where offending causes real harm and where risks to reoffending remain significant.\n\nI have had regard to all these principles in reaching my provisional conclusions today.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe cumulative impact of repeated thefts on the community’s sense of security and business viability cannot be overstated. The prospect of deterrence—both specific and general—must be given appropriate weight, alongside considerations of rehabilitation and proportionality.\n\nThe final pre-sentence report will explore in depth whether community sanctions augmented by accredited offending behaviour programmes might be viable, particularly interventions addressing impulsivity, financial management, and social integration. The possibility of unpaid work as a component of such a disposal will also be considered.\n\nIt must be underscored that the court remains open to any proposals that aim to reduce reoffending and assist reintegration without compromising public protection.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Windsor Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal sentence date has been set pending receipt of updated pre-sentence and psychiatric reports. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal sentencing within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are in place. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINDSOR  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. W2025/08321  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J.
