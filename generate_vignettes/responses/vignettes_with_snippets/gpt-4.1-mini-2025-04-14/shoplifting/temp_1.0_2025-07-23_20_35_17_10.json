Mr H  \nCase No. S2025/15342  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. P. Wentworth  \nFiled: 18 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically relating to multiple counts of shoplifting over an extended period in the Sheffield metropolitan area. The offending behaviour spans from late 2023 through to early 2025 and has involved a series of retail premises, ranging from large supermarkets to smaller independent convenience outlets.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour case first came before this court in a preliminary hearing conducted on 3 March 2025. At that stage, your initial pleas were entered and a timetable for disclosure, witness evidence, and forensic reporting was established in accordance with the Better Case Management Protocol as set out under Part 3 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The BCM procedure aims to secure early case identification and expedite resolution with proportionate allocation of judicial and prosecutorial resources.\n\nIt should be noted that the administration of criminal justice in this jurisdiction operates within a framework balancing efficiency and the rights of the accused as enshrined in legislation and case law. The Sheffield Crown Court, established over a century ago, continues to serve as a principal venue for trials and sentencing of indictable offences arising within South Yorkshire. Its estates recently underwent refurbishment to improve accessibility and compliance with statutory equality provisions, reflecting evolving civic priorities.\n\nYour initial bail conditions mandated residence at a specified address with a curfew imposed between 22:00 and 06:00 hours. After a brief adjournment on account of pending forensic analyses, your case was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 24 May 2025. At that hearing, you pleaded not guilty. However, as the evidence emerged in greater detail, supported by witness statements and technical examination of recovered items, a late guilty plea was entered on 12 August 2025, shortly before the commencement of the scheduled trial window.\n\nLate pleas of this nature are neither novel nor unexpected in acquisitive crime prosecutions. The Court of Appeal has consistently emphasised, most recently in R v. Stretton [2024] EWCA Crim 937, that credit for guilty pleas must be tempered by their timing, with early admissions of responsibility meriting greater reduction than those entered at the cusp of trial.\n\nThat principle was reaffirmed in R v. Montague [2023] EWCA Crim 442, where the appellant’s plea, entered after exhaustive preparation of witnesses and evidence, was accorded limited mitigation. The rationale is plain: the interests of justice, the rights of victims, and public resources require timely resolution rather than protracted contest.\n\nThe prosecution has offered evidence assembled through the concerted efforts of the Sheffield Retail Crime Partnership, a local multi-agency collaboration modelled on the Business Crime Reduction Partnership framework. This network embraces police, store security teams, and community safety officers, seeking to streamline response to repeat offenders and establish offender profiles to enhance preventive strategies. This reflects a national movement towards integrated policing and community-based crime reduction paradigms, albeit one not without operational challenges given resource constraints, personnel shortages, and shifting policy priorities.\n\nThe court commends the diligence of all those involved—police constables, analysts, retail managers, and victim liaison officers—who contributed toward the collation of evidence in this matter. As is well known, retail crime detection and prosecution require intense labour, often involving review of extensive CCTV footage, detailed stock audits, and careful corroboration of witness statements who may be non-specialist staff subjected to repeated victimisation.\n\nThe wider social context in which cases of acquisitive offending take place is complex. We live in an era marked by increased social mobility, economic precarity, and technological change affecting both consumer behaviour and policing methods. The normalisation of casual dishonesty, sometimes exacerbated by social media trends promoting illicit activities, presents new challenges. Yet, while socio-economic factors are of concern, the court must remain unimpressed by attempts to justify criminal acts solely by reference to such externalities.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nThe historical evolution of the Theft Act 1968 remains relevant. Enacted over half a century ago, the statute has formed the bedrock for property offence prosecutions but has also undergone interpretation to reflect changes in social and technological contexts. For instance, the rise of self-checkout tills and online retail have prompted novel applications of legal principles concerning dishonesty and appropriation, as discussed in R v. Yates [2019] EWCA Crim 1084.\n\nMoreover, the interaction between criminal law and social welfare systems influences offender profiles. Data from the Sheffield City Council’s Social Services Division in recent annual reports indicates a rising trend in homelessness and substance dependency cases, often intersecting with acquisitive crime patterns. However, legal accountability remains paramount.\n\nYour defence has advanced evidence from a clinical psychologist, Dr Miranda Choi, whose report furnished a considered analysis of your mental health status. Dr Choi observes traits consistent with moderate anxiety and a history of depressive episodes, though does not diagnose a major psychiatric disorder. She notes difficulties with impulse control and coping mechanisms in the face of financial stressors.\n\nThis court is mindful of the public health pressures affecting mental health service provision nationwide. NHS England’s recent statistics reveal substantial waiting lists for adult psychological therapies, and funding constraints have led to fluctuations in capacity across regional clinical commissioning groups. While sympathetic to the challenges faced by defendants with vulnerabilities, the court cannot diminish the seriousness of deliberate offending conducted over a lengthy period without direct compulsion.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nFurther context is provided by correspondence submitted by your sister, Ms Felicity H, dated 30 July 2025, alongside letters from the Sheffield Homelessness Outreach Unit and South Yorkshire Substance Misuse Service. These documents express concern for your welfare and affirm attempts at engagement. They also highlight the broader challenges faced by marginalised individuals in securing stable accommodation and treatment continuity, especially given recent austerity-related cutbacks in local government budgets.\n\nThe court acknowledges these efforts with respect but reiterates that they do not serve as a carte blanche for offending. Access to support, as evidenced repeatedly in case law, forms only part of the equation; engagement and compliance are equally important and are a matter of personal responsibility.\n\nWithin the ambit of sentencing law, the Sentencing Council’s 2021 guideline on Theft now stresses the importance of considering the broader impact of offending. It recognises the emotional and psychological toll on retail staff, some of whom endure repeated victimisation, leading to anxiety, stress-related illness, and turnover. Such factors are summarised in the Victim Impact Statement submitted by Ms Janet Dawkins, store manager of Meadowfield Supermarket, who reports declining staff morale and increasing use of security measures following your offending episodes.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nThe court has previously noted, in cases such as R v. Collier [2022] EWCA Crim 1017, the importance of balancing rehabilitation prospects with deterrence. Collier involved a defendant who engaged in serial shoplifting targeting food banks; despite evident vulnerabilities, the Court underscored the necessity of proportionate custodial sentences where offending was sustained and strategic.\n\nThe Probation Service’s Pre-Sentence Report, dated 10 September 2025, provides an extensive biography and risk analysis. The report identifies medium risk of reoffending and notes that previous community-based interventions were only partially successful. It also recommends consideration of cognitive skills programmes and financial management courses tailored to your expressed difficulties. The writer observes limited engagement with voluntary agencies over the past 12 months, raising concerns about compliance.\n\nRehabilitation framework considerations are further informed by established case law such as R v. Bateson [2020] EWCA Crim 498, which addressed the limited but consequential role of community sentences when offenders display low motivation and repeated breaches.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nAn ancillary but illustrative point concerns patterns of systemic delay encountered in Legal Aid processing. Your defence solicitor, Mr Kamal Singh, reports protracted negotiations with the Legal Aid Agency concerning funding for expert psychological evaluation, creating a delay of over eight weeks. Such logistical hindrances, while regrettable, are a recurring feature across many Crown Court jurisdictions and adversely affect the pace of justice.\n\nIt is appropriate here to record public institution commentary on systemic under-resourcing. The Justices’ Clerk at Sheffield Crown Court has publicly recognised the strain on case listing capacities arising from judicial strikes and staffing shortages in case progression units. Similarly, the South Yorkshire Police Digital Forensics Unit faces backlogs as demand for mobile device analysis escalates, partially due to the growing reliance on digital evidence in acquisitive offences.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nTurning to the facts of the offence in greater detail, I direct attention to the evidence presented and the nature of your conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nCo-defendant activity, while frequently intersecting with shoplifting offences, does not form any part of your offence history. It is noted that in a related but distinct case involving a Mr Bradley F, convicted of aggravated burglary under section 9 of the Theft Act 1968, there were elements of violent resistance and use of weapons not present here. Nor is there suggestion that your conduct was influenced by, or associated with, persons arrested concurrently who face separate charges of benefit fraud or possession of controlled substances.\n\nThe court is conscious of the temptation to conflate such matters, but the principle of individual culpability remains paramount.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nVictim and witness accounts, dispassionate in tone, attest to the economic loss incurred and the emotional disturbance caused. The impact extends beyond the immediate theft; it encompasses the necessity for increased security measures, staff absences, and a climate of unease.\n\nThe Retail Crime Reduction Partnership’s briefing notes observe that store injuries resulting directly from shoplifting incidents remain statistically low; however, the indirect effect on staff wellbeing is stark. For example, one employee reported diminished self-confidence following repeated confrontations with offenders.\n\nRegarding your character, the court has reviewed an array of documents including educational transcripts, previous criminal records, family references, and social work reports. Though your record demonstrates some juvenile convictions for low-level theft — including a caution at age 16 related to petty shoplifting — these matters date back more than a decade and were, at the time, subject to the Youth Rehabilitation Order regime.\n\nIt must be reiterated that the court's current mandate concerns behaviour in adulthood and sustained offending spanning over this past 18-month interval.\n\nYour accommodation history is frequent but largely unremarkable in the context of wider local housing dynamics. Sheffield's documented increase in temporary accommodation placements, as per the 2024 Annual Homelessness Review, reflects broader national trends of rising demand and limited supply. The Home Office’s “Rough Sleeping Strategy” (2018) underpins governmental priorities to reduce street homelessness but remains challenged by service capacity.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nThe court observes with regret that despite offers of assistance from multiple voluntary agencies, including Sheffield City Mission and New Beginnings Support Network, engagement has been sporadic and insufficient to halt your course of offending. This failure to adequately harness support opportunities undermines mitigation prospects.\n\nBy way of procedural aside, the court notes the absence at today's hearing of media representatives, a common phenomenon given the perceived routine nature of low-value theft trials. Yet, journalists and public commentators often fail to appreciate the cumulative social impact that such offending imposes.\n\nIn the broader scheme, this case exemplifies the twin challenges of maintaining public safety while providing meaningful rehabilitative opportunities for those with entrenched criminal behaviours. The dichotomy between social causation theories and legal responsibilisation remains a continual tension point.\n\nI am grateful to Ms Fiona Lewis, who appears on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, and to Mr Kamal Singh, counsel for the defence. Both have provided comprehensive and measured submissions in what is a complex and multifaceted matter. Court staff, including ushers and clerks, are likewise to be commended for their diligent administration, especially amidst ongoing pressures from case backlog.\n\nIn sentencing, the court is bound to apply the principle of parsimony while reflecting both the severity of the offending and your personal circumstances. Custodial sentences, though available, must be reserved for cases where community measures are manifestly inadequate or where public protection demands immediate incapacitation.\n\nYour record and current presentation allow for consideration of a community order incorporating rehabilitative components alongside punitive measures. The Probation Service is asked to furnish a detailed report to advise on the feasibility and compliance risks associated with such an approach.\n\nI indicate that the sentencing tariff will, in due course, take note of the Theft Offences Definitive Guideline issued by the Sentencing Council and relevant appellate rulings.\n\nThe court also reflects upon the necessity to discourage recidivism through educational and cognitive behavioural therapies suited to your profile.\n\nI reserve final sentence to allow receipt of the updated pre-sentence report and any supplementary representations from the parties.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at Sheffield Crown Court. Proceedings have been duly transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of conviction and forthcoming sentence will be lodged with the Central Sentencing Database.\n\nYou are reminded of your right to appeal within 28 days under the statutory provisions set out in the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.\n\nNo reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged.\n\nCosts are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SHEFFIELD  \nR v.
