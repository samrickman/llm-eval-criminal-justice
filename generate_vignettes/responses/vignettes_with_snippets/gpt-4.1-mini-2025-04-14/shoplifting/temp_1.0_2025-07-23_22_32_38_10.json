MR H  \nCase No. MCC/2025/14823  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. A. Calderwood  \nFiled: 14 August 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear today for sentencing following your conviction at trial on a charge of theft by shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct considered in this matter encompasses multiple incidents over a protracted timeframe, primarily in the Manchester metropolitan area, including various retail establishments ranging from chain convenience stores to independent pharmacists and grocery shops. \n\nProcedural History and Context  \nYour arrest occurred on 12 March 2025, subsequent to an extensive investigative effort led by the Greater Manchester Police Acquisitive Crime Unit in liaison with the Manchester Business Crime Taskforce. This multi-agency collaboration sought to mitigate the repeated disruption faced by local businesses due to increasing incidents of shop theft that had attracted concern among both proprietors and community policing teams.  \n\nIt is notable that the coordination of evidence and intelligence in shoplifting cases presents several practical difficulties. These include disparate and unaligned CCTV systems across different premises, varying standards and resolutions of imagery, and a general paucity of eyewitness testimony given the often anonymised environments of high street retail. The process often demands painstaking collation, receipt analysis, and where applicable, forensic examination of recovered items or items found in the possession of the defendant or associates. The policing resources absorbed by these efforts are non-trivial, especially in an operational context where violent and organised crime investigators compete for scarce demand-led deployments.  \n\nIn your matter, the investigative phase culminated in your interview under caution, which took place on 16 March 2025. During this interview, you denied the allegations, although subsequent corroborating evidence encoded through security footage and witness accounts led to your charge. The case proceeded through the usual stages of pre-trial management, under the auspices of the Better Case Management (BCM) protocols intended to secure early clarity, reduce avoidable delay, and promote efficient trial preparation. There were no material delays attributable to listing constraints or administrative backlog.  \n\nYour defence counsel applied for an adjournment to permit the instruction of a psychiatric evaluation relevant to mitigation and risk assessment; this application was granted, resulting in a rescheduled sentence date of 14 August 2025. I am grateful to the probation service and Dr Siobhan Greaves, consultant forensic psychiatrist, for the detailed reports provided and for their continued engagement with your case.  \n\nIt must be observed that applications for psychological or psychiatric assessment are both routine and necessary in matters where mitigating circumstances or issues of mental health vulnerability may be germane. It is regrettable, nevertheless, that contemporaneous strain on the Legal Aid Agency continues to produce episodes of procedural delay, exacerbating the load on all court users—defendants, counsel, judiciary alike. The court notes continuing calls for reform to streamline these essential support functions while balancing expenditure prudence with the fundamental right to a fair hearing.  \n\nI also acknowledge the written representations provided by the Manchester Retail Victim Liaison Service, who have collated several victim impact statements highlighting the disruption, distress, and cumulative financial loss occasioned by your actions. The statements describe not only direct losses of stock but also consequential effects—alterations in staff rotas, increased security measures, and a perceptible atmosphere of anxiety among frontline workers.  \n\nGeneral Observations on the Context of Low-Level Acquisitive Crime  \nWe find ourselves in a period characterised by continued increases in low-level acquisitive offences, including shop theft. Vanishingly few of these attract media attention or public discourse beyond passing mentions in regional reports. Yet the social cost is substantial—not only in pounds sterling but in the emotional toll on workers and communities. The proliferation of such conduct corrodes social cohesion and undermines trust in commercial and public spaces.   \n\nThe court’s role is not to sermonise but to apply the law judicially, responding firmly and with appropriate proportionality. Over recent years, appellate authorities have underscored the seriousness to be accorded to such offences where they form part of an organised, persistent or escalating pattern. Equally, the courts recognise the need for rehabilitation, especially where underlying factors such as mental health difficulties or acute social deprivation are evident.  \n\nOf relevance here is the Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Whittaker [2022] EWCA Crim 2054, which engaged with the sentencing of repeat shoplifters presenting with a history of untreated substance misuse and unstable housing. The judgment stressed the importance of including appropriate community-based interventions where feasible but simultaneously affirmed that repeated breaches of trust cannot be lightly treated.  \n\nI also reflect on the judgment in R v. Fenwick [2021] EWCA Crim 2289, which concerned a defendant convicted of theft from charity shops using distraction techniques. The Court emphasised that offenses committed in places often reliant on volunteer labour entailed a particular degree of moral reprehensibility, calling for sentences with both deterrence and rehabilitative effect.  \n\nIn this broader legal environment, I must turn to your own offending and the circumstances in which it arose.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  \n\nThe nature of your conduct betrays more than a fleeting temptation or momentary lapse. This was a repeated pattern of behaviour, marked by some degree of planning and an apparent disregard for the consequences to the affected businesses and their employees. The use of bags and layered clothing to conceal items, coupled with occasioned uses of distraction, signifies a degree of sophistication not usually observed in those who commit a one-off or spontaneous act of theft.  \n\nFor context, the court must mention the scale of disruption caused by even a series of low-value offences. Retailers often experience shrinkage rates in the mid-single-digit percentages overall, but the economic impact of individual offenders forming part of that statistic is real and cumulative. In particular, independent or smaller retailers, which operate at comparatively thin margins and often rely on local community goodwill, are hit disproportionately hard.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  \n\nThough no physical violence or threat was ever reported, the psychological impact on staff cannot be overlooked. Multiple victim impact statements describe ongoing worry, reduced job satisfaction, requests for altered work patterns, and, in some cases, the need for management to impose lock-downs of vulnerable merchandise. The cumulative culture of fear and vigilance inevitably alters the working environment.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nIt bears consideration that the wider effects of repeat shoplifting extend beyond simple financial loss and personal inconvenience. The Manchester Retail Crime Taskforce have highlighted to the court that persistent offenders place escalating pressure on local policing budgets and contribute to elevated insurance premiums for businesses. The resource allocation required to investigate such offences frequently diverts officers from other priorities.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\nTurning to ancillary matters, the broader societal backdrop against which acquisitive offending occurs warrants mention. Increasing homelessness, economic precarity, and reductions in welfare supports interlock to create a strain on social safety nets. This is underscored by reports from charities such as Greater Manchester Food Aid Network and Shelter North West, which work to support vulnerable individuals facing multiple challenges. Their observations of increased demand for emergency support reflect societal pressures that the courts observe but must nonetheless adjudicate within the framework of law and order.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  \n\nOn an institutional level, it is worth noting that the Legal Aid Agency in this jurisdiction continues to face mounting pressure to process requests for funding authorisations with adequate expedition. Delays in scientific testing requests or expert psychological evaluations have caused, in some cases, postponements that place stress on all involved parties.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  \n\nExpert Psychiatric Assessment and Probation Report  \nThe psychiatric evaluation commissioned to assist the court’s understanding of your antecedents and current state was performed by Dr Siobhan Greaves in May 2025. Her detailed report concludes that you suffer no major mental illness; rather, the profile suggests traits of impulsivity, low mood, and an untreated mild dependence on alcohol. It is further observed that you have had limited engagement with social and clinical services, despite multiple opportunities for referral from police liaison officers and community outreach workers.  \n\nThe probation assessment authored by Officer Tamsin Wells indicates medium risk of reoffending with low risk of harm to others. It is recorded that you are unemployed and reside in temporary accommodation provided under the Manchester City Council Housing Support Programme but have inconsistent attendance at allocated appointments for employment or welfare advice.  \n\nIt is important for the court to note that, while support services including financial counselling, substance use interventions, and mental health referrals have been offered repeatedly, your uptake has been uneven and often tentative. This situation exemplifies the ongoing and frustrating challenge faced by public service providers who strive to reduce recidivism in the face of complex, overlapping needs.  \n\nYour record discloses multiple prior convictions for shoplifting dating back to 2017, several of which resulted in community-based sentences. The recurrence demonstrates a clear pattern of offending behaviour that interventions to date have failed to interrupt. This is especially pertinent when considering the prospects of rehabilitation and the safety of the public.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  \n\nChairing a glance now towards material ancillary decisions, I recall that the defendant’s co-tenant, Mr Callaghan, was arrested in a wholly unrelated matter concerning possession of controlled substances with intent to supply. Investigations led to the discovery of Class B and C substances within the shared accommodation but hold no bearing on the current case save for the logistical pressures on police resources these separate enquiries occasioned.  \n\nFurther, it must be recorded that your former partner is currently subject to separate proceedings for an alleged breach of a civil harassment order. The unrelated nature of those proceedings underscores the complexities often faced by individuals intertwined in multifaceted social challenges.  \n\nConsideration must also be given to the persistent operational pressures on crime analysts and digital forensic teams within Greater Manchester Police. The increasing prevalence of encrypted messaging and anonymous transactions complicates investigations, demanding greater expertise and time investment per offender. These factors exacerbate challenges in establishing evidential clarity, especially in cases involving low-value items dispersed across multiple premises.  \n\nIn this regard, the court acknowledges the efforts of Ms Clare Donovan, a member of the Greater Manchester Retail Crime Intelligence Unit, whose specialist brief includes the collation of retail theft data and dissemination of alerts to partner agencies. Her recent submission highlights concerns regarding the limited penetration of crime prevention education among repeat offenders under thirty years of age, suggesting the need for enhanced multi-agency approaches.  \n\nThe court is, regrettably, familiar with the uneven uptake of initiatives such as the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) and the implementation of integrated offender management programmes targeting prolific acquisitive offenders. Such programmes, while invaluable, struggle under capacity constraints and variable offender engagement.  \n\nAs part of the background, it is worth drawing attention to legal principles established in R v. Connors [2019] EWCA Crim 766, where the Court underscored the principle that sentencing must account not only for harm to identifiable individuals but to the social fabric more broadly, especially in recurrent acquisitive behaviour undermining community confidence. Although Connors dealt with aggravated taking of motor vehicles, its dicta are apposite in the context of repeat shoplifting impacting urban retail ecosystems.  \n\nThe evolving jurisprudence surrounding sentencing in theft offences also invites consideration of the Sentencing Council's guideline preamble, which recognises that the repetitive nature of offending, particularly with little sign of procedural compliance or remorse, marks a distinct sentencing category. It recommends consideration of custodial sentences where community supervision has demonstrably failed, subject to offender vulnerability and rehabilitative potential.  \n\nClosing Observations  \nIn preparation for sentencing, I have thoroughly reviewed all procedural records, expert reports, victim submissions, and counsel’s oral and written submissions. I acknowledge that the late stage at which you entered your guilty plea reduced the prospective benefit from credit, in line with established appellate guidance that emphasises timing and sincerity over strategic or tactical admissions.  \n\nThe court has also reviewed correspondence from Shelter Manchester, a charity supporting people in precarious accommodation, which set out ongoing commitments to supporting you post-sentence, conditional upon engagement. These efforts are commendable but contingent upon a degree of personal responsibility and constructive participation going forward.  \n\nIn terms of sentencing options, this court is mindful of the pressing need to balance deterrence, punishment, rehabilitation, and public protection. The latter, in particular, assumes heightened significance given the pattern of reoffending and limited engagement to date with support services. However, custodial sentences must never be imposed reflexively, especially where viable community interventions might reduce risk and facilitate reintegration.  \n\nTo that end, I will direct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared. The probation service shall give detailed consideration to available community rehabilitation programmes, including cognitive-behavioural work targeting acquisitive offending, impulse control, and substance use where appropriate. The report will also assess the feasibility of a structured unpaid work requirement aimed at visible community benefit while promoting personal accountability.  \n\nI remind all parties that where custodial sentences are imposed, the imposition must be justifiable on the grounds of inability to deter by lesser means, or to protect the public from serious harm. The court must also consider the impact of incarceration on accommodation status, family networks, and mental health.  \n\nThe public interest is served not only by appropriate punishment but by the promotion of strategies that reduce repeat offending, facilitate desistance, and support stable tenancy and employment where possible. Accordingly, the forthcoming sentencing decision will be informed with a view to these multifaceted objectives.  \n\nIt is of no small note that the increasing prevalence of smartphone recording amongst commercial premises staff and customers has marginally improved evidential quality in theft cases, but cannot substitute the broader social and institutional responses essential to meaningful progress.  \n\nIn conclusion, the court today sets the matter down for sentence on 4 September 2025, at which time any further reports, representations from probation, and submissions from counsel will be duly considered. The defendant is reminded that sentencing decisions are at the discretion of the Court, conditioned by statute, guideline frameworks, case law, and the facts as established through evidence.  \n\nI thank Ms Jennifer Langford, representing the Crown, and Mr Michael Forbes for the defence, who has acted diligently throughout proceedings notwithstanding the universal frustrations imposed by systemic delays in funding authorisations. The courtroom staff, including usher Gary Sykes, and court clerk Mrs Helen O’Brien, are likewise acknowledged for ensuring today's proceedings were conducted smoothly.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 August 2025, in Court 5 at Manchester Crown Court. All proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record will be sent to the appropriate custodial and supervisory authorities for implementation. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal against any sentence imposed within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved for determination at sentencing.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  \nR v.
