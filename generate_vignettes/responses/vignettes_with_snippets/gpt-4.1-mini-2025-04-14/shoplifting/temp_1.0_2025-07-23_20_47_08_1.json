MR H  \nCase No. T2025/18479  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. Fairchild  \nFiled: 18 August 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in respect of a charge arising under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely, a course of conduct involving shoplifting offences allegedly occurring over the period from early 2023 through to the spring of 2025. The prosecution case concerns thefts committed at several retail premises within Leicester city and the adjacent districts. The complainants are a mixture of large chain supermarkets and independent convenience stores located in areas experiencing longstanding socioeconomic pressures.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour initial appearance was before Leicester Magistrates’ Court on 12 March 2025. Following the submission of evidence by the Crown Prosecution Service and your indication of a not guilty plea at that stage, the case was committed to this Crown Court for trial. The listing was set following a plea and trial preparation hearing held on 24 April 2025. You initially maintained your plea of not guilty but subsequently entered a guilty plea on 15 July 2025, immediately before the scheduled trial date. This plea shift, occurring after an extended period in which multiple hearings were occupied in ensuring full disclosure was received and forensic evidence processed, has a significant bearing on the level of credit for plea that may be given.\n\nThe Better Case Management (BCM) protocol has governed the procedural progression of this matter, facilitating role-specific deadlines for disclosure, statements, and witness availability confirmation. It is to be regretted, however, that the typical procedural timeline was interrupted due to delays in Legal Aid authorisation arising from your defence counsel’s several attempts to instruct a forensic behavioral psychologist. A formal letter of instruction was not approved until late June, notwithstanding a request submitted in early April. Such delay is regrettable and symptomatic of the larger systemic issues facing funding bodies tasked with balancing fiscal constraints and access to justice.\n\nThe court records its thanks to the various administrative officers and crown court staff for their forbearance during these numerous adjournments, not least as the court building itself underwent a minor refurbishment over the spring months which, though intended to enhance public accessibility, at times contributed to logistical complexity.\n\nIt must also be recorded that the Legal Aid Agency’s processing of your representation order was impacted by a regional strike action affecting administrative staff, compounding the delays in approval for funding of expert reports. The implications of such workforce industrial action continue to affect the criminal justice system and, regrettably, create significant knock-on effects for timely case progression.\n\nThis court further notes the quiet but no less significant role played by local retail staff and community safety officers, who have borne the brunt of the incidents underlying the present charge. Representations received from the Leicester Retail Against Crime Partnership commend the professionalism of shop assistants who have been required to provide witness statements with limited resources and under difficult working conditions, frequently facing intimidation from repeat offenders.\n\nIn addition, correspondence received from the Leicester Safer Neighbourhoods Team details the challenges of balancing deployment between high-priority violent crime investigations and managing persistent acquisitive crime. The operational pressures are well known to this court and underscore the allocative strains within contemporary policing frameworks.\n\nIt is proper in this context to observe that the court’s jurisdiction here is that of a Crown Court by virtue of the charge carrying a potential custodial sentence exceeding six months and the complexity of issues arising from the indictment. This court is thus empowered not only to impose custodial sentences but also community orders incorporating rehabilitation requirements, provided such options align with the statutory criteria and public protection objectives.\n\nIt is notable that, although the thefts involved relatively low-value goods, the cumulative impact includes both economic loss and emotional distress among victims, with some reports highlighting an increase in staff sickness attributable to anxiety. Research into the psychological effects of retail theft on workers indicates a measurable rise in occupational stress attributable to repeated victimisation, even absent physical harm.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\nThe conduct attributed to you, particularly given its repetition and the targeting of vulnerable small businesses alongside larger retail outlets, warrants detailed scrutiny. Your modus operandi, as gleaned from the evidential record, was consistent. The court notes that surveillance footage demonstrates a practiced approach, indicating considerable forethought rather than impulsive opportunism.\n\nI should mention here for the record the separate investigation recently concluded in a neighbouring county involving a co-defendant charged with offences of fly-tipping on green belt land, a matter entirely unrelated to your case except that it arose from the same initial police tasking. That co-defendant, in addition, is subject to ongoing proceedings for criminal damage to a church noticeboard in that jurisdiction, details which have no bearing on your circumstances but which serve as a reminder of the multiple offending trajectories that cross paths in the criminal justice system.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}. Some of the items stolen were reportedly antiseptic creams and over-the-counter medications frequently used by vulnerable persons in the community. The thefts thus carry implications for public health, particularly in the context of widespread shortages and rising costs of essential medicines.\n\nBefore expanding further on the facts, this court must address some relevant legal principles and precedent upon which sentencing should be based.\n\nLegal Context and Case Law  \nThe Theft Act 1968, under which you stand charged, provides a statutory framework for assessing and responding to dishonesty offences. Section 1 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof.\n\nSection 9 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and associated case law affirm the court’s discretion to treat representation orders flexibly but do not displace the fundamental principle that sentencing must be proportional to the conduct established.\n\nThe Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline (2022) clearly enunciates factors aggravating or mitigating culpability, including the scale, value, targeting of vulnerable victims, repeated incidents, and the presence of threats or violence. Although your offences are non-violent, repeated breaches and the deliberate targeting of small retailers are material aggravating factors.\n\nIn R v. Flynn [2021] EWCA Crim 899, the Court of Appeal emphasised the importance of cumulative impact in theft offences, noting that sustained offending over time affects victim confidence and can warrant immediate custodial sentences, even where individual instances might be considered minor.\n\nFurthermore, as observed in R v. Meadows [2023] EWCA Crim 257, the court reaffirmed that entry into guilty pleas at the earliest reasonable opportunity significantly influences sentencing discount. The late nature of your plea—a matter discussed further below—curtails this mitigating effect.\n\nOther relevant authority includes R v. Alderton [2019] EWCA Crim 1740 which considered the role of diversion and rehabilitation in cases where offenders present with identified vulnerabilities but whose engagement with support services is minimal.\n\nExpert Reports and Support Services  \nA psychiatric evaluation was commissioned and has been received from Dr Jonathan Mills, Consultant Psychiatrist, whose report dated 29 June 2025 provides an analysis of your mental health status and implications for sentencing.\n\nDr Mills concluded that while there is no diagnosable major mental illness, there are indicators of anxiety and a mild depressive disorder, which appear related more to situational factors than enduring pathology. His report highlights significant personality traits linked to impaired impulse control and low frustration tolerance, as well as a history of intermittent misuse of alcohol. Treatment recommendations include cognitive-behavioral therapy and referral to community mental health services, though your engagement has been intermittent at best.\n\nThe report also comments on your refusal to accept referrals to budgeting and housing support services, despite ongoing financial instability documented within the probation records. The refusal of such support is regrettable, as these services can be instrumental in addressing underlying drivers of acquisitive offending.\n\nIt is certainly not unusual that individuals facing economic and psychological distress seek to manage hardship in ways that end in breach of the law. Nonetheless, the judicial process balances compassion with the imperative for public protection and deterrence.\n\nI note, for completeness, that a previous probation officer assigned to a wholly unrelated case involving a defendant charged with affray following a brawl involving pool cues has submitted a neutral character reference indicating the challenges of working with clients resistant to engagement. While the officers involved spoke positively about your demeanour during interview, the absence of sustained engagement is a concern.\n\nThe court also acknowledges the dedicated efforts of Leicester Community Support Services, which support vulnerable persons in securing accommodation and accessing health care. Their input has been invaluable in this matter, particularly in providing up-to-date information about local service availability and constraints.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  \n\nThe patterns of your offending include removing security labels from items and disguising merchandise with bags and clothing items, tactics well known in retail crime circles. These indicate not mere momentary lapses but considered behaviour amounting to calculated dishonesty.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning, although unrelated to your offences, the outcome of a recent prosecution for possession of a bladed article at a school car park within Leicester city centre. That case drew significant local media attention and led to a call for enhanced school security measures. Such incidents, while not directly connected to the sourcing or sale of stolen goods in the present case, demonstrate the range of public order challenges confronting policing in the area.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nBetween December 2024 and March 2025, your visits to specific pharmacy and convenience stores increased, coinciding with shifts in local policing tactics targeting street-level trafficking of stolen goods. These observations informed the surveillance strategy deployed by local officers.\n\nThe court is conscious of the increasing strain placed on public services, including probation, policing, and health, by the cumulative effect of acquisitive crimes such as these. Resources are finite, and the diversion of personnel and funding to low-level offending cases, while necessary, does detract from the capacity to respond to more serious risks.\n\nAlso germane to the public interest is the evidence that persistent shoplifting increases the burden on businesses, some of which have had to reduce opening hours or close entirely, with consequential effects on local employment and community safety.\n\nIn addition to economic loss, victim impact statements collected by the Leicester Retail Crime Forum speak to staff distress, increased workloads, and fear of repeat victimisation. The psychological toll on vulnerable employees, often women working alone during night shifts, is plainly material.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nThe court notes with concern the documented progression of your offending despite previous warnings, including a formal community resolution recorded in 2023. Such failure to desist after earlier sanctions is an aggravating factor.\n\nThe Mitigation  \nThe defendant has submitted several letters from family members and representatives of charitable organisations including Leicester Homeless Outreach and Turning Point, which provide context about your personal circumstances, including recent periods of homelessness and struggles with substance misuse. The court has also received a statement from your sister, Ms Bernadine S., who describes familial relationships marked by instability and punctuated by sporadic contact.\n\nWhilst such material is relevant, it does not negate responsibility. The court recognises the role of social determinants in the genesis of offending but cannot subordinate individual accountability to circumstance alone.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nThe defence has emphasised your accommodation difficulties and points to the ongoing national housing crisis as a complicating factor. There is merit in such observations. The proliferation of temporary accommodation placements, often distant from social networks, exacerbates social exclusion and can, regrettably, contribute to patterns of marginalised behaviour.\n\nFurther, this court acknowledges the impact of rising inflation, increased fuel costs, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic hardship levels. These broader societal pressures complicate any rehabilitation assessment.\n\nNonetheless, the court must be guided primarily by what is proportionate and just in response to your conduct, with due regard to public protection and the need for deterrence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nThe late nature of your guilty plea is regrettable. Early admission of guilt facilitates procedural economy, spares witnesses the ordeal of trial, and generally attracts a greater degree of sentencing leniency. As affirmed in R v. Pritchard [2023] EWCA Crim 1014, late pleas should be afforded reduced credit, especially when the evidence against the defendant is compelling.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nWhile your plea was ultimately entered in advance of trial, it followed lengthy proceedings, and the court must adjust credit accordingly.\n\nI remind all parties that sentencing is not merely punitive but aims to promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism wherever possible. Structured community orders remain viable and often preferable, but only where compliance is realistic and public safety is not compromised.\n\nThe court also notes that the local Better Case Management arrangements seek to minimize delay and increase predictability, yet logistical challenges, including staff shortages, remote working protocols, and increased case volumes, have limited effect in controlling systemic delay.\n\nIt is also worth briefly commenting on the wider context in which this offence exists. Recent data from the National Retail Security Council indicate a modest but sustained increase in shoplifting incidents nationally, attributed in part to reductions in in-store staffing and the increasing sophistication of offenders. Technological advances in CCTV, while helpful, remain imperfect because of privacy considerations, data storage limits, and variations in image quality.\n\nReports from the Leicester City Police Digital Forensics Unit further reflect the burden of processing extensive footage, extracting admissible evidence, and managing case files within stringent timeframes. These demands underscore that the prosecution of small-scale shoplifting is resource-intensive — a cost borne by the public and private sectors alike.\n\nSuch matters, while not determinative, must inform the court’s assessment of the propriety of custodial sentences and community-based penalties alike.\n\nTo that end, this court has directed a pre-sentence report be prepared by Probation Officer Sally Pierce, due within four weeks. The report will assess the risks posed for reoffending, your engagement with and suitability for community-based interventions — including cognitive skills training and rehabilitation activity requirements — and the availability of stable accommodation and employment support. The report should also encompass assessment for potential substance misuse treatment pathways.\n\nThis sentencing hearing has been conducted in open court. I record my thanks to Ms Emma Goodwin, who appears on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Adam Forsyth, who represents Mr H under a Legal Aid order. I note again with dismay the repeated delays encountered in the processing of funding applications for expert reports and the systemic difficulties afflicting the administration of justice.\n\nThe proceedings today have been conducted with due seriousness but also in a spirit of constructive engagement on the part of counsel and court staff. It remains imperative that cases such as these progress without undue delay, as justice delayed risks justice denied.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Leicester. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities, including the Police National Computer and Probation Service.\n\nMr H is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to sections 108 and 111 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 respectively. There are no reporting restrictions engaged by virtue of section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 in connection with this case.\n\nNo further directions are made as to costs at this time.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEICESTER  \nR v.
