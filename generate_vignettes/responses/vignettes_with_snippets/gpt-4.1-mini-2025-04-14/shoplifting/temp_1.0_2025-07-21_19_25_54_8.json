MR H  \nCase No. T2025/14537  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. Carmichael  \nFiled: 16 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court today for sentence in relation to charges brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically shoplifting offences spanning the latter months of 2023 and continuing through to early 2025. These offences were committed across various retail establishments situated within Greater Manchester’s commercial districts, including areas of Salford and Stockport. The charges represent a pattern of sustained and calculated acquisitive offending, for which the Crown seeks a custodial or community sentence commensurate with the gravity of your conduct.\n\nProcedural Background  \nYou were initially arrested on 9 March 2025 following an investigation by the Greater Manchester Police Retail Crime Unit, which had been conducting a multi-agency operation targeting repeat offenders within the region's commercial corridors. This investigation was notable for its breadth and complexity, involving collaborative efforts between local policing teams, loss prevention personnel, and community safety partnerships. The case file, now exceeding 400 pages, includes digitally recorded witness statements, recovered CCTV footage, and forensic analyses linking you to multiple incidents.  \nI note with approval that, unlike many matters involving low-value theft, this case progressed within reasonable timeframes, at least according to the schedule expected under the Criminal Procedure Rules and Better Case Management (BCM) protocols. The cooperation demonstrated by counsel for the Crown and the defence in adhering to listing dates contributed significantly to this efficient progression. The case was listed for plea and trial preparation hearing on 23 May 2025, following initial disclosure and after lengthy consideration of submitted evidentiary material.  \n\nIt is worth observation that the BCM model, as introduced in recent years and refined in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, aims to ensure that cases such as this, which might otherwise be subject to delay and fragmentation, proceed with a greater measure of clarity and expedition. Such reforms also serve to alleviate the administrative burden which routinely impairs the functioning of the criminal courts in matters of this nature. In the present instance, the progress from charge to plea (albeit late) occurred within the anticipated framework.  \n\nThe initial plea was not guilty, and a contested trial was scheduled for 15 July 2025. However, on the eve of that trial, a late guilty plea was entered, necessitating the rescheduling of sentencing. The court has reflected upon the significance of such late pleas, mindful both of established authorities and of the impacts on court resources and victim interests. The jurisprudence establishes, with clarity, that the timing of a plea materially affects the extent of any permitted credit. It is no entitlement, but a privilege that may be withheld or limited. A plea that comes under duress or only when the weight of evidence is overwhelming provides markedly less mitigation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\nThe role of multi-agency collaboration in cases akin to the present can scarcely be overstated. The Greater Manchester Retail Crime Partnership, a coalition of law enforcement agencies, public sector bodies, and representative retail groups, has made commendable progress in coordinating responses to such persistent offending patterns. Their intelligence-led approach, emphasizing real-time information sharing, data analytics, and operational liaison, seeks to anticipate offending behaviour and disrupt it before escalation. It is notable, however, that despite these advances, the pressure on frontline police officers tasked with such investigations remains substantial, particularly given competing demands in areas marked by elevated gang activity and violent crime. This allocation of resources underscores the broader societal impact of shoplifting, which, though often minimised, thereby carries consequences extending beyond the immediate financial loss.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  \n\nIt is vital to place this case within the prevailing jurisprudential landscape. Authorities such as R v. Ellis [2019] EWCA Crim 345 and R v. Abasi [2022] EWCA Crim 573 have solidified the principle that repeated acquisitive offending, including shoplifting, warrants a response calibrated to both public protection and offender rehabilitation. Ellis underscores the aggravation occasioned by persistence and evidence of planning, while Abasi highlights the importance of considering the cumulative psychological impact on those victimised, including store employees often overlooked in earlier sentencing frameworks. Such authorities guide this court’s approach today, informing not only sentencing severity but also the conditions which may accompany any community disposal.  \n\nI acknowledge that the case arose contemporaneously with considerable systemic strain on local justice services. The Crown’s diligent representatives, led by Ms Miranda Cartwright, prosecuted with evident thoroughness despite significant administrative hurdles and ongoing Legal Aid Agency delays. Conversely, the defence, led by Mr Paul Johnson, sought authorisations for psychiatric and forensic expert assessments, essential given emerging concerns about the defendant's vulnerability and mental health status. The protracted approval process for such funding underscores once again the limitations of the current legal aid regime. As this court has previously remarked, delays down this route regularly obstruct the timely administration of justice, disproportionately impacting defendants who either lack personal means or depend on complex inter-agency coordination. This regrettable pattern continues despite reform initiatives.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  \n\nThe court has also received and carefully considered numerous written representations from local community groups, including the Manchester Business Coalition Against Crime (MBCAC) and the South Manchester Voluntary Support Network (SMVSN). These bodies articulate the broader community implications of acquisitive crime, highlighting the unseen ripple effects that extend into employee wellbeing, local business viability, and public confidence in safety. Particularly noteworthy were victim impact statements provided by several stores, including statements from managers and front-line retail assistants, reflecting anxiety and diminished morale occasioned by repeated shoplifting incidents. That these statements were gathered despite the chronic under-resourcing of victim liaison services merits recognition.  \n\nPrior to today’s hearing, the court received an independent psychiatric report prepared by Dr Eleanor Stone, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at St. Mary’s Hospital. Dr Stone conducted an extensive clinical interview and reviewed available records. Her report, comprehensive and professionally presented, identified significant difficulties with impulse control and emotional regulation linked to a history of attachment disorder. Whilst the report does not diagnose any major psychotic or mood disorder, it emphasises the presence of maladaptive personality traits that likely influence offending behaviour. Dr Stone also recommends engagement with specialist cognitive behavioural therapy designed to address criminogenic thinking patterns as part of any rehabilitative framework. The report underscores that while these factors do not excuse criminal responsibility, they require recognition in sentencing both for fairness and effectiveness of intervention.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nIt is important to remark that this case proceeded against a backdrop of increasing public concern regarding street-level acquisitive crime in Manchester, notably shoplifting and associated behaviours such as antisocial conduct. Council and Police initiatives, including Operation Retail Shield, have sought to reduce offending through a combination of enforcement, diversion, and offender management. Despite these efforts, offences of this nature persist, frequently complicated by underlying socioeconomic deprivation, substance misuse, and mental health challenges that defy simple remedy. Observers note a marked decline in the effectiveness of traditional deterrents, alongside a growing appreciation of the need for integrated, trauma-informed frameworks addressing underlying vulnerability, rather than solely focussing on punitive responses. Such complexity requires courts and other agencies to balance competing imperatives carefully.  \n\nThe court also notes with sadness the persistent challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency in timely funding decisions for expert reports or specialist interventions. The procedural history demonstrates multiple requests, clarifications, and supervisory reviews before resources were authorised for the instruction of appropriate clinical expertise. Such delays not only prolong proceedings but impede forensic insight critical to apt case resolution. It remains paramount that decision-makers within the legal aid framework recognise the value of expeditious approval, particularly in cases where underlying vulnerability may be significant.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\nCases bearing partial analogy to the present include R v. Daniels [2024] EWCA Crim 789, concerning possession of a bladed article in a school car park, and R v. Mitchell [2023] EWCA Crim 609, involving aggravated burglary with minor violence. While neither case relates directly to shoplifting, they illustrate the wider sentencing principles applicable to offenders presenting mixed risk profiles with potential for public harm. In Daniels, the Court of Appeal emphasised the necessity of assessing both the precipitating circumstances and subsequent engagement with rehabilitative services. Mitchell held that where risk behaviours are coupled with evidence of substance misuse and non-compliance with supervision, custodial sentences with extended licence conditions may be appropriate to ensure public protection. Neither case parallels your offending in gravity, but they highlight the principles governing judicial discretion.  \n\nIn giving these remarks, it would be remiss not to mention the enduring phenomena of “late pleas” and their consequences. Your decision to enter a guilty plea on the morning of the scheduled trial, after prolonged denial, is a regrettable but familiar pattern. As established in leading cases, including R v. Clarke [2023] EWCA Crim 412, credit for such pleas must be modest. The timing offers scant real benefit to victims, witnesses, or court efficiency. Whilst the law preserves the right to change plea at any stage, the court must balance that right against the public interest in timely, fair resolution.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  \n\nThe facts, as proven by the Crown and accepted by you through your plea, describe theft taking place in multiple shops. Surveillance footage and witness accounts demonstrate your deliberate acts of concealment and evasion. Multiple incidents show a consistent modus operandi: approaching shelves bearing high-demand consumer goods, removing items surreptitiously, then exiting without payment. The court is informed that you frequently used techniques designed to distract staff, including feigned phone calls and obfuscation by clothing layers.  \n\nNotably, though no assault or violence is present, the psychological effect upon store personnel is palpable. The victim impact statements describe a climate of insecurity, with some staff reporting stress-related symptoms and reduced confidence. This effect, while intangible, informs the court’s assessment of harm.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  \n\nThe persistence of offending despite previous community-based disposals, including warnings and conditional cautions, aggravates the seriousness of your conduct. It signals an unwillingness or inability to desist without firm intervention. The probation service’s pre-sentence report, prepared by Officer Hannah Melrose, identifies medium likelihood of further offending without meaningful engagement in rehabilitative programmes. The report also notes your unstable housing situation and absence of meaningful employment, though these are contextual factors rather than direct mitigation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  \n\nThere remains, in this jurisdiction and beyond, a discernible tension regarding the response to acquisitive offending. The court is reminded of the social and economic upheaval occasioned by recent global events — the pandemic, inflationary pressures, and attendant rises in poverty have all contributed to elevated offending in certain strata. Yet, these factors do not grant licence to flout the law nor diminish the impact upon victims. Nor do they absolve the responsibility to engage proactively with available support.  \n\nThe probation service has been engaged throughout these proceedings, albeit constrained by significant caseload pressures and limited resources. The officer assigned, Ms Melrose, reports commendable efforts to involve you in services addressing financial management and substance use, but these overtures have, to date, failed to yield consistent participation. This dynamic is, regrettably, a familiar and persistent feature of cases involving repeat acquisitive offenders.  \n\nHaving weighed the multiple factors before me, including the seriousness of the offending, the impact on victims, the aggravating feature of persistence despite prior intervention, and your personal circumstances and vulnerabilities as identified in clinical assessment, I shall direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report. This report will assist the court in identifying the most appropriate sentencing framework—whether custodial or community-based—that balances punitive, rehabilitative, and protective aims.  \n\nI note the provisions of the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline, particularly the guidelines concerning repeat offending and the presence of aggravating and mitigating factors. The guideline appropriately emphasizes the importance of addressing risks of harm and the accused’s capacity to engage with rehabilitative services.  \n\nI also reiterate that a sentence imposing immediate custody may be warranted where offending demonstrates persistence and disregard for sanctions, but equally, the guidance recognises the value of community orders supplemented by tailored interventions where compliance can be reasonably expected. The forthcoming pre-sentence report will be invaluable in guiding this determination.  \n\nThe court acknowledges the contributions of all those involved in this matter: to Ms Cartwright and her colleagues for the diligent prosecution; to Mr Johnson for his thorough and professional defence; to Dr Stone for her expert psychiatric evaluation; and to Ms Melrose and the probation service for their insight and ongoing work in this case. It is also appropriate to place on record the court’s gratitude to the administrative staff and ushers of this court, whose patience and professionalism ensure the smooth conduct of hearings despite the well-documented pressures on court resources.  \n\nThe sentencing hearing today has been conducted in open court with all interested parties present. I remind Mr H of his right to appeal, subject to the applicable time limits and procedural requirements.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2025, in Court 12 of Manchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be made available in due course. The defendant is reminded of his statutory right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are applicable in these proceedings. No further orders as to costs are made at this stage.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  \nR v.
