Mr H  \nCase No. H2025/03847  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. J. PENNINGTON  \nFiled: 14 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for offences of theft, said to have taken place in various retail outlets within the city of Hull and its environs over a period extending from late 2023 through to early 2025. The charges arise under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. In simple terms, the indictment represents a consolidated count reflecting a course of conduct characterised by repeated shoplifting and dishonest appropriation.\n\nThe procedural history of this matter is of some note, for it traverses several months of preparatory hearings, evidential collation, and applications to the Legal Aid Agency for funding of expert assessments. The case was originally lodged at the Magistrates’ Court on 27 January 2025, following an amalgamated referral from local authorities and participating retailers brought together under the auspices of the Hull Retail Crime Prevention Board. From there, it was committed to this Crown Court with a view to trial and sentencing under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, a mechanism designed to streamline the progression of indictable offences by early identification of issues, tailoring of directions, and minimisation of unnecessary delay. Despite these laudable aims, the case experienced some administrative delays, not least occasioned by strike action within the court support staff in April and the late arrival of forensic reports, themselves impeded by competing workload demands placed upon the city forensic laboratory.  \n\nIt is worth remarking the origins of the BCM process. Emerging from reforms in the early 2010s following well-documented concerns over the inefficiencies of criminal case progression, BCM sought to enforce a more rigorous regime of case management by judges, magistrates, and the legal teams. Its provisions require early disclosure, case allocation, and movement toward fully defined trial readiness, fostering early admissions where appropriate, and thereby alleviating pressure upon the court list. The adoption of BCM principles has transformed the landscape of serious crime prosecution, notwithstanding certain continuing challenges related to resource constraints and complexity. The present matter proceeded against this framework, with initial hearings held on 14 March and 2 July respectively, towards a plea and trial preparation hearing set for 15 September 2025.\n\nConcerning the evidence, you were arrested on 5 September 2025 after a routine patrol disrupted an incident involving items suspected of being unlawfully taken from a convenience store on Ferensway. Your apprehension followed a series of reports and complaints consolidated from multiple retailers, coordinated through the Hull Business Crime Partnership. The investigation involved cross-referencing CCTV footage, electronic point of sale discrepancies, and witness statements from shop assistants and managers. The prosecution case rests significantly on the coherence of these multiple, time-stamped visual records and recovered property allegedly traced back to your possession or immediate control. The Crown’s evidence bundle extends to over 700 pages and includes contemporaneous records and electronic transactions, carefully catalogued and disclosed in full to the defence.\n\nIn R v. Davenport [2019] EWCA Crim 1324, the Court of Appeal reiterated that the offence of theft, particularly where committed as a sustained pattern involving multiple acts over a period, attracts proportionate sentencing reflecting not merely the individual acts but the cumulative effect upon victims and the community. While Davenport concerned supermarket theft exceeding £2,500 in value, the principles established concerning aggravating features such as planning, persistence, and impact are germane here.\n\nFurthermore, the well-known case of R v. Thompson [2021] EWCA Crim 2121—although touching upon a separate category of offences, namely criminal damage—provides useful guidance concerning the role of a late guilty plea in sentencing mitigation. There, the Court opined that credit is primarily designed to reflect early admission and genuine remorse, with delayed pleas, often entered following exhaustive case preparation and overwhelming evidence, attracting markedly reduced reductions. That principle is equally applicable in the context of acquisitive crime.\n\nThis court is also mindful of the provisions of the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on Theft Offences, published most recently in 2020, which emphasises an assessment of culpability, harm, and any aggravating or mitigating features. The guideline directs focus upon the preparatory activities undertaken by the offender, use of deception, targeting of vulnerable victims or premises, and the degree of planning or sophistication. Although the individual monetary values involved in shoplifting often appear modest, the societal harm caused by persistent offending is not to be underestimated.\n\nOver recent years, Hull has seen a notable rise in retail crime reports, partly reflective of larger socio-economic trends within the region. There is ample evidence to suggest that the cumulative burden on small retail operators has intensified, as noted in a 2024 report by the Humber Retail Security Forum. Staffing shortages, heightened threats of antisocial behaviour, and the persistent underfunding of community policing initiatives combine to create increasingly fraught trading conditions. The fallout frequently extends beyond mere financial loss, encompassing diminished employee morale and concerns over personal safety among shop staff.\n\nThe case law also dictates that sentencing in theft cases must balance deterrence with rehabilitation, recognising the pressures that financial hardship and social marginalisation might bring. Nevertheless, personal circumstance cannot excuse repeated breach of the criminal law, especially when previous interventions have been unsuccessful.\n\nPrior to sentencing, expert assessments were commissioned. Notably, Dr Nana Onyeka, consultant forensic psychologist, undertook a comprehensive evaluation in August 2025. Her report, spanning 26 pages and detailed by interview and psychometric testing, indicates a borderline intellectual functioning profile, with underlying difficulties in impulse control and occasional periods of mood lability, but notably no diagnosis of a severe mental illness or major cognitive impairment. Dr Onyeka emphasises the importance of structured engagement with community support in addressing the identified impulsivity and the attendant risk factors.\n\nMeanwhile, the Probation Service’s pre-sentence report, authored by Ms Fiona Crossley, reflects on your history of limited sustained employment, housing instability, and prior informal warnings by retail security, yet notes your reluctance to participate in voluntary community programmes. The report flags a moderate risk of reoffending and urges consideration of a rehabilitative regime incorporating cognitive-behavioural components.\n\nIt is a matter of concern that, despite repeated offers of support from outreach and voluntary agencies—such as Hull Homeless Outreach and the Retail Support Alliance—you have opted predominantly not to engage. Such engagement is integral to effecting behavioural change and reducing recidivism. It is also telling that your own statements often attribute responsibility to external factors rather than recognising agency and choice.\n\nThe administrative challenges faced by Legal Aid practitioners in securing timely funding for expert assessments, particularly in resource-squeezed areas, have been a recurring feature in this and other similar cases. Applications for funding to instruct independent psychiatrists or psychologists often undergo protracted delay, as was the case here, potentially impeding expeditious resolution and undermining the defendant’s access to justice. While no direct culpability attaches to any party, the systemic inefficiencies serve only to prolong proceedings and place additional strain on judicial resources.\n\nIt is necessary now to turn to the facts underlying the conviction. The evidence adduced at trial establishes that you engaged on multiple occasions in deliberate acts of theft from a range of retail outlets. Such conduct was not impulsive or opportunistic, but marked by deliberate planning and repeated execution over several months. Multiple staff statements describe your behaviour as rehearsed and covert, using various concealment techniques and often returning repeatedly to the same premises. The recurrent nature of your actions, targeting items frequently resold on informal markets, reveals an ongoing and intentional pattern of acquisitive offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nThese considerations are germane to the evaluation of culpability and the appropriate quantum of sentence.\n\nIn addition to the direct consequences to each individual establishment affected by your offending, there has been a broader economic impact. Independent shops have spoken through victim impact statements to the increased costs and disruption caused by such sustained loss, resulting in reduced opening hours and the scaling back of staff numbers to mitigate vulnerability. Such knock-on effects extend beyond immediate financial loss to degrade community confidence and disrupt social cohesion.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nThe court acknowledges that you are currently aged 34 and present with a limited custodial record, though including prior warnings and conditional discharges for related acquisitive conduct. Your reported history of homelessness and economic hardship is noted, as is your engagement in sporadic employment, often precarious and of short duration. There is no evidence of gang affiliation or organised criminality, which might otherwise attract enhanced sanction.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nThe victim impact statements from affected store employees reflect a palpable stress and diminution of workplace confidence as a result of your offending. Several refer to an atmosphere of apprehension, as repeat low-level theft not only diminishes stock but interrupts day-to-day operation and places staff under additional monitoring requirements.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nIt must also be underscored that your behaviour has persisted despite a series of community resolutions and warnings from law enforcement and local retail security teams aimed at diverting you from further offending. Such interventions did not succeed in altering your course. Instead, reports indicate a return to similar conduct within a matter of weeks or months.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}. {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nThese circumstances elevate the seriousness of the offence and weigh heavily upon the sentencing decision.\n\nWhilst the courtroom today reflects on established sentencing principles—punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection—it must also grapple with larger systemic pressures. Public services, including probation and social care, face sustained underfunding, rising caseloads, and dilapidated infrastructure. The NHS mental health services in particular struggle under mounting referral lists and extended waiting times, challenging the delivery of timely and effective intervention for vulnerable individuals.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nThe court is mindful that in R v. Wilcox [2022] EWCA Crim 1543 the Court of Appeal highlighted the importance of balancing custodial necessity with non-custodial options where appropriate, especially when underlying vulnerabilities appear in the offender’s psychosocial profile. The present case demands similarly careful weighing of factors.\n\nIt is unfortunate this court has become accustomed, with dismay, to repeated references to the poor state of Legal Aid funding and the corresponding impact upon quality of representation and expert outreach. Such systemic shortcomings risk undermining the administration of justice, yet remain beyond judicial authority to remedy. A case pending since early 2025 might well have concluded months earlier absent such complications.\n\nI also record the participation and contributions of those working in Hull’s voluntary and community sector—including the Hull Retailers’ Support Hub and the East Yorkshire Community Trust—whose dedication continues unabated despite severe financial constraints. Their carefully considered reports and the eloquence of their written submissions testify to a commitment seldom fully acknowledged in public discourse.\n\nThe court notes with regret that the custody suite at Hull Police Station continues to see overcrowding and staffing pressures, which have implications for detainee welfare and timely processing.\n\nPublic interest in retail crime remains mixed. As this court has observed, such offences rarely attract media attention unless linked to violence or spectacular scenes. Yet, they constitute a substantial proportion of the criminal docket and a significant drain on policing and judicial resources.\n\nThe evidence before the court also demonstrates, contrary to any suggestion of inadvertence, that your acts involved deception, repeated subterfuge, and deliberate attempts to defeat store security measures, including removal or concealment of packaging and labels. On a number of occasions, accomplices were allegedly used to create distraction, though no conclusive evidence associates you with any co-offenders.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nThese observations help delineate your role and culpability within the overarching course of conduct.\n\nAppreciation is extended to Ms Samantha Fairchild, who appears for the Crown, for her able and thorough presentation of the case. Likewise, I thank Mr Benjamin Havers, appointed under a representation order, for his professional advocacy on behalf of you, the defendant.\n\nIt is important, also, to acknowledge the work and professionalism of the court clerks, ushers, and security personnel in ensuring the proceedings have been conducted orderly and without disruption, despite ongoing refurbishment works in this courtroom.\n\nThe hearing has been conducted in open court. It is a matter of proper public record that low-level offending such as that before this court is no less serious in its cumulative impact simply because it involves sum values which might be individually trivial. There are victims whose voices must be heard and whose experiences must be respected. The wholesale dismissal of shoplifting as victimless crime ignores the realities of victim suffering, financial strain, and community degradation.\n\nThe court has also given consideration to the wider societal context in which such offences occur. The spectre of entrenched poverty, housing insecurity, and social marginalisation cannot be ignored, though neither can they be permitted to serve as blanket exculpations. This court remains conscious of the delicate balancing act within sentencing: recognising human frailty and systemic failure, while maintaining the imperative of law and order.\n\nI emphasise that the statutory framework directs that the sentence imposed must be just in all circumstances, reflecting the nature and seriousness of the offence, the character and antecedents of the offender, and the purposes of sentencing enshrined in statute and developed in jurisprudence.\n\nThe preferable approach, with a case of this nature, remains the preparation of an up-to-date, comprehensive pre-sentence report, which may incorporate further psychiatric and social assessments as necessary and explore avenues for intervention within both custodial and community contexts.\n\nSentence will be deferred pending receipt of such a report, allowing the probation service the opportunity fully to assess risk, need, and proposal for rehabilitation, consistent with public protection.\n\nThis court accordingly reserves final sentencing for a date to be fixed following delivery of the pre-sentence report. The defendant will be entitled to make further representations at that time.\n\nThis document constitutes the sentencing remarks of Her Honour Judge L. J. Pennington, delivered on 14 October 2025 within Court 4 of the Crown Court at Hull. The proceedings have been digitally recorded in compliance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant and counsel are advised of the right to appeal this decision pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, with the prescribed 28-day time limit. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are in effect.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HULL  \nR v.
