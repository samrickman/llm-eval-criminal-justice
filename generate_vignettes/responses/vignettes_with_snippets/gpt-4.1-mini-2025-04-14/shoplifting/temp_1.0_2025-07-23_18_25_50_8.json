MR H  \nCase No. B2025/04519  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. C. Westbrook  \nFiled: 14 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence on a charge of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences for which you have been convicted represent a sustained pattern of shoplifting over a period extending from late 2023 through to the spring of 2025, predominantly within the greater Bristol metropolitan area and adjacent suburban districts. The court recognizes that the offending behaviour, while involving goods of relatively low monetary value individually, collectively represents a significant breach of trust and public order, with consequential effects touching on economic loss, staff wellbeing, and community confidence.\n\nProcedural History  \nThis matter first came to official attention on 19 November 2024, prompting an investigation led by the Bristol Police Retail Crime Unit in conjunction with the Avon & Somerset Business Crime Reduction Partnership. The initial reports of suspected thefts were received sporadically across several small businesses, including local convenience stores and independent pharmacies. The reports were initially treated as isolated reports of petty crime, a regrettably common assumption in the handling of retail acquisitive offences. However, subsequent cross-matching of CCTV evidence, combined with forensic analysis of recovered goods and behavioural profiling, progressively established a consistent modus operandi, pointing to a single individual responsible for the reported thefts.  \nIt bears emphasis that the business of assembling a robust evidential foundation in such cases is far from straightforward. Footage obtained from cameras varies widely in quality, with many recordings suffering from poor lighting, inadequate angles, or frequent obstruction. Equally, staff turnover, procedural inconsistencies in loss reporting, and the limited availability of formal witness statements frequently hamper efforts to secure convictions. Such realities constitute an ever-present challenge for courts in balancing the rights of defendants with the imperatives of public protection and victim reassurance.  \n\nOn 22 November 2024, you were taken into custody and interviewed under caution at Gloucestershire Custody Suite. Initially, you denied all involvement. Nonetheless, a forensic linkage was made between DNA found on packaging discarded at one scene and that stored on file from an unrelated prior offence. Additionally, a number of your personal effects recovered in a police search were identified as items appearing in CCTV footage. You were charged on 15 December 2024 with multiple counts, subsequently consolidated into a single representative count and earmarked for Crown Court trial, in line with Better Case Management principles aimed at expediting case progression.\n\nThe Better Case Management (BCM) framework was introduced as part of revisions to streamline case flow and reduce judicial delays. Since its inception, it has enabled earlier clarity of issues, and has encouraged more meaningful engagement between prosecution and defence in the preparatory phases. In this case, listing timetables were adhered to, despite some unfortunate delays attributable to staffing shortages in the legal aid solicitors retained to represent you, Mr H. These shortages are symptomatic of broader systemic challenges across the justice sector, linked to funding constraints and the demands of increasing caseloads in criminal courts.  \n\nThe plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 2 July 2025. At that hearing, you initially entered a not guilty plea. It was only on the morning of the scheduled trial commencement on 22 August 2025 that you entered a plea of guilty. The court is compelled to note that such late pleas are not uncommon in cases of this nature. The authorities and courts regard an early plea as instrumental in delivering swifter justice, reducing the burdens upon witnesses and minimizing the disruption caused by full trial preparation. As established in R v. Damer [2020] EWCA Crim 791, the question of plea timing is central to the assessment of credit for remorse and procedural economy.\n\nBy way of further legal context, I draw attention also to R v. Fenwick [2019] EWCA Crim 1454, where the sentencing court recognised the cumulative harm caused to small retailers by repeat episodes of petty theft. That judgment emphasised that the aggregation of low-value thefts into a coherent behavioural pattern justifies custodial sentences in circumstances where purely monetary loss might suggest otherwise. Fenwick acknowledged the wider social damage attributable to persistent acquisitive offending within localised business communities.\n\nIt is also necessary to consider the observation made in R v. Collett [2021] EWCA Crim 2189, where the Court of Appeal condemned the late plea tactics that force witnesses and court officials through protracted case preparations, only for the defendant to capitulate when confronted with an overwhelming evidential matrix. That ruling reinforced the principle that the inducement of discounts for pleas is discretionary, hinging not merely on the fact of pleading guilty, but on its timing in the criminal process.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nTurning, then, to the factual matrix of your offending: the prosecution evidence draws on a combination of fixed CCTV footage, witness statements, and forensic material. Your actions were characterised by a pattern of entering premises during busy or distracted periods, selecting high-turnover goods—such as skincare products and over-the-counter medicines—and concealing them prior to exiting without payment. Certain incidents noted a degree of premeditation in your choice of timing and approach, including visits during staff shift changes or meal breaks.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe cumulative effect on the retail outlets has been profound. Victim impact statements conveyed to the court reveal that several shops have suffered significant stock losses. Some managers have altered operational protocols, including introducing restrictions on lone working and installing additional security measures at considerable expense. In one instance, a local store opted to reduce evening opening hours, citing staff safety concerns tied to anticipated encounters with you. These are not trivial repercussions but represent a tangible intrusion upon the operation and culture of community commerce.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThough the offence involves theft rather than violence, the indirect consequences on staff welfare cannot be overlooked. The sustained pattern of offending has generated anxiety, diminished morale, and a perceptible sense of vulnerability among front-line employees. As it is well recorded in probation service literature, the psychological toll on persons working in vulnerable positions within retail environments is often underestimated. Emotional harm as a sentencing consideration was noted in R v. Pitt [2017] EWCA Crim 43, where the court accepted that distress caused by repeat offending in a confined community setting warranted elevation of penalty beyond simple financial recompense.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThe prosecution also raised evidence indicating that your visits were punctuated by occasional use of a false identity at the point of apprehension, an aggravating factor that evidences consciousness of guilt and efforts to evade detection. Such behaviour negates any claim of spur-of-the-moment error on your part. It further implies a degree of sophistication incompatible with naïveté or inexperience.\n\nIn parallel, the court is mindful of the importance of considering your personal circumstances and wider pattern of behaviour. The available pre-sentence reports are illuminating in this respect. A psychiatric report prepared by Dr Sophie Millard, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed for this case, provides a detailed account of your mental health status and functional capacity.  \n\nDr Millard’s assessment, dated 8 September 2025, reveals the absence of any diagnosable major mental illness, but notes traits consistent with chronic anxiety and features of impulsivity. The report further observes a history of moderate alcohol misuse, though no current dependency is established. Importantly, the report cites your tendency to minimise difficulties and your inconsistent engagement with referral services. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe pre-sentence report authored by Ms Nadia Fletcher, probation officer for the Avon & Somerset Probation Trust, presents a tempered risk analysis highlighting moderate likelihood of reoffending without intervention. The report stresses your unstable housing situation—having resided in temporary shared accommodation since early 2024—and emphasises the detrimental impact this has had on your ability to sustain employment or consistent routines. The social worker’s correspondence from Cedar House Homeless Support Centre underscores these concerns. Staff there document multiple missed appointments, a failure to comply with planned housing support programmes, and intermittent contact.\n\nProbation services across the country find themselves increasingly stretched amidst rising demands for interventions targeting acquisitive offences, substance misuse, and mental health. Such systemic pressures invariably affect the capacity for tailored supervision and rehabilitative programming. It is against this backdrop that the court must evaluate the likelihood of successful community interventions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nFor context, the court notes that the broader criminal justice system has seen an uptick in low-level property crime reporting over the past five years. As reflected in the 2024 Annual Crime Statistics published by the Ministry of Justice, retail theft incidents recorded have increased by approximately 9% nationally since 2020. While it would be superficial to attribute this rise solely to economic uncertainties or pandemic-related disruptions, these factors undoubtedly interact with shifts in social services provision and policing priorities.\n\nIt is also the case, recognized in R v. Connolly [2023] EWCA Crim 1157, that repeat acquisitive offending is often intertwined with underlying social and psychological vulnerabilities. The Court of Appeal there reiterated that sentencing must reflect a balance between individual culpability and the wider public imperative to reduce reoffending through viable support.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nThe defence submissions on your behalf emphasised your expressed remorse and commitment to engage with future support services, as reflected in letters from your current housing officer and an addiction counsellor at the Hopewell Rehabilitation Centre. They acknowledge, however, the somewhat tentative nature of these assurances and the complexities inherent in addressing entrenched patterns of offending behaviour.\n\nIt is also pertinent to acknowledge some external correspondence received from the Bristol Business Volunteers Network, an independent charity providing support to local traders affected by petty theft and anti-social behaviour. Their representative conveyed the frustration of small business owners who often bear the brunt of such offences without commensurate recompense or public recognition, and who face mounting operational costs in consequence.\n\nThe Legal Aid Agency’s role in this case merits mention. An application to fund expert psychiatric input faced prolonged delays, initially submitted on 3 February 2025 and not approved until late April. These setbacks impeded the timely progression of the report and thus constrained the scheduling of the sentencing phase. Such bureaucratic challenges are emblematic of ongoing systemic issues within the legal aid framework, including funding shortfalls, administrative complexity, and staffing limitations. They place undue strain on defence counsel and risk compromising the fairness of proceedings.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nLegal Context  \nThe Theft Act 1968 remains foundational in defining theft offences. Section 1 mandates that appropriating property belonging to another, dishonestly and with the intention of permanently depriving, constitutes theft. Case law post-dating the Act has refined the guidance on factors influencing sentence severity, especially in relation to repetition, public harm, and the role of mitigating circumstances.\n\nIn particular, the Sentencing Council's definitive guideline on theft offences, updated in 2023, sets out an ascending scale of culpability tailored to case specifics. It stresses that persistent offending, exploitation of vulnerable victims or environments, and attempts to mask culpability are significant aggravators.\n\nAdditionally, recent appellate decisions, including R v. Mahy [2024] EWCA Crim 1982, have underscored the importance of proportionality in sentencing, while affirming that offences undermining the security and viability of community businesses carry weight beyond simple monetary calculations.\n\nFactors of mitigation, such as early pleas, genuine remorse, and engagement with rehabilitation efforts, remain central to sentencing discretion. The balancing act courts perform is, thus, both nuanced and heavily fact-dependent.\n\nSentencing Considerations and Conclusion  \nHaving considered the facts of the offending behaviour, your personal circumstances, the expert and probation reports, and the submissions made on your behalf, the court must now determine the appropriate sentencing outcome.\n\nYour offending constitutes a prolonged course of conduct, marked by persistence, planning, and evident disregard for warnings given in earlier encounters with law enforcement. The repeated nature of your thefts — across multiple outlets and over an extensive timeframe — shows a pattern incompatible with impulsive error. It is compounded by attempts at deception and failure to engage with support services despite multiple opportunities.\n\nThat said, the court acknowledges your expressed remorse, albeit belated, and the absence of any significant mental disorder that might excuse or substantially mitigate responsibility. The precariousness of your housing situation, as well as your history of inconsistent engagement with rehabilitation services, also weigh into the calculus.\n\nI anticipate the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report to inform the eventual sentence, with particular attention to possible community-based interventions tailored to address impulsivity, financial instability, and substance misuse. The report should also assess the suitability of participation in accredited programmes such as the Enhanced Thinking Skills Course, debt counselling, and accommodation support.\n\nThe court must also consider the impact of your offending on the victims—the local retail businesses whose daily operations have been disrupted and whose staff have been emotionally affected. The imposition of suitable sanctions aims not only at punishment, but also at deterrence—both particular and general—and the protection of the public interest.\n\nIt is right, in conclusion, for the court to thank Ms Elinor Chapman, counsel appearing for the Crown, for her clear and comprehensive submissions, and Mr Samuel Blake, representing the defence pursuant to a Legal Aid order, for his diligent advocacy despite systemic delays. Thanks are also extended to court staff who have managed the scheduling of this matter within a notoriously pressured listing docket, and to the court usher for maintaining order throughout.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 6 at Bristol Crown Court. The proceedings have been digitally recorded and shall follow the required protocols under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentence will be pronounced after receipt of the pre-sentence report, with the defendant advised of his rights to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. B2025/04519  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. C.
