MR H  \nCase No. T2025/14377  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. L. BRIGGS  \nFiled: 4 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences under consideration span a period commencing in late 2023 and extending into early 2025, primarily within the Greater Manchester metropolitan area, including retail premises located in Salford, Bolton, and the city centre of Manchester itself.  \n\nProcedural and Investigative Background  \nYou were first apprehended on 12 February 2025 after an extended investigation conducted jointly by Greater Manchester Police's Economic Crime Unit and the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP). This inquiry was instigated following reports of repeated thefts from a variety of independent retailers, leading to a coordinated surveillance and intelligence-gathering operation. The police compounded efforts with extensive reviews of CCTV footage, financial transaction records, and witness statements, alongside interviews with store personnel who had endured your repeated incursions.  \n\nThis case is illustrative of the resource intensiveness associated with prosecuting what might superficially be characterised as “low-level” offending. The collective hours of work by officers dedicated to this investigation, augmented by the input from retail security advisors and business designees, represent a significant commitment of public resources. It is, regrettably, characteristic of contemporary acquisitive crime litigation that cases such as yours absorb disproportionately high investigative effort relative to the apparent gravity of individual acts.  \n\nIndeed, one must acknowledge the cumulative strain on police and judicial systems resulting from such persistent offending. Resources expended here could otherwise have been deployed to pressing areas such as organised crime and serious violence investigations, a point well understood by those professionals committed to upholding the criminal justice system in the face of growing demand.  \n\nIt is also germane to note the efficacy of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership in this jurisdiction, which has overseen multiple initiatives aimed at deterring repeat offending through community alerts, offender monitoring panels, and the coordination of local retail security improvements. While not universally flawless in operation, the partnership in this instance demonstrated a commendable degree of organisational coherence, facilitating the expedited flow of intelligence and victim impact data contributions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nNotwithstanding these procedural successes, it must be recognised that Legal Aid funding delays complicated defence preparation. Applications for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist, submitted in late February 2025, were not authorised until mid-April after multiple rounds of administrative clarification and document submission. As is lamentably common, such protracted bureaucratic processes imposed avoidable strain not only on your legal team but also on the court’s listing timetable.  \n\nIndeed, the impediments created by Legal Aid approval processes have become an increasingly significant source of frustration in cases of this nature, culminating in extended adjournments and the attenuation of procedural momentum. This is a matter of considerable concern affecting the expeditious delivery of justice for both defendants and victims, and it is to be hoped that reforms addressing these systemic delays will be forthcoming in the near term.  \n\nRepresentation and Submissions  \nToday’s hearing has been conducted in open court, with Ms Felicia Randall appearing on behalf of the Crown and Mr Donovan Heath acting for the defence pursuant to a legally funded representation order. I acknowledge the professionalism and thoroughness of counsel on both sides.  \n\nThe defence has sought to mitigate on the basis of your personal circumstances, including housing instability, intermittent employment, and an absence of diagnosed psychiatric illness. Additionally, letters from local community charities—namely The Bridge Project and the Greater Manchester Food Access Network—as well as testimonials from family members and your local housing support worker have been submitted in support, highlighting both ongoing vulnerabilities and your expressed desire to desist from criminal conduct.  \n\nWhile these representations are noted with due respect, it is incumbent upon the court to balance personal context with the overarching imperative of public protection and victim impact in determining an appropriate sentence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nHistorical and Comparative Case Law  \nThe theft offences under the Theft Act 1968 have been the subject of extensive judicial consideration, though each case inevitably turns on its unique facts and surrounding circumstances. For guidance, this court is mindful of the principles established in R v. Yong [2019] EWCA Crim 1806, where repeated shoplifting over an extended period was held to justify a custodial sentence given the sustained nature of the offending and the impact on vulnerable retail workers. Yong underscored that even offences involving modest monetary value, when persistent and deliberate, engage significant public interest and warrant firm judicial response.  \n\nSimilarly, R v. Ferrell [2022] EWCA Crim 902, which concerned repeated offending involving distraction techniques and removal of security devices, highlights the court’s expectation that deliberate and premeditated shop theft be met with sentences capable of both individual deterrence and general exemplification.  \n\nAlthough your offences lack a violent element, it is important to reflect on the harm caused to the victims and the wider community. The position was encapsulated in R v. Madison [2020] EWCA Crim 1342, where the Court noted that the criminal justice system must send a clear message that low-level acquisitive offending, when persistent, is both economically and psychologically damaging to individuals and businesses.  \n\nThe unavailability of any credible coercion or duress defence, as in your case, further reinforces the need to impose a sentence reflective of seriousness and consistent with public expectation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nContextual Observations on Public Services and Social Factors  \nThe court is, of course, acutely aware of the complex social and economic milieu in which many offences of this nature arise. The escalation in street homelessness and associated beggary within Greater Manchester has presented significant challenges to social services and voluntary sector organisations alike. The availability of emergency accommodation, day centres, and support for substance misuse and mental health remains at chronic insufficiency relative to demand, a fact recognised by the recent Greater Manchester Combined Authority annual report on homelessness disabilities and housing needs.  \n\nDespite these broader systemic issues, this court must reflect that individual accountability remains paramount. The resources expended by charities such as the Manchester Homeless Outreach Team—notably the tireless work by case workers arranging transitional housing and counselling—must not be undermined by repeated criminal conduct by individuals benefiting from such support.  \n\nIndeed, the refusal or failure to engage with available services and support pathways, while regrettable, is an equally salient factor in sentencing. It is a matter recognised in both professional guidance and recent academic literature that active and consistent engagement with rehabilitative services is a crucial determinant in the mitigation of offending behaviour.  \n\nThe court further observes the ongoing pressures faced by local probation services across the North West region. Staffing shortages, increased caseloads, and the resultant diminution of direct offender contact have limited the scope for effective rehabilitation in certain cases. The need for tailored risk assessment and appropriate allocation of community orders is emphasised to achieve both protective and rehabilitative aims.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nIt is worth reminding myself, and those present today, that multi-agency cooperation epitomised in frameworks such as the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC), and the Integrated Offender Management programme—although primarily oriented towards medium and high-risk offenders—offers valuable lessons in collaborative practice that may inform broader acquisitive offending interventions.  \n\nThe Court extends its appreciation to the staff of Greater Manchester Retail Safety Partnership, whose contributions of victim impact statements and consultations played a pivotal role in shaping the prosecution’s case and highlighting the practical effects of repeat shoplifting on individual members of the local business community. Their role, often unheralded, is vital in bridging the gap between the abstract notions of criminal conduct and the tangible harm experienced by ordinary citizens.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nPsychiatric and Psychological Assessments  \nA psychiatric report commissioned from Dr Mercy Longridge, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was submitted on 1 September 2025. Her findings were that while you do not suffer from any severe mental illness, you demonstrate features consistent with borderline personality traits alongside impulsivity and significant emotional dysregulation. She noted also mild polysubstance misuse but no dependency syndrome. The assessment emphasised that your level of insight was limited and that engagement with any proposed psychological intervention was inconsistent.  \n\nThe report recommended a structured cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme focusing on impulse control and decision-making, coupled with consistent substance misuse monitoring through community services. It highlighted the clear connection between impulsivity and the repetitive nature of the offending, with suggested benefits from specialist offending behaviour programmes.  \n\nAdditionally, the pre-sentence report authored by probation officer Ms Jasmine Boyle, dated 22 September 2025, provides a comprehensive criminogenic needs assessment, emphasising the criticality of tailored community supervision to reduce both the likelihood of reoffending and the risk of escalation to more serious offences. It also stresses the importance of addressing housing stability and employment prospects, key factors in your rehabilitation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nThe Impact on Victims and Community Confidence  \nVictim impact statements from three independent retailers—ranging from small grocers to pharmacy outlets—detail the anxiety induced among staff by your repeated visits, disruptions caused to business operations during investigation periods, and the financial implications of stock losses that, while individually modest, cumulatively strained budgets and contributed to at least one premature staff resignation.  \n\nStaff have described feelings of vulnerability and, in some instances, fear, even in the absence of overt threats or aggression. The disruption has also had knock-on effects in terms of rescheduling shifts and increasing security measures, all of which exacerbate the operational costs borne by small businesses already competing in challenging economic circumstances.  \n\nSuch consequences, though often invisible beyond the immediate business community, ripple outward to affect consumer confidence and the vitality of local commercial areas. The court reiterates the position taken in R v. Flannigan [2017] EWCA Crim 1473, where the sentencing judge emphasised that the “psychological harm to victims of acquisitive crime is neither negligible nor consistently apparent” but must nonetheless inform sentencing considerations.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nWhile your offences did not involve violence or threats, the persistent nature of the thefts and the attendant breach of trust within familiar community spaces justifies a firm approach intended to convey both censure and deterrence.  \n\nMitigating Factors and Personal Circumstances  \nThis court acknowledges that you entered a guilty plea at the earliest hearing following completion of the forensic and psychiatric investigations. Although this plea came after initial denials, its timeliness is noted under the principles summarised in R v. Booker [2017] EWCA Crim 548, weighing partially in your favour and meriting some credit.  \n\nFurther mitigation arises from your current housing instability described as precarious but supported through emergency accommodation initiatives. Letters from your housing support worker attest to your participation in some workshops aimed at financial literacy, though engagement has been inconsistent.  \n\nYou also are a man of 34 years with a sparse employment history, intermittent underemployment, and limited educational attainment. These factors, coupled with systemic barriers to stable housing, pose significant challenges to rehabilitation. I do not diminish the difficulties that such circumstances entail, but they do not, in themselves, excuse repeated criminality.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nI am obliged to consider whether any community-based sanction might be appropriate. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines on theft offences recommend a range of options based on culpability and harm, including community orders with rehabilitation requirements and custodial sentences where seriousness warrants.  \n\nYour prior convictions for theft—although less numerous than some offenders—do evidence a pattern of recidivism that this court must address to protect the public and uphold deterrence. This, in conjunction with the breach of trust towards communities, weighs against a purely lenient approach.\n\nConclusions and Next Steps  \nMr H, the offences before the court constitute a serious and calculated exercise in opportunistic dishonesty, repeated over a significant period and targeted at vulnerable premises and staff. The cumulative harm arises not merely from loss of property but from the undermining of community safety and the financial and psychological toll on victims.  \n\nWhile there are personal difficulties in your background that warrant some consideration, these cannot, and do not, override the seriousness of your conduct or the clear public interest in deterrence and rehabilitation. The reports submitted recommend carefully structured community interventions, but also caution as to the potential risks of non-engagement and progression in offending behaviour.  \n\nIn light of the range and gravity of factors set out, I will defer passing sentence to enable probation to prepare a comprehensive report considering the full range of sentencing options, including the suitability and feasibility of tailored community orders incorporating cognitive skills work, substance misuse support, and housing assistance. This report should include an assessment of public protection requirements and the necessary conditions to mitigate the risk of reoffending.  \n\nI would like formally to record my appreciation to all involved professionals, including probation personnel, forensic psychiatrists, police officers, and victim liaison officers, whose collective work enables the court to reach a considered and informed conclusion.  \n\nIt is also appropriate to note that the physical courtroom environment has recently undergone refurbishment, improving accessibility and acoustics, and this enhances the dignity of proceedings—an important consideration in maintaining public confidence in the criminal justice system.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 4 October 2025, in Court 6 at Manchester Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be retained for the official record. The defendant is reminded of the statutory right of appeal against sentence, which must be lodged within 28 days of sentencing notice in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. The question of costs is reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  \nR v.
