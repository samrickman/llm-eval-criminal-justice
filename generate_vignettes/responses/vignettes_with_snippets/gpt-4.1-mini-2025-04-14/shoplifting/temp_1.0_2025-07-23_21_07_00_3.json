MR H  \nCase No. B2025/03841  \nSentencing Remarks — Her Honour Judge C. W. FLETCHER  \nFiled: 14 August 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this Court for sentencing in respect of a charge brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, pertaining to offences of shoplifting committed on multiple occasions within the Bristol metropolitan area. The offending conduct spans a period commencing in mid-2022 and extending through to March of this year. The incidents principally involve a succession of retail premises, notably pharmacies and convenience stores located in the Bristol central ward and adjacent districts.\n\nProcedural and Investigatory Background  \nThe origins of this prosecution lie in an intricate inquiry coordinated by officers from the Bristol City Police Retail Crime Unit, together with collaborative input from the Bristol Business Crime Partnership and local Safer Streets initiatives. This inquiry was mounted following reports from several independent retailers noting a pattern of repeated thefts, initially dismissed as isolated but subsequently assessed as symptomatic of a persistent modus operandi.\n\nThis Court acknowledges at the outset the substantial investigative effort expended in assembling the prosecution case. It is worth observing that offences of the type before me frequently demand considerable resource allocation from overstretched services. The collation of security camera footage, interviews with overburdened shop staff, and analysis of stock discrepancy reports comprise a labour-intensive endeavor. Police forces routinely face mounting challenges in allocating personnel to non-violent acquisitive crime management, given escalating demands from serious violence and organised crime investigations.\n\nMr H was arrested on 29 March 2025 following a protracted surveillance operation. The police employed a suite of investigatory techniques, including but not limited to, the analysis of transport use, examination of closed-circuit television coverage from multiple retailers, and authorised mobile device tracking sanctioned under strict judicial oversight. These measures, particularly the latter, require compelling justification and evidential thresholds appropriate to the intrusive nature of the surveillance. Such a warrant was duly granted after representations conveyed the sustained and recurrent pattern of offending that had inflicted commercial and psychological harm upon businesses and store employees alike.\n\nIn the widely reported case of R v. Dunlop [2019] EWCA Crim 2034, the Court of Appeal underscored that while persistent acquisitive offending may appear minor in scale individually, the cumulative impact on victims and community cohesion warrants serious judicial attention. The principle that public protection and respect for the rule of law necessitate a calibrated response is enduring. Similarly, the decision in R v. Calderon [2021] EWCA Crim 345, which dealt with serial shoplifting within large retail chains, is instructive in affirming that repeated breaches of trust and property rights cannot be discounted on account of the relatively low monetary value of individual thefts.\n\nThe case advanced with a degree of procedural normalcy afforded by adherence to the Better Case Management protocol, a framework designed to foster early case resolution and judicial efficiency. A plea and trial preparation hearing was originally scheduled for 24 April 2025 but was adjourned upon application by the defence to permit the commissioning of a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and the preparation of ancillary reports.\n\nRepresentations to the Court  \nThe Crown, represented by Ms Felicity Warren, has called for a sentence reflective of the harm occasioned to vulnerable retailers. The prosecution emphasises the persistence of the offending pattern, the distress experienced by shop staff—including the destabilisation of staffing arrangements—and the broader risks posed by repeated acquisitive crime to the vitality and safety of local business communities.\n\nConversely, the defence, led by Mr Andrew Medhurst, has submitted a number of mitigating factors, including your reported struggles with housing instability, intermittent engagement with support services, and purported financial hardship. The Court has had the benefit of an extensive bundle of letters from voluntary sector agencies including Safe Haven Bristol, and outreach services such as Bristol Homeless Support. These offer a nuanced perspective of your circumstances but do not diminish the objective gravity of the offending conduct.\n\nIt must be underscored that while personal circumstances inform sentencing, they do not provide exculpation for criminality. The statutory duty upon this Court is to balance the principles of retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public.\n\nAt the plea and trial preparation hearing on 5 June 2025, your initial not guilty plea was maintained. However, on the morning of trial, following further evidential disclosures and a pre-trial review, you entered a full guilty plea. While the Court notes your eventual acceptance of responsibility, it is necessary to consider the timing of this plea in the context of guidelines articulated in R v. Haswell [2022] EWCA Crim 1450, which caution that credit for guilty pleas may be proportionally reduced where pleas are delayed until the last moment, thereby offering limited procedural economy or victim relief.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nIn examining the factual matrix, this Court has also had regard to expert assessments. Dr James Harrow, consultant forensic psychiatrist, evaluated you in July 2025. His report—detailed and professionally composed—notes the presence of mild to moderate trait impulsivity and borderline personality features but finds no evidence of major mental illness. Dr Harrow observes that such traits may potentiate difficulties with impulse control and financial planning, but crucially, highlights your inconsistent engagement with available support services.\n\nIt is an all-too-familiar refrain within the criminal justice system that opportunities for intervention are missed through non-engagement. This Court is mindful of the manifold challenges faced by community services in Bristol and wider England, particularly those under pressure from increased case loads and limited funding streams. The NHS England waiting list for adult community mental health services extends beyond 12 months in many localities, constraining the ability to deliver timely multidisciplinary intervention.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThis appears to have been no accidental or impulsive lapse. Instead, it represents a calculated practice sustained over months, exploiting retail environments during periods identified as vulnerable, such as early morning openings or shift changeovers. The use of accessories such as large backpacks and cloaking garments corroborates an intent to evade detection, and the documented switching of routes between stores evidences deliberate planning.\n\nThe Court has also examined the correspondence from the Bristol Retail Association, which draws attention to the undue psychological pressures placed upon frontline workers. One manager describes a climate of fear and low morale precipitated by repeated incidents attributed to you, including modifications to staff rotas to reduce lone working.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nOf note is a local council report highlighting that, despite the predominance of transient homelessness in the Bristol area, the defendant does not fall within the traditional rough sleeper cohort but occupies temporary accommodation procured through charitable organisations. This nuanced distinction underscores the complexity of addressing social need alongside criminal behaviour.\n\nIn anticipation of sentencing, a pre-sentence report was prepared by Probation Officer Ms Lara Jefferies. The document details your history, including four previous convictions for similar offences, none of which has been discharged by custodial sentences. The report identifies multiple criminogenic needs such as impulsivity, problematic financial management, and poor attendance at support services. It recommends consideration of a structured community order incorporating accredited cognitive behavioural programmes.\n\nAdditionally, the report acknowledges the ongoing strain upon probation services within the South West region, which has seen staffing levels reduced by 15% over the past two years amid rising case numbers. Such systemic pressures have coincided with delays in providing timely intervention, an issue of critical importance when designing effective sentences.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nFurthermore, the Court notes that at no point during this case did evidence emerge to indicate the involvement of co-offenders or complicity with organised criminal networks, a factor evaluated as borderline procedural significance given the increasing prevalence of such complexity in acquisitive crime investigations.\n\nThe defence has adduced a letter from your sister, Ms Bernadine Williams, which paints a picture of familial support despite prior fractures. She expresses hope that a rehabilitative community-based sentence might facilitate your reintegration and stability. While touching, the letter obviously requires cautious weight within the sentencing calculus.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe Court is indebted to the diligent efforts of the Bristol Business Crime Reduction Partnership, which has demonstrated, contrary to the trend observed in some metropolitan areas, an effective multi-agency response. Their timely collation of incident data and prompt notification to local retailers enabled early identification of the offending pattern. Moreover, their outreach to affected business owners resulted in valuable victim impact statements.\n\nThese victim impact remarks profoundly underscore the often-overlooked human consequences of shoplifting. While the total financial loss may be modest, the psychological toll marked by dread, anxiety, and heightened stress is palpable.\n\nNotwithstanding, the Court is equally cognisant of the observations made by the Retail Support and Recovery Network, a voluntary sector outfit that assists both retailers and offenders in navigating the complex aftermath of such offences. Their communications to the defence acknowledge the difficulties faced by individuals like you, particularly in the context of compounded socio-economic hardships.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nI pause here to observe that delays in the supply of Defence evidence and expert reports caused the adjournment of the original sentencing listed for 18 July 2025. This delay exemplifies broader systemic challenges arising from increasingly stringent and bureaucratic Legal Aid procedures. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted approval process for funding instructs independent psychiatric experts to provide necessary clinical insights, an ongoing source of frustration within the judiciary. It is undesirable that fairness and proper preparation are compromised by avoidable administrative inertia. Such impediments to justice are not sustainable.\n\nEmpirical data from the Home Office’s latest crime statistics shows an alarming national rise in acquisitive offences, especially shoplifting. This troubling trend dovetails with rising street homelessness, greater visible begging, and increased social disorder in many urban centres. Whilst this Court recognises the multifactorial drivers of offending, including economic precarity, it must remain vigilant against normalising conduct harmful to the social fabric.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nThis case illustrates, poignantly, the difficult interface between law enforcement priorities, social welfare provision, and community safety. On that note, it is prudent to recall the judgment in R v. Dobson [2018] EWCA Crim 2778, concerning the burglary of a residential premise and the resultant custodial sentence, where the Court stressed that even without physical violence, the invasion of personal space and consequent sense of violation justifies stern sentencing.\n\nAlthough the present offending did not involve residential properties, the psychological impact upon shop staff and shopkeepers arguably contravenes the protective principles emphasised therein.\n\nConsideration also falls to R v. Ferguson [2023] EWCA Crim 405, which drew attention to the sentencing of offenders who commit multiple thefts within tightly circumscribed localities over extended periods, highlighting that sentences must reflect the cumulative nature of such conduct and the harm to public confidence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nIn acknowledging your age—just 35 years old—and personal history, the Court notes that a pattern of entrenched behaviour has emerged. The occasional use of diversionary programmes previously afforded to you has failed to disrupt this pattern. Your non-engagement with interventions remains a source of concern.\n\nIt falls within the remit of this Court to fashion a sentence that simultaneously dissuades future offending, offers a genuine opportunity for rehabilitation, and adequately reflects the enduring impact upon victims and the wider community.\n\nI will therefore adjourn the matter for the preparation of a further comprehensive pre-sentence report. This report should explore the viability of both custodial and community options, with reference to facilities such as structured offending behaviour programmes, financial management support, and drug and alcohol counselling should any dependency be identified. The report should also address the current state of accommodation and consider potential pathways to housing stability.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered on 14 August 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been digitally recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A transcript of this hearing will be forwarded to the relevant authorities. The defendant is hereby advised of the right to appeal this decision within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Orders relating to cost are reserved for future determination.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
