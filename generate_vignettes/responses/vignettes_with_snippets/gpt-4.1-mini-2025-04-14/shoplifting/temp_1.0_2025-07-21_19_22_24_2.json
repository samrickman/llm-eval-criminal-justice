MR H  \nCase No. BRLSC-2025-14690  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J. MONTGOMERY  \nFiled: 15 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand today for sentence following your admission to a charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically shoplifting. The incidents concern a series of offences occurring over an extended period, from October 2023 through March 2025, within the wider Bristol metropolitan area. The offending involves multiple retail premises and has prompted serious consideration of both your personal circumstances and the wider implications of your conduct.\n\nProcedural History  \nThis matter commenced with your arrest on 29 March 2025, following an operation conducted by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary Retail Crime Unit. That arrest was not a spontaneous event but rather the result of a protracted investigatory period spanning approximately four months. During that time, officers, with support from local council enforcement teams and the Bristol Business Crime Reduction Partnership, engaged in extensive data gathering, surveillance deployments, and witness interviews. Such collaborative policing strategies are emblematic of contemporary approaches to addressing acquisitive crime, albeit often challenged by resource constraints and fluctuating staff availability. It is a matter of public record that police forces across England and Wales face considerable pressure from rising crime figures alongside demands to prioritise investigations of greater immediate threat to life and property. The resources allocated to retail crime, while significant, must therefore be judiciously deployed, focused on offenders whose repeated conduct causes persistent harm both financially and psychologically to business proprietors and their employees.\n\nOn a procedural note, it merits mention that the management of your case has predominantly aligned with the objectives set by the Better Case Management initiative as promulgated under the Criminal Procedure Rules. Notwithstanding a modest delay occasioned by the adjournment required to allow for completion of psychiatric assessment and associated reports, the listing of your plea and trial preparation hearings occurred within the prescribed time frames. I wish to acknowledge the efforts of all professional staff involved in case management, particularly members of the crown prosecution service team assigned to this file, whose coordination facilitated the expeditious compilation of evidence packages.\n\nDelays affecting some cases, understandably, arise from the ongoing workload pressures experienced in the courts. These pressures have been exacerbated by staffing shortfalls and, on occasion, industrial action across various public services during the past year. The knock-on effect on timely listings and adjournments is well documented, and this court notes with some concern the cumulative impact such interruptions have on defendants, victims, and the administration of justice. The Legal Aid Agency, whose role in facilitating access to expert reports is essential in cases such as this, has unfortunately been a source of delay. Your defence applied for funding to obtain a psychiatric evaluation from Dr Mariam Schäfer, consultant forensic psychologist, on 22 April 2025. That application did not receive formal authorisation until 10 June 2025, an avoidable lag that hindered pre-sentence considerations and lengthened an already protracted process. Such administrative bottlenecks represent a systemic challenge that ought to be addressed if the justice system is to serve all parties efficiently while safeguarding individual rights to representation and fair hearing.\n\nIn addressing the facts of the case, it is necessary to first observe that your initial plea at the plea and trial preparation hearing, conducted on 3 July 2025, was not one of guilty. Upon receiving a comprehensive disclosure bundle that included unredacted CCTV footage, store manager statements, and forensic evidence correlating items seized at your arrest to the incidents under scrutiny, you entered a plea of guilty on 14 August 2025. The timing and circumstances surrounding this late admission of guilt engage the court's attention in relation to pena plea credit. Decisions in authority, notably R v. Norton [2022] EWCA Crim 1158, confirm that while the law encourages early pleas, the ultimate function of sentencing credit must serve justice and reflect genuine responsibility rather than mere tactical advantages.\n\nPart of the evidence relied upon in this case included witness testimony from Mrs Linda Prescott, a retail operations manager responsible for several convenience stores impacted by the offending. Mrs Prescott described the impact of repeated thefts on staff wellbeing as notable, including increased anxiety among shopfloor personnel and the imposition of stricter store procedures — some of which materially affected customer service levels. I acknowledge the forthrightness of these victim statements submitted through the Victim Support Service. It must be emphasised that offences presenting low in monetary value may nonetheless occasion significant psychological distress and economic cost beyond the immediate loss.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nCourts face the challenge of balancing empathy for individual mitigating circumstances with the equally important public interest in effective deterrence, accountability, and protection of communities. Recent jurisprudence underscores that acquisitive offending, when habitual and repetitive, conveys a risk to societal cohesion disproportionate to the individual offence value. It is worth recalling the decision in R v. Wilson [2023] EWCA Crim 756, which reaffirmed the Court's stance that terms of custody are justified where repeat offending is not arrested, especially where offenders demonstrate limited engagement with rehabilitation pathways.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nIn the course of preparing for this hearing, this court has had the benefit of the pre-sentence report compiled by Probation Officer Miriam Langley, dated 30 August 2025. Ms Langley’s report provides a detailed examination of your personal history, social circumstances, and potential risks, including an analysis of previous convictions, family background, and engagement with community services. The report indicates your current accommodation as a privately rented flat in South Bristol, with no reported cohabitants. It further notes sporadic employment history with gaps associated with reported mental health crises.\n\nThe report comments on your prior convictions, including three counts of shoplifting dating back to 2019–2021, culminating in a community order which was reportedly breached. While noting your stated motivation linked to financial hardship, the probation officer remarks that your efforts to seek assistance from social welfare services appear inconsistent at best. Your current attitude reflects ambivalence concerning previous intervention efforts, a factor contributing to an assessed medium risk of reoffending.\n\nYour prior sentence history is augmented by an arrest in 2020 for possession of a bladed article in a public car park adjacent to a secondary school. The circumstances in that matter resulted in a fine and conditional discharge but did not progress to conviction. This incident is referenced solely for completeness, as there is no suggestion of connection to the instant offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nAn independent psychiatric report was prepared by Dr Mariam Schäfer following a clinical assessment on 12 July 2025. Dr Schäfer offered a carefully considered opinion, concluding there is no diagnosable major mental illness. She noted evidence of stress-related mood fluctuations and traits consistent with anxiety, but no pathology requiring hospitalisation or specialist forensic intervention. Importantly, she observed an absence of formal substance misuse assessments, an omission the court regrets but which reflects waiting list delays in NHS community mental health services in the area. Dr Schäfer recommended referral to local psychological support groups and stress management programmes as part of any rehabilitative plan.\n\nThese healthcare service gaps reflect broader systemic pressures on the public mental health system, which the court duly notes without attributing responsibility to the defendant. The NHS has, across multiple domains, endured underfunding and protracted waiting times, impacting patient care and community outcomes.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nApart from your personal history, the court acknowledges written submissions from the Bristol City Homelessness Outreach Charity, which has provided ancillary support to you and others in circumstances of housing precarity. Their letters attest to the considerable workload borne by voluntary and statutory agencies grappling with the overlapping crises of street homelessness, welfare system deficiencies, and escalating demand for low-threshold services. They candidly report that client engagement remains a persistent challenge in this sector, with many individuals oscillating between access and withdrawal from offered programmes.\n\nIt would be remiss not to record appreciation for the professionalism and dedication of such agencies, whose role in reducing reoffending and promoting reintegration is critical, albeit hindered by constrained funding and capacity limits. Their material, while acknowledging the seriousness of your conduct, urges a measured response oriented towards rehabilitation rather than only punitive sanction.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nIt also bears mentioning that your sibling, Ms T, is currently subject to unrelated proceedings in a magistrates' court in neighbouring South Gloucestershire, concerning allegations of benefit fraud. While bearing no connection to your case, this aspect has been referenced by defence counsel as part of a broader contextual submission regarding family dynamics. The court records this for completeness but does not regard it as mitigating or otherwise relevant to your culpability or risk assessment.\n\nEqually, the landlord of your accommodation was reportedly served a noise abatement notice in April 2025 for disturbances emanating from another tenant’s flat. This has no bearing on your behaviour or circumstances but is noted as an incidental matter arising during the course of pre-sentence enquiries.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nThe Crown have made reference to a recent case, R v. Chandler [2024] EWCA Crim 891, where an offender was sentenced to immediate custody following a conviction for aggravated criminal damage involving the destruction of a listed church noticeboard. The incident involved the use of spray paint to affix political slogans and resulted in repair costs exceeding £5,000. The judgment emphasised the societal harm caused by attacks on community heritage assets and the necessity of custodial deterrence. While clearly distinct from your case in terms of subject matter and gravity, the authorities cited serve as a broader illustration of the courts’ approach to offences engendering public disquiet and the erosion of shared values.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nYour counsel has advanced mitigatory submissions concerning your previously reported experiences of childhood trauma and ongoing struggles with economic instability. These are taken seriously and have indeed been reflected in the pre-sentence report. It is apparent that multiple challenging factors shape your life narrative. However, as is well established, personal adversity, while informing appropriate levels of compassion in sentencing, does not absolve an individual from responsibility. R v. Hemsley [2021] EWCA Crim 1547 reiterates the principle that mitigating factors must be balanced against the protection of the public and the imperative to deter persistent offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe court notes with concern that there is no evidence of engagement with drug or alcohol treatment programmes, despite recent local authority referrals to the Bristol Integrated Substance Misuse Service (BISM). This is a salient point given the known association between substance misuse and acquisitive crime. That omission may indicate a degree of denial or disengagement with potential sources of help.\n\nMoreover, prior breaches of community orders instigated for related offences underline a persistent failure to comply with court-mandated rehabilitation. This pattern is significant and substantially informs the court’s assessment of risk and the likely need for a custodial element in the sentence to follow.\n\nIn addressing these matters, the court must also consider section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which requires sentences to be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the offender's culpability. It must balance punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection.\n\nThe sentencing guidelines published by the Sentencing Council for theft offences articulate key factors for consideration. These include the value of goods taken, frequency and duration of offending, the use of deception or planning, the impact on victims, and any prior criminal record. Importantly, aggravating features such as vulnerability of victims, targeting of community resources, and disruption to business activities must be weighed.\n\nIn that regard, the cumulative impact of your offending on retail staff morale and business viability is not trivial. The necessity to alter working patterns, implement additional security measures, and the emotional toll upon those affected must weigh heavily in the court’s considerations. While raw financial loss may be moderate, the ripple effects penetrate more deeply.\n\nIt is worth recording the court’s awareness of the mounting challenges faced by frontline retailers countrywide. The trend of repeated shoplifting has contributed to a decline in local business confidence and is a factor in some chains reducing their presence in urban centres. This is a matter of social import beyond purely legal dimensions.\n\nFinally, I thank counsel for their submissions delivered with due diligence. Ms L. Griffin, who appears representing the Crown, provided a clear and detailed outline of the prosecution case. Mr P. Knight, instructed on your behalf, offered comprehensive mitigation and sought to highlight the systemic issues influencing your offending.\n\nThe court is grateful also to the ushering and administrative staff in Court 6 at Bristol Crown Court, who, despite the pressures imposed by ongoing reductions in staffing and the older court building’s maintenance requirements, maintain order and facilitate smooth proceedings.\n\nToday’s remarks are delivered in open court pursuant to protocol. A formal transcript shall be produced in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5, and a record maintained within the court file.\n\nIn accordance with standard practice for cases involving contested sentencing issues, especially those with unresolved questions about suitability for community-based rehabilitation, I will defer final sentencing. This is to allow the probation service to complete a supplementary report, including an updated assessment of your compliance prospects and detailed recommendations for structured interventions. The report will particularly address possibilities for mental health support, substance misuse treatment, cognitive skills development, and structured community sentence options including unpaid work.\n\nThe court has noted the observations from the charitable sector and the mitigating material submitted. While these carry weight, the overriding objective remains the promotion of public safety and effective offender rehabilitation balanced with appropriate recognition of culpability.\n\nAccordingly, sentencing is adjourned to the date fixed on 10 November 2025, by which all reports and representations shall have been received and considered.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
