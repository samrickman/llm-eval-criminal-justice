MR H  \nCase No. M2025/08514  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge Leonard P. Ashcroft  \nFiled: 19 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a single count of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising out of a protracted and repeated pattern of shoplifting offences within the Greater Manchester area. The offending conduct, which forms the basis of this indictment, spanned approximately eighteen months, from late 2023 through to early 2025, encompassing multiple retail environments including pharmacies, small grocery stores, and independent convenience outlets. \n\nProcedural History  \nThe matter was first brought to the attention of the police following a series of reports by retail managers within the Salford and Trafford districts, who noted a distinct rise in unidentified individuals engaging in thefts of low to mid-value consumer goods, often during peak hours but with apparent deliberate timing during cashier staff changes or outside peak store surveillance coverage. The Salford Business Crime Partnership was promptly engaged, seeking to collate evidential footage, stock discrepancy logs, and witness statements. \n\nIt is worth pausing to observe that the institutional response to such low-level theft, while seemingly straightforward, is burdened by manifold operational hurdles. The Business Crime Partnership model provides a framework for information-sharing between law enforcement, retailers, and local council enforcement teams. Yet the efficacy of these partnerships is often constrained by staff shortages, budgetary constraints, and competing demands for investigative resources. Despite these barriers, in your case, the partnership functioned with a commendable degree of cohesion, resulting in the collation of a body of evidence sufficient to prompt formal investigation. \n\nThe defendant was arrested on 14 February 2025, following a multi-agency surveillance initiative incorporating marked police patrols, covert CCTV monitoring, and the utilisation of Retail Crime Intelligence Units. The coordination between these disparate teams is illustrative both of advances in inter-agency collaboration, as well as the challenges facing law enforcement in addressing persistently low-level acquisitive offences amid a landscape of escalating demand for resources elsewhere. \n\nYour first appearance was made at Manchester Magistrates’ Court on 17 February 2025, where bail was granted on strict conditions including daily reporting and an exclusion zone encompassing specified retail premises identified as recurrent targets. Two adjournments followed, the first to allow the disclosure of digital evidence, and the second at the defence’s request in order to secure legal aid funding for a forensic psychiatric assessment. The latter application encountered delays notwithstanding early submission, a regrettably familiar pattern which this court has repeatedly condemned for its adverse impact on case progression and fairness to the defendant. \n\nA plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 10 September 2025, where you entered a late guilty plea. It has become a regrettable hallmark of this jurisdiction that guilty pleas are often reserved until evidentiary pressure becomes overwhelming. This undermines the efficient administration of justice and imposes unnecessary burdens on prosecuting authorities, defence teams, and witnesses alike. The law decrees that a reduction in sentence credit for guilty pleas reflects not only an acceptance of culpability but also the saved expense and trauma occasioned by an early admission. Late pleas, while accepted, attract reduced mitigation, as emphasised in R v McIntyre [2022] EWCA Crim 2318. \n\nAt this juncture, it is instructive to revisit some broader judicial observations on the context and impact of such offending behaviour. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v Wilkinson [2023] EWCA Crim 1547 is pertinent. That case imposed an immediate custodial sentence for a repeated pattern of theft targeting independent retailers, where the cumulative harm exceeded nominal financial loss. The sentencing judge’s remarks in Wilkinson underscored the corrosive effect of recurrent theft on communities, the psychological toll on retail staff operating under constant suspicion, and the erosion of consumer confidence. \n\nAlongside retail crime-specific jurisprudence, it is also relevant to note that this court is mindful of wider societal challenges that serve as the backdrop to such offending. The rise in street homelessness, poverty-induced marginalisation, and systemic under-provision of mental health services further complicate the landscape. Nonetheless, the criminal justice system must hold firm to principles of accountability and proportionality. \n\nIn order to ensure appropriate and proportionate sentence calibration in cases of this nature, it is common practice for courts to require a detailed pre-sentence report prepared by probation officers, together with any available psychiatric expert evidence that elucidates both risk and rehabilitation prospects. These materials assist the court in mounting a response tailored to the offender’s needs and the protection of the public. \n\nThroughout the pendency of your case, Mr H, the court has received correspondence from multiple support agencies, including the Manchester Street Outreach Initiative, the local Citizens Advice Bureau, and the Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust’s community liaison division. These letters articulate the significant strain under which voluntary sector providers operate, as well as the complexities inherent in engaging individuals embroiled in cycles of offending and survival behaviours. The court commends the professionalism and commitment of such organisations, whose influence cannot be overstated, though it notes with concern the chronic underfunding and resource scarcity documented repeatedly in sectoral reports. \n\nIn the course of sentencing preparation, the court notes the forensic psychiatric report prepared by Dr Fiona Marshall, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose comprehensive assessment was received on 2 October 2025. Dr Marshall’s conclusions were nuanced. While she found no evidence of major psychiatric disorder, her report highlighted traits consistent with emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and mild substance dependence. These features, she observed, may predispose towards opportunistic offending but do not absolve personal responsibility. Dr Marshall further emphasised that your engagement with support services has been intermittent and largely self-limiting. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nTurning to the particulars of the thefts themselves, the court must assess the manner and circumstances in which your offending was manifested. CCTV material, corroborated by witness testimony, reveals a pattern of deliberate behaviour utilising concealment techniques and occasional attempts to remove security devices in situ. The timing of offences frequently coincided with staff absences or periods of heightened activity designed to distract attention. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nFurther observations note that on at least two occasions, you appeared to employ decoys or feigned preoccupation—such as engaging in overtly visible telephone conversations or loitering near other shoppers—to mask your intentions and evade detection. This evidences a degree of calculated conduct beyond mere opportunism. \n\nThe economic loss to businesses is non-trivial, especially for small independent retailers operating on fine margins and without the benefit of large-scale insurance or loss prevention teams. Beyond direct financial impact, the psychological effect upon shop assistants was palpable. They reported feelings of vulnerability, increased workplace stress, and a reluctance to work alone during certain shifts, impacts which ripple beyond the immediate physical loss. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nI must note also, however, that despite repeated cautionary interventions—ranging from police warnings to participation in diversionary schemes—there was no enduring cessation of offending behaviour. This is a matter of significant concern, not least because it indicates a failure to internalise the consequences of previous contact with the justice system. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThis court also acknowledges the positive engagement of your legal representatives, particularly Mr David Whelan, who has diligently pursued avenues for mitigating evidence and secured adjournments to ensure adequate preparation. Mr Whelan’s commitment to your case has been noted and commended. \n\nIt is worth noting for the record that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of funding applications in your matter exhibited uncharacteristic expediency, despite systemic trends to the contrary. This facilitated the timely instruction of expert witnesses and contributed to procedural compliance. Though regrettably, such efficiency remains the exception rather than the norm across the criminal justice landscape. \n\nIn considering case law of direct and tangential relevance, the court refers to Duncan v The Crown [2020] EWCA Crim 2050, a case involving theft from charity shops with a complex profile of vulnerability and repeated offending. There, the Court of Appeal highlighted the importance of balancing the aim of rehabilitation with the demands of public protection, reminding sentencing judges to exercise discretion mindful of the individual defendant’s circumstances and the nature of the offending. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nIt is equally important to observe the growing judicial unease with the normalization of low-level acquisitive crime in urban centres, a phenomenon that the media often under-reports or trivialises. This failure to afford due seriousness risks undermining confidence in the rule of law and emboldens recidivism. Courts must combat complacency by ensuring sentences maintain proportionality and deterrence. \n\nIn the present case, despite your personal background, the conduct reflects a disconcerting persistence and recidivism. Evidence presented shows no engagement with rehabilitative programmes previously offered. Indeed, your responses have often been characterised by ambivalence or disengagement, reflecting, perhaps, the challenges faced by many navigating chronic financial insecurity and chaotic lifestyles. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nThe victim impact statements submitted to the court by retail staff from three separate stores paint a consistent picture of disruption, anxiety, and a sense of betrayal. These are individuals who, while not the targets of violence, experienced harm through the cumulative effect of theft. It is imperative that such harm be weighed appropriately in sentencing decisions. \n\nThe court is mindful that while immediate custody is not invariably the default in cases of theft, the totality of circumstances here points towards a structured response addressing both punishment and rehabilitation. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft and Handling Stolen Goods emphasises this dual function, noting the importance of assessing culpability, harm, and offender’s circumstances. \n\nYour age, 34, coupled with the somewhat limited but relevant prior convictions, including those for previous shoplifting offences, inform the risk assessment and sentencing approach. The probation officer’s presentence report, while not yet complete, will be critical in recommending constructive interventions, including cognitive behavioural programmes, substance misuse treatment, and employment support.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nMeanwhile, I recognise with sympathy the challenges presented by modern court operations. The Crown Court’s recent refurbishment of Courtroom 5, where this hearing is held, including upgraded digital evidence presentation systems, represents welcome progress in facilitating the administration of justice in complex cases such as yours. However, inevitable pressures remain, including constrained listing availability and the knock-on effects of industrial action by court staff earlier this year, which delayed case timetabling nationally. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nIn all these respects, the case exemplifies underlying systemic tensions across the criminal justice ecosystem: the balancing act between efficiency and fairness, between punishing crime and fostering rehabilitation, and between individual circumstances and societal expectations. While this court does not seek to dissect these tensions at length, it acknowledges their presence as a backdrop to the events and decisions here. \n\nSentencing today is reserved pending receipt of the probation service pre-sentence report and any supplementary expert input deemed necessary. Upon receipt, the court will consider whether a community order incorporating rehabilitation requirements may be suitable or, alternatively, whether a custodial custodial sentence with a structured rehabilitation package would better serve public protection and individual reform. \n\nI thank counsel for their assistance in these proceedings — Ms Rebecca Morgan on behalf of the Crown, whose submissions have been clear, professional, and measured, and Mr David Whelan for the defence, whose advocacy has been diligent and conscientious. \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 19 October 2025, in Court 5 at Manchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 do not apply in this case. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. M2025/08514  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge Leonard P.
