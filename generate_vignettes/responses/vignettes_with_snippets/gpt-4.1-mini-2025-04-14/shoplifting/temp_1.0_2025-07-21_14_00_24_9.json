MR H  \nCase No. T2026/04158  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. A. GRAYSON  \nFiled: 14 September 2026  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced on a charge of theft, specifically multiple counts of shoplifting conducted over a period stretching from late 2024 to mid-2026. This offending has primarily involved retail premises situated throughout the Greater Manchester conurbation, encompassing independent stores and larger commercial outlets alike. The indictment consolidates these numerous acts into a single count, reflecting the court’s approach to cumulative conduct as forming a course of criminal behaviour.\n\nProcedural and Investigative Context  \nYour arrest was effected on 25 July 2026 following an extensive investigation initiated by the Manchester Retail Crime Taskforce, a body convened to tackle the proliferation of shop thefts which has exerted palpable strain on local businesses and policing resources. The investigation was the product of concerted multi-agency efforts, including liaison with the Manchester Business Crime Reduction Group, input from local trading standards officers, and the proactive deployment of covert surveillance across premises identified as high-risk.\n\nSuch investigative measures, while increasingly necessary, constitute a considerable diversion of scarce public resources. Attending to what many might dismiss as “low-level” offending can, paradoxically, demand a disproportionate commitment of specialist manpower, digital forensic expertise, and administrative capacity. The court is acutely aware, from discussions with senior officers and policy colleagues, that dedicated police teams often find themselves hindered by the volume and persistence of these crimes, which cumulatively sap momentum from more serious investigative priorities, including those addressing violent offences, drug trafficking, and organised crime syndicates operating at a macro scale.\n\nIt is a regrettable truth that repeated retail theft — despite the relatively modest value of items stolen — can cumulatively produce serious economic and social dislocation. Damage to staff morale, increased security costs, store closures, and the withdrawal of services from fragile communities are but some consequences. The broader social fallout is manifestly felt, especially when shoplifting targets are small, locally owned businesses that often serve disadvantaged neighbourhoods.\n\nYour case has unfolded amid the ongoing evolution of criminal case management processes. The Better Case Management system, introduced to accelerate evidence assessment, streamline disclosure, and minimise adjournments, was engaged here, reflecting the Crown Court’s commitment to procedural efficiency. The case was marked by scheduling challenges, notably the temporary unavailability of key witness statements and delays occasioned by competing lists, but overall progression was consistent with official timelines. The court acknowledges the diligent efforts of the Crown Prosecution Service to coordinate effectively with law enforcement and business stakeholders to bring your case expeditiously before the court.\n\nFollowing your initial custody and charge on 27 July, you made your first court appearance on 2 August. The proceedings have since encompassed a plea and trial preparation hearing, during which you maintained a not guilty plea, denying involvement. This plea was reconsidered only at the outset of the scheduled trial in September, when you elected instead to enter a guilty plea to the representative count.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nYour change of plea at this late stage, while ultimately consistent with the evidence presented, cannot attract the full measure of credit contemplated by sentencing guidelines. It is a regrettably habitual pattern in many acquisitive crime cases whereby defendants delay admission of guilt until trial preparation has essentially concluded, thereby imposing avoidable strain on witnesses, police, and court processes. The precedent of R v. Davies [2019] EWCA Crim 412 establishes that such tardy pleas warrant limited discount, serving to balance the interests of justice and procedural economy.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe Court’s reflection on your conduct is informed by detailed witness statements, CCTV footage submitted by various retailers, and forensic analysis indicating the repeated nature of your offending. The offences display a matrix of deliberate planning — including selection of low-staffed time periods, utilisation of concealment techniques, and occasional use of accomplices unknown to the court and as yet unprosecuted. While your own role has been singular, the context is not devoid of complexity.\n\nMulti-Agency Input and Community Impact  \nIt is appropriate to recognise the collaborative efforts of the Manchester Retail Crime Reduction Group (MRCRG), whose reports have shed light on the cumulative effects of your offences beyond what raw figures might convey. The MRCRG's interventions have included improvements to store layout, staff training in theft prevention, and community education initiatives. The Group’s recent quarterly report emphasised the uptick in “displacement tactics” employed by repeat offenders, noting a concurrent rise in what they term “flash thefts” designed to exploit momentary vulnerabilities during peak hours.\n\nMoreover, victim impact statements submitted on behalf of several small businesses paint a picture of anxiety and economic hardship. One such witness described how the repeated thefts led to the reduction of opening hours for fear of theft accruing during unstaffed intervals, a measure that consequently adversely affected customer access and employee income. It is clear that the intangible harms wrought by your behaviour extend into social and economic domains, compounding the direct loss of stock.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe court also notes the correspondence received from the North West Retail Workers’ Union expressing particular concern over the mental health toll that repeated thefts impose on frontline staff. The Union highlighted increased reports of workplace stress, absenteeism, and in some cases, the need for clinical interventions. While these impacts are difficult to measure with precision, their resonance with lived experience must not be overlooked.\n\nThe foregoing underscores that, while shoplifting may seem a minor offence on paper, its reverberations within communities and the commercial ecosystem can be profound. It is a salutary reminder that sentencing must account for the aggregate effects when determining an appropriate sanction.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThe Probation Service has produced a comprehensive pre-sentence report, following interviews with yourself, feedback from family members, and evaluation of your engagement with prior community orders. Unfortunately, the report documents a limited history of compliance and support uptake, indicating a pattern of superficial engagement rather than substantive rehabilitation.\n\nExpert Psychiatric and Psychological Assessment  \nFurther to a court direction, a psychiatric evaluation was undertaken by Dr Amanda Reid, a consultant forensic psychiatrist specialising in impulsivity disorders and acquisitive crime. Dr Reid’s report, filed on 30 August, was detailed and professionally composed, offering insight into your mental state and possible contributory factors. While the assessment concluded that you do not meet diagnostic criteria for a major mental illness or personality disorder, it identified tendencies consistent with impulse control difficulties interlaced with chronic situational anxiety.\n\nThe report cautiously recommended intensive cognitive-behavioural therapy addressing decision-making patterns and distress tolerance. This position aligns with emerging evidence regarding the efficacy of targeted psychological interventions for acquisitive offenders exhibiting impulsivity without broader psychopathology.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nNotwithstanding these recommendations, the report underscores your limited motivation to engage with voluntary services and notes a degree of ambivalence expressed during interview, often manifested as minimisation and rationalisation of offending behaviour. Such attitudes are well-recognised impediments to effective rehabilitation and elevate concern regarding likelihood of recidivism absent punitive measures.\n\nYour background is marked by periods of housing instability and fluctuating familial support, detailed extensively in the probation report. The court is mindful of the challenging socio-economic landscape and the frequent shortfall in specialist resources, particularly within mental health and social care systems. NHS waiting lists for psychological therapy in Greater Manchester are known to be long; capacity constraints pose systemic barriers to timely intervention.\n\nNonetheless, while acknowledging these difficulties, the court must balance empathetic understanding against accountability and public safety imperatives. Many defendants face similar or greater barriers yet manage to maintain lawful conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nThe Legal Aid Agency’s involvement in this matter has been noted with some concern. The defence’s applications for funding to obtain expert advice, delayed by repeated administrative requests and protracted authorisation processes, resulted in the psychiatric report being filed a mere two weeks prior to sentencing. These bureaucratic delays, increasingly frequent in contemporary practice, hinder prompt justice and strain all parties involved.\n\nThe Crown and defence counsel have fulfilled their roles with professionalism. I thank Miss Olivia Kent for the Crown and Mr Jacob Mills for the defence, both of whom have conducted proceedings with appropriate decorum and respect for court processes.\n\nLegal Principles and Relevant Case Law  \nSection 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property, with intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property. Though shoplifting may be regarded as a “minor” offence in some circles, persistent offending as exhibited here engages intensified sentencing scrutiny.\n\nThe Sentencing Council guidelines on theft offences articulate a framework that considers culpability, harm, and mitigating or aggravating factors. Crucially, a course of conduct spanning multiple incidents, especially when involving vulnerable victims or community impact, attracts enhanced penalties.\n\nIn R v. Atkinson [2024] EWCA Crim 1351, the Court affirmed that repeat offending involving planned manipulation and targeting of small businesses requires a deterrent sentence. Atkinson’s behaviour bore similarities in both methodology and impact and resulted in a custodial sentence reflecting public protection priorities.\n\nThough distinct, the facts of R v. Thompson [2023] EWCA Crim 1127 are instructive. There, the defendant’s persistent shop theft from pharmacy premises was linked to underlying substance misuse. Sentencing considerations included the offender’s engagement with structured treatment and demonstrated remorse. While your engagement has been notably less cooperative, Thompson serves to highlight the role that rehabilitation can and should play in sentencing strategy where feasible.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nConversely, the Court must be mindful of the ruling in R v. Grant [2025] EWCA Crim 945, which explicitly cautioned against leniency where defendants have failed to avail themselves of available support and continue to offend. Grant was a case involving repeated theft of foodstuffs from charity shops, conducted over months despite previous warnings and diversionary interventions. The Court emphasised that community safety and victim confidence require sentences that reflect the seriousness of offending as well as its persistence.\n\nBy analogy, that approach informs the present case.\n\nSentencing Considerations and Public Policy Context  \nThis court cannot and does not view your offences in isolation from the broader social context in which they occurred. The empirical reality of increased street homelessness, economic precarity, and the ordinary anxieties accompanying post-pandemic recovery bear on many defendants who enter these precincts.\n\nNevertheless, such circumstances do not excuse nor justify persistent criminal conduct. The danger exists that omission of consequence may further erode social cohesion and embolden those who would exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain.\n\nOf particular note is the strain placed upon local housing services, which, as documented in a report from the Manchester Housing Partnership dated 10 August 2026, is running at near capacity with substantial waiting lists. This environmental stress adds a difficult backdrop against which offences such as yours occur, but again cannot be permitted to distort the court’s overarching duty to uphold lawful conduct.\n\nThe issue of contributory hardship was examined in the recent case of R v. Sutherland [2026] EWCA Crim 210, which clarified that while poverty and unstable housing are matters of potential mitigation, they do not provide carte blanche for criminal activity.\n\nEqually, the phenomenon of increased digital engagement in retail, including the introduction of self-scan checkouts and anonymous payment methods, has created novel opportunities for offenders but equally novel challenges for courts and law enforcement.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe Probation Service shall consider all rehabilitative options as part of the pre-sentence process. The possibility of structured supervision, cognitive-behavioural programmes tailored to theft-related offending, and restorative justice pathways merit exploration, balanced against an assessment of public protection requirements.\n\nConversely, custodial sentences remain the necessary disposition where repeated defiance of law and failure to engage with support services converge in ways that jeopardise community confidence and safety.\n\nConclusion and Orders  \nThe sentencing hearing today has proceeded in open court. I acknowledge the contributions of both Crown and defence counsel and the cooperation of allied agencies. The court also notes, with respect, the challenges posed by prolonged and multifaceted investigations, as well as the systemic pressures afflicting mental health services and social support networks.\n\nIt remains the responsibility of the court to impose a sentence reflective of the gravity of the offending, the need for deterrence, and your particular circumstances including personal background, prior history, and psychiatric assessment.\n\nAt this juncture, however, I must reserve final judgment until receipt of the detailed pre-sentence report currently being prepared by the probation service. This report will be instrumental in framing the custodial versus community sentencing debate in this instance.\n\nI remind you of your right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days of the handing down of judgment. The proceedings have been duly recorded under Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5, and no reporting restrictions currently apply.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this 14th day of September 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. The support and decorum maintained by court officers and registry staff during this matter have been exemplary and are hereby acknowledged.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  \nR v.
