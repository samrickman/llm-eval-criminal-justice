Mr H  \nCase No. T2025/13568  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. A. Godfrey  \nFiled: 14 August 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely shoplifting from multiple retail premises within the metropolitan area spanning between late 2023 and the early part of 2025. This indictment represents the prosecution’s consolidation of a series of thefts alleged to have been committed across various commercial establishments within the Coventry and Warwickshire boroughs.\n\nIt is appropriate at the outset to reflect upon the procedural and evidential history of this matter, which has unfolded over the course of more than eighteen months. Your initial arrest took place on 7 March 2025, following a lengthy intelligence-led investigation conducted by officers of the Warwickshire Constabulary alongside key stakeholders including the Coventry City Business Crime Partnership and local community policing teams. The genesis of the case lay in a series of reported incidents involving the disappearance of consumer goods from retail outlets, predominantly convenience and pharmacy stores, where losses, while individually modest in monetary value, cumulatively raised substantial concerns regarding public confidence and commercial sustainability.\n\nSuch investigations, it should be noted, are by no means routine undertakings. The collation and cross-referencing of digital and physical evidence—including CCTV stills and video footage from disparate sources—entails considerable commitment of investigative resources. Officers are daily confronted with the limitations posed by quality of footage, covering angles that often obscure crucial features and timestamps that do not always align cleanly with corroborative witness statements. The phenomenon of repeated low-level acquisitive crime is not novel. However, the procedural conundrums it presents continue to test the capacities of policing and judicial systems alike in an era of constrained budgets and increasing demand.\n\nYour initial proceedings commenced at the Magistrates’ Court in Coventry on 10 March 2025, where you first entered a not guilty plea. The matter was committed to the Crown Court pursuant to standard pre-trial procedures, and a plea and case management hearing was subsequently listed for 29 April 2025 before me. Regrettably, this hearing was delayed twice on the defence’s application, first to allow for the drafting of further mitigation and then to secure the production of a psychiatric report. These adjournments, while frustrating to all concerned, were duly granted in consideration of procedural fairness and your rights to the preparation of a full and robust defence.\n\nThe psychiatric evaluation, commissioned in late April and conducted by Dr Amina Shah, a consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Warwickshire Mental Health Trust, was thorough and accompanied by a comprehensive narrative passed to both prosecution and defence. In her report dated 15 May 2025, Dr Shah expressed that while you do not present with major mental illness, there are indications of emotional dysregulation and traits suggestive of an impulse control disorder of mild severity. Notably, her appraisal also references your reported history of intermittent engagement with drug and alcohol misuse services, and a pattern of low-level substance misuse that may have influenced your behaviour, albeit not to a degree causing pervasive impairment.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nIt is fitting at this juncture to address for the record the continued difficulties besetting the provision of forensic mental health expertise within the jurisdiction. Despite the evident importance of such assessments in sentencing decisions, there remain significant delays in funding authorisations for expert reports due to systemic bottlenecks at the Legal Aid Agency. The court has been compelled on multiple occasions to remonstrate against procedural inertia which hampers expedient case progression. The present matter is no exception. Notwithstanding the eventual completion of the psychiatric report, the timeline was regrettably extended by administrative deferments beyond the control of the parties.\n\nAppreciation is hereby expressed for the attentiveness of Ms Eleanor Lees, your defence solicitor, whose persistent and diligent representation has ensured continued advocacy through these challenges, and for Crown Counsel Ms Saira Nyong’o, whose coordination aided timely disclosure and synthesis of evidential materials. Both counsel have conducted themselves with professionalism and decorum throughout. The court is also grateful to the staff of the Coventry Retailers’ Victim Support Network, particularly Mrs Lesley Carver, whose charitable organisation has devoted considerable voluntary time to liaising with affected shops and providing victim impact statements.\n\nIn the course of enumerating the evidential matrix supporting the prosecution, it is instructive to consider the precedential context. While distinct in facts, R v. Tyrell [2022] EWCA Crim 1834 remains instructive for sentencing frameworks in relation to repetitive acquisitive crime. The defendant in Tyrell engaged in multiple counts of shoplifting across a six-month period, targeting high-turnover retail outlets and deploying distraction techniques. The Court of Appeal therein emphasised the aggravating effect of premeditation and repeated offending, affirming a custodial sentence where interventionist approaches had failed to deter recidivism.\n\nSimilarly, in R v. Simmonds [2023] EWCA Crim 395, the appellate court underscored factors including the erosion of staff morale and the indirect economic consequences borne by small business proprietors as weighty considerations when calibrating the severity of punishment. Though these cases diverge in contextual specifics from the matter at bar, the underlying principles remain cogent and provide a judicial backdrop for sentencing deliberations.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nThe court further notes the limitation of community diversion efforts in your history. You were subject to a conditional caution in 2023 for a related offence, coupled with engagement on a pilot theft prevention scheme organised by the Coventry Crime Reduction Partnership. Despite these initiatives, your offending persisted, evidencing a lack of responsiveness to non-custodial interventions.\n\nThe circumstances of your offending reveal a sustained and deliberate pattern. Surveillance footage from multiple outlets depicts a consistent modus operandi: targeted selection of items—often high-value cosmetics and over-the-counter medicines—carried out during identified shift changes or periods of reduced staffing. On occasion, you were observed to use concealment tactics such as layered clothing or bags switched to avoid detection.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nIn some instances, your conduct extended beyond mere appropriation and involved the removal or disabling of electronic security tags, an act which necessitated the duplication or improper usage of store devices. Store managers have provided statements describing not only the material loss but the resultant atmosphere of anxiety and insecurity felt by staff. A number of employees disclosed altered shift patterns and expressed anxiety sufficient to consider seeking transfers—indicative of the wider operational impact of your conduct.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the broader retail environment has become increasingly strained, with increasing reports of shop staff turnover and early retirement linked directly to workplace stress in theft-affected stores. These are matters to which the court must have regard, as the social fabric sustaining commercial stability is inextricably connected to the wellbeing of individual workers.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nThis court has observed, with some concern, a recurring phenomenon in which the pressures on frontline services—be they police, probation, or health-related—are compounded by cumulative low-level offending. The Legal Aid Agency, notwithstanding its stated commitment to facilitating fair access to justice, has in this district manifested procedural shortcomings including protracted approval processes for expert instructions and delayed authorisation for guardian ad litem appointments in family law proceedings. While these do not pertain directly to your charges, the systemic nature of such delays impacts the wider administration of justice and by extension the lives of defendants awaiting resolution.\n\nThe Local Authority Housing Department has submitted correspondence dated 21 June 2025, outlining ongoing challenges associated with increased homelessness and temporary accommodation allocations within the region. The linkages between housing instability, financial insecurity, and acquisitive offending have been the focus of contemporary criminological studies, though one must resist simplistic causal attributions. The court recognises that these wider social determinants create a complex background but insists that accountability remains paramount.\n\nAmong unrelated, yet strikingly illustrative case material furnished to this court was a local prosecution relating to the use of counterfeit currency at a Coventry car boot sale, prosecuted in early 2024. While entirely separate, it highlights the diversity of acquisitive behaviours that occupy judicial attention.\n\nThe Crown submits that, notwithstanding the lack of direct violence or threats, your offending has had a deleterious cumulative impact such that a deterrent and rehabilitative sentence is essential. The factual network supporting this position is built upon multiple items of direct and circumstantial evidence, including forensic collection of recovered goods and detailed witness testimonies.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nThe compilation of victim impact statements, prepared by the Coventry Retailer Liaison Unit, reveal the profound psychological effect upon those who regularly serve the public. One staff member, Ms Hannah Pearson, described losing “all sense of safety” at work following repeated thefts, necessitating counselling and prolonged leave. Another, a store manager with over 20 years’ experience, lamented the financial and emotional toll taken upon small-scale retailers operating on thin margins.\n\nThis evidence serves to amplify the seriousness with which the court must treat the persistent disregard for property rights demonstrated in your conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nAt the plea and trial preparation hearing on 17 June 2025, you elected to enter a guilty plea in respect of the charge, having previously maintained a not guilty stance. You were afforded credit for this plea, although the timing—mere weeks prior to the anticipated trial—warrants moderation of any discount in accordance with established jurisprudence, as articulated in R v. McLaren [2019] EWCA Crim 1122, which reduced the maximum available credit for late pleas in shoplifting cases.\n\nYour history reveals antecedents including previous convictions for shoplifting, as well as minor public order offences, none of which involved the use or threat of violence. There is no evidence of gang association or organised criminal enterprise in your case. This court further notes that you have declined various probation service offers for intervention, which may have assisted in addressing underlying factors.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nThe most recent pre-sentence report, prepared by Senior Probation Officer Fiona Carrick dated 29 July 2025, provides a comprehensive assessment of your offending pattern, social circumstances, and risk profile. The report identifies medium risk of serious harm primarily attributable to acquisitive offending, consistent with impulsive traits outlined in the psychiatric assessment. It underscores your continued unstable accommodation status and lack of sustained employment as contributors to reoffending risk.\n\nOffender engagement with community services has been sporadic and inconsistent. Recommendations include enrolment on a Cognitive Behavioural Programme tailored to theft offenders, exploration of substance misuse treatment options, and enhanced financial management support. Ms Carrick’s report expresses concern that without structured intervention, the risk of reoffending remains significant.\n\nFurthermore, this court must consider the established framework set out in the Sentencing Council Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (reissued 2020), which emphasises factors such as harm, culpability, premeditation, and mitigating circumstances. While this was not a high-value single theft, the cumulative impact, deliberate planning, and failure to desist following prior warnings place this offending in a higher culpability bracket.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nIt is incumbent here to recognise that the court, while exercising its duty to protect the public and uphold the rule of law, also endeavours to ensure sentencing outcomes that are not merely punitive but orientated towards rehabilitation where feasible. The prospect of community-based remedies including rehabilitation activity requirements or unpaid work may be considered where suitable. However, your repeated failure to engage with non-custodial measures necessitates careful reflection on the proportionality of any custodial element.\n\nThe court is mindful that in recent years, pressures on probation resourcing have escalated dramatically, with caseloads increasing disproportionately to staffing capacity, leading in some areas to delays in assessment and intervention delivery. These strains are recorded in annual Ministry of Justice reports and impact the speed and efficacy of rehabilitative efforts.\n\nYou were previously provided with opportunities for diversion from prosecution, including a conditional caution in 2023, which you breached. This pattern illustrates a troubling resistance to authority and an unwillingness to avail yourself consistently of support measures.\n\nIt remains essential for the judge, in balancing the aims of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection, to weigh carefully all contextual information, including your personal circumstances, the factual matrix of the offending, and pre-existing vulnerabilities as identified in professional reports. Nothing in that process ought to infantilise or excuse criminal responsibility.\n\nThe court is advised that sentencing will not take place today, pending receipt of an updated pre-sentence report to be furnished within the next four weeks. This will incorporate any further psychiatric or psychological assessments, as well as the views of the probation officer, to assist in a fully informed sentencing decision.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are accordingly issued this day, 14 August 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Coventry. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of the right of appeal against sentence within 28 days under statutory provisions including the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT COVENTRY  \nR v.
