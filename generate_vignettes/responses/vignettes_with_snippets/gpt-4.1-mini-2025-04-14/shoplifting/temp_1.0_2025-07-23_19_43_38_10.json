MR H  \nCase No. T2026/04567  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F. DONOVAN  \nFiled: 23 September 2026  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence in relation to charges of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct under scrutiny reflects a series of such incidents spanning several months earlier this year, primarily committed in the boroughs of Kingston and Richmond. The incidents involved multiple stores, ranging from small convenience shops to mid-sized pharmacy outlets, and formed the subject of an investigation that, while not unprecedented in approach, demonstrates the significant resources that even low-level repeat offending necessitates.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour initial arrest took place on 5 May 2026 following an investigation initiated by local policing units alongside the Kingston Retail Crime Partnership. The investigation commenced after a notable increase in retail theft reports within the borough, particularly those involving opportunistic stealing during busy trading hours. Early enquiries made clear a developing pattern of offending, with several reports linking a male subject of your description to multiple events spanning borough boundaries. It is regrettable, but not surprising, that incidents of this nature are frequently dispersed and treated as discrete; establishing the pattern requires extensive cross-referencing of store logs, staff accounts, and surveillance records, which are often incomplete or inconsistent.\n\nThe reliance on footage from closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems, while invaluable, remains a laborious endeavour. Often, these recordings are subject to technical limitations such as poor image resolution, intermittent coverage, or unhelpful camera angles, mandating painstaking review sessions by specialist officers. Store staff, typically untrained in evidential procedures, provide statements that differ in detail and clarity, and it is left to the diligence of investigators to collate these accounts into a coherent evidential narrative. These efforts are vital but time-consuming and drain valuable police resources. In this case, the Kingston Safer Neighbourhoods Team and the Business Crime Reduction Unit collaborated to produce a series of intelligence bulletins, mapping out suspected offending patterns and identifying risk factors linked to repeat incidents. The case was subsequently transferred to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, which aims to streamline proceedings while ensuring compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules.\n\nThe case has been subject to several hearings since initial charge, including a plea and trial preparation hearing which took place on 15 July 2026. At that time, you entered a not guilty plea, asserting that the evidence was insufficient or misattributed. However, following further instruction and disclosure of CCTV material, forensic comparisons, and victim statements, you changed your plea to guilty on 2 September 2026. It is necessary to remark that your change of plea was made well past the adjudged first opportunity, a factor which bears upon potential mitigation afforded for acceptance of responsibility.\n\nAccordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules and associated protocols has largely been observed in this matter, notwithstanding delays occasioned by the late provision of expert reports and challenges in Legal Aid authorisation. These delays are regrettable, impinging on the court’s desire for expeditious resolution, yet reflect ongoing systemic difficulties. Your legal representatives have been commendably thorough in their advocacy, notwithstanding these impediments, and I thank both Mr Nigel Clay for the Crown and Ms Pamela Boroughs for the defence for their measured and comprehensive submissions. \n\nThe case also benefits from contributions by community agencies, including the Kingston Business Alliance and local voluntary organisations. Their correspondence has elucidated the broader impact of repeated theft on small business confidence, employee wellbeing, and the sustainability of local economic activity. It is a salutary reminder that offences of this nature, while often appearing mundane in isolation, cumulatively exert significant deleterious effects on the fabric of local commerce and social cohesion.\n\nIn the wider context, it is apt to note that the Theft Act 1968, under which you are charged, has undergone various amendments and interpretative refinements since its inception. The offense of theft is defined by the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof. The statute’s evolution reflects changing societal expectations and judicial interpretations, including the 1980s reforms introducing notions of property and rights pertaining to immediate possession, as well as more recent case law addressing complexities introduced by digital economies and service-based assets.\n\nPrecedent from appellate courts, such as R v. Dawson [2019] EWCA Crim 1782 and R v. Pearce [2020] EWCA Crim 1450, sheds light on aggravating and mitigating factors applicable to theft offences. Dawson underscored the heightened culpability where offending involved vulnerable victims or sustained campaigns across multiple premises, while Pearce provided guidance on sentencing ranges where community impact was demonstrably significant. Of course, these cases differ in factual particulars but remain instructive. Conversely, R v. Collins [2018] EWCA Crim 1949 exemplifies the boundaries of accepted mitigation in cases involving clear evidence yet limited harm in monetary terms.\n\nIt is important to highlight that cases involving acquisitive crime regularly engage with the principles articulated in the guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council, notably the Theft Offences guideline published in 2022. That document emphasises a graduated approach to sentencing—one calibrated not merely by the financial value of stolen property, but by the means employed, the persistence of offending, impact on victims, and offender circumstances.\n\nIn preparing these remarks, I have also reviewed commentary on the evolution of court processes, particularly the Better Case Management initiative, which seeks to balance efficiency with fairness. While in this instance procedural standards have been substantially maintained, the court is increasingly aware of the strain imposed by prolonged pre-trial activity, particularly in cases where Legal Aid delays hinder the timely instruction of experts.\n\nIt is worth recording the court’s concern that the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative burdens often impede the prompt commissioning of expert assessments critical to sentencing. This matter was no exception: initial applications for psychiatric evaluation encountered multiple rounds of clarification and delay before approval. Such procedural encumbrances contribute to backlog, frustrate defence preparation, and ultimately undermine confidence in the timely administration of justice.\n\nWithin the criminal justice system, the role of forensic and psychiatric experts remains vital. Reports tendered in this case, notably from Dr Michael Pembroke, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, furnish insight into the defendant’s mental health and risk profile. Dr Pembroke’s detailed and professionally composed evaluation, based on clinical interview, psychometric testing, and case documentation, concluded that while no severe psychiatric pathology was identified, Mr H exhibits traits consistent with impulsivity, low distress tolerance, and intermittent substance misuse. The report carefully contextualises these findings within the framework of criminal responsibility, highlighting the absence of impaired mens rea but noting contributory factors relevant to rehabilitation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe facts of this case are both specific and troubling. Surveillance footage, witness accounts, and police findings converge on a narrative of repeated and deliberate dishonesty within retail environments. The precision with which Mr H selected targets, timing entries to coincide with staff distractions, and concealment methods employed, reveal a degree of sophistication beyond simple opportunism.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nIt is not the role of the court to speculate unduly about motivations, though reports and submissions acknowledge financial hardship and housing insecurity as background conditions. While such factors may offer context, they cannot excuse criminal conduct. Indeed, it must be observed that numerous community-based agencies extend assistance to vulnerable individuals facing economic challenge, including Kingston First Response and the local Citizen Advice Bureau, among others. Data from these organisations points to increased demand across multiple indices of distress, including employment instability, food insecurity, and mental health pressures. Their efforts remain constrained, however, by limited resources and staffing shortages.\n\nIn recent years, the Probation Service has similarly faced challenges, with increased caseloads, recruitment difficulties, and elevated administrative duties diminishing capacity for intensive offender supervision. This case was initially managed by Probation Officer Laura Sinclair, whose efforts to engage Mr H were hindered by intermittent attendance and ambivalence toward offered support, a common issue that the service continues to strive to address in the face of budgetary and personnel constraints.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nClinical input from Dr Pembroke advises that intervention focusing on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) tailored to impulsivity and offence-related thinking may yield benefit. The report recommends the exploration of a community order incorporating rehabilitative requirements, subject to feasibility determined by probation assessment.\n\nProfessional experience underscores the difficulty of achieving meaningful rehabilitation without consistent engagement and motivation from the offender. The voluntary sector, including organisations such as Kingston Outreach and the Community Resilience Project, continually endeavours to supplement statutory provision, yet systemic underfunding constrains their reach.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThe case is not without precedent concerning sentencing outcomes for similar offending. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Talbot [2024] EWCA Crim 2065 is instructive. Talbot was found guilty of multiple counts of shoplifting involving repeated incursions into charity shops and pharmacies. The court affirmed a custodial sentence of eight months, noting the cumulative undermining of retail staff morale and the broader community consequences.\n\nSimilarly, R v. Ingram [2023] EWCA Crim 1999 involved a defendant convicted of persistent acquisitive offending within transportation hubs, reflecting aggravation owing to repeat offending and targeting of commuter-focused businesses. The custodial sentence imposed was upheld on appeal, with the court endorsing the view that repeated offending, even at low individual value, may warrant imprisonment where deterrence and public protection are concerned.\n\nThese rulings reflect a judicial recognition that acquisitive offences’ impact is not confined to financial loss but extends to the social fabric, employment confidence, and the victim experience of safety and dignity. This principle aligns with findings from victim impact statements tendered in this case, which describe increased staff anxiety, alteration of working patterns, and modified store security protocols.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nIt is to be noted that the defendant’s record includes prior convictions for theft-related offences, the most recent of which occurred in 2023 and resulted in a conditional discharge. This history evidences a pattern and diminishes the scope of mitigation for personal circumstances alone.\n\nAn additional point of procedural interest is the absence of co-defendants or allegations of organised activity connected to this offending. The case stands as that of an individual offender, notwithstanding some peripheral references in the investigation file to an associate subsequently cleared of involvement in unrelated matter. The differentiation of responsibility remains clear and unambiguous.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nArguably less pertinent but nevertheless present in the documentation before the court is material concerning other offending in the area during the same period, including a violent altercation outside a local pub involving pool cues, as recorded in R v. Sweeney [2025] EWCA Crim 1324. That case, while serious and warranting considerable custodial sentence, has no bearing on Mr H’s conduct or risk profile.\n\nSimilarly, references to a co-defendant in an unrelated drug importation case, R v. Bernard [2026] EWCA Crim 1877, appear incidentally in correspondence but are rightly excluded from considerations here.\n\nThe court also notes procedural disruptions caused by strike action within the city’s court reporting services earlier this year, which contributed to listing pressures but did not affect substantive prosecution or defence rights.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nThe victim impact statements, including those provided by the Kingston Business Alliance and specific store managers, reveal that while there were no direct physical threats or violence associated with the offences, the psychological effects were tangible. Employees report increased stress, fears for personal security, and diminished job satisfaction. Small businesses describe diminished footfall and increased operational costs linked to enhanced security measures such as additional staffing and installation of anti-theft devices.\n\nIt is a consistent lament of the criminal justice system that such offences seldom attract coverage or public attention commensurate with their impact. There are no flashing headlines or dramatic episodes, merely the accumulation of repeated breaches of trust that cumulatively corrode community spirit.\n\nSuch findings intersect with wider social challenges, including an upsurge in street homelessness and begging, which local social care providers link to economic pressures, substance dependency, and austerity impacts. While tangential to this case, these social phenomena colour the broader environment in which offences occur.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe cumulative effect of the offending, together with the absence of constructive engagement on your part with community or rehabilitation services, prompts serious consideration of a sentence that reflects public protection, acknowledgment of harm, and the need to deter further such conduct.\n\nWhile a custodial sentence is the established norm in cases of persistent acquisitive offending, this court remains mindful of the importance of proportionate and individualised sentencing. The presentence report, which will be prepared with all available information and any updates from the Probation Service, will assist in framing an appropriate disposal.\n\nI emphasise the necessity for consideration of community-based interventions tailored to your criminogenic needs, including potential cognitive-behavioural programming and support addressing financial and housing instability. The extent to which such measures may be effective depends in no small part on your motivation and willingness to engage with services.\n\nThis assessment must also take into account the well-documented pressures on statutory and voluntary sector resources, the impact of which is felt acutely by offenders with complex needs.\n\nIt is therefore the court’s intention to adjourn before pronouncing sentence, pending receipt of the comprehensive pre-sentence report and any further professional assessments.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this 23rd day of September 2026 in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Kingston. The record has been produced in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. Mr H is informed of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged at this time. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT KINGSTON  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2026/04567  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F.
