MR H  \nCase No. T2025/15429  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. E. THOMPSON  \nFiled: 17 September 2025\n\nMr H, you are before this court for sentence following your conviction on a charge relating to shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a period from early 2023 through to June 2025 and involves multiple retail establishments situated within the Hartford metropolitan area and the adjoining boroughs. The incidents collectively indicate a prolonged and deliberate course of criminal behaviour, targeting stores frequented by members of the community and employing methods designed to evade detection.\n\nProcedural Background  \nYou were first brought to the attention of law enforcement on 15 May 2025, during the course of an investigation initiated by the Hartford Retail Crime Alliance. This consortium encompasses representatives from local retail chains, municipal policing, and community safety officers, aimed at addressing the apparent surge in shop thefts within the city centre. The Alliance’s intelligence gathering was catalysed by a discernible pattern of similar thefts occurring across various outlets, with a consistent description of a male suspect matching your physical characteristics, including distinctive apparel noted by multiple eyewitnesses. The investigation subsequently expanded to incorporate surveillance footage analysis, witness interviews, and digital forensics.\n\nIt is, unfortunately, common that such offending unfolds behind a veneer of ordinariness, with frequent recourse to techniques enabling the offender to blend innocuously among shoppers. The judicial system is frequently confronted with the challenge of assembling evidential packages from incomplete or fragmentary sources, notably when video recordings are of limited quality or when victimised businesses lack the resources to mount comprehensive investigative initiatives. Despite advances in technology and collaborative policing efforts, it remains the case that offences often require a concerted commitment of time and expertise to marshal sufficient proof to meet the criminal standard. This procedural reality speaks less to the seriousness of each individual incident, and more to the cumulative strain placed upon our criminal justice institutions when confronting persistent acquisitive offending.\n\nIn the present case, one remarks that the Hartford Retail Crime Alliance’s coordinated efforts represent an instance of effective inter-agency cooperation, albeit one that required sustained vigilance and the pooling of information from multiple retail outlets. The initial charges were brought against you on 2 July 2025, subsequent to your arrest on 30 June, following an operation involving uniformed officers, plainclothes detectives, and technical specialists engaged in CCTV footage enhancement. The application of digital enhancement techniques, though now commonplace, remains a resource-intensive process, often necessitating specialist personnel whose availability is limited by competing demands in other priority areas such as violent crime and counter-terrorism. \n\nIt warrants acknowledging that this case proceeded under the Better Case Management (BCM) procedures established pursuant to amendments to the Criminal Procedure Rules in 2020. This regime aims to expedite case progression, identify key issues at an early stage, and reduce unnecessary adjournments. It is a point of professional satisfaction to note that the relevant parties – police, prosecution, and defence – complied with pre-trial disclosure and scheduling expectations to a commendable degree. The plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 15 August 2025 before this court, at which you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequently, evidence was served including multiple staff statements, enhanced video materials, and seizure records of items recovered in your possession at arrest.\n\nThe reluctance of some defendants to admit guilt early in the proceedings is a familiar, albeit regrettable, feature of modern criminal practice. While the law appropriately permits defendants to contest charges until proven, the consequences for victims, witnesses, and court resource are tangible and significant. The judiciary is mindful of the guidance established in authorities such as R v. Faraday [2022] EWCA Crim 2489, which emphasises the importance of timely pleas in ensuring the efficient conduct of trials and the sparing of victims from protracted distress. The court will apply that principle in the assessment of any mitigation for your eventual plea.\n\nThere is also merit in briefly reflecting on the historiography of the Theft Act 1968 itself. Enacted at a time when retail trade and the consumer environment were undergoing profound transformation, the statute sought to balance the interests of proprietors with the rights of accused individuals in a manner consistent with evolving societal standards. Throughout its application, jurisprudence has grappled with delineating the boundaries between inadvertent misappropriation, necessity-based conduct, and intentional dishonesty. While such considerations are of academic interest, the present matter is plainly situated within the sphere of deliberate, recurrent offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nIn considering the factual matrix, it must be stated that the offences spanned a variety of retail outlets, including both independent high-street businesses and larger chain stores. There is evidence that you exploited staffing patterns, including times when fewer employees were on duty, and utilised accessories such as bags or outerwear to conceal items. Surveillance footage depicts a blend of opportunism and calculated conduct. The temporal distribution of offences reveals multiple incidents in quick succession, indicating a sustained readiness to engage in illegal activity despite prior interventions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nTurning to relevant case law, the Court is invariably guided by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences (2020), which provides structured criteria for assessing culpability and harm. Aggravating factors pertinent to the present case include the frequency and deliberate concealment of stolen goods, evidence of planning, and the deleterious impact on victim businesses, many of which operate on tight margins and rely heavily on local custom.\n\nIt is appropriate to mention decisions such as R v. Conway [2019] EWCA Crim 1210, which addressed repeat shoplifting with an emphasis on the persistence of offending and the need for deterrence. There, the Court of Appeal underscored that the cumulative effect of repeated shop thefts may warrant custodial sentences, even when individual episodes involve low monetary value. Likewise, R v. Cartwright [2017] EWCA Crim 254 affirmed that the psychological effects on retail staff and the erosion of trust within communities are relevant sentencing considerations.\n\nIt is also notable that in R v. Daltry [2021] EWCA Crim 497, the Court dealt with an offender exhibiting a similar pattern of behaviour, who repeatedly exploited self-service checkouts to conceal goods and avoid detection. The court emphasised that the sophistication of such modus operandi may elevate the seriousness of offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThis case was remanded for a psychiatric evaluation at your counsel’s behest. The assessment was conducted by Dr Sheila Markham, a consultant forensic psychiatrist with extensive experience in acquisitive crime and impulse control disorders. Her report, dated 5 September 2025, confirms the absence of major mental illness but identifies traits consistent with moderate impulsivity and features suggestive of mild anxiety and low mood. Dr Markham noted that you denied problematic substance misuse, though acknowledged some episodic alcohol use. Of particular note was your reluctance to engage consistently with community support services, which Dr Markham characterises as a barrier to effective rehabilitation. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4} \n\nThe impression conveyed by the psychiatric report is one of potential vulnerability, albeit insufficient in itself to diminish moral blameworthiness. The court also reviewed a pre-sentence report prepared by probation officer Helen Wilkins. Her report, dated 10 September 2025, references your prior convictions for theft and summary offences spanning the last decade, none involving violence or sexual offending. The report highlights difficulties including periods of unstable housing, intermittent employment, and a limited support network. Importantly, it records your failure to comply with previous diversionary programmes, including a community order with an unpaid work requirement imposed in 2021.\n\nA salient point within that document is the probation officer’s observation of local service pressures. The current shortage of probation officers, with caseloads exceeding recommended limits, complicates the delivery of tailored supervision and offender management. These systemic constraints present obstacles to rehabilitation planning but do not absolve offenders of responsibility for their actions.\n\nIt must be said that funding and resources available for community-based interventions in acquisitive crime remain limited, despite growing demand. This is a chronic issue documented in multiple reports from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation and underscored by Parliamentary Select Committees. This court notes the commendable but stretched efforts of local voluntary sector organisations who aim to support offenders facing financial hardship, chaotic lifestyles, and addiction challenges.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nAmong victim impact evidence considered was a statement from Ms Karen Doyle, proprietor of a small pharmacy, who detailed the economic and emotional toll wrought by repeated thefts. She lamented both direct loss of stock and the indirect effects of staff anxiety, increased security expenditure, and the tarnishing of community reputation. Similar sentiments were echoed in correspondence from the North Hartford Business Improvement District, which cited a rising prevalence of retail crime as a factor contributing to declining footfall and attendant risks for urban regeneration efforts.\n\nThe court also had regard to a letter from the Hartford Citizens’ Advice Bureau, outlining the broader social context including employment challenges and welfare changes affecting individuals in your demographic. While such perspectives provide important context for policymakers and social planners, they can neither excuse nor justify unlawful conduct. It is a fundamental tenet of the criminal justice system that individual accountability remains paramount.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nThis court further notes the enduring challenges faced by those residential landlords who provide accommodation to tenants with complex needs. In this context, a letter from your housing association notes prior noise complaints unrelated to your tenancy, reflecting broader issues in multi-occupancy properties. Though tangential to the offence before me, these factors underscore the difficulties encountered by front-line public services in maintaining environments conducive to stability and rehabilitation.\n\nThe court acknowledges that your personal circumstances have been complicated by periods of homelessness and social isolation. These are recognized risk factors for engagement in acquisitive crime, as numerous criminological studies attest. Nevertheless, distinctions must be drawn between causal influences and excuse. Courts are vigilant to the risk of romanticising hardship.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nTurning now to the matter of sentencing. The Theft Act 1968’s sentencing framework establishes a range of custodial and community disposals proportionate to the offence’s harm and culpability. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines provide structure but leave room for judicial discretion informed by individual circumstances.\n\nIt is not the function of this court to impose sentences motivated by retribution alone, but neither does the court seek to gloss over the seriousness and impact of repeated dishonesty. The appropriate balance must encompass punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public.\n\nR v. Westwood [2018] EWCA Crim 1552 stresses the utility of community sentences equipped with tailored interventions to address underlying causes and reduce recidivism in acquisitive offending. However, that approach depends on genuine engagement. Where offenders persist with offending despite previous warnings and community-based disposals, as your record shows, the prospect of custody is heightened.\n\nThe court remains conscious of the well-documented mental health pressures endemic within the criminal justice population, as highlighted in NHS England’s 2024 report on service provision and unmet need. While the present psychiatric assessment does not indicate major pathology, the mildly elevated risk of impulse-driven offending is relevant to structuring rehabilitative interventions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nI have had the benefit of submissions from Mr Julian Forbes, who appeared on your behalf, and Ms Rachel Morgan for the Crown. Mr Forbes urged consideration of a community order incorporating an accredited offending behaviour programme and structured drug and alcohol support should it be deemed appropriate following further assessment. Ms Morgan correctly emphasised the necessity of sanction commensurate with the persistent nature of the offending and the real, quantified harm endured by local businesses and staff.\n\nThe court acknowledges the unacceptably frequent delays in funding authorisations for expert assessments in criminal cases. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted determination process has, regrettably, contributed to adjournments and increased anxiety for all participants. Recent Parliamentary debate has called attention to this systemic issue, urging reform to enhance efficiency and responsiveness.\n\nIn matters of court management, I note that this case was delayed due to a short staffing period occasioned by the industrial action undertaken by regional court clerks earlier this year. Such challenges remain a constant undercurrent within our justice system, impacting timeframes and resource allocation across all tiers of courts.\n\nIt is also relevant to underline that the premises affected are serviced by a combination of local CCTV schemes and private security patrols interconnected via a central command room operated by the Netherbridge Service Partnership. This layering of security is indicative of retailers’ increasing attempts to deter theft and antisocial behaviour. While technologically impressive, it has not eliminated offending, highlighting the limitations of surveillance absent effective social and enforcement policy.\n\nIn light of the evidence and reports received, I shall direct the preparation of an up-to-date pre-sentence report. The probation service is instructed particularly to consider the viability of a community order incorporating elements of unpaid work, cognitive-behavioural therapy focusing on criminal thinking patterns, and comprehensive reintegration support addressing employment and housing stability.\n\nThis court also encourages relevant agencies to explore appropriate mental health interventions aligned with Dr Markham’s observations, while recognising the limits imposed by insufficient capacity within NHS community provision and local counselling services.\n\nThe sentencing hearing today has been conducted fully in open court. I commend the professionalism of all legal representatives involved, and of courtroom staff who have ensured smooth proceedings despite environmental limitations and intermittent equipment malfunctions.\n\nIn conclusion, Mr H, you face a sentencing decision that must reflect the seriousness of your repeated conduct; the harm caused to victim businesses and their employees; your personal circumstances, including the mental health factors assessed; and the overarching interests of justice and public protection.\n\nThe matter stands adjourned for the pre-sentence report to be prepared and lodged, with sentencing to follow on a date to be fixed shortly thereafter. You are reminded of your right of legal representation, appeal, and the importance of cooperating fully with all required assessments.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued on this 17th day of September 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Hartford. Proceedings have been recorded and are transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities for recording and future reference. You are advised of your right to appeal against any sentence imposed within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTFORD  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2025/15429  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. E.
