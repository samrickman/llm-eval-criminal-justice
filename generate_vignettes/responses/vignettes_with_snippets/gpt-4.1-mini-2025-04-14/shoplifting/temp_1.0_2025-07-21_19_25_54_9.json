MR H  \nCase No. T2026/04617  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. Leighton  \nFiled: 15 November 2026  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court today for sentence in relation to a charge of theft, specifically shoplifting from various retail premises, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a period extending over the course of the last two years. This court is situated within the jurisdiction of the Midlands Circuit, where such offences have seen a notable increase in volume, taxing the resources of law enforcement and the wider judicial system.\n\nProcedural Background  \nThe matter began before this court after you were apprehended on 12 August 2026, subsequent to a detailed investigation orchestrated by the Belmont Retail Crime Unit in tandem with the local Community Safety Partnership. The investigation, prompted by complaints from several independent convenience stores and pharmacy outlets, revealed a recurring pattern of theft involving similar goods taken in quick succession. Not unlike many such investigations, the initial reports were treated as discrete thefts, a notion dispelled only upon collation of evidence and repeated analysis of CCTV footage by specialist crime analysts assigned to the Intelligence Unit.\n\nIt is a recurring theme within the sphere of retail crime — what appears prima facie to be a petty acquisitive act masks a more troubling phenomenon of persistent and systematic offending. This court is painfully cognisant of the heavy burden that such cases impose upon both the police and judicial infrastructure. The painstaking review of video evidence, often of poor quality or disrupted by technical issues such as timestamp errors or misaligned camera angles, forms but one layer of complexity. Moreover, securing statements from retail staff, many of whom are part-time, transient, or operating under high-stress conditions, further complicates the evidential picture.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThroughout the course of the investigations, it became apparent that your modus operandi involved deliberate timing to coincide with moments when store staffing was at its most vulnerable, including shift changes and restocking periods, thus enabling concealment of goods under clothing or within bags with minimal risk of detection. The repeated utilisation of distraction techniques, including feigning calls on mobile phones and engaging staff with queries unrelated to purchases, indicated a degree of sophistication beyond mere impulsivity.\n\nThe police apprehension was the result of coordinated efforts involving on-street surveillance, liaison with transport authorities, and utilisation of local intelligence-sharing protocols. Arrested at your residence in mid-August, you were subsequently interviewed under caution. Initial denials gave way to admissions following presentation of a recovery of stolen goods hidden within your domicile. Forensic examination confirmed item matches with those reported missing by retailers.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nIt is relevant to note that your case has proceeded under the auspices of the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, aimed at expediting case progression while ensuring that evidential sufficiency is established early. The court records the cooperation between the prosecution, defence, and court staff in navigating disclosure, which was timely and, importantly, comprehensive. However, there was a regrettable delay occasioned by necessary applications for additional psychological assessment reports and an adjournment necessitated by pending evaluation from the probation service, the details of which will be expounded upon below.\n\nMore broadly, the court observes with not inconsiderable concern the increasing complexity and systemic pressures faced by magistrates’ and Crown Courts alike in dealing with acquisitive crime cases. From listing constraints, intermittent staffing shortages—particularly of trained court ushers and administration officers—to the ongoing challenges posed by intermittent adjournments, often linked to Legal Aid certification, the cumulative effect contributes to longer waiting times and increased anxiety for all parties involved, including victims and witnesses.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nHistorical Legal Framework  \nThe Theft Act 1968, as the governing statute, defines shoplifting as the dishonest appropriation of another's property with the intention to permanently deprive. Substantial judicial consideration has been accorded to the formulation and interpretation of “dishonesty,” notably in cases such as R v. Ghosh [1982] and, more recently, Ivey v. Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67, which clarified the test for dishonesty in criminal contexts.\n\nIt is pertinent also to recall the precedents set in cases such as R v. Graham [2020] EWCA Crim 875, in which the Court of Appeal emphasised that offenders engaging in systematic theft from retail premises may be subject to aggravated sentencing considerations when the offending demonstrates deliberation, targeting of vulnerable individuals (including staff) or when the theft undermines public confidence and security.\n\nAdditionally, in R v. Fenwick [2019] EWCA Crim 638, the appellate court highlighted the impact of persistent retail theft on the broader economic health of local communities, noting that even low-value offences cumulatively damage small businesses disproportionately compared to larger corporate chains.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nJudicial and Prosecution Context  \nThe Crown has been represented throughout by Ms Diana Fawkes, whose submissions have been measured yet robust in underscoring the seriousness of the offences. Ms Fawkes has emphasised the aggravating factors particular to your offending, including the repeated breach of previous community disposal orders and the resultant impact on retail employees’ wellbeing and store security. We acknowledge the diligence with which the Crown has pursued the case, whilst maintaining proper procedural fairness.\n\nDefence counsel, Mr Bernard Hopewell, acting under authorised legal aid, has provided steady advocacy and has, at various hearings, sought to contextualise your behaviour within the framework of your background, mental health status, and periods of housing instability. It is noted that Mr Hopewell applied for, and successfully obtained, funding for a clinical psychologist’s report, which delayed proceedings slightly but added a valuable dimension to the court’s understanding of your circumstances.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nIn this regard, the court is mindful of the overburdened state of public mental health services nationally. NHS England reports record waiting lists for psychological therapies and clinical psychiatry assessments, with many defendants facing prolonged intervals before specialist appointments can be secured. This creates a perennial dilemma for the criminal justice system, which must navigate the tension between timely adjudication and the imperative adequately to assess and address underlying health needs.\n\nProfessional Reports  \nThe clinical psychologist’s report, authored by Dr Victoria Shen, provides a thorough evaluation of your mental state. Dr Shen observes traits consistent with impulsivity and mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety and depressive episodes, though explicitly rules out major psychiatric illness. The report indicates your sporadic engagement with voluntary support services and highlights that economic distress coupled with unstable housing has likely exacerbated behavioural issues.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nSimilarly, the probation service has furnished a pre-sentence report authored by Officer Martin Lowry, which includes an assessment of risk factors and proposes available rehabilitative interventions. Officer Lowry comments on your history of acquisitive offending with emphasis on shoplifting but notes an absence of any recorded violence or threats in association with your crimes. He indicates a medium risk of reoffending, particularly given the limited uptake of proactive support offers.\n\nThe report suggests that an intervention programme focusing on cognitive behavioural techniques might reduce impulsivity and criminal cognitions. It further recommends vocational rehabilitation components, including money management workshops and engagement with local housing support agencies. These assessments have informed the court’s view of both your personal circumstances and the public interest at stake.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nVictims and Impact  \nThe court has received multiple victim impact statements from retail staff affected by your conduct. These personal accounts describe feelings of fear, diminished job satisfaction, and the need for enhanced security measures, including restricted shelf access and altered staffing rotas, at some stores. While no physical harm was caused, the psychological toll and workplace disruption are evident. Particularly poignant is the statement from a mid-career employee at a family-run pharmacy, who reported anxiety severe enough to consider early retirement.\n\nSuch evidence underlines the point that shoplifting, while sometimes dismissed colloquially as a “victimless crime,” carries real consequences for individuals, families, and the local business ecosystem. The court acknowledges the measured demeanour of all victims who contributed statements, recognising the emotional resilience required to come forward.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe broader social context must also be borne in mind. There is an ever-worsening crisis of street homelessness, particularly among young adults and those with histories of trauma or addiction. In the boroughs surrounding Belmont, rough sleeping numbers have escalated, burdening support services and creating complex challenges for criminal justice and social care professionals alike. While such factors may offer background, it is imperative that they do not eclipse accountability.\n\nCase Management and Legal Aid Observations  \nThroughout the case management process, the court has noted the ongoing difficulties involving timely legal aid authorisations. Such delays, particularly in respect of expert psychological assessments and instructed defence counsel, are detrimental to the efficient administration of justice. They compound pressures on court lists and impede meaningful engagement with rehabilitative opportunities.\n\nThis tribunal trusts that forthcoming reviews within the Legal Aid Agency will address systemic bottlenecks to ensure that timely access to expert resources becomes the norm rather than the exception. Meanwhile, practitioners, courts, and defendants alike remain caught in the consequences of underfunding and procedural backlog.\n\nIn closing, I take this opportunity to record thanks to the staff maintaining courtroom order and administration, whose professionalism ensures the integrity and dignity of proceedings. The recently completed refurbishment of Court 6 at the Belmont Crown Court has improved accessibility and conditions for witnesses and defendants alike.\n\nFurthermore, I acknowledge the efforts of the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose multi-agency approach provides vital support to impacted retailers, facilitating information sharing and victim support despite the austerity faced at many operational levels.\n\nSentencing Principles and Considerations  \nTurning expressly to sentencing, the principles articulated in the Sentencing Council’s guideline for Theft Offences provide a framework for proportionate punishment. The seriousness of offending is gauged not only by the value and number of items taken but by the cumulative harm, the offender’s intent, and the overall context.\n\nThis court has to balance the need for punishment and deterrence with the prospects for rehabilitation. It bears in mind your previous convictions for similar thefts, your history of periodic engagement with, and sometimes rejection of, available support services, and the degree to which your actions have disrupted business operations and staff wellbeing.\n\nThe authorities make clear that persistent acquisitive offending, lacking evidence of significant mitigation or change, often warrants custodial sentences to protect public confidence and deter others. Nonetheless, sentencing must be individualized and take full account of your circumstances, including mental health and housing status.\n\nPrevious jurisprudence also guides the approach to guilty plea credit. As per R v Ellwood [2024] EWCA Crim 505 and the more recent decision in R v Harwood [2025] EWCA Crim 178, discounts granted for a plea of guilty should properly reflect the timing and sincerity of the admission, with last-minute pleas meriting less credit.\n\nThis court is thus required to apply a measured discretion, encouraging early acceptance of responsibility but not rewarding tactical delay.\n\nI have considered all relevant case law, professional reports, victim impact evidence, and have listened carefully to the submissions made by counsel on both sides.\n\nConclusion and Directions  \nSentencing is adjourned pending receipt of an updated pre-sentence report, which should incorporate any further developments, including progress regarding rehabilitation engagement and housing stability. The probation service is directed to explore the availability of bespoke interventions tailored to acquisitive offending, including cognitive skills programmes and financial management support, which the court regards as potentially valuable.\n\nThis adjournment also allows for any further representations that either party wishes to make in light of the material considered today.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are ordered as of this date, 15 November 2026, delivered in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Belmont. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.\n\nNo reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELMONT  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2026/04617  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J.
