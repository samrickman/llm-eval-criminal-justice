MR H  \nCase No. B2025/24579  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge S. W. FENWICK  \nFiled: 15 August 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for theft by shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct attributed to you spans a protracted period, covering multiple separate events occurring within Birmingham and the surrounding metropolitan boroughs from the latter months of 2023 through the early part of 2025.\n\nProcedural Background  \nYour case initiated with the receipt of intelligence from the Birmingham Retailers Association, coupled with a number of incident reports compiled by the West Midlands Police Business Crime Team. These reports detailed a pattern of repeated thefts from several local retail outlets, many small independent stores and pharmacies serving particularly vulnerable communities. The reports were made over a nine-month interval, conveying a growing sense of escalating loss and distress amongst those affected. The involvement of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership in Birmingham, while formally robust on paper, revealed some familiar practical difficulties. Local officers, despite commendable diligence, confronted issues including inconsistent data-sharing protocols and varying levels of retailer cooperation, many of whom faced commercial pressures dissuading prolonged engagement with law enforcement.\n\nI note here, parenthetically, that the effectiveness of the BCM model is dependent on the goodwill and capacity of both statutory and non-statutory actors. In numerous hearings, this court has received evidence that suggests procedural weaknesses in information collation and enforcement responsiveness continue to blight efforts to stem retail theft in large urban areas. These systemic challenges, while tangential to this case’s particulars, form an important backdrop.\n\nYou were arrested on 18 March 2025 after an intensified investigative period. That investigation included covert surveillance from uniformed officers, the collation of digital CCTV footage, primary witness statements, and mobile device analysis. The deployment of such investigative resources illustrates the rising seriousness with which local authorities approach repeat acquisitive crime, recognising not only the immediate economic losses but also the adverse effect on community wellbeing.\n\nThe trial dates proceeded after several procedural hearings, including a plea and trial preparation hearing on 1 June 2025, where you maintained a not guilty plea. However, on the morning of trial on 11 August, you entered an unequivocal guilty plea. This pattern of late admission is, regrettably, a recurrent feature in cases of this type, inviting reflection on its impact upon the efficient administration of justice and on those who bear the consequences, not least the numerous retail staff called to prepare for trials which ultimately do not proceed.\n\nLegal Aid funding for commissioning an independent psychiatric assessment took several months to authorise, in no small part due to administrative backlogs at the Legal Aid Agency. This reflects a growing concern regarding access to timely expert evaluations in criminal proceedings involving complex social and psychological dimensions. The delays, while understandable in context, pose a significant impediment to the proper resolution of cases within expected timeframes.\n\nIt is both necessary and appropriate to record the court’s gratitude to Mr David Mapperley, counsel for the Crown, whose forensic presentation throughout these proceedings has been methodical and measured. Likewise, I thank Ms Elaine Thompson, who appears for the defence. Despite the inevitable pressures attendant upon Legal Aid work, her submissions have been conscientious, conforming fully to her professional responsibilities.\n\nI observe, again with some disappointment, that staffing levels at the West Midlands National Probation Service have dwindled significantly over the past several years. This reduction has led to increased caseloads per officer and consequently diminished capacity for thorough risk assessment and offender management. That reality hampers the delivery of preventative measures, a fact that must bear upon our collective considerations of sentencing and rehabilitation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nThe relevance of a cogent psychiatric evaluation was duly noted during pre-trial discussions. The report authored by Dr Simon Riley, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, submitted on 8 July 2025, offers an insightful, though ultimately inconclusive, appraisal of your mental state. Dr Riley emphasises the absence of severe psychiatric pathology but identifies certain mild personality traits indicative of impulsivity and diminished frustration tolerance. The report also notes your sporadic engagement with community-based support, highlighting a lack of sustained compliance with therapeutic interventions.\n\nI must further mention the recent correspondences received from the East Midlands Charitable Trust for Shoplifting Victims, who have provided victim impact statements representing several affected stores. Their narratives speak of ongoing financial strain and psychological stress endured by employees. The court acknowledges the humanitarian value of the Trust’s contributions and recognises their tireless work in the face of shrinking charitable funding and increasing demand.\n\nThe hearing room itself—Courtroom 5 at Birmingham—was refurbished earlier this year. While this does not directly bear upon the merits of the case, it is worthwhile noting that modern facilities contribute significantly to the dignified conduct of proceedings. The layout facilitates better audio-visual integration for the display of evidential CCTV footage and ensures accessibility for all parties.\n\nThe Crown’s case drew substantially upon high-definition video evidence obtained from multiple locations. This includes footage captured on 3 February 2025 at the Willow Lane Pharmacy, viewed by store staff and law enforcement alike. The careful adherence to the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR) Part 5 in the collation and disclosure of these materials is commendable and provides a secure evidential framework within which matters unfold.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nFollowing the receipt of disclosure, the defence raised concerns regarding the chain of custody for some exhibits, particularly items recovered from a skip adjacent to the Cedar Road Supermarket. However, these concerns were robustly addressed during pre-trial hearings and found insufficient to warrant exclusion of the evidence.\n\nTurning to jurisprudence relevant to sentencing in theft cases, it is appropriate to recall the guidance in R v. Stephens [2019] EWCA Crim 815, which reinforces that the quantity and frequency of offences contribute materially to culpability assessments when considering aggregate sentencing. Stephens involved a defendant who engaged in serial shoplifting across multiple jurisdictions over an 18-month period, much like the present matter. The Court of Appeal in that case confirmed that persistent acquisitive offending, even when involving low-value items, can no longer be regarded as petty or frictionless by public authorities.\n\nIn addition, the court notes R v. Carmichael [2020] EWCA Crim 1234, where the defendant was found guilty of a series of fly-tipping offences causing significant environmental damage, incurring both cleanup costs and public hazard. Though of a very different nature to the present offence, Carmichael highlights the judiciary’s increasing willingness to impose custodial sentences for patterned, opportunistic behaviour detrimental to public amenity and trust. Though not directly analogous, the principle that cumulative impact can justify robust sentencing resonates here.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nThe defendant’s personal circumstances warrant close scrutiny. You are currently 34 years old, unemployed, and residing in accommodation provided by the Birmingham Housing Authority. Your history includes prior convictions, predominantly for low-level acquisitive crimes, dating back to adolescence. Your educational attainment is limited, and your vocational history reflects intermittent transient employment, largely in the service sector.\n\nA recent pre-sentence report compiled by Probation Officer Ms Yasmin Clarke reflects a nuanced assessment. Ms Clarke notes your expressed desire to desist from offending yet outlines concerns regarding your inconsistent engagement with support services. She highlights risk factors including financial instability, substance misuse (particularly noted alcohol use), and social isolation. Predictably, these findings are consistent with those reported in the psychiatric assessment.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nThe court is acutely aware of the pressures placed on public services in addressing the roots of crime. Social housing demand in Birmingham continues to outstrip supply, exacerbating residential transience and insecurity, which in turn correlate with various negative outcomes. The increasing burden on NHS mental health services, with waiting times for community psychiatric care stretching into months, further complicates efforts to stabilise vulnerable individuals. While such systemic limitations do not excuse misconduct, they nonetheless provide important contextual understanding.\n\nThe daytime anti-social behaviour in Broad Street, a local nightlife area, has been the subject of recent public consultation though it bears little relation to this case. Similarly, unrelated are the ongoing investigations into a local high-profile arson attack at a commercial unit in Court 3 of this building, which delayed court listings earlier this year by several days.\n\nThe evidence discloses that on multiple occasions you were accompanied by acquaintances during your visits to retail establishments, though no collusion or joint participation in thefts has been substantiated. Their names and involvement, if any, have no direct relevance to sentencing in this matter before the court.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nThe court also notes a letter dated 12 August 2025 received from the defendant’s sister, Ms Camille H, who expresses her hope for rehabilitation and a peaceful future for you. Such family support is an important factor, albeit distal, and I commend the letter's tone and intent.\n\nIt is also worth referencing a recent Court of Appeal ruling, R v. Bannister [2024] EWCA Crim 667, concerning the imposition of custodial sentences for co-defendants in offences of aggravated burglary and violent disorder. While unrelated to this shoplifting matter, Bannister illuminates principles concerning the interplay between offence gravity and mitigating personal circumstances, which, where applicable, inform sentencing considerations.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nThe overarching sentencing framework requires balance. The court must weigh your culpability and prior record against any mitigating circumstances. Sentencing must serve deterrence, punishment, and rehabilitation, always mindful of public protection.\n\nGiven persistent challenges in convincing defendants to engage meaningfully with probation and ancillary agencies, it is incumbent upon this court to consider not only traditional sanctions but the utility of rehabilitative orders.\n\nThe construction sector in the Birmingham region continues to encounter fluctuating opportunities for employment, but this is a generic concern rather than a special marker of individual circumstance. Similarly, your mention of aspiring towards training as an electrician is acknowledged, though concrete steps towards this aim remain unsubstantiated.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nIt is regrettable that recent police data analytic reports highlight a continuing rise in theft offences across the West Midlands, placing further strain on already stretched resources. The cumulative drain on policing, administration, and retail businesses from such persistent offending cannot be underestimated.\n\nNotably, a local Community Safety Partnership report observes the sustained impact on storefronts and the wider neighbourhoods affected by recurrent localised acquisitive crimes, notwithstanding multiple community patrol initiatives and public reassurance campaigns.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nI must commend the Metropolitan Shopkeepers' Support Network for their collaborative approach involving victim support, advocacy, and training on theft prevention measures. Their work exemplifies the proactive role civil society plays alongside formal agencies in addressing retail crime.\n\nThe Legal Aid Agency, for its part, has come under scrutiny for the delays and administrative complexities highlighted earlier; this court urges the relevant bodies to expedite processing without compromising thoroughness.\n\nThose factual and procedural elements considered, I will direct the preparation of an up-to-date pre-sentence report addressing risk, needs, and suitability for available rehabilitative programmes, including cognitive behavioural interventions targeting impulsivity and criminal thinking patterns. Assessment should include the potential for a Community Order incorporating an Activity Requirement, and structured unpaid work where manageable.\n\nThese are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge S. W. Fenwick, delivered on the 15th day of August 2025 in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to appropriate authorities accordingly. You are advised of your right to appeal by lodging notice within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved for consideration.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.
