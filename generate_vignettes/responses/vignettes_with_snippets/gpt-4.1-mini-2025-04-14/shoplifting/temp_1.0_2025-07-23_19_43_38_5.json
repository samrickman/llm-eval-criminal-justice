MR H  \nCase No. T2025/14532  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. A. WINTHROP  \nFiled: 22 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction for theft, specifically the unlawful and dishonest appropriation of goods from multiple retail premises across the Brixton and surrounding Lambeth boroughs, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct spans a period of approximately eighteen months, from early 2024 through to May 2025, during which time you engaged in a course of conduct involving repeated shoplifting episodes, principally targeting small local outlets, including convenience stores and independent drugstores.\n\nProcedural and Investigative Context  \nYou were arrested on 28 May 2025 after an extended multi-agency investigation directed by the Metropolitan Police Service in partnership with the Brixton Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP). This investigation relied upon data collation from several sources, including in-store CCTV, electronic point of sale (EPOS) discrepancy reports, and intelligence provided by store staff regarding the suspect’s modus operandi. The Chief Inspector leading the team remarked upon the “compounding frustration” across the retail sector, emphasising not only the direct losses incurred but the cumulative burden placed upon staff wellbeing and community reassurance.  \n\nThe engagement of the mayor’s Prevent initiative for London’s acquisitive crime saw additional officers seconded to assist with data analytics and safeguarding assessments, reflecting the perceived seriousness attached to repeated low-level theft in the capital’s commercial districts. Notwithstanding the apparent triviality of individual incidents—as associated case law often reflects ([see R v. Bannister [2019] EWCA Crim 1033]), the functional consequences on retail resilience, staff morale, and public confidence mean that such offences are not without gravity.\n\nThe Defence team was granted Legal Aid representation on 12 June 2025, though it should be recorded that some delays were occasioned by administrative processes at the Legal Aid Agency. Initial funding applications for an independent forensic psychologist assessment were submitted on 20 June but only authorised on 5 August after protracted correspondence and clarifications. These delays are unfortunate but illustrative of systemic pressures faced by the criminal justice system.  \n\nThe Better Case Management (BCM) regime, introduced to streamline case progression and reduce churn in the Crown Court, was strictly adhered to in this matter. The initial plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 3July 2025, with sentencing listed for 24 September. Adjournments occurred solely to allow for receipt and consideration of a psychiatric assessment and pre-sentence reports. The full cooperation of the Brixton Retail Partnership in providing victim statements and stock loss audits is gratefully noted.\n\nA plea hearing convened on 12 September 2025 saw you enter a guilty plea, although this was only after preliminary not guilty pleas at earlier stages of the proceedings. This pattern of late pleas is not unusual in acquisitive crime cases and has important sentencing implications. The Court of Appeal decisions in R v. Gautier [2021] EWCA Crim 1208 and R v. Mazur [2020] EWCA Crim 853 clarify the principles governing reductions for guilty pleas: promptness and sincerity remain key considerations. Credit for late pleas—while available—is reserved for cases where the defence demonstrates genuine acceptance of responsibility and minimises the costs borne by victims and the justice system.  \n\nIt is also prudent at this stage to acknowledge the working conditions of retail employees in the current climate, as noted in the 2023 Labour Market Report on Shopfloor Stress, which highlights increased turnover and anxiety related to shoplifting incidents. This evidence underscores the relevance of the human element behind recorded losses: shoplifting does not merely represent a financial metric, but a lived workplace challenge for many.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nHistorical and Legal Precedents  \nThe Theft Act 1968 remains the statutory bedrock governing this offence, defining theft as the dishonest appropriation of property with intent to permanently deprive, and articulating the contours of culpability. The sentencing framework set out by the Sentencing Council’s Theft guideline (2020) mandates consideration of factors such as the value of goods stolen, the sophistication of offending, use of accomplices or deception, and the impact upon victims and community confidence. The importance of proportionality in sentence is stressed throughout, balancing public protection with offender rehabilitation.\n\nThis court notes the relevance of the leading authority in this area, R v. Hamilton [2018] EWCA Crim 1460, which, though concerned with aggravated burglary, emphasised the psychological impact on victims notwithstanding absence of physical harm. A similar consideration underpins R v. Clarke [2019] EWCA Crim 1754, pertaining to cumulative impact in shoplifting offences where persistent offending generates a climate of fear within retail environments.\n\nThe Court further draws attention to R v. Joyce [2017] EWCA Crim 2253, involving trafficking of stolen goods, which was not directly engaged here but informs the wider context of property crime and the illicit economy. While Mr H has no known involvement in such activities, the Court acknowledges that persistent retail theft can undermine wider efforts to disrupt these markets.\n\nThe defendant’s prior record, as set out in the pre-sentence report, includes multiple shoplifting offences dating back to 2019, as well as minor public order warnings unrelated to this conduct. This background informs court’s assessment of both culpability and risk.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nExpert Reports and Risk Assessment  \nAn independent psychiatric report was commissioned from Dr Helen Cordova, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, who conducted a clinical interview and psychological testing on 10 August 2025. The report concluded that while Mr H does not suffer from any major mental illness, he exhibits features of moderate anxiety and emotional dysregulation, complicated by a history of unstable accommodation and intermittent alcohol misuse. Dr Cordova observes that these factors “may contribute to impulsive decision-making and reduce capacity to engage constructively with support services,” but stops short of linking these issues causally to the offending behaviour.  \n\nIn this regard, the court recalls R v. Mandelbaum [2022] EWCA Crim 1013, which articulates that whilst psychiatric conditions may mitigate culpability to some extent, they do not exempt offenders from bearing responsibility, particularly where harm has resulted.\n\nThe present report also highlights Mr H's apparent disengagement from voluntary community support programmes, despite several invitations and offers from the local authority’s outreach teams. It is regrettable that such resources are not fully utilised, particularly in a socio-economic environment where homelessness and social exclusion have markedly increased over the past five years.  \n\nWe note correspondence received from the charity Faithful Neighbours, who have attempted to provide both practical assistance and supportive counselling to you since late 2024. Their letters—respectfully submitted on your behalf—acknowledge reluctance to consistently attend scheduled appointments, referencing unsettled living arrangements and fluctuating motivation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nVictim Impact and Community Considerations  \nThe court has carefully considered several statements submitted by representatives of retail premises targeted by your offences. These include accounts of persistently elevated insecurity among staff, operational disruptions attributed to repeated stock theft, and the imposition of informal security protocols (such as limiting public store areas and reducing opening hours).\n\nContent from the Brixton Business Crime Reduction Partnership clearly articulates the cumulative economic impact of losses attributed to repeat offenders—estimated at several thousands of pounds across all affected outlets. Moreover, the psychological toll on employees cannot be overstated. One store manager’s testimony highlights that staff anxiety levels have reached a point where short staffing and altered shift patterns were adopted to mitigate perceived risk.\n\nThese concerns are consistent with findings in the 2024 Retail Workers Welfare Survey, which found that 42% of workers had experienced heightened stress related to shoplifting incidents within the previous year.\n\nThe court also puts on record its appreciation of the Brixton Safer Neighbourhood Team, whose community engagement and rapid response capabilities have been instrumental in both managing incidents and supporting victims.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nThe defendant’s personal circumstances are substantial within this enquiry. He is 33 years old and currently lives in provisional housing on the outskirts of Brixton, with frequent changes to his residence noted. The instability of his housing has been highlighted both in pre-sentence reports and correspondence from social services.\n\nThe court is also alerted to the fact that local housing allocations are under exceptional strain, with the Homelessness Reduction Project reporting a 23% increase in emergency accommodation placements since 2023. While housing insecurity is an established risk factor for offending, it is important to underline that it does not constitute a legal excuse.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nThe court has reviewed the police disclosure bundle, including detailed witness statements, police notebooks, and statements from retail security guards. The meticulous documentation of store visits, cross-referenced CCTV stills, and subsequent forensic identification of seized goods at your residence, constitutes a compelling evidential basis for conviction.\n\nOn the matter of forensic evidence, it is worth noting that samples recovered from your clothing were subjected to microspectrophotometric analysis by City Forensic Services, revealing traces consistent with specific products stolen, which significantly corroborated witness testimony. This high level of scientific scrutiny reflects contemporary standards in evidence gathering, and underscores the strength of the prosecution case.\n\nAdditionally, other investigations within the Metropolitan area, notably R v. Fields [2023] EWCA Crim 458, whilst unrelated to you, illustrate the complexities associated with forensic linkage in retail theft, particularly when multiple co-offenders are involved. It was relevant that in Fields, the Court remarked on the difficulties in distinguishing between individual participation in organised shoplifting rings.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nCommunity-Based Support and Systemic Reflections  \nThe ongoing pressure on public services relevant to this case cannot be ignored. Probation services face chronic under-resourcing, which result in higher caseloads for officers and increased strain on rehabilitative programming.\n\nNorth London Probation Trust has recently published a report recommending expanded funding for integrated offender management units, citing evidence that repeat shoplifting offenders like Mr H benefit from sustained, holistic interventions involving housing support, mental health services, and vocational training.\n\nCorrespondence from the London Retail Liaison Group highlights acute frustrations among small business owners, who report that enforcement action often fails to sufficiently deter repeat offending. While such concerns do not themselves dictate sentencing, they provide a necessary backdrop and underscore the importance of proportional and effective sentencing.\n\nThe court is also concerned about the disparities in service uptake, with mental health waiting lists for psychological therapies in Brixton extending beyond six months. This unfortunate service gap may curtail opportunities for individuals like Mr H to access timely care.\n\nThe combined effect of these socio-economic and systemic factors is complex. While they do not excuse offending, they must be borne in mind when considering sentencing objectives of rehabilitation and public protection.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nI have noted with gratitude the submissions made by Mr Callum Price, your counsel, who emphasized the absence of violence or threats, the defendant’s stated remorse, and the context of personal instability. The Crown, represented by Ms. Fiona Mallory, has underscored the sustained and repetitive nature of the offending, and the consequential impact on business confidence and community wellbeing.\n\nLegal mail sent by your sister, Ms Bernice Heath, was lodged in support of your character, expressing hope for your successful rehabilitation and affirming that she will offer ongoing support post-sentence. Letters from local charities, including the Brixton Support Network and Streetwise Advocates, echoed this sentiment while underscoring the need for careful supervision and appropriate intervention.\n\nThe court welcomes these expressions whilst recognising that words must be followed by sustained action.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nSentencing Considerations and Conclusion  \nMr H, the course of offending before this court is both serious and sustained. The statutory purposes of sentencing articulated under section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 are applicable—namely, punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, protection of the public, and the making of reparation.\n\nThe cumulative effect of your repeated shoplifting cannot be understated. Though individual incidents involved low-value items, the pattern and persistence reflect a calculated decision to engage in dishonesty over an extended period. This has had palpable economic and psychological consequences for the victims and, by extension, the local community.\n\nYour guilty plea, coming late in proceedings, merits some credit, though as established in R v. Dobson [2022] EWCA Crim 789, such credit is tempered proportionately by the timing and circumstances of the admission.\n\nI have carefully weighed the mitigating factors—namely your personal and social difficulties, absence of any violent conduct, and your expressed remorse. At the same time, I emphasise that robbery, burglary, or drug trafficking cases with direct or proximate harm bear different weight and complexity; see R v Mellor [2019] EWCA Crim 1210 concerning offences involving threat or coercion. These are, understandably, more severe and attract commensurately harsher sentences. That said, they are not directly relevant here beyond illustrating sentencing gradations.\n\nI also recall from R v. Sterling [2017] EWCA Crim 1403 the principle that public denunciation and deterrence remain primary objectives in cases of repeated acquisitive offending, particularly where community trust is eroded.\n\nAt present, I remain mindful of your non-engagement with voluntary services and the risk that presents for reoffending. The probation pre-sentence report will need to address fully the feasibility of community-based rehabilitation integrated with housing support and substance misuse treatment.\n\nThis court takes into account the fact that your involvement with policing and social services is longstanding but marked by episodic compliance. This pattern necessitates a robust response to enforce adherence and protect the public.\n\nThe circumstances described in the pre-sentence report indicate that a community disposal might mitigate against immediate custody, subject to structured supervision. However, the final sentence will reflect the comprehensive assessment of risk, culpability, and rehabilitative potential.\n\nThese are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge R. A. Winthrop, issued on 22 September 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brixton. The hearing was conducted openly, recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, and counsel for the Crown and defence were present throughout.\n\nA formal transcript will be lodged with the court records. The defendant is hereby advised of their statutory right of appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently applicable. The issue of costs is reserved until final sentence.  \n\nThe court will adjourn this matter to allow for the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report which will encompass assessment of risk, suitability for rehabilitative programmes, and possible arrangements for accommodation.\n\nSentencing will be scheduled following receipt and consideration of these reports. Judicial directions to the probation service have been issued accordingly.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIXTON  \nR v.
