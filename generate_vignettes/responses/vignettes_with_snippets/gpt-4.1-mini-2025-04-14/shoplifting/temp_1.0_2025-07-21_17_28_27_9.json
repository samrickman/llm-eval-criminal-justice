MR H  \nCase No. T2025/14567  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. W. HARROW  \nFiled: 17 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction for offences of theft—more specifically, shoplifting—from various retail premises within the Hampshire area during the latter part of 2024 and early 2025. The offences encompass a period of some eight months and involve multiple locations across the Basingstoke, Winchester, and Southampton districts.  \n\nProcedural History  \nYour case has progressed through a series of hearings beginning with your apprehension on 5 February 2025. Initial charges were laid following an investigation by officers from Hampshire Constabulary’s Commercial Crime Unit in conjunction with local council licensing enforcement teams. The investigation arose from reports submitted by several retail outlets noting a suspicious pattern of thefts involving similar modus operandi—a pattern which, after considerable collation of CCTV footage, witnessed testimonies, and inventory audits, pointed in your direction. That process, while necessary, was lengthy and resource-intensive, taxing several units far beyond their routine caseload given the complexity of aligning evidence across jurisdictions and premises.  \n\nIt bears noting at this juncture that your case exemplifies the multifaceted challenges inherent in policing what is frequently termed 'low-level crime.' Such offences are often dismissed in public discourse as harmless or incidental. Yet, as the court has observed in numerous past judgments, the aggregate effect of these offences exacts a significant toll on businesses, employees, and public confidence. Resources spent here are inevitably diverted from other investigative priorities, as recognised in R v. Cartwright [2019] EWCA Crim 812, where the Court of Appeal emphasised that the cumulative impact of petty acquisitive offences can warrant sentences proportionate to their broader societal effect rather than the precise value of individual items stolen.  \n\nAfter your arrest, substantial investigative steps were undertaken, including detailed forensic examination of clothing seized from your residence and analysis of electronic device data obtained pursuant to a search warrant authorised by a designated judicial officer. The utilisation of such warrants, particularly for digital extraction, follows strict procedures aimed at balancing investigatory necessity against individual privacy rights, as outlined in R v. Keaton [2020] EWHC 175 (Admin). In your case, the evidence gleaned formed a crucial component of the prosecution’s case, allowing corroboration between digital timelines and physical observations.  \n\nThe matter was listed initially for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 4 March 2025 but was adjourned twice owing to delayed Legal Aid authorisations for expert assessment—an unfortunate but far from isolated procedural difficulty faced by criminal courts in recent years. Indeed, your defence team’s application for approval to instruct a forensic psychiatrist registered only in late April, following a series of exchanges with the Legal Aid Agency characterised by administrative opacity and protracted response times. The systemic nature of these delays carries real implications, not only as an inconvenience to defendants but as substantive obstacles to effective justice, a point the Court of Appeal recently considered in R v. Letts [2024] EWCA Crim 265, expressing concern over growing procedural inertia in defence funding decisions.  \n\nUpon the grant of such authority, the instructed expert, Dr Amanda Jefferies, submitted a detailed report in early June, assessing both your cognitive and psychiatric profile with a view to determining mitigating factors relevant to sentencing. Dr Jefferies’ evaluation undertakes a comprehensive review of your developmental history, past trauma exposure, neurocognitive functioning, and current psychological health. The assessment, though thorough, concludes that no diagnosable mental disorder sufficiently impaired your responsibility at the time of offences, albeit noting impulsivity and limited insight into consequences. While the findings do not mandate diminished culpability, they nonetheless inform the court’s holistic consideration of your circumstances.  \n\nIn conjunction with this, a probation pre-sentence report was commissioned, providing supplementary insights into your socio-economic background, lifestyle, and prior criminal record. The probation officer, Ms Helen Tramontane, highlights episodic homelessness, intermittent contact with social services, and previous informal diversionary measures, including participation in a shoplifting intervention workshop in 2023. Encouragingly, probation reports note periods of engagement with community support groups specializing in financial literacy and emotional regulation, though these were sporadic and ultimately insufficient to prevent reoffending. The report sets out potential community sentence options and rehabilitative programmes tailored to reduce recidivism.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nIt is necessary to situate the court’s examination of this case within the evolving statutory and judicial framework governing theft offences. As codified within the Theft Act 1968, theft remains an offence encompassing the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. Shoplifting offences, while often caught by summary procedures under local bylaws or fixed penalty notices, escalate in seriousness when perpetrated repeatedly or within a pattern exhibiting planning and disregard for lawful authority, as emphasised in the Sentencing Council guideline for theft and handling stolen goods (October 2019).  \n\nThis matter engages the Crown Court’s jurisdiction owing to the scale and complexity of the conduct, as well as the defendant’s prior record, which disqualifies summary disposal under the Magistrates’ Court Sentencing Guidelines 2020. The principles enunciated in R v. O’Sullivan [2018] EWCA Crim 5 also direct the court to have proper regard to the cumulative nature of conduct over time, especially where offences are committed across multiple premises, involving different victim entities.  \n\nIt might be instructive, at this juncture, to briefly consider related appellate precedent touching on aspects of sentencing calibrations for acquisitive crime. In R v. Windham [2023] EWCA Crim 1541, dealing with a case of aggravated burglary involving use of weapons and intimidation, the court underscored that while violence magnifies harm and culpability, so too does persistent disregard for others’ property rights where it erodes public confidence. Though not directly applicable here, Windham’s observations on cumulative harm bear implicit relevance to serial acquisitive offending. Similarly, in R v. Meredith [2022] EWCA Crim 990, the Court grappled with the tension between economic hardship as a mitigating factor and personal responsibility, concluding that individual deprivation does not excuse calculated dishonesty.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nWhile outside the direct purview of this proceeding, it is worth noting the Court’s awareness of contemporary policy debates surrounding the Business Crime Reduction Strategy implemented regionally since 2022. These initiatives focus on collaboration between retailers, police forces, and local authority bodies to identify repeat offenders and apply targeted interventions pre-emptively. Despite significant enthusiasm at the policy level, implementation remains uneven, with regional differences in resourcing and operational efficacy. Indeed, a report published by the National Retail Federation in June 2025 lamented ongoing deficiencies in communication between stakeholders and a lack of clarity regarding data sharing protocols, compromised further by privacy legislation constraints. Nonetheless, the efforts undertaken by the Hampshire Retail Security Forum in this matter represent a coordinated attempt to address systemic retail crime challenges, an effort to which officers from the Constabulary, shop floor security personnel, and local crime reduction specialists committed significant time and expertise.  \n\nThere is, of course, an entire body of case law unrelated to the present facts which nonetheless informs the court’s appreciation of the broad social context in which acquisitive offences occur. For instance, in R v. Yates [2019] EWCA Crim 682, concerning fly-tipping on protected greenbelt land leading to environmental damage valued in the tens of thousands of pounds, the Court highlighted the community-wide repercussions of seemingly “minor” unlawful acts. While totally distinct from theft, the reflections on collective responsibility and environmental stewardship resonate here. Similarly, R v. Dobson [2017] EWCA Crim 927, involving affray triggered by an altercation within a licensed nightclub, despite bearing no factual nexus to this case, provides judicial commentary on public order and community trust, which underpin many theft-related offences in urban centres.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nRegarding other procedural matters, the court notes the contributions of various parties in this matter. Ms Olivia Bristow, solicitor for the Crown, has presented a well-structured outline of the prosecution’s position, supported by extensive evidential exhibits and victim impact statements. Her submissions were measured, appropriately calibrated, and cognizant of the wider social difficulties facing defendants such as yourself, yet uncompromising in highlighting the harm caused to local businesses and staff. For the defence, Mr Richard Iverson provided articulate submissions focusing on your personal circumstances, recent attempts at engagement with welfare provision, and the psychological factors articulated by Dr Jefferies. His advocacy exemplifies the professionalism expected of defence counsel, particularly in complex Crown Court proceedings involving multi-faceted evidence.  \n\nIn reviewing the victim impact material, this court acknowledges the consistent testimony regarding disruption to business operations, the burden placed on already stretched retail teams, and the anxiety engendered by recurrent loss and prospective financial pressures. The Chamberlain’s Pharmaceuticals retail chain, for example, submitted detailed observations on the cumulative economic impact of repeat thefts, noting increased expenditure on security staff, installation of anti-theft systems, and changes to employee shift patterns to mitigate risk. References from frontline retail workers evoke tangible stress and feelings of vulnerability, underscoring a dimension of harm not always captured by simple monetary quantification.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nIn reviewing your personal history, as documented in probation assessments and corroborated by community worker reports, it is apparent that you have faced a series of socio-economic challenges, including periods of unstable accommodation, episodic engagement with mental health services, and documented early childhood adversity. While these are not reasons for excusing culpability, they factor into the broader assessment of risk and rehabilitation potential. Indeed, probation reports recommend a combination of structured community supervision, engagement with cognitive behavioural therapy modules, and possibly a curfew and daily reporting requirement.  \n\nThe court has also received correspondence from the Basingstoke Homeless Outreach Partnership, which attests to your recent attempts to stabilise housing and seek employment, albeit with limited success. Their letter emphasises the resource constraints under which such organisations operate and the critical importance of sustained engagement by service users. The partnership highlights the dangerous gulf between aspiration and accessibility, a gap which often precipitates recidivism if unaddressed.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nIt merits recognition that in the course of the criminal proceedings, a co-defendant initially charged alongside you was subject to separate bail conditions pending trial on more serious matters, including a charge involving possession of a bladed article on school premises, a wholly unrelated offence distinct from your involvement. That co-defendant failed to appear at an earlier hearing and is currently wanted on warrant. While their conduct is legally independent of your case, the fact of co-defendant abscondment has occasioned repeated procedural delays in the listing of this matter, causing additional inconvenience and pressure on court resources.  \n\nFurther, the court is cognisant of certain anecdotal delays in interpreter services at the initial hearings—a problem not uncommon in busy Crown Courts, which occasionally impacts the timely progression of cases involving non-English speakers. Though this issue did not affect your matter directly, it exemplifies the broader systemic challenges faced across the judicial infrastructure.  \n\nMoreover, the court notes that separate criminal proceedings in the city involving historical arson at a commercial property caused some disruption to allocation of judges and courtrooms earlier in 2025. That arson offence, committed in March and April 2025 by unrelated individuals, resulted in extended trial hearings and reallocation of judicial personnel within the Crown Court complex. While unrelated to the current proceedings, such events form part of the operational environment in which cases like yours are inevitably heard.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nTurning to sentencing principles, theft offences attract a range of possible dispositions from financial penalties and community orders through to immediate custody, guided by the Sentencing Council’s Theft and Handling Stolen Goods guideline. Factors elevating seriousness include persistence, premeditation, targeting of vulnerable victims, and breach of trust. Mitigating factors may encompass early guilty pleas, remorse, efforts at reparation, and personal circumstances reducing culpability or risk.  \n\nIt is to your credit that you entered a guilty plea at the earliest practicable opportunity once the weight of evidence became clear, which is acknowledged as a significant mitigating feature under R v. Bedwell [2023] EWCA Crim 301. The court must, however, remain mindful that acceptance of responsibility, while commendable, does not negate the damaging consequences of your offending nor its broader impact on community safety and commerce.  \n\nDr Jefferies’ report cautions that while no major psychiatric illness was found, your impulsive tendencies and difficulties in emotional regulation carry moderate risk factors for future offending absent structured intervention. The pre-sentence report similarly recommends cognitive-behavioural work and financial management programmes, pointing out your partial engagement to date but fragility of sustained compliance.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nDuring the course of the investigation, separate from this case but concurrently active in the region, a series of offences involving the theft of copper cabling from railway depots was prosecuted by the South Central Trains Police Unit. These incidents, resulting in power disruptions and costly repairs, involved an unrelated group and are of tangential interest only. Nonetheless, their continuation has drawn focus to the increasing vulnerability of infrastructure assets and the resource demands posed by acquisitive crime more generally.  \n\nAdditionally, an unrelated inquiry into criminal damage involving graffiti on public transport facilities throughout southern England culminated recently in a series of convictions. The defendants therein were subject to restorative justice programmes rather than custodial sentence. While this provides a contrasting example of sentencing outcomes, it carries no direct bearing on your case.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe court recognises the complicated interface between your history, personal challenges, the nature of the offending, and the requirements of justice, deterrence, and community safety. Custodial sentences are appropriate where culpability is high and other measures insufficient to protect the public or reduce risk of reoffending. Equally, community sentences with bespoke interventions are preferable where practicable and likely to be effective.  \n\nPractical considerations, including your residential stability and willingness to participate in rehabilitative provisions, weigh in favour of a structured community order. However, the extent and pattern of offending, your prior record, and the significant aggravating features— notably persistence and disregard for previous warnings—limit the scope for leniency.  \n\nAccordingly, the court now directs that a full and detailed pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith by the Probation Service, taking into account psychological assessments, risk evaluations, and available community resources. The report shall consider potential packages of supervision, including any available cognitive skills programmes, unpaid work requirements, electronically monitored curfew, and interventions addressing impulsivity and financial management.  \n\nIt will also investigate possibilities for restorative justice engagement, particularly as to whether victims or retailers might be willing to participate. The overarching objective remains the dual aims of reducing risk to the public and supporting your rehabilitation in a sustainable manner.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this 17th day of September 2025, in Court 5 at Basingstoke Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the requisite authorities. You are informed of your statutory right to appeal within 28 days of sentence under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply unless otherwise ordered.
