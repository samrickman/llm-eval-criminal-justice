MR H  \nCase No. T2025/17539  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. PENNINGTON  \nFiled: 16 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentencing in respect of an offence of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, encompassing a pattern of shoplifting incidents across several retail premises within the Greater Bexley area over a protracted timeline extending from mid-2023 through to early 2025.\n\nProcedural History  \nThis matter was initiated following your arrest on 9 April 2025, consequent upon investigative efforts spearheaded by the Bexley Neighbourhood Policing Unit in collaboration with the Retail Crime Reduction Panel established across the boroughs of Bexley, Greenwich, and parts of Kent. The case, it must be noted, has traversed the courts’ listings somewhat irregularly, with adjournments occasioned by diverse factors including the late delivery of expert reports, representation applications, and responses by the Legal Aid Agency, whose administrative processes have, regrettably, imposed avoidable delay in this instance. Such occurrences unfortunately typify many cases involving complex offending profiles with underlying social and medical dimensions.\n\nAt the initial hearing on 21 May 2025, you entered a not guilty plea. Thereafter, scheduled hearings in July and August were vacated to await the outcome of a psychiatric assessment and further compilation of evidence. Only at a hearing on 12 September 2025 did you elect to change your plea to guilty. Applications from the defence for additional mitigating documentation, including letters from charitable organisations and a statement provided by your cousin, were permitted, and these have been duly considered.\n\nI wish to record my thanks to the defence advocate, Ms Judith Lane, who has prepared sound submissions under challenging circumstances. Also, those acting on behalf of the Crown, led by Mr Andrew Collins, have conducted their duties with appropriate professionalism. Regrettably, as before, the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted decision-making process in authorising expert input has materially impeded timeliness; an ongoing, well-documented concern within this jurisdiction.\n\nThe essence of the Better Case Management framework is, as with all such initiatives, to encourage early identification of issues and avoid unnecessary delay. While this case complied in the main with standard procedural timings, the unavoidable adjournments have exacerbated the length of proceedings.\n\nThe court is not unaware that the function of retail crime reduction partnerships has become more critical in recent times. These multi-agency schemes are designed to facilitate intelligence-sharing between private sector employers, local police, council services, and charitable care providers, thus enabling a more coherent response to the often intricate phenomena of repeat offending. At this juncture, it must be acknowledged that the Bexley Retail Security Partnership has supplied comprehensive victim impact statements and contributed valuable operational insights. Their efforts must not be understated, given the pressures experienced within such voluntary but essential bodies.\n\nIt is appropriate here to remark, lest it be overlooked, on the chronic strain placed upon the Probation Service in this region. Staffing shortages, increased caseloads, and expanding administrative requirements have produced a service provision model operating on the margins of efficacy. The consequences of this are felt in various arenas, notably in the preparation and monitoring of intervention programmes designed to reduce reoffending in acquisitive crime. Despite these challenges, officers involved in this case have undertaken their roles conscientiously.\n\nIt is difficult to detach the consideration of acquisitive crime from its broader social context. The confluence of economic hardship, housing instability, and mental health vulnerabilities creates a crucible in which offending behaviour may fuel spiralling adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, while courts must ensure due sensitivity, the imperative to safeguard community confidence and local commerce remains paramount.\n\nHistorical and Legal Context  \nThe Theft Act 1968, at its section 1, provides the statutory framework underpinning this offence, defining theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. Though shoplifting is frequently characterised as a ‘minor’ offence within the public imagination, this court is acutely aware that the reality is often far more complex and consequential.\n\nThe Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences rightly emphasises context, recognising that repetitive offending, targeting vulnerable or small-scale premises, and incidents causing significant distress to victims—all bear upon the gravity of sentencing.\n\nReliance is also placed upon case law, including the decision in R v. Birchwood [2022] EWCA Crim 2025, where the Court stressed that persistent dishonesty reflects a high level of culpability and justifies proportionate punishment. In Birchwood, the defendant’s repetitive thefts over two years from multiple grocery outlets were met with an immediate custodial sentence reflecting the cumulative societal harm.\n\nIn the present matter, while the indictment comprises a single representative act, sentencing must reflect the entire course of conduct. Such has been the settled principle in tread mining the limits of proportionality.\n\nThe Crown rightly reminds the court of the recent authority of R v. Giles [2024] EWCA Crim 12, which drew attention to the impact of the offender’s conduct on retail employees, many of whom suffer increased anxiety and reduced job security due to persistent shoplifting in their workplaces. While Giles concerned an aggravated burglary alongside theft, its observations on victim-related harm in acquisitive crime retain persuasive, albeit indirect, relevance.\n\nThe court is, of course, familiar with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Rules governing evidence and disclosure. Despite resource constraints, police officers involved in this case prepared voluminous bundles, incorporating store CCTV, witness statements, forensic exhibits, and entries from a Retail Loss Prevention database maintained jointly with the Bexley Business Crime Reduction Initiative.\n\nThe investigation demonstrated the application of modern technology including digital forensic analysis of mobile phone records and surveillance data, reinforcing the evidential weight against you.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nSuch consistent and concerted behaviour invites the court’s attention to the manner of offending. It is rarely about mere impulsive acts of minor dishonesty but, as in this case, often evidence a deliberate modus operandi, calculated and adapted over time.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe use of disguises, concealment tactics, or manipulation of staff routines display a tactical awareness beyond that of a casual or opportunist offender.\n\nThe court notes with concern that there was evidence your conduct extended to multiple premises, including those reliant upon volunteer labour and staffed by vulnerable persons.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nIt is necessary to consider the human impact as well as pecuniary loss. Statements from affected employees reveal heightened feelings of vulnerability and increased workload pressures attributable to your behaviour.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThe mental health report prepared by Dr Anne Simmons, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, contains a detailed account of your psychological profile. Dr Simmons identifies features characterised by intermittent depressive episodes and elements consistent with borderline personality traits. She notes your history of low mood, occasional self-harm, and prior inpatient psychiatric care in 2022 but concludes that no major psychotic disorder is present. Though this report was thorough and carefully prepared, it ultimately advises that there is limited scope for genuine clinical mitigation given the offences’ nature and your current presentation.\n\nSuch reports serve an essential function in informing judicial discretion. They illuminate complex human dimensions but do not function as carte blanche to exempt from responsibility.\n\nIt is pertinent here to recall R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, where the Court of Appeal affirmed that mental disorder alone does not preclude custodial sentencing where public safety is at stake. Though Mallory involved a defendant with a diagnosed schizoaffective disorder involved in serious property damage by fire, the principle extends beyond such extreme facts. Public protection and rehabilitation require a balance, not an abdication of accountability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThis underlines the continuing challenge for both courts and community services: how to integrate therapeutic measures within the frameworks of justice while meeting the demands of safety and deterrence.\n\nThe Probation Service report, authored by Ms Karen Bedford, highlights ongoing concerns about your sporadic engagement with voluntary support initiatives, including the Bexley Employment and Housing Support Scheme and the local Drug and Alcohol Recovery Partnership. Despite repeated referrals, uptake has been limited, which is a regrettable but recurring issue in such offending profiles. Probation officers also note your unstable living arrangements, moving between temporary accommodations and short-term stays with various acquaintances.\n\nThe strain on voluntary and statutory services is inescapable. The Bexley Housing Outreach Project, which submitted a letter expressing frustration at the systemic inadequacies in providing stable accommodation for vulnerable individuals, describes the current backlog and the impossibility of satisfactory intervention without broader policy reforms. While the courts’ role does not extend directly to policy criticism, it inevitably operates within systems under duress.\n\nThe National Health Service faces similarly profound pressure. Mental health services, especially those providing medium and high-secure facilities or community assertive outreach, report excessive waiting times and fragmented provision. The court observes with some sadness that these deficits contribute to the revolving door of offending, particularly among those with dual diagnoses or substance misuse.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nEconomic hardship must be considered, but it cannot substitute for compliance with law and order. The broader social contract requires that rights be balanced by responsibilities.\n\nAn aside is warranted with regard to the increase in street homelessness and associated public space antisocial behaviour that is so visibly codified in urban centres. The question of entrenchment is relevant here, though it remains a separate matter from the particulars of the case before the court.\n\nSimilarly, the pressures on the police force are manifold. Officers detail frequent redeployment to emergencies and capacity limitations that reduce the resources available for acquisitive crime investigations. Notwithstanding this, the Bexley Constabulary’s Retail Unit demonstrated commendable resolve in assembling a coherent case.\n\nThe court observes that some operational features of the investigation included the analysis of anonymised public transport usage data—an area of emerging but contested practice in policing intelligence. Such methods raise important questions of privacy balanced against community safety, though these are not determinate factors in the present case.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nAs for offences committed by co-defendants in related proceedings, unrelated charges including possession of a bladed article in proximity to a school and arson on commercial premises have been pursued separately. The court carefully distinguishes these from the facts before me and draws no inference therefrom concerning your conduct.\n\nSimilarly, matters involving family members under investigation for different offences, and occasional noise abatement notices issued to landlords, while of human interest, bear no causal or mitigating relevance here.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nYour personal antecedents show a pattern of acquisitive offending dating back to 2018, with at least four recorded convictions for theft and a conditional discharge as recently as late 2023. These prior outcomes included diversionary programmes oriented towards crime reduction but yielded limited lasting effect.\n\nDefence submissions emphasise your low risk of violent behaviour and absence of previous custodial sentences—points which are germane to the sentencing assessment. Moreover, your expressed remorse in court and in a letter read aloud are acknowledged, though the timing of your guilty plea suggests a strategic change in litigation position rather than an early acceptance of responsibility.\n\nThe Court of Appeal’s pronouncements in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 caution against excessive mitigation credit where pleas emerge late, largely in the face of inevitable conviction.\n\nSentencing Framework  \nI am required to consider the statutory purposes of sentencing: punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, protection of the public, and the rehabilitation of offenders. Given your history and circumstances, these objectives must be appropriately calibrated.\n\nThe custodian community balance emphasises proportionate response to the harm caused to individual victims and the wider public interest in upholding commerce and order.\n\nI must also note the increasing focus on restorative justice schemes within acquisitive crime management. Despite proactive offers, you have not engaged meaningfully with such programmes in Bexley or elsewhere.\n\nPublic accounts of criminal justice transparency reveal that cases of this nature rarely garner media attention unless extraordinary features arise. This is regrettable, insofar as it allows the slow erosion of confidence in the rule of law to proceed unchecked. However, the court must act irrespective of public profile.\n\nToday’s hearing proceeded without incident in Courtroom 5, the refurbishment of which completes a rolling programme of upgrades intended to enhance security and accessibility. I thank the usher, Mrs Sheila Howard, and supporting clerical staff for their diligent assistance.\n\nIn closing, I reserve final sentencing until the probation service provides an updated report reflecting current circumstances and potential pathways to address underlying issues alongside appropriate punitive measures.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bexleyheath. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to all relevant authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are currently engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BEXLEYHEATH  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2025/17539  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M.
