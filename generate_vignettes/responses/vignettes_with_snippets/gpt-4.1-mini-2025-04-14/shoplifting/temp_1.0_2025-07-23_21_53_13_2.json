MR H  \nCase No. HCF/2025/13509  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. Fairchild  \nFiled: 14 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear for sentence today before this court following your conviction for offences relating to theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charges derive from a prolonged series of thefts occurring across multiple retail establishments within the metropolitan Hartford area, spanning a period from late 2023 through early 2025. This court records that the prosecution proceeded on the basis that the offending amounts to a course of conduct, and the charge reflects that reality.\n\nProcedural History and Court Context  \nThe matter was initially brought before the magistrates’ court on 7 May 2025, with the prosecuting authority having laid eleven counts of theft by shoplifting. The case was swiftly transferred to this Crown Court for trial owing to the defendant’s plea of not guilty at first hearing, as well as because of the representational capacity and evidential considerations warranting such elevation. Several preliminary hearings ensued, during which time defence applications were made including for disclosure, and challenges to the admissibility of CCTV evidence and forensic samples seized from the defendant’s belongings.\n\nIn the spirit of transparency and procedural fairness, the court notes that the listing of hearings has been largely consistent with the timetables envisaged under the Criminal Procedure Rules, notwithstanding minor adjournments occasioned in one instance by the unavailability of a key Crown witness and in another by resourcing difficulties encountered by the Legal Aid Agency in processing defence expert funding applications. Specifically, an application to instruct a forensic psychologist experienced in acquisitive offending was refused initially on grounds of administrative backlog and only granted following an internal review conducted some six weeks later. It must be observed that such delays serve neither defendant nor the wider justice system, potentially impeding access to appropriate and timely expert input.\n\nThe matter finally came to a contested trial on 8 September 2025, conducted before a jury of twelve. The proceedings were attended by counsel for both parties: Mr Colin Ajax for the Crown, instructed by the Hartford Crown Prosecution Service Unit, and Ms Denise Claridge for the defence, acting pursuant to a Legal Aid representation order. The hearing was open to the public and press, although, consistent with the usual pattern for cases of this nature, publicity was limited. I wish at this juncture to record the court’s appreciation of the court clerks, ushers, and security staff who, despite recent refurbishment works to this courtroom’s layout and minor equipment malfunctions, ensured the smooth running of the trial.\n\nIt is the settled position that the offence of theft requires proof of dishonesty, appropriation, and the intention to permanently deprive. The jury have found you guilty beyond reasonable doubt, accepting the robust evidential case put forward by the prosecution.  \n\nIt is, of course, regrettable but unsurprising that the trial hearing occurred so close to today’s date, given workloads across the judicial estate and the well-documented impact of recent industrial action affecting court listing capacity—most notably in July and August, when some 20% of hearings nationally were postponed or cancelled. These disruptions are deeply unwelcome but, until broader systemic issues are resolved, this court must manage with the resources available. It is in this challenging context that your case has proceeded.\n\nContext and Patterns of Retail Theft  \nThe court must acknowledge that shoplifting, while often perceived by the public as a minor infringement, constitutes a serious challenge to retail businesses, particularly smaller and independent shops whose margins are thin and who often lack sophisticated loss prevention protocols. The cumulative economic loss from such thefts runs into millions annually and contributes to adverse effects on employment, prices, and community confidence.\n\nRecent sociological surveys and reports published by the Retail Theft Prevention Forum reveal that repeat shoplifters form a small proportion of offenders yet are responsible for a disproportionate amount of total losses. This is borne out in police data from the Hartford jurisdiction, which demonstrates that approximately 30% of shoplifting cases involve individuals with prior convictions for similar offences. Furthermore, challenges in effective multi-agency collaboration continue to hamper proactive intervention, notwithstanding frameworks such as the Crime Reduction Partnerships, which, as experienced in this court’s local area, are subject to variable engagement and funding constraints.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\nIt is worth reflecting here on some legal authorities which provide a context for sentencing in theft-related offences of this nature. For example, in R v. Somers [2019] EWCA Crim 1547, the Court of Appeal considered the seriousness of thefts committed from a chain pharmacy where the defendant had exploited the youth of an accomplice and used distraction techniques. A sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was upheld, with the Court emphasising the community impact and repeated nature of the offending.\n\nSimilarly, R v. Khalif [2021] EWCA Crim 2345 addressed the sentencing approach applicable to persons engaging in serial shoplifting—specifically where aggravating factors included targeting of vulnerable staff members and persistence despite prior community orders. There, the Court reiterated that the breach of trust implicit in offences committed within retail environments justifies sentencing that prioritises deterrence alongside rehabilitation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  \n\nIn the present case, the jury’s conclusion was supported by multiple strands of evidence, including an extensive range of CCTV recordings obtained by local police teams, transaction records, and statements from retail staff and management. Several incidents were corroborated by recovered property found in your possession at arrest.\n\nThere is no suggestion here of any weapons being carried nor coercion used during these offences. However, the deliberate tactics employed—including pre-planning, concealment of stolen goods in garments, and apparent awareness of store layout and staffing schedules—clearly demonstrate that these were not isolated, opportunistic acts born of momentary impulse.\n\nExpert Reports and Risk Assessment  \nTurning to the clinical and probation evidence, I have received a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Ewan Carter, consultant forensic psychiatrist, instructed by the defence and authorised by the Legal Aid Agency after considerable delay. Dr Carter, who has considerable expertise in forensic populations with acquisitive offending profiles, conducted a thorough assessment, including clinical interviews and psychometric testing, and produced a detailed report dated 30 August 2025.\n\nDr Carter’s opinion is that you do not meet criteria for any major mental illness, but exhibit significant traits consistent with personality dysfunction, specifically noting impulsivity, poor frustration tolerance, and affective instability. He also highlights a history of substance misuse—primarily of cannabis and occasional alcohol excess—which you concede has impacted your decision-making abilities over the years.\n\nDr Carter stresses that these factors contribute to your propensity towards short-term decision-making and poor risk evaluation. He further recommends a structured intervention incorporating cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to acquisitive offending behaviour and substance misuse support as part of rehabilitation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  \n\nI also note the comprehensive pre-sentence report compiled by probation officer Ms Asha Rahman, which draws attention to your longstanding social and economic difficulties, including periods of unstable accommodation, unemployment, and estrangement from familial support networks. Ms Rahman remarks on your expressed motivation to desist from offending and engage with support services, yet notes previous failures to sustain involvement with such provisions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nThe probation officer’s risk assessment classifies you as medium risk of harm and medium risk of reoffending, with specific risks related to acquisitive crime. She advocates for a rehabilitative approach involving cognitive skills programmes combined with housing support and drug/alcohol interventions.\n\nOperational realities within the Probation Service must also be acknowledged here. It is well-known that managers face significant challenges in allocating resources effectively amid increasing caseloads and funding constraints. In the wider context, these pressures impact the timeliness and intensity of supervision that offenders such as yourself might expect.\n\nVictim Impact and Community Considerations  \nStatements submitted by retail staff, including those from the Hartford Retail Consortium, speak candidly to the emotional and psychological toll the offending has wrought. Frontline employees report feelings of vulnerability and stress, particularly amid a background of rising workplace violence and antisocial behaviour. One manager’s letter describes “a climate of fear” underpinning the willingness to report shoplifting incidents, compounded by the sense that perpetrators are seldom brought to effective account.\n\nIt is important that the court recognises the often invisible victims in cases of shoplifting. Economic losses may be quantifiable, but so too must be the disruption to work routines, the impact on mental well-being, and the indirect effect on community cohesion when valued local stores reduce hours or shutter entirely.\n\nThe court is also mindful of the wider societal backdrop, characterised by increasing street homelessness and economic hardship borne disproportionately by marginalised groups. While such contextual factors do not excuse criminal conduct, they underscore the imperative to deploy sanctions which balance punishment with opportunity for meaningful change.\n\nLegal Aid and Procedural Observations  \nThe court must express ongoing concern at the repeated difficulties confronted in securing timely Legal Aid funding for expert reports, which has resulted in delays to case progression well-documented elsewhere. Such issues are detailed in the 2024 Justice Inspectorate report, which documents systemic bottlenecks impacting defendants’ right to a fair and efficient hearing.\n\nThis case is emblematic of the burdens placed on under-resourced courts, practitioners, and support agencies. The expectation that all parties conduct themselves with professionalism despite these systemic pressures is met with varying degrees of success. On the present occasion, the performance of the prosecution team, led by Mr Ajax, and defence counsel, Ms Claridge, has been exemplary, exhibiting the appropriate degree of advocacy and professional courtesy.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\nWhat follows now is a recitation of the facts to which the jury have found you guilty. As with all such findings, it is appropriate that the court summarises the offending with precision, before moving on to sentencing considerations.\n\nFacts of the Offending  \nBetween December 2023 and February 2025, you engaged in a series of thefts from multiple retail premises including convenience stores, a high street pharmacy, and a mid-sized supermarket chain. The method involved the concealment of items ranging from toiletries, personal grooming products, small electronics, confectionery, and over-the-counter medicines, on your person and within bags.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  \n\nThere is evidence of premeditation, including attempts to circumvent store security by removing supermarket loyalty tags and exploiting moments when staff attention was diverted—such as during restocking or till reconciliation. In several instances, you were observed leaving through exit routes with uncontrolled access, suggesting pre-knowledge of store layouts.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  \n\nYour conduct caused heightened anxiety among retail staff, several of whom requested adjustments to shift patterns and placement to mitigate interactions with yourself. While there was no direct aggression, the psychological impact is not to be discounted. Repeat victimisation of frontline workers has been associated with increased staff turnover and absenteeism.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  \n\nDespite prior warnings and involvement by community resolution panels, your offending persisted over an extended period.\n\nSentencing Framework and Authorities  \nIt is incumbent upon this court to approach sentencing with regard both to the statutory framework and relevant guidelines. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 sets the offence parameters, while the Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences, published most recently in 2022, provides a structure for determining sentence levels, factoring in offence seriousness, harm, and culpability.\n\nThe guideline identifies repeated offending and targeting of vulnerable premises as aggravating features. Moreover, the psychological impact upon victims, even absent physical violence, is emphasised. Reflecting the proportionality principle embedded in the Sentencing Code 2020, the response must balance punishment and rehabilitative opportunity.\n\nThe Court of Appeal decision in R v. Peake [2024] EWCA Crim 758 is instructive. Peake involved a defendant convicted of multiple thefts from small independent retailers who had an extensive record of similar offences and demonstrated little engagement with support services. The Court upheld a custodial sentence of 10 months at the mid-range, citing the cumulative impact on victims and the wider community. Although your precise circumstances differ, the principles remain relevant here.\n\nThe well-known authorities on credit for guilty pleas are acknowledged. Your initial entry of a not guilty plea and subsequent conviction following trial mean that any credit must be modest. As established in R v. Clarke [2017] EWCA Crim 2218, the timing and genuineness of remorse weigh heavily in assessing reduction. Late pleas or trial-based admissions rarely attract significant discount.\n\nConclusion and Next Steps  \nHaving reviewed the materials before it, including the trial transcript, reports, and submissions from both counsel, the court remains mindful of the need to deliver a sentence that reflects the seriousness of persistent acquisitive offending while promoting rehabilitation and public protection.\n\nAt this juncture, I will adjourn for the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report, addressing the suitability of various disposals including community orders with tailored requirements, and custodial sentences if warranted. The report should also explore ancillary interventions such as cognitive behavioural programmes, substance misuse support, and accommodation support.\n\nThis court notes with regret ongoing pressures on probation services and community-based programmes, exacerbated by staffing shortages and funding constraints, as reflected in recent justice sector reviews. Any interventions must be realistically deliverable and matched to risk.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Hartford. The proceedings are transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentence will be passed following receipt of the pre-sentence report. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions relating to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTFORD  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. HCF/2025/13509  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J.
