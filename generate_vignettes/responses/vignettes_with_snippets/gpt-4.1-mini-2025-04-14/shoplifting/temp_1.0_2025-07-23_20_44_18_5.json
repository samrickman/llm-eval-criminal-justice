MR H  \nCase No. C2025/14789  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. TREVELYAN  \nFiled: 16 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, as established during the earlier trial proceedings, spans a significant period from late 2023 through to the spring of this calendar year, involving multiple instances of shoplifting across various retail outlets within the Birmingham metropolitan area.\n\nProcedural and Investigative Background  \nYour arrest, dating to 19 April 2025, was the culmination of an investigation led principally by the West Midlands Police Commercial Crime Unit in liaison with the Birmingham Retail Crime Partnership and the Safer Birmingham Board. This multi-agency response was necessitated by a growing pattern of thefts involving several well-known supermarket chains, pharmacy counters, and smaller independent convenience stores. Initial reports in mid-2023 had been treated discretely, given the relatively low value of individual incidents and frequent difficulties in identifying likely suspects. Over time, however, the emerging trend revealed a marked increase in repeat offending, with common elements in modus operandi, timing, and location coalescing into an actionable intelligence profile.  \n\nIt is, regrettably, an observation well known to this court that such patterns often take months to crystallise in the hands of overstretched police and local authorities. Collaborative efforts, although commendable in this instance, are frequently impeded by personnel turnover, competing priorities, and the increasingly difficult terrain of evidential gathering in low-level volume crime. The Birmingham Retail Crime Partnership, alongside smaller voluntary sector stakeholders, have reported operational stress arising from such chronic demand without a proportionate rise in resources. Against this backdrop, it bears emphasis that the successful apprehension of offenders like yourself invariably involves significant diversion of specialist assets, including covert surveillance, store manager debriefings, and complex data analytics.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nThe court was apprised during pre-trial hearings of the painstaking nature of this investigation, which included the acquisition and examination of extensive CCTV footage from multiple sites, biometric comparison of clothing and footwear, and forensic analysis of items recovered in your possession at the time of arrest. Consequently, despite the modest face value of the stolen goods, the operational cost and resource allocation demand a more measured understanding of the offences’ seriousness.\n\nOn 22 May 2025, following initial hearings conducted in Birmingham Magistrates’ Court, your case was transferred here pursuant to the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol. As is now routine, the case moved through pre-trial listing in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules timelines, albeit not without some delays attributable to defence applications for forensic expert instructions and Legal Aid funding authorisations. These delays reflect a regrettable but increasingly endemic issue in the justice system, where administrative bottlenecks impede timely progression and add unwarranted stress to all parties involved.\n\nTo this end, I would like to place on record the court’s recognition of the diligent efforts of your defence counsel, Mr James Thorne, instructed under a representation order, who has conducted his work with commendable professionalism despite the above systemic challenges. Equally, I acknowledge the Crown Prosecutor, Ms Amina Khalid, whose presentation of the case was thorough and precise, reflecting careful consideration of evidentiary parameters and legal principles.\n\nThe plea hearing held on 10 September 2025 saw you enter a plea of guilty to the single representative charge after initially maintaining denial at earlier hearings. The court notes that this plea was entered at the earliest possible moment after the trial window opened, which is of some significance when considering mitigation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nHistorical Legal Context — Previous Authorities and Sentencing Frameworks  \nThe offence before the court invokes the provisions set out in the Theft Act 1968, a statute first enacted in 1968 and amended on several occasions to meet the evolving challenges posed by changes in commercial practice and technological development. The current sentencing framework is governed principally by the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, effective since 2019, which emphasises the culpability of the offending behaviour, the harm caused to victims (whether direct or indirect), and factors relating to the defendant’s personal circumstances.\n\nIn the evolving jurisprudence on acquisitive crime, several cases serve as important reference points. For instance, R v. Greaves [2018] EWCA Crim 3391 stressed that repeated low-level thefts involving planning and cunning merit custodial sentences where community sentences have previously failed. Similarly, R v. Peterson [2021] EWCA Crim 987 upheld a six-month custodial term for a defendant found guilty of persistent offences despite having engaged with probation-led diversion schemes, emphasising the imperative of deterrence when rehabilitation efforts have limited effect.\n\nAlthough these decisions concern different fact sets and geographical contexts, they underline the court’s duty to balance rehabilitative aspirations with the requirement to protect the public and uphold confidence in the justice system. It is therefore important to note that persistent offending, even when involving relatively low-value items, can disrupt local economies and community cohesion, particularly where staff and shopkeepers are subject to repeated victimisation.\n\nAdding further texture to this legal landscape are considerations highlighted in R v. Montague [2022] EWCA Crim 1285, which considered offences involving illicit disposal of waste at industrial premises. Although unrelated in offence type, the judgment offers instructive commentary on the erosion of respect for lawful boundaries and the spiralling effects of cumulative low-level offences on public trust—a theme resonant in cases involving repeat shoplifting.\n\nThe Crown has drawn attention to the aforementioned precedents, alongside expert submissions on the socio-economic impact of your offences, to present a holistic picture warranting a firm sentence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nDefence Submissions and Victim Impact  \nYour defence has, through counsel and written correspondence, invited the court to consider a range of mitigating factors, including your unstable living circumstances, lack of regular employment, and long-standing struggles with impulse control and anxiety. These factors were explored in greater depth in a psychiatric assessment commissioned by the court from Dr Caroline Mitchell, consultant forensic psychiatrist.\n\nDr Mitchell’s detailed clinical report, dated 3 October 2025, provides a nuanced account of your mental health status. She noted the absence of diagnosable psychotic or mood disorders, while identifying traits consistent with borderline personality dynamics, impulsivity, and intermittent engagement with substance misuse support services. She observed, however, that you had declined several offers of structured intervention, a fact which has been viewed as a limiting factor in your potential for rehabilitation.\n\nIt is regrettable that despite the availability of voluntary sector support — including agencies such as SafePath and Crisis Ryze — your interactions have been sporadic and marked by periods of disengagement. These agencies had contributed witness statements commenting upon the challenges of maintaining contact with you amidst frequent changes of accommodation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nTurning to the question of victims, statements provided by management and employees of three retail outlets underscore the real and tangible effects of your activities. While no physical violence was reported, the psychological impact of repeated theft on frontline staff was evident, with reports of increased stress, anxiety, and decreased morale. One manager, in particular, described the effects as “significant and cumulative,” leading to staff shortages due to sick leave and reluctance to work certain shifts.\n\nIt is notable that shoplifting may often be dismissed publicly as a “victimless crime” or mere “economic necessity,” but this court firmly rejects such reductive characterisations. The consequences ripple through retail supply chains, affect wages and working conditions, and can culminate in closures, further unemployment, and community decline. Victims’ voices, though perhaps quieter in shoplifting cases than in high-profile assaults or fraud, nevertheless merit respectful attention.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}. {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nThe Role of Multi-Agency Collaboration and Institutional Challenges  \nThis case highlights the growing complexity and strain placed upon public agencies tasked with crime prevention and support. Local police forces, despite staffing shortfalls and competing demands from violent crime units, maintain a notable commitment to tackling shoplifting as part of broader efforts to sustain community safety.\n\nThe probation service, meanwhile, reports being under significant operational pressure nationally, with workforce attrition affecting its ability to provide tailored offender management. This shortfall inevitably impacts the feasibility of community-based sentences and rehabilitation plans for offenders like yourself.\n\nLegal Aid provisions, as has been remarked in multiple judicial forums recently, remain constrained by administrative delays and funding uncertainties. Your defence counsel’s early application for expert psychiatric input endured protracted approval processes, during which case momentum was hindered. These systemic issues, while external to your individual conduct, contribute a cautionary context to the implementation of justice.\n\nOf related concern is the observation of gradual ‘normalisation’ of low-level acquisitive crime in certain urban areas, a sociological trend analysed in the 2024 report by the Centre for Urban Crime Studies. Although the court is not swayed by sociological reportage alone, it acknowledges the practical challenges faced by frontline officers and community safety teams in reversing these trends.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nThe Facts of the Offences  \nThe facts in this case form a detailed record of your conduct, evidencing planned and deliberate acts of theft over an extended timeframe. The incidents predominantly involved small but commercially significant items — over-the-counter medicines, toiletries, and packaged food products — taken from multiple premises, often utilising concealment techniques and exploiting moments of staff distraction or absence.\n\nThe evidence presented at trial included extensive CCTV documentation demonstrating a consistent method and presence across several different locations. Items missing matched your recovered possessions on arrest, supported by witness testimony from retail employees.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nThe final fact to emphasise is the repeat nature of your offending despite earlier police cautions and community resolution interventions. This pattern accentuates the risk you pose to local retailers and weakens the case for less restrictive disposal options.\n\nSentencing Considerations and Next Steps  \nGiven the totality of circumstances, including your age, prior convictions, personal circumstances, psychiatric evaluation, and the offending pattern, the court is tasked with striking a delicate balance between the objectives of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection.\n\nThe court has considered the potential for community-based sentences, mindful of your disengagement with support services to date, but is also conscious that custody remains a real and present option where repeated offending undermines trust in voluntary interventions.\n\nA pre-sentence report has been commissioned to provide a fuller picture of your background, current risk levels, and prospects for rehabilitation. The probation service is directed to explore the scope for participation in structured cognitive-behavioural programmes, substance misuse treatment, and accommodation support, considering the constraints noted earlier.\n\nI expect the report to give detailed consideration to all feasible community sentences, including unpaid work requirements and Suspended Sentence Orders with appropriate supervision. It should also assess risk in relation to reoffending and public safety.\n\nBefore concluding, I would reiterate the court’s thanks to all practitioners involved and acknowledge the continuing pressures on the institutions responsible for both enforcement and care. The layout and decor of this courtroom in Birmingham, refurbished last year at significant public expense, stand as a reminder of the importance afforded to due process and dignified administration of justice.\n\nThe Court also expresses its gratitude to the clerk, usher, and court support staff, whose diligent management ensures proceedings run smoothly, often unnoticed.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 16 October 2025, in Court 6 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of conviction and sentence will follow upon receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further submissions. You are reminded of your right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs shall be reserved pending final sentencing.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.
