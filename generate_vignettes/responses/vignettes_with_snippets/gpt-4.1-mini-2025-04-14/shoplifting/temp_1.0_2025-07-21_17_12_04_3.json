MR H  \nCase No. T2025/05931  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. F. DUNBAR  \nFiled: 14 August 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence on a charge of theft, specifically the unauthorised removal of goods from retail premises, commonly known as shoplifting, committed over a span of time in the city and its environs. The charge pertains to a sustained series of thefts contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour stretches from mid-2023 through early 2025 and was concentrated largely within the commercial centres of Bristol and neighbouring towns, targeting a variety of shops including independent grocers and pharmacy outlets.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour case was initially lodged at the Bristol Magistrates’ Court on 22 January 2025. Adjudication was deemed suitable for the Crown Court due to the cumulative seriousness and pattern of offending and its reflection in the volume of evidence. You were first interviewed under caution on 5 February 2025, during which you denied stealing, despite multiple witnesses and CCTV identification placing you at the scenes. Following the submission of incontrovertible forensic evidence including possession of stolen goods located at your residence and automated facial recognition linkage to shop security systems, you were formally charged on 15 February 2025 with a single representative count.\n\nIt is worthy of note that this case was allocated to the Crown Court’s business court list pursuant to the Better Case Management (BCM) guidelines, designed to ensure expeditious handling of cases, avoid unnecessary delays, and assist in early plea resolution. The initial plea and trial preparation hearing was listed for 13 March 2025; however, it was adjourned upon defence application for the preparation of a psychiatric evaluation. Adjournments due to attempts to secure Legal Aid authorised funding for that report contributed to a delay, as did intermittent strikes among court administrative personnel in April and May. The psychiatric report was ultimately completed and filed on 10 July 2025, with the formal sentencing hearing scheduled for today.\n\nThe Strategic Policing and Crime Board of Avon & Somerset Police have reiterated the strain placed upon local policing by repeat low-level offending such as shoplifting, emphasising the resource allocation challenges this constitutes amidst ongoing priorities concerning organised crime and serious violence. This court registers those observations, mindful of the broader environment within which such offences arise.\n\nIt is necessary to express some consternation regarding the performance of the Legal Aid Agency over the course of these proceedings. The defence’s request for funding to instruct a clinical forensic psychologist with expertise in compulsive acquisitive crime was not conferred until delayed administrative exchanges had endured for over five weeks. The knock-on effect was a protracted overall timetable for case progression, extending well beyond the normalisation envisaged in the Criminal Procedure Rules and the judiciary’s directives on proportionality.\n\nSimilar claims of agency inefficiency, affecting the timeliness of expert reports and representation, have been the subject of recent Parliamentary Select Committee inquiries. There is growing recognition that the procedural bureaucracy built into the allocation of Legal Aid funds can, in many instances, constitute a barrier to the timely delivery of justice. One hopes that this case, among others, serves as a reminder of the need for systemic review and reform.\n\nThe role of multi-agency partnerships should also be recognised. The Bristol Retail Crime Prevention Partnership cooperated closely with the Avon & Somerset Police Safer Neighbourhood Teams. Incident reports were collated, and briefing notes issued to frontline staff in affected retail outlets. This allowed a modicum of preventative effort, including reconfiguration of high-value product placements and staff training on recognising common diversion tactics deployed by repeat offenders. While not perfect, coordination between public and private actors appears at least functional in this instance.\n\nFurthermore, representations from the Bristol Community Support Network—who provide assistance and outreach to vulnerable individuals at risk of entrenchment in criminality—were also received and reviewed by the court. Their approach to you was characterised by sustained engagement, though ultimately hampered by inconsistent participation on your part.\n\nTurning to relevant legal principles, it is appropriate to note the primary sentencing guidelines reflected in the Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences promulgated by the Sentencing Council. This document, which has been in force since 2019, sets out the framework for assessing culpability and harm, including the nature and duration of the offending, the sophistication of planning involved, and the impact on victims. The guideline makes clear that careful calibration is required to distinguish between opportunistic, one-off theft, and a protracted course of conduct akin to what is alleged here.\n\nI also take judicial notice of the decisional history elucidated in R v. Fairbairn [2022] EWCA Crim 850, which dealt with repeated assaults linked to a burglary series, and R v. Jennings [2021] EWCA Crim 432, concerning the theft of aviation parts—a matter unrelated to the present charge, but significant for its legal discussion on intention to permanently deprive. Neither case is factually on point, but their legal ratios on intent and seriousness provide useful context.\n\nIn R v. Philips [2020] EWCA Crim 1083, the Court of Appeal considered a defendant who committed multiple thefts involving theft of plants from commercial nurseries, underscoring how repeated theft from niche outlets can heighten culpability. The sentence of twelve months’ imprisonment, upheld on appeal, was viewed as warranted given the cumulative economic and psychological impact.\n\nSimilarly, the court is mindful of the ruling in R v. Atwood [2017] EWCA Crim 2246, where the defendant was convicted of fly-tipping significant quantities of industrial waste in protected woodland—a regulatory offence with physical and environmental consequences distinct from shoplifting, yet notable for the Court’s articulation of harm to community interest in shared public resources.\n\nA regrettable, yet unavoidable, observation is that in jurisdictions such as this one, delays caused by external factors such as industrial action, heavy workloads on digital forensic teams, and overwhelmed psychiatric services have increasingly become routine features in the management of criminal cases. These systemic pressures warrant careful reflection, for they bear directly on the administration of justice and equitable treatment of defendants and victims alike.\n\nIt has also come to the court’s attention that unrelated proceedings involving an associate of yours—a former flatmate, now on trial for benefit fraud—are taking place contemporaneously. While entirely separate, the co-location of familial or social contacts in various judicial processes can complicate public perceptions, reinforcing the necessity for clear delineation between distinct matters.\n\nFurther tangentially, the court was informed of the recent conviction of a man accused of affray in a public house near Bristol city centre, where a pool cue was wielded during an altercation. Though no factual link to your offences exists, such events contribute to the general climate of community safety concerns considered in sentencing ethos.\n\nOn 11 March 2025, a co-defendant charged alongside you in an associated but entirely different matter failed to attend court and was declared at large by warrant of arrest. That circumstance is regrettable but wholly unconnected to your case, which proceeds in isolation.\n\nIn preparation for the sentencing, a pre-sentence report was ordered at an earlier hearing, with a focus on assessing your risk of reoffending, support networks, housing status, and potential for rehabilitation. The report, filed on 8 August 2025, was prepared by Probation Officer Miss Jenna Clarke, a practitioner with considerable experience in the field of theft and acquisitive crime.\n\nMiss Clarke reports that you are currently unemployed, residing in temporary accommodation provided by Bristol City Council. You have four prior convictions for shoplifting dating back over the past decade, with the most recent prior to these charges occurring in 2022, when you received a conditional discharge. The report also notes sporadic engagement with support services, including financial counselling offered by the local charity “Hand in Hand” and attendance at a drug and alcohol advice clinic, which you declined to pursue further.\n\nAn independent psychiatric report was also tendered from Dr Malcolm Bellamy, consultant forensic psychiatrist, based on assessments conducted in May and June. Dr Bellamy concluded that you do not meet criteria for a major mental disorder, but identified moderate depressive symptoms, notable impulsivity traits, and evidence of substance misuse predominantly involving alcohol. The report expressed concern regarding your low motivation for change and poor insight into the consequences of offending. Importantly, the assessment advised that custodial sentence supervision might be necessary to ensure compliance with planned interventions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nIt is necessary here to set out briefly the offending of which you stand convicted. The facts reflect a calculated series of actions committed over numerous occasions. The overall pattern betrays no injustice in holding you accountable for a deliberate and repeated course of conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nYour offending is particularly noteworthy for the choice of premises targeted. The majority are small, locally owned businesses lacking the security infrastructure of larger chains. That these ventures represent vital community resources must not be overlooked. The harm done to proprietors extends beyond mere financial loss to include significant anxiety and a sense of violation.\n\nI observe that the court received written victim impact statements from four independent shopkeepers, including a pharmacist who detailed the psychological strain experienced by staff following repeated theft of over-the-counter medicines, leading to increased staff turnover and decreased morale.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nThe sophistication of your conduct is evident. Multiple items were concealed using layered clothing, shopping bags, and backpacks, sometimes during periods of heightened store activity such as school runs or lunchtimes. Such tactics are consistent with offending profiles seen both in police intelligence and academic research on retail crime.\n\nThe court has also reviewed the findings of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership meeting held on 20 June 2025, which outlined coordinated mitigation attempts deployed at affected premises. These included increased CCTV coverage, staffing adjustments, and community liaison efforts. The persistence of offending despite these measures underlines the deliberate and intentional nature of your conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nYour actions did not entail threat or violence, but that does not diminish their seriousness. The cumulative distress imposed upon those who work in vulnerable settings cannot be measured solely in pecuniary terms.\n\nNotwithstanding these infractions, there is no evidence to suggest your conduct escalated to possession of weapons or involvement in organised shoplifting gangs. This contrasts with cases such as R v. Barnett [2019] EWCA Crim 1127, where defendants operated as part of highly organised theft rings engaging in fencing and distribution of stolen goods.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nThe impact on community cohesion and local economies is subtle but profound. Reports from the City of Bristol’s Business Improvement District underscore how persistent theft discourages investment and incentivises closures in affected neighbourhoods. A report dated 12 May 2025 emphasises that retail shrinkage due to theft was responsible for an estimated 3% reduction in footfall in certain areas over a 12-month period.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nFurthermore, evidence indicates that you made use of distraction techniques on numerous occasions, engaging store employees in conversation or feigning interest in other products while purloining goods elsewhere.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nDespite a prior community resolution issued in 2022 following earlier shoplifting charges, you resumed similar offending within months, displaying a regrettable failure to desist.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nThe probation report notes that you have neither secured nor consistently maintained employment over recent years. Employment, of course, is a significant protective factor against reoffending. This absence magnifies concerns that a custodial sentence might be necessary to engender meaningful rehabilitation.\n\nThe report also highlights the impact of housing instability on your circumstances. The difficulties faced by the Bristol city housing strategy are well documented: high demand, low supply, and extended waiting lists conspire to leave many vulnerable persons in precarious accommodation or temporary placements. Yet, these systemic pressures are persistent and, while relevant as context, do not absolve individual responsibility for criminal conduct.\n\nThe court is mindful of the growing visibility of homelessness across urban centres, including visible clusters in the city centre and the encampments along Cumberland Basin. While your situation does not amount to entrenched rough sleeping, the precariousness of your housing contributes to the context.\n\nDr Bellamy’s psychiatric report recommends cognitive behavioural interventions focusing on impulsivity management, as well as alcohol use disorder treatment, preferably delivered in conjunction with probation-supervised programmes. The report also acknowledges that your engagement to date with such measures has been minimal.\n\nIt must be emphasised that no formal diagnoses of psychosis or major affective disorder were found. Prior legal issues relating to possession of controlled substances and public order offences received from prior convictions have been marked by relatively minor culpability and no history of violence.\n\nFurther afield, this court has noted the sentencing of recent cases involving serious harm, including R v. Fletcher [2025] EWCA Crim 754, which involved aggravated burglary with injury in a separate jurisdiction, and R v. Owens [2024] EWCA Crim 305, concerning large-scale drug importation. Neither bears on the present case save to demonstrate the broad range of offences prosecuted across Crown Court listings.\n\nSimilarly, this court’s own lists have included unrelated matters such as arson offences damaging commercial storage units in Courtroom 4, as well as fraud cases involving identity theft and mortgage deception—diversions from the immediate facts but illustrative of the diverse workload shouldered by the criminal justice system.\n\nThe submissions made on your behalf by Mr Alex Thornton, your instructed defence counsel, were careful to emphasise your relative youth at the commencement of the offending series, the impact of instability in your early childhood, and your expressed desire to engage with rehabilitative opportunities. Mr Thornton drew attention to the enclosed character references and letters of support from the local drop-in centre “Hope House,” where you have attended sporadically over the past year.\n\nThe Crown, represented by Ms Faith Massey, correctly emphasised the ongoing harm to vulnerable retail staff and proprietors, and highlighted your prior history and the persistence of offending after non-custodial interventions. The Crown requested a custodial sentence commensurate with culpability and harm consistent with sentencing principles laid down in the Theft guideline.\n\nRelevant case law bearing on credit for your guilty plea must be addressed. As noted in R v. Clarke [2023] EWCA Crim 1274, late pleas entered after substantial trial preparation warrant reduced credit. While the exact timing and circumstances of your admission permit some but not full mitigation, the court is mindful of the impact this has had on witnesses and court resources.\n\nThis court is cognisant of the wider phenomenon of ‘late guilty pleas’ in similarly situated cases. While legally permitted and procedurally fair, they have a tangible impact on the economy of court sittings and the emotional and logistical burden on victims and witnesses. Sympathy for difficulties encountered by defendants must not obscure these realities.\n\nIn sentencing you today, careful consideration will be given to the statutory framework under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, especially sections 142 and 153 relating to custodial sentences and community orders. The court seeks to balance punishment, deterrence, public protection, and reformative opportunities.\n\nGiven the evidence of recurrence and refusal or failure to engage meaningfully with community-based interventions previously, it is likely that custody will feature in the ultimate sentence. However, the pre-sentence report and psychiatric evidence may identify appropriate rehabilitative or treatment conditions to be embedded where possible, even within custodial settings.\n\nThis court also notes, in a more peripheral sense, ongoing discussions around regulatory frameworks governing the retail sector, including calls for increased security measures and legislative changes to support small businesses. While these policy matters are of public interest, they are beyond this court’s remit in the sentencing exercise before me.\n\nThe hearing today has occurred in open court, with all parties in attendance, including legal representatives for both prosecution and defence. I thank Ms Massey and Mr Thornton for their professional conduct and measured presentations, which have facilitated the fair and orderly progress of proceedings. Court staff, ushers, and registrars are also acknowledged for their assistance.\n\nI reserve final sentence until such time as a full pre-sentence report, including any updated psychiatric or psychological evaluations, can be received and considered. This is to ensure that the sentence imposed is proportionate, informed, and capable of addressing both the individual circumstances of the defendant and the wider needs of public safety and community reassurance.\n\nThese are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge G. F. Dunbar, issued on 14 August 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been duly transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days, consistent with the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No specific reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2025/05931  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. F.
