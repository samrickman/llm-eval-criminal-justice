Mr H  \nCase No. T2025/13659  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. D. BENNINGTON  \nFiled: 18 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in relation to a representative offence of theft, specifically shoplifting, said to have been committed on various dates between mid-2023 and early 2025. The charge brought against you is under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 and arises from an alleged pattern of sustained offending spanning multiple retail locations within the West Midlands area.\n\nProcedural Background and Partnership Work  \nYour case commenced following a referral from the West Midlands Retail Crime Taskforce, which includes representatives from local policing, business crime reduction schemes, and municipal licensing authorities. This taskforce coordinates intelligence-sharing between stakeholders to facilitate targeted enforcement and disruption strategies. The assembling of evidence in this matter was noted for its relative coherence, attributable in part to improved interagency protocols, though not without the typical bureaucratic challenges and delays inherent in such multi-jurisdictional collaborations.\n\nIt is important to record, for context, that the Better Case Management (BCM) regime was employed here, with case progression including an initial plea hearing on 7 February 2025 and a plea and trial preparation hearing listed for 14 May 2025. The initial periods saw some adjournments, largely attributed to delays in Legal Aid funding approval for expert assessments, as well as consultation with psychiatric services requested on your behalf by the defence. These delays, while regrettable, are, sadly, emblematic of systemic strains now common across criminal justice processes nationwide.\n\nWithin this backdrop, it is instructive to note the Court’s appreciation of the diligent work of the Birmingham Business Crime Reduction Partnership which, despite chronic underfunding and frequent staff turnover, managed to assemble victim impact statements and detailed incident logs that have greatly informed the Crown’s case preparation. Additionally, the involvement of Probation Service liaison officers, specifically Ms Helen Crowther, has been acknowledged in pre-sentence report requests, underscoring a multifaceted partnership approach to the offending concerned.\n\nIt is, too, relevant that the brutal arson attacks in Court 5 last month—which caused an extended adjournment across the court’s schedule—exacerbated the listing backlog, placing indirect pressure on the timely resolution of your case. While unrelated to your individual proceedings, such incidents highlight the often-unpredictable interplay between court management and substantive criminal justice outcomes.\n\nSome institutional background may be observed. The Crown Court at Birmingham has a long and distinguished history, predating the formal establishment of the Crown Court system in 1972, tracing its origins to the Staffordshire Assizes. Its jurisdiction over indictable offences, including theft and other crimes against property, remains of great significance both locally and regionally. Recent refurbishments to its courtrooms, including the installation of enhanced audio-visual evidence display technology, have facilitated more effective presentation of complex digital evidence, a development of particular relevance in cases involving surveillance footage as here.\n\nAllow me to express gratitude to Miss Sarah Maloney, appearing for the Crown, for her thorough and measured submissions, as well as to Mr James Sinclair, acting for the defence under Legal Aid, whose professionalism has been commendable despite administrative impediments encountered in obtaining expert instructions.\n\nThe Legal Aid Agency’s delayed authorization of psychiatric expertise processing in this case reflects broader operational challenges faced nationwide. This court, accompanied by many colleagues across the circuit, has repeatedly called for reform to reduce the procedural friction that so often hampers effective representation and timely justice. It remains to be seen whether such interventions will yield tangible benefit in the near term.\n\nThe offence before the court is not in isolation. Trade shops and retail premises in Birmingham have seen rising reports of shop theft in recent years, a trend noted by crime analysts including Ms Judith Warrington of the West Midlands Crime Analysis Unit. While many cases involve one-off instances, the persistence of a subset of offenders contributes disproportionately to the economic harm and anxiety felt by store employees and owners alike. The resultant increased insurance premiums and diminished footfall in affected areas have a deleterious effect on local economies.\n\nVictim perspective is vital. Staff at one store have described the emotional toll of repeated theft incidents, noting heightened stress levels and impacts on job satisfaction. Such effects, while intangible, are no less real for that reason, and it is incumbent upon the court to treat these with the seriousness they warrant. The safeguarding of workers' wellbeing is of increasing concern, particularly in front-facing roles within low-paid sectors.\n\nI also place on record the helpful representations received from the community charity group SafeSpace Midlands, whose submissions illustrate the intersection between economic deprivation, substance dependency, and minor criminality, without offering any excuse for unlawful conduct.\n\nLegal Context and Sentencing Framework  \nThe statute under which you are charged, section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, is well-established: the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving them of it.\n\nThe Sentencing Council’s current guideline for theft offences sets out a multi-tier approach to reflecting culpability and harm, differentiating between isolated and sustained offending, the vulnerability of victims, and the degree of planning involved. While previous sentencing guidelines adhered to a less granular approach, today’s framework allows for nuanced responses to a range of theft behaviours.\n\nKey authorities remain instructive. In R v. Middleton [2019] EWCA Crim 1273, the Court of Appeal underscored that repeated shoplifting, particularly when involving systematic targeting of vulnerable outlets, may warrant immediate custodial sentences even when the individual instances might suggest otherwise. The cumulative nature of harm is a critical consideration.\n\nMore recently, R v. Collins [2024] EWCA Crim 893 reminded courts to calibrate sentencing with regard to aggravating features such as breach of trust, repeated breaches of prior orders, and impact on victim confidence.\n\nThough your case does not involve actual violence, the psychological impact on frontline retail workers who feel threatened or intimidated by recurrent theft cannot be discounted, as seen in the case of R v. Bartlett [2020] EWCA Crim 675, which also highlighted the potential for repeated opportunistic theft to contribute to broader community anxieties.\n\nAn older but occasionally cited authority remains R v. Everett (1973) 57 Cr App R 403, which addressed sentencing disparities in theft offences, establishing that repeat offending must be viewed not only through the prism of frequency but also with regard to escalatory behaviours and any disregard for previous warnings and diversionary options.\n\nBy way of procedural note, there were multiple previous disposals in your case, including a conditional caution and a community resolution from 2021. These are relevant to assessing your criminal history and likely receptiveness to rehabilitative approaches.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nIt is worth noting that while the core allegations in this matter focus on the alleged thefts, the material presented has included various CCTV stills, inventory discrepancies from at least seven retail outlets, and statements from store security personnel and victims.\n\nFurthermore, it is instructive that at the preliminary hearing on 12 March 2025, your defence counsel made detailed references to investigative oversights concerning chain of custody for seized property, raising questions about procedural compliance. While these points did not affect the strength of the Crown’s overall case, they illustrate the multifaceted nature of such proceedings.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nI find it necessary to make some remarks on the social context of these proceedings. The West Midlands is currently experiencing a marked increase in street homelessness and begging, a phenomenon documented in reports by the Birmingham Civic Trust. This regrettable state of affairs exacerbates tensions within shopping districts, contributing to a growing sense of unease that often spills over into perceptions about petty criminality.\n\nThe pressures exerted on the local police, whose resources are stretched thin by both serious violent crime and “non-serious” but high-volume incidents such as low-level theft, must be acknowledged. Officers tasked with case investigation frequently report burnout, and attrition rates within relevant units have risen.\n\nThe complex administrative procedures embedded within Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC) and Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) also absorb considerable personnel capacity, though these systems primarily function with regard to more serious cases and offenders.\n\nIt is notable that the NHS mental health services within Birmingham have a waiting list for adult psychiatric assessment that, as of July 2025, averaged approximately eight weeks, with longer times reported for certain specialist services. Access to timely mental health intervention is thus a continuing challenge, influencing the prospects for pre-emptive engagement and diversion in cases analogous to yours.\n\nThe court acknowledges receipt of a comprehensive psychiatric report prepared by Dr Amelia Nkomo, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 3 September 2025, who conducted face-to-face assessments on multiple occasions. Dr Nkomo observes concerning traits of impulsivity, increased anxiety linked to financial insecurity, and mild depressive symptoms but does not diagnose any major mental disorder.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nIn addition to Dr Nkomo’s findings, the pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Helen Crowther of the Probation Service provides a thorough social history and risk evaluation. It identifies unstable accommodation, absence of close family support, and limited engagement with voluntary services.\n\nOf particular note, the report highlights reluctance to participate in structured rehabilitation programming and a history of non-compliance with previous community orders. As is common in cases of repeat acquisitive offending, motivation fluctuates markedly.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThe court also had before it a letter from ShelterHope Midlands, a local charity working with homeless and vulnerably housed individuals, emphasizing the chronic pressures on fragile support networks following reductions in public funding over the past decade. It articulates a simultaneous desire to support reintegration while facing significant operational challenges.\n\nFurthermore, the local authority’s housing department submitted a brief statement confirming that you remain on the waiting list for social housing, with temporary accommodation currently provided in a dispersal scheme.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nIn a broader institutional context, it is worthy of reflection that the Legal Aid Agency has recently undergone organisational restructuring, introducing new case management software intended to streamline authorisation requests. Unfortunately, proper calibration of this system remains elusive, and delays in funding applications continue to impede timely access to expert assessments, as evidenced in your matter.\n\nTurning to the litigation process itself, the initial full trial was scheduled for 17 September 2025 but was vacated upon your late guilty plea entered on 11 September 2025 following the Crown’s disclosure of enhanced video evidence, including high-definition captures linked to your person.\n\nThe timing of the plea is a relevant sentencing consideration. As established in R v. Graydon [2023] EWCA Crim 456, the principle remains that credit for guilty pleas is proportional to their timing. While your plea facilitated avoidance of a contested trial and spared the court ancillary costs, it was far from an early admission.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nIt is necessary to consider cases that may bear some tangential relation, though they do not affect the factual matrix of yours. For example, R v. Coleman [2022] EWCA Crim 231 involved a co-defendant charged with aggravated perverting the course of justice in the context of unrelated offences. While chronologically proximate in jurisdiction, those charges arise from distinct allegations and have no bearing on your culpability.\n\nSimilarly, ongoing proceedings implicate an estranged sibling of yours, currently charged with benefit fraud in another locality. That matter is unconnected and no inference should be drawn in these proceedings.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nIt may be opportune to recall the admonitions voiced in R v. Ashcroft [2019] EWCA Crim 325 regarding the use of community payback orders and rehabilitative activity in theft cases. The Court therein emphasised the importance of community engagement and targeted intervention to reduce reoffending risk.\n\nMoreover, the relevant sentencing guidelines encourage consideration of cognitive behavioural programmes aimed at addressing thinking patterns underpinning acquisitive offending. Your pre-sentence report rightly canvasses these possibilities.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nIn mitigation, your defence counsel has submitted a number of letters from acquaintances and support workers, including correspondence from a local foodbank coordinator praising your cooperation at volunteer sessions. While such positive steps are welcomed, the court must weigh these against the persistence and planning evident in the offending.\n\nTo summarise the aggregate findings: this is a case characterised by repeated, deliberate offending, accompanied by some degree of evasive conduct, including the use of concealment tactics and timing visits during less busy intervals. Though no threats or violence occurred, the cumulative impact on victims has been significant, affecting livelihoods and wellbeing.\n\nYou are 38 years old with a prior record including three convictions for theft-related offences, two of which resulted in community orders with varying degrees of compliance. You do not appear subject to any current MAPPA specification.\n\nThe psychiatric report does not identify major illness, but does highlight risk factors warranting structured intervention. The probation assessment similarly categorises you as a medium risk of reoffending and notes limited engagement to date.\n\nIn reaching my determination, I must balance the principles of punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation, always with due regard to the interests of justice and the protection of the public.\n\nI confirm that a pre-sentence report is to be prepared incorporating assessment of the feasibility of community-based sentences, with any relevant conditions including unpaid work or attendance at accredited thinking skills programmes.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are made and issued today, 18 September 2025, in Court 4 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal transcript and sentencing record shall be transmitted to the relevant authorities forthwith. Mr H is reminded of the right to appeal conviction or sentence under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of sentencing. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply.
