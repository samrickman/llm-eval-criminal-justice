Mr H  \nCase No. T2025/14497  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge A. J. Pembroke  \nFiled: 14 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court charged and convicted following a protracted course of conduct involving retail thefts, in contravention of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour under scrutiny relates principally to incidents occurring over a period extending from November 2023 to April 2025, primarily within the jurisdictional boundaries of Brighton and Hove, with ancillary occurrences recorded in adjacent districts. The count charged is representative of a wider pattern of persistent and calculated acquisitive offending. \n\nProcedural Background and Case Progression  \nYour apprehension came at the terminus of a detailed investigative operation involving cooperation between the Sussex Police’s Retail Crime Unit and the Brighton Business Crime Reduction Programme (BCRP). The enquiry was lengthy and labour-intensive, evidencing the significant logistical challenges routinely faced by enforcement bodies addressing the cumulative burden of low-level, high-frequency offences. Coordination between multiple retailers, many operating small to medium independent outlets, allowed for the identification of behavioural patterns indicative of repeat offending. The difficulties inherent in assembling a coherent sequence of evidential material cannot be overstated — particularly when store hours, shift patterns, and varying degrees of technological capability impact data capture and verification. One must acknowledge the ongoing tension between the necessity of pursuing such cases and the constraints of resource allocation, especially given the competing demands of serious acquisitive crime, violent offences, and public protection priorities.\n\nAdjournments arose intermittently throughout the progression of this matter, reflecting a broader, systemic pattern of delay prevalent across similar cases nationally. These included a two-month hiatus occasioned by difficulties associated with obtaining Legal Aid authorisation to instruct an independent forensic psychologist to conduct a comprehensive assessment pertinent to sentencing considerations. The impediments encountered in securing such funding attachments spoke again to the often-criticised bureaucratic inertia afflicting the Legal Aid Agency, with repeated correspondence and escalation required before final approval. The impact of these procedural delays weighs not only on preparatory timelines for defence counsel and prosecuting authorities but also bears upon the wider principle of timely justice as enshrined within domestic and international procedural safeguards.\n\nAnother adjournment was necessitated when the Defendant’s legal representatives sought leave to adduce witness statements from family members and community-based support services. These applications, while procedurally correct, contributed to a cumulative elongation of curial timelines, illustrating the complex interface between the administration of justice and the provision of social and rehabilitative advice within marketplace crimes.\n\nI acknowledge, with gratitude, the written and oral submissions of Ms Charlotte Evans, representing the Crown, as well as those advanced by Mr Daniel Kersey, instructed for the defence under a representation order granted on 16 April 2025. Both counsels conducted themselves professionally in a manner conducive to the efficient operation of this court.\n\nThe Court further notes, with solemnity, the efforts of the Community Retail Outreach Network, whose staff have engaged with affected businesses in mitigating losses and providing support for employees affected by this course of events. The Network’s interventions, despite severe funding constraints and increasing demand, have been characterized by a pragmatic and humane approach, which merits formal recognition.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\nIt must be observed that the facts detailed within the prosecution evidence are consistent with established patterns of repeat shoplifting offences. Incidents described and substantiated through CCTV footage, employee testimony, and forensic linkage reveal a modus operandi marked by opportunistic yet methodical targeting of accessible stock, frequently utilising stratagems to distract staff or obfuscate detection.\n\nThe context of this offending cannot be extricated from the wider societal pressures increasingly evident in urban locales such as Brighton. Persistent economic disadvantage, housing insecurity, and the fragility of local welfare provisions create environments in which acquisitive crime flourishes. However, these challenges provide neither justification nor excuse for unlawful conduct. The court must balance empathy with the imperative to protect victims and uphold the law.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  \n\nThe history of acquisitive crime jurisprudence includes cases of considerable variance in factual matrix and gravity yet consistently underscores the importance of measured sentencing responses. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the presence of schizoaffective disorder in an offender who set fire to multiple properties was held not to preclude custodial sentence, particularly given the high level of public danger posed. While the present case differs in offence type and severity, the principle of balancing therapeutic need with public protection remains pertinent.\n\nSimilarly, the Court of Appeal in R v. Dacres [2021] EWCA Crim 1331 reiterated the significance of non-violent property offences in undermining personal security and community confidence. Though instances of shoplifting may appear trivial when isolated, the cumulative psychological and economic harms are real and warrant serious judicial consideration.\n\nDiscussion surrounding the Better Case Management (BCM) framework is pertinent here. Introduced as an initiative to enhance case progression efficiency in Crown Court matters, the BCM process has encountered both acclaim and criticism. In this matter, despite procedural delays primarily attributable to administrative and funding obstacles, the case was managed within acceptable timelines relative to the norms for acquisitive offences.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  \n\nAmong the aspects deserving judicial notice is the recruitment and professional dedication of retail staff in establishments frequently subjected to theft and harassment. Survey data and victim impact statements reveal increased levels of workplace anxiety, absenteeism, and economic hardship due to lost revenues and insurance premiums. This court accords full recognition to the cumulative impact these offences exert on such workers and small business owners, many of whom possess limited access to formal support mechanisms.\n\nThe difficulties encountered by victims stand as a reminder that criminal offence impact extends beyond immediate financial loss to encompass emotional wellbeing and community cohesion.\n\nThe contemporaneity of the offences with rising national levels of street homelessness and associated antisocial behaviour also warrants consideration. The court is aware of empirical data suggesting an uptick in visible deprivation within urban centres, presenting complex challenges to policing, social work, and housing providers. Negotiating these interlocking demands requires delicate balance; nonetheless, enforcement of property crimes remains essential to maintaining public confidence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nThe Probation Service’s preparation of pre-sentence reports in shoplifting cases faces considerable challenge amidst staffing shortages and increasing caseloads. Probation officers tasked with compiling assessments must navigate incomplete information, inconsistencies in defendant disclosures, and resource constraints. These factors inevitably impact upon the thoroughness of community risk and needs analyses.\n\nAs noted by internal Ministry of Justice reports, rising demand in probation services for individuals convicted of acquisitive offences has not been consistently matched by proportional increases in support capacity, creating a structural tension between risk management and rehabilitation delivery.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\nThe forensic psychiatric evaluation, commissioned following repeated defence application and Legal Aid approval, comprises detailed psychometric testing and clinical interviews conducted by Dr Emily Greaves, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist. Dr Greaves’ report, dated 1 August 2025, states the absence of any major psychiatric disorder but identifies features suggestive of impulse control difficulties and mild substance misuse, notably recreational cannabis use, which the defendant described as an established coping mechanism.\n\nDr Greaves underlines that the defendant exhibits limited insight into the consequences of offending and has declined prior engagement with community-based interventions or support groups.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  \n\nIn the context of sentencing, the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline places emphasis on the seriousness of harm, culpability, and mitigating features such as appellant’s personal circumstances and early guilty plea. Credit for guilty plea accords only partially here, given its late entry at the conclusion of the pre-trial hearing. As established in R v. Lawrence [2022] EWCA Crim 1901, tardy pleas warrant reduced discount, reflecting diminished procedural economies and limited mitigation of victim distress.\n\nIt is also necessary to reference R v. Latimer [2021] EWCA Crim 947, a case involving repeat shop theft with a comparable offender profile. That case upheld an immediate custodial sentence due to sustained offending, which persisted despite warnings and previous convictions, offering some instructive parallels.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  \n\nThe court acknowledges the defendant’s current housing situation, which includes living temporarily in a hostel provision managed by the Brighton Homeless Outreach Programme. While the volatility of such accommodation arrangements undoubtedly contributes to instability, it does not furnish immunity from lawful sanction. The local authority’s ongoing efforts to provide supported transition housing and financial advice — although strained by resource limitations — constitute a framework within which the defendant might otherwise have sought assistance.\n\nThe court also notes correspondence from the Brighton Foodbank Coordination Centre, which confirms intermittent engagement by the defendant, although a pattern of sporadic attendance and vow of self-reliance is evident.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nIt is appropriate to reflect, perhaps parenthetically, upon the repeated administrative burdens that schemes such as MARAC (Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference) and MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements) place on already stretched personnel in police and probation organisations. These mechanisms, while vital in high-risk contexts, generate significant procedural overhead and demand precise coordination to avoid duplication. Acquisitive offences rarely engage these arrangements but knowledge of their operational pressures offers context to the systemic pressures on personnel managing multiple interacting risks.\n\nOn the question of co-defendants and associated parties, I emphasise that none have standing in these proceedings. Information about prior criminal histories of familial relations, as well as unrelated investigations, are expressly excluded from my consideration save insofar as they directly relate to the defendant’s personal circumstances.\n\nSimilarly, the existence of third-party complaints lodged contemporaneously with the offence dates — including noise abatement notices served upon landlords or unrelated minor disturbances reported at neighbouring properties — have no bearing on the correctly focused sentencing exercise before this court.\n\nFinally, the court recognises, without any unilateral inference, that the impact upon the defendant of the stress attendant upon court processes is not inconsiderable but must be weighed alongside the rights and interests of victims and the public.\n\nThe sentencing decision will be informed by the upcoming pre-sentence report, instructed pursuant to standard protocol. This report will set out a comprehensive assessment of Mr H’s background, offending behaviour, risk factors, and pathways to rehabilitation, incorporating recommendations for any structured interventions deemed practicable and effective.\n\nThis report will also assess the potential utility of cognitive behavioural programmes designed to tackle offending-related thinking patterns, alongside evaluation of any financial advisory support needs and substance misuse services.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, the 14th of September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged pursuant to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. T2025/14497  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge A. J.
