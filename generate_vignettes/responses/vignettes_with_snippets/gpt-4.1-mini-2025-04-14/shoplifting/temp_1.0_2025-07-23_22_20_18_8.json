MR H  \nCase No. L2025/14327  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. A. KENDRICK  \nFiled: 18 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court charged with offences of theft from retail premises, more commonly styled as shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour which underpins your conviction stretches over a period from November 2023 through to May 2025, and includes multiple incidents across the West Yorkshire metropolitan area, touching upon communities within Leeds, Bradford, and Calderdale. This court has been handed a representative charge reflecting a sustained pattern of conduct rather than unrelated isolated events.\n\nProcedural History and Case Progression  \nYou were first arrested on 12 June 2025 following a detailed investigation coordinated by the West Yorkshire Police Force Commercial Crime Unit in cooperation with the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), a multi-agency scheme involving the police, local authorities, and security personnel from affected retail outlets. This investigation included the systematic collection and analysis of surveillance footage, staff reports, and third-party witness statements. It should be observed that such inquiries are resource-intensive, requiring officers to spend considerable hours reviewing hours upon hours of video material—most of it low quality and unremarkable—before identifying patterns consistent with one individual’s movements and behaviours.\n\nOf particular note during the investigative phase was the challenge of collating data from disparate stores, some belonging to different corporate entities and others independent businesses lacking formal loss prevention teams. Such cooperation is often fragile and contingent upon the resources available within each organisation. It is not uncommon for discount supermarkets and small convenience stores to have limited surveillance coverage, or for filming angles to be insufficient for positive identification.\n\nYour initial interview under caution took place on 14 June. At that time, you denied any involvement in the incidents. However, forensic examination of clothing seized at the time of your arrest, notably a grey jumper bearing fibrous traces matching fibres from tags found on stolen property, was admitted as corroboratory evidence during the proceedings. Following charge, the case was allocated promptly to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management procedures instituted by the Criminal Procedure Rules. The intentions of BCM are to streamline listing, encourage early disclosure, and reduce unnecessary delays in delivering justice.\n\nAn initial plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 4 July. At that juncture, your defence team entered a not guilty plea. Subsequently, as further evidential material was served—namely, new high-definition CCTV footage and several staff statements referencing repeated off-site forfeitures of unpaid-for goods—you altered your position, entering a guilty plea on the first day of the trial window; a point at which the evidential case against you had become, in the Crown’s submission, overwhelmingly unanswerable.\n\nThe court must, in accordance with applicable sentencing principles, evaluate the nature and timing of this change in plea carefully. Previous jurisprudence, including the well-cited case of R v. Horton [2023] EWCA Crim 857, underscores that credit for a guilty plea is inherently discretionary and tidally linked to both the timing and the sincerity—mere strategic capitulation is insufficient to warrant full mitigation.\n\nThe law mandates that the sentencing tribunal consider whether the plea has spared victims, witnesses, and public resources from the ordeal of a full trial. Late pleas of convenience attract correspondingly reduced discounts, and this principle has been reaffirmed in R v. Freeman [2024] EWCA Crim 1012, a case concerning persistent offences of shoplifting over an eighteen-month period involving multiple retailers.\n\nPatterns in acquisitive offending such as these are not to be trivialised as victimless or “minor” infractions. The cumulative impact on small businesses is well documented, reflected across multiple victim impact statements tendered by store managers and collective representations submitted by the West Yorkshire Retailers’ Association. These statements describe not merely financial loss but significant emotional strain, with some staff reporting increased anxiety, the imposition of restrictive customer policies, and a sense of insecurity in their daily work environment. The effect on affected employees, many of whom are low-paid and work irregular hours, is a difficult yet inescapable facet of the harm occasioned by persistent acquisitive crime.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nA significant challenge arises in the prosecution of offences such as yours due to the mobile nature of the offending and the tendency for such behaviour to occur across jurisdictional boundaries. The court notes the commendable degree of inter-agency cooperation in this case, which involved West Yorkshire Police’s Specialist Crime and Intelligence Team liaising with Bradford safeguarding services and Calderdale social outreach coordinators to consolidate victim reports and offender profiles. This cooperation extended to the activation of Local Crime Delivery Groups under the auspices of the Business Crime Partnership Framework, which seeks to bridge the gap between formal law enforcement and community-based restorative justice mechanisms.\n\nDespite the apparent efficacy of such multi-layered approaches, the court is mindful of the well-evidenced limits of institutional capacity. Housing services have reported a marked increase in demand linked to street homelessness over the past year, with acute shortages in emergency accommodation disproportionately affecting younger adults with backgrounds similar to your own. NHS mental health services in the region continue to experience substantial backlogs, with waiting times for adult psychiatric assessment often exceeding three months. Such systemic pressures, while not dispositive of individual culpability, form the context within which many offences may be understood.\n\nThe Legal Aid Agency’s role in this matter merits reflection. The court reiterates its ongoing concern regarding delays in the authorisation of expert assessments, in this instance a psychiatric evaluation sought early in the proceedings but approved only after a protracted period of more than eight weeks. These delays hamper both defence preparation and the court’s capacity to reach an informed sentencing decision promptly. Prior rulings, including R v. Phillips [2021] EWCA Crim 1560, have criticised systemic inefficiencies that undermine defendants’ rights to a fair hearing and obstruct the timely execution of justice. It behooves the Legal Aid System, rightly and urgently, to address such bottlenecks.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nDefence Submissions  \nYour solicitor, Mr Dean Wren, has provided written submissions highlighting your personal background, which includes a history of intermittent employment, documented financial hardship, and episodic housing instability. Letters from local charities—namely the Leeds Hope Centre and Bradford Mutual Aid—attach endorsements for your character and commend a recent albeit inconsistent effort to engage with support programmes. Such efforts, while preliminary and partial, warrant careful consideration.\n\nIt is submitted that the offending arose in part from a combination of economic necessity and diminished social support networks. Your case is advanced as one illustrative of the wider societal challenges presently confronting marginalised individuals, rather than as emblematic of pure criminal intent.\n\nThe court acknowledges these contextual factors, but must balance them against the imperative of public protection, ensuring deterrence, and upholding the rule of law.\n\nLegal Framework and Case Law  \nThe Theft Act 1968 remains the foundational statute governing the conduct at issue. Section 1 requires as elements dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intention to permanently deprive.\n\nThe Sentencing Council’s current guideline on Theft Offences (effective as of 1 January 2021) stipulates that sentences are to be determined from the established starting points depending on the value of the goods, the offender’s culpability, harm caused, and other aggravating or mitigating factors. Persistent offending, targeting vulnerable victims, and failure to engage with rehabilitative services typically increase sentencing severity.\n\nThe court has considered relevant appellate jurisprudence, including R v. Mitchell [2019] EWCA Crim 995, wherein the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence for repeated theft from convenience stores, noting the cumulative impact on victim businesses and staff wellbeing. Similarly, the decision in R v. Owen [2020] EWCA Crim 1184 highlighted that repeated low-level acquisitive offences display a particular threat to public confidence in community safety, justifying immediate custody in appropriate cases.\n\nA more recent authority, R v. Lenton [2024] EWCA Crim 704, further clarified the approach to credit for guilty pleas entered late in prolonged acquisitive crime proceedings, affirming that mere acceptance of guilt at trial window onset does not automatically confer maximum mitigation where the defendant had opportunities to admit responsibility earlier.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nA wider review of case law reiterates that sentences must be sufficient to mark the breach of trust, denounce disregard for societal norms, and provide both specific and general deterrence. General deterrence bears particular weight in shoplifting cases, where the prevalence of reoffending underscores the necessity of firm judicial response.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nConsideration is also given to the observations in R v. Simmons [2018] EWCA Crim 1725, where the Court noted that community orders, while often appropriate for first-time offenders or those with demonstrable rehabilitative potential, may be insufficient where the pattern evidences deliberate, calculated dishonesty.\n\nVictim Impact and Community Effect  \nStatements submitted by retail managers and affected employees paint a vivid picture of the ripple effects of shoplifting. These include increased security measures generating financial burden, diminished staff morale, and unfortunate operational consequences such as reduced opening hours. It was reported by one pharmacy manager that employees had been urged to remain vigilant during closing shifts, significantly heightening work-related stress.\n\nThe court also reflects on correspondence from the West Yorkshire Retailers’ Association expressing concern about the rising cost to small businesses in theft-related losses and the broader implication for town centre vitality. These voices, often heard only faintly amidst larger criminal justice processes, deserve full weight in the sentencing exercise.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nAssessment of Personal Circumstances  \nProbation reports prepared at the court’s direction identify you as a 34-year-old individual with no known history of substance misuse but with longstanding financial precariousness and familial estrangement. You have four prior convictions for acquisitive crime, including two for shoplifting dating back to 2020 and 2021. These convictions have resulted in community sentences, which reportedly were only partially complied with.\n\nThe most recent Probation Officer’s report, dated 2 September 2025, notes your limited engagement with voluntary sector initiatives but stops short of affirming a positive rehabilitative trajectory. The report recommends consideration of a community order incorporating an Accredited Programme targeting offending behaviour, coupled with mandatory supervision and a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement. It expresses concern about potential risks of recurrence absent structured intervention.\n\nA psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Angela Morley at your solicitor’s request, concludes that while you exhibit some traits consistent with anxiety and low mood, there is no clinical evidence of severe mental disorder affecting your responsibility or impulse control. Dr Morley stresses the importance of bespoke psychosocial support addressing underlying stressors, financial management, and self-control strategies.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nThe court appreciates these contributions from the professionals involved, acknowledging their role in helping to contextualise the personal and social dimensions underpinning your offending.\n\nRelevant External Factors  \nThe court is mindful of broader systemic difficulties. The Leeds Mental Health Trust reports continuing challenges with capacity, with adult community teams operating under significant pressure and waiting times for assessment and intervention extending beyond routine levels. Housing authorities in West Yorkshire face growing caseloads, with priority need criteria often unmet and temporary accommodation stretched.\n\nWest Yorkshire Police criminal intelligence units have advised on continuing workloads impacted by acquisitive offending and noted the extent to which such crimes draw scarce frontline resources away from serious and violent crime investigations. These pressures are well known but offer no excuse for offending, rather highlighting the importance of clear and proportionate judicial response.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nAncillary Observations and Institutional Notes  \nIt is appropriate to record the court’s appreciation for the integrity and diligence of the court list officer, ushering staff, and administrative personnel in Court 5 at Leeds Crown Court, who have facilitated the listing of this matter amidst challenging logistical constraints. Due to recent refurbishment, the courtroom now benefits from enhanced acoustic properties and digital evidence presentation systems, a welcome improvement aiding clearer understanding of evidential material.\n\nThe hearing today has been conducted in full open court, accessible to press and public in accordance with open justice principles. No reporting restrictions apply in this matter. It is notable, however, that absent media attendance reflects contemporary trends of public indifference towards acquisitive crime cases unless augmented by violence or sensational elements.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nClosing Remarks and Sentencing Directions  \nThe question now before the court is the appropriate sanction which balances the gravity of your offences, the impact on victims, your personal circumstances, and the public interest. There is an evident pattern of offending, punctuated by prior opportunities for intervention and unaccompanied by meaningful engagement with support services. Your guilty plea, entered late, remains a relevant factor, but one which, for the reasons already set out, limits the scale of credit that may be afforded.\n\nI shall direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report to assist the court’s final determination. This report shall, inter alia, consider the appropriateness of community-based interventions versus immediate custodial sentences, with particular attention to the feasibility of rehabilitative programmes addressing offending behaviour and financial vulnerability. It shall also explore your engagement capacity and risk profile, alongside the potential utility of restorative justice measures that may contribute to reparation and victim satisfaction.\n\nSentencing is adjourned to a suitable date following the receipt of the probation services’ further advice. I thank counsel for their submissions made today: Ms Nicola Stevens for the Crown Prosecution Service, and Mr Dean Wren for the defence. I regret the administrative delays occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted authorisation process.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, at Leeds Crown Court, Court 5. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is informed of the right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.
