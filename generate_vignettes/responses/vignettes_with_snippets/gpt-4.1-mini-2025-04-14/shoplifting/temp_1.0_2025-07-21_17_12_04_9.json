MR H  \nCase No. B2025/13459  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge W. F. KENDALL  \nFiled: 14 November 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentence following a conviction related to theft from retail premises, a matter prosecuted under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending was committed over a period extending from late 2023 through to early 2025, predominantly in the city centre of Brighton and surrounding suburban shopping areas. This court is aware that repeat offending of this nature places considerable strain not only on the victim businesses but on entire community networks of safety, commerce, and neighbourhood cohesion.\n\nProcedural History  \nYou were first brought to the attention of police authorities in late November 2024 after a string of reports from multiple retailers within a concentrated retail corridor. This led to a joint operation spearheaded by the Sussex Business Crime Unit in concert with the Brighton Safer Neighbourhood Team and representatives of the Business Improvement District (BID). Over several weeks, the investigation employed a multi-modal approach incorporating analysis of security footage, spot checks by city council enforcement officers, and liaison with the Brighton Retail Crime Prevention Partnership. It is important to note that the use of closed-circuit television (CCTV) as a primary investigative tool is subject to real-world limitations: coverage is often partial, quality inconsistent, and, as is frequently the case, the sheer volume of footage reviewed necessitates considerable officer time that could otherwise be allocated to crimes of higher severity.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nThe investigation was compounded by challenges common to acquisitive crime cases: witnesses with fragmentary recollection, inconsistencies in reported stolen items, and turnover of store personnel. It was not until December 2024 that you were identified as a suspect, following both direct observation and corroborative evidence from retail loss prevention teams. You were arrested on 16 December 2024 and you subsequently elected to provide a written statement—initially denying involvement. This denial was tested and undermined by forensic examination of clothing items retrieved from your residence during a warrant executed on 17 December, which matched fibres and residues observed in multiple shoplifting incidents.\n\nThe matter was initially listed at Brighton Magistrates’ Court but transferred to the Crown Court for trial due to the volume and complexity of evidence. A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 20 February 2025, at which you entered a not guilty plea. On 4 September 2025, on the first morning of your trial in Court 4, you changed your plea to guilty against the advice of counsel. This late plea is pertinent to sentencing considerations.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nDelays were occasioned by a number of procedural matters. Defence counsel initially made an application for funding through the Legal Aid Agency to instruct a forensic psychologist with specialist knowledge of repeat acquisitive crime. The Agency’s protracted response cycle, involving requests for further information and bureaucratic challenge, caused a postponement of court proceedings by approximately six weeks. Such delays are regrettable and not unique; they underscore the administrative burdens now confronting Legal Aid and its impact on timely justice. The court hopes that forthcoming reforms will mitigate these procedural inefficiencies.\n\nRelevant Legal Authority  \nTurning to the legal framework, the Theft Act 1968’s section 1 defines theft succinctly as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive the owner. This seemingly simple definition belies the complexities courts face when assessing repeated offences within a given period, particularly those constituting a course of conduct. Sentencing must balance the discrete nature of individual acts against their cumulative effect.\n\nThe Sentencing Council guideline for theft offences, promulgated in 2022, provides a detailed framework for assessing harm, culpability, and mitigating factors. Items are categorised primarily by value and vulnerability of victims; the deliberate selection of small independent retailers—as with your case—is considered an aggravating factor by virtue of the disproportionate impact of losses and fear caused. Additionally, the guidance emphasises that persistent offending escalates the seriousness beyond the nominal value of stolen goods.\n\nThe court has also reviewed relevant guidance contained within the foreword to the Sentencing Council document, where it is acknowledged that sentencing “must be proportionate to harm caused and the offender’s culpability, recognising the cumulative impact of repeated offending”. The careful calibration required is echoed in case law.\n\nIn R v. Lambert [2023] EWCA Crim 1052, the Court of Appeal confronted a series of shoplifting offences involving multiple community pharmacies and independent grocers. The defendant was found to have methodically planned occasions to enter premises during predictable lulls, employing concealment tactics and evasion. The Court found that disruptive acquisitive offences could have a “chilling effect” on local trade and warranted a custodial sentence of 14 months, particularly where there was an absence of genuine remorse or engagement with rehabilitative services.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nFurther precedent was considered in R v. Cole [2020] EWCA Crim 870, involving a defendant who had participated in importing substantial quantities of counterfeit branded goods through parcel freight. Though the offence was unrelated to shoplifting, the court in Cole advanced the principle that a defendant’s culpability and moral blameworthiness must be assessed holistically, including their contribution to organised crime and exploitation. Such reflections are tangential to the instant matter but nonetheless informative in framing judicial response to layered patterns of dishonesty.\n\nContextual Observations  \nThe court is mindful of the broader sociological and systemic context in which offences like these occur. We are living in a time marked by increasing economic precarity and social dislocation. Rises in street homelessness, often entwined with untreated mental health issues, substance dependency, and fractured support networks, present significant challenges to public institutions.\n\nHowever, this court must also observe the strain placed on retail sectors by persistent theft. Small businesses operate under perpetual financial pressure, often absorbing shrinkage without recourse to insurance or compensation. There is a human cost: anxious staff who may face verbal abuse or feel unsafe, scheduling alterations to avoid lone working, and a sense of erosion of the communal trust fundamental to healthy commerce. It is imperative that sentencing reflects not only abstract legal principles but tangible community impact.\n\nThe Sussex Police Retail Crime Unit reports that retail crime accounts for a significant proportion of daily calls. The administrative burden this imposes on limited resources diverts attention from violent crime and serious organised offences. Local policing is, regrettably, caught in a difficult balance — addressing low-level offending with disproportionate resource allocation is unsustainable.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nIt is to be noted that your case demonstrates elements that activate the Business Crime Reduction Partnership protocols. This partnership, which incorporates police, council licensing services, retail security teams, and community safety officers, seeks to intervene early and reduce the repeat victimisation of retail premises. As is often the case, the efficacy of this multi-agency approach relies heavily on timely intelligence sharing, sustained funding, and frontline officer availability, factors which vary considerably by district. Brighton’s scheme, while ambitious, has faced challenges including recent cutbacks to its budget and staff turnover.\n\nThat said, the involvement of the Retail Crime Prevention Board here has resulted in some coordinated interventions, including bespoke training for staff at affected stores on recognising distraction techniques commonly employed by persistent shoplifters.\n\nPsychiatric and Probation Reports  \nIn your case, the psychiatric assessment conducted by Dr Amanda Spencer, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided a detailed clinical picture. Dr Spencer’s report, dated 22 October 2025, draws attention to a background of emotional instability and early adverse experiences, but finds no diagnosable psychosis or severe personality disorder. Instead, the report emphasises traits of impulsivity, intermittent depressive symptoms, and mild substance misuse—principally alcohol.\n\nDr Spencer notes that your engagement with recommended community mental health services has been sporadic, characterised by missed appointments and limited insight into the consequences of your behaviour. The report underscores that while psychiatric illness is not a main driver of your offending, there exists a risk profile involving social isolation and financial instability.\n\nSubmissions from probation echo these findings. Your allocated probation officer, Ms Kim Abbott, highlighted that you have been non-compliant with previous community orders imposed in 2022, were noted to have failed to sustain regular employment since 2021, and currently reside in unstable housing, provided through a temporary placement scheme. Such instability compounds the risk of recidivism, particularly when combined with limited social supports.\n\n {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\nYou have made reference in correspondence to your estranged relationship with your family, though attempts to verify engagement have been inconclusive. Your previous dependence on informal networks of support was reportedly bounded by episodes of conflict and disconnection. This court recognises the complex personal dynamics at play but weighs them cautiously when considering personal responsibility.\n\nI must again commend the patience and professionalism of the probation service in this case, which continues to manage extensive caseloads and systemic staffing shortages. The recent recruitment drive aimed at bolstering intermediate-level officers is hoped to improve supervision levels, but the backlog remains substantial.\n\nVictim Impact and Business Community Statements  \nVictim statements presented through the Brighton Retail Crime Partnership articulate the extent to which your offending has eroded staff confidence and operational viability. Retail managers detailed alterations to store opening hours and security measures implemented explicitly in response to theft fears.\n\nOne statement, from Mr Leonard Simeon, manager of a community grocer on Western Road, indicated that staff turnover had increased following your visits, citing emotional exhaustion among employees. Such human consequences, although intangible, underscore the broader harm resultant from acquisitive crime.\n\nThe Retail Support Network—a voluntary group providing advisory and restorative services to victims—submitted a letter recognising the ongoing challenges of engaging with perpetrators at this level of criminality. They emphasised that the trauma experienced by retail employees from persistent theft is often underestimated and rarely visible to the public.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nCourtroom Observations  \nI acknowledge the courteous conduct of counsel during these proceedings. Mrs Caroline Forster, representing the Crown, delivered submissions reflecting a balanced appreciation for the mitigating evidence alongside the need for deterrence. Mr James Warren, appearing under a representation order, advanced a cogent mitigating case drawing upon your difficult circumstances, late entry of plea, and absence of violence.\n\nThis courtroom itself was refurbished earlier this year following grant funding. The improved lighting and acoustics have enhanced the environment, though it remains staffed by the same diligent usher team who have maintained calm order throughout a crowded and busy session today.\n\nIt is worth noting that this case was listed at several points in the last six months and was twice postponed due to Covid-19-related staffing shortages, reflecting the burden placed on criminal justice resources since the pandemic and ongoing public sector workforce constraints.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nSentencing Considerations  \nHaving reviewed all materials and submissions, I return to the salient principles. Your offending constitutes a sustained course of dishonesty, with clear evidence of planning and repeat engagement in theft at multiple premises. Such persistence demonstrates significant culpability.\n\nThe harm occasioned extends beyond mere financial loss. The psychological impact on employees, the disruption to business operations, and the drain on public resources must be recognised. Your history of previous convictions for similar conduct is a material aggravating factor, as is your failure to desist despite warnings and prior community measures.\n\nThe mitigation acknowledged includes your current personal difficulties, your late plea of guilty, and some degree of cooperation with supervision since arrest. Nevertheless, the multiplicity of offences and the breadth of impact temper the extent of credit granted.\n\nThis court is conscious of evolving sentencing frameworks emphasising rehabilitation and desistance. A pre-sentence report will be critical in assessing appropriate community-based interventions, including cognitive behavioural programmes and structured employment support. It should also explore financial management assistance and engagement with substance misuse services.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nIt is incumbent upon the probation service to explore whether a community order inclusive of rehabilitation activity, unpaid work, and a drug and alcohol treatment requirement could be feasibly complied with in your circumstances. The risk to public confidence and safety inherent in repeated acquisitive offending requires a proportionate and carefully tailored response. Custodial sentences, while sometimes necessary, should be a last resort when community sanctions are unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe court acknowledges the challenge of balancing punitive and rehabilitative aims in cases underpinned by complex social and psychological factors. Notwithstanding, public protection, accountability, and deterrence remain fundamental.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 November 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The record of conviction will be forwarded forthwith to relevant authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. No costs are presently ordered.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. B2025/13459  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge W.
