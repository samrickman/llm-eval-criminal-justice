MR H  \nCase No. L2025/13547  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. T. RAVENWOOD  \nFiled: 14 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences in question were committed over a period extending from August 2023 through to February 2025, predominantly within the commercial districts of central Leeds and surrounding suburban retail parks. This court has had the advantage of reviewing a substantial evidential and procedural record, including the police investigation, prosecutorial submissions, defence representations, and expert reports relevant to your personal circumstances.\n\nProcedural History and Case Management  \nThe proceedings commenced with your arrest on 9 March 2025 following a coordinated investigation led by the West Yorkshire Police Business Crime Team, in conjunction with the Leeds Retail Crime Forum and officers assigned to the Safer Leeds Partnership. This multi-agency effort arose after a notable rise in thefts targeting multiple convenience stores, pharmacies, and charity shops, with surveillance footage, witness testimony, and electronic point-of-sale analyses revealing a consistent pattern matching your description. \n\nThe investigative phase was marked by a high degree of inter-agency collaboration, though not without challenges. For instance, the integration of body-worn camera material with fixed CCTV data required extensive cross-departmental consultation. Moreover, queries raised during disclosure preparation necessitated auxiliary examinations of financial transaction records, which further extended the timeline. Nevertheless, the prosecution adapted to these developments in a timely manner, advancing the case through the stages set out in the Criminal Procedure Rules and the Better Case Management (BCM) framework.\n\nYour first appearance at Leeds Magistrates’ Court was on 11 March 2025, where you were bailed with conditions sufficiently stringent to restrict your movement, pending the next hearing. This court notes the proactive approach taken by the prosecution in disclosure management and outlining an agreed list of witness evidence to avoid unnecessary adjournments. It is to be regretted, however, that the Legal Aid Agency posed complications regarding funding approval for your instructed defence. Applications submitted through Mr Nathan Radcliffe, instructed advocate, faced repeated administrative delays, culminating in funding authorisation only on 15 April 2025. This delay is unfortunate, particularly given the importance of timely psychiatric and social assessments in cases such as this.\n\nOn 22 April 2025, your case was transferred to the Crown Court at Leeds as part of the scheme under section 51 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013, acknowledging the seriousness and complexity of the offences alleged. The first Crown Court hearing was listed for 9 May but adjourned to accommodate the scheduling for psychiatric reports, and to allow for service of a detailed witness statement from a community liaison officer involved with the incident sites. The plea and trial preparation hearing subsequently took place on 1 June 2025, where a not guilty plea was entered. However, after the culmination of evidential disclosures and legal discourse, you entered a guilty plea on 16 September 2025, shortly before the date initially set for trial.\n\nIt is well established in sentencing jurisprudence that credit for guilty pleas must be tempered by their timing and context. As articulated in R v. Hardy [2019] EWCA Crim 327, the reduction available to late pleas is significantly smaller than for early admissions of responsibility. The Court of Appeal has held that credit should be awarded not mechanically, but on a flexible basis, having regard to genuinely acknowledged remorse and the extent to which victims and the criminal justice system are spared the strain of contested proceedings. The approach set out in the Sentencing Council's Definitive Guideline on Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea (March 2020) has been duly considered in this matter.\n\nThis court is also mindful of the observations made in R v. Elliman [2021] EWCA Crim 1461, particularly the recognition that repeated offending following prior interventions should attract enhanced scrutiny and require robust sentencing responses to ensure both deterrence and rehabilitation. Those principles are apposite in the instant case.\n\nThe Victims and Community Impact  \nThe victim impact statements filed by store proprietors and employees paint a detailed picture of the cumulative effect of your conduct. While no physical violence was perpetrated, the repeated nature of the offences — often involving the theft of essential items such as hygiene products and medicines — has fostered an atmosphere of heightened anxiety and insecurity among staff. One store manager noted having to impose more restrictive operational policies, including the reduction of opening hours and reliance on additional security personnel, with obvious attendant financial implications.\n\nI acknowledge the submissions made by Leeds Retail Support Network, a local charity providing support and advice to small businesses affected by crime. Their letter underscores the disproportionately damaging effect of thefts that, while low in individual value, aggregate to significant losses threatening business viability. This group also highlights the broader community ramifications — including diminished public confidence in safety and the erosion of neighbourhood commercial vitality.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThis court also heard from West Yorkshire Community Outreach, who commented on the strain imposed on voluntary sector resources, particularly with regard to efforts aimed at diversion and rehabilitation of offenders. Their correspondence referred to the increasing demands on limited funding streams, including government-supported programmes designed to redirect individuals away from offending towards stable employment and housing solutions.\n\nIt is worth reflecting, briefly and without presumption, on the challenges faced by the voluntary sector in an era of austere financial circumstances. Organisations like West Yorkshire Community Outreach provide essential bridges between statutory services and the lived realities of vulnerable populations. The capacity constraints faced by such bodies inevitably impact their ability to respond adequately to the scale of repetitive minor acquisitive offences.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nAnalysis of Offender Background and Related Factors  \nThe probation pre-sentence report, submitted on 30 September 2025 by Officer Joanna Meadows, provides a comprehensive summary of your personal history and offending pattern. At 34 years of age, you have a recorded previous history involving three convictions for shoplifting offences between 2018 and 2022, each occasionally accompanied by community resolutions and conditional discharges.\n\nThe report details a turbulent upbringing marked by family disruption, intermittent periods of homelessness, and exposure to substance misuse within your immediate environment. Despite these adversities, the report highlights an inconsistent engagement with available community supports and programmes. The probation officer observes that while you express awareness of the consequences of your actions, your motivation to alter behaviour appears fragile and intermittent.\n\nThe Mental Health Court Liaison Team report, compiled by Dr Elaine Prescott, consultant forensic psychiatrist, offers a nuanced perspective on your mental state. The report affirms the absence of any diagnosable psychotic disorder or severe enduring mental illness but describes traits consistent with borderline personality characteristics, including affective instability, impulsivity, and difficulties with interpersonal relationships. The report recommends consideration of a structured therapeutic intervention, including dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), as part of any community sentence, acknowledging that such engagement is challenging but potentially beneficial.\n\nThis psychological assessment invites reflection on wider systemic pressures. Mental health provision within the National Health Service (NHS) continues to face considerable waiting times and limitations in service access, especially for services tailored to personality disorders. As such, vulnerable individuals such as yourself may find themselves navigating a fragmented system where timely help is elusive — a factor that this court must weigh alongside personal accountability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nIt would be remiss not to mention the increasing demands placed upon the Probation Service nationally and locally, a trend that has become particularly acute in recent years. Staffing limitations, high caseloads, and operational constraints inhibit the degree of supervision and support that may be provided to individuals presenting with complex psychosocial needs. In the present case, the supervising officer has noted these difficulties, emphasising the importance of coordination between probation, mental health services, and community agencies.\n\nSimilarly, the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative machinery has, regrettably, amplified procedural complexity in this case. Requests for funding to enable expert assessments and ancillary reports encountered notable delays despite repeated insistence from the defence team. These delays not only obstructed timely justice but imposed unwarranted strain on all parties involved.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nRelevant Case Law and Sentencing Framework  \nThe Theft Act 1968 remains the cornerstone legislative instrument for offences of this nature. Section 1 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. The breadth of the statute encompasses a wide variety of behaviours, varying in severity and impact.\n\nThe Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline, last revised in April 2023, concentrates on factors such as the value of goods taken, the sophistication and planning of the offending, the level of culpability, and the impact on victims. Aggravating and mitigating factors are carefully weighed, including any prior history, the presence of any threats or violence, and whether the offender has sought to make reparation.\n\nIn R v. Sanderson [2024] EWCA Crim 2081, the Court upheld a custodial sentence for an offender with multiple prior convictions for shop theft, whose conduct was characterised as both deliberate and intrusive, involving repeated returns to the same premises to avoid detection. The case underlined the importance of distinguishing between opportunistic and systematic offending.\n\nBy contrast, the judgment in R v. Jennings [2022] EWCA Crim 1037 elucidated the circumstances in which community sentences with rehabilitation requirements were deemed appropriate, particularly where the offender’s background demonstrated a clear response to intervention efforts and where custodial sentences would likely exacerbate vulnerabilities.\n\nIt is against that backdrop that this court must evaluate all material factors to determine the appropriate custodial threshold and, if applicable, the length and conditions of any sentence. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe Court’s Considerations on the Conduct and Surrounding Context  \nTurning to the details of your offending, it must be acknowledged that the shoplifting incidents were characterised by a methodical approach, often involving concealment of items within everyday clothing and the use of distraction techniques. The choice of shops—primarily smaller outlets where staffing levels were limited or where staff were known to be vulnerable—indicates a degree of predation and calculated intent.\n\nThe protracted nature of your conduct, as well as the failure to desist despite prior warnings and community redirection, is troubling. No evidence suggests coercion or the involvement of organised criminal networks; rather, this pattern points toward an entrenched offending habit, underpinned by limited insight and failed engagement with support.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nThe cumulative effect on shopkeepers has been considerable. Beyond the immediate financial losses, there has been a ripple effect manifesting in staff absenteeism, increased operating costs, and apprehension that has spilled over into community perception of safety. While these offences may not attract headlines or sensational reporting, their consequences are enduring and felt in tangible ways.\n\nParallel to these considerations is the broader social picture. Mr H, one cannot ignore the increasing levels of street homelessness within Leeds, the strain on mental health provision, and austerity-driven reductions in social support programmes. These are real issues that shape the environment in which individuals make choices, albeit not absolving responsibility.\n\nAnalogous to the observations made in R v. Hedges [2023] EWCA Crim 1487, where the court emphasised the necessity of balancing the offender’s personal circumstances with public protection imperatives, this court is mindful that sentencing must serve both rehabilitative aims and the deterrence of further offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nFurther Observations and Institutional Context  \nIt is appropriate to document the court’s appreciation for the efforts of various public and voluntary bodies involved in this case. The Leeds Retail Crime Forum, despite resource constraints and rising caseloads, has been exemplary in collating incident reports and facilitating communication with police and justice agencies.\n\nSimilarly, the input of the Mental Health Liaison Team, under Dr Prescott’s stewardship, has provided invaluable insight into the mitigating factors influencing your conduct. Their commitment to operating within stretched NHS budgets and navigating systemic waiting lists deserves commendation.\n\nConversely, the court notes with dismay the systemic difficulties encountered in securing timely Legal Aid funding for expert evaluation. Such procedural barriers compromise not only the fairness towards defendants but also the operational efficacy of the court.\n\nThe judiciary also recognises routine frustrations arising from the increasing demands on the Probation Service and the challenges of multi-agency working. The complex interface between criminal justice, social welfare, and public health continues to test institutional capacities and necessitates ongoing cross-sector innovation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nClosing Remarks and Directions  \nIn summary, the offences you have committed represent a sustained breach of the legal and ethical norms underpinning property and community life. While your personal circumstances and mental health considerations invite some caution against precipitous custodial judgment, the persistence of your offending and its adverse impact counsel strongly for a decisive response.\n\nI shall therefore direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared with urgency, taking particular account of your mental health needs and engagement prospects. This report should also inquire into the suitability of a community order incorporating accredited cognitive behavioural programmes aimed at addressing impulsivity and acquisitive offending, as well as the feasibility of supervision with an emphasis on fostering stable accommodation and employment pathways.\n\nYour counsel and the probation service are requested to liaise to expedite this reporting process. It is this court’s intention to return to sentence promptly upon the receipt of these materials.\n\nThis hearing has been conducted with full respect to the provisions of open justice. I note the attendance of Ms Eleanor Poole for the Crown and Mr Nathan Radcliffe for the defence. The court appreciates their professional conduct throughout what has been a protracted process.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this 14th day of October 2025 in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Leeds. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is informed of the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEEDS  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. L2025/13547  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. T.
