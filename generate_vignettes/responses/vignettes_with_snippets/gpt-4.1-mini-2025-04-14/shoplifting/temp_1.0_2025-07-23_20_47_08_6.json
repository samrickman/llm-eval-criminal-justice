MR H  \nCase No. T2025/13157  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. L. Godfrey  \nFiled: 14 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in connection with a charge of theft from retail premises, dated 18 June 2025, under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct in question, as detailed in the indictment and not disputed here, involves a course of shoplifting incidents spanning approximately one year and encompassing multiple shops within the Winchester and Eastleigh boroughs.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour journey through the criminal justice system in this matter has been subject to several procedural events of note. You were arrested on 12 July 2025 following an investigation led by the Hampshire Constabulary, supplemented by officers attached to the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP). The investigation was notable for its multi-agency nature, involving coordination with store security teams from various high street retailers, local council licensing officers, and the Safer Neighbourhoods Team. The multi-agency framework, while intended to enhance efficiency, inevitably involves a degree of complexity in communication and record-keeping. This case illustrates both the advantages and shortcomings of such collaboration.  \n\nOn 15 July 2025, you were formally charged with the offence, following an extensive review of dozens of hours of CCTV footage, inventory audits, and witness statements. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) authorised charging after considering evidential sufficiency and the public interest. You initially entered a plea of not guilty at the first hearing on 29 July 2025. Subsequently, after exchange of further evidence and pre-trial preparations, you amended your plea to guilty at the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing (PTPH) held on 2 September 2025.\n\nAt various points, the case was adjourned to facilitate the preparation of expert reports and to allow for the instruction of psychiatric evaluation, all of which conform with the principles enshrined in the Criminal Procedure Rules and the Better Case Management (BCM) framework recently regarded as crucial in streamlining Crown Court activity. These adjournments, though delaying final resolution, were necessitated by administrative bottlenecks within the Legal Aid Agency and the competing demands placed upon local mental health services.\n\nThe court must also note, with some regret, that these procedural delays are emblematic of a wider systemic challenge affecting the effective and timely administration of justice in cases of this nature. The routine difficulties of securing expert reports in acquisitive crime cases, particularly in areas facing staff shortages and funding cuts, have been recorded elsewhere and remain a cause for concern.  \n\nIt is also pertinent to acknowledge the role played by the Winchester Retail Support Group, a coalition of affected shopkeepers who provided victim impact statements. The statements eloquently describe the cumulative harm inflicted by repeated thefts, including loss of stock, increased insurance premiums, and emotional distress among staff—often compounded by under-resourcing and the pressures of managing busy retail environments. Such repercussions cannot be overlooked in assessing the gravity of offences that may appear minor when viewed individually but catastrophic in aggregate.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe court has received several letters addressed to it on your behalf—some emanating from voluntary sector agencies engaged in welfare provision in the Hampshire area, including the Winchester Homeless Action Group (WHAG) and the Hampshire Financial Inclusion Service. These letters commend your efforts to attend appointments and express hope for your successful engagement with support mechanisms. However, they also convey the acute challenges posed by an overstretched system. Long waits for mental health counselling, delays in benefit assessments, and limited emergency accommodation options serve to illustrate the precarious social conditions that may form part of the background to your conduct, though they do not excuse it.\n\nThe defendant's barrister has placed before the court a psychiatric report authored by Dr Amira Khalil, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 1 September 2025. Dr Khalil’s report is detailed and professionally composed, noting traits consistent with impulse control difficulties and mild depressive symptoms but no formal diagnosis of major mental illness. Interestingly, the report also offers an observation on your capacity to engage constructively with rehabilitative programmes, should such be recommended. It suggests that, absent external pressures, sustained compliance may be fragile—an assessment which this court will factor into its overall considerations.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe findings in Dr Khalil’s report are neither novel nor isolated. Studies, such as the one referenced by the Department of Health in its 2023 review of mental health service provision, indicate a notable prevalence of comorbid factors in individuals convicted of shoplifting offences, including socio-economic deprivation, substance misuse, and untreated psychological conditions. Such complexities underpin the challenges faced by community justice and health providers alike.\n\nNotwithstanding the clinical observations, it remains fundamental that responsibility for criminal behaviour rests with the individual. This principle is deeply embedded in jurisprudence, including past appellate decisions emphasising the primacy of culpability notwithstanding mitigating circumstances. The case of R v. Albritton [2020] EWCA Crim 1267 underscored that “psychological difficulties may inform sentencing but do not absolve the defendant from liability where intent and knowledge are established.” The court finds that Mr H’s actions fit within this paradigm.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe Crown has advanced a comprehensive outline of the aggravating factors in this matter, notably the repeated, calculated nature of the offending, the targeting of vulnerable and small independent retailers, and previous interventions that failed to deter recidivism. The Prosecution points to the absence of expressed remorse prior to the late plea and the ongoing disruption caused to businesses within the local economy. The Crown's submissions cite the Sentencing Council's Theft guideline (effective from 1 February 2023), emphasising increased culpability for persistent offending, especially where there is evidence of premeditation and use of evasion techniques.\n\nSeveral precedents were cited, including R v. Meadows [2021] EWCA Crim 1543, where the Court of Appeal upheld an immediate custodial sentence for a defendant who had engaged in similarly persistent shop theft across multiple retail outlets. Despite the low monetary value of individual thefts, the court acknowledged the profound emotional and operational impact on victims and supported sentencing that reflected community deterrence. The court issues a cautious reminder that sentencing guidelines serve as a framework rather than a rigid rulebook—the judge must retain discretion to respond to the facts of the case.\n\nThe sentencing framework is also informed by the decision in R v. Pearson [2019] EWCA Crim 802, which stressed the importance of proportionality. There, the court warned against overreliance on custodial approaches where community sentences coupled with rehabilitative measures may suffice. The current case lies, arguably, in a middle ground: serious enough to merit significant punishment but with scope for structured treatment and supervision.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nDuring the course of proceedings, defence counsel has noted the challenges faced in securing access to housing and employment. The defendant resides in temporary accommodation arranged by Hampshire County Council, a transitional placement following eviction from private rented accommodation due to rental arrears. Social services have documented your housing instability over the past 18 months, and correspondence from the housing caseworker describes how this instability has previously precipitated periods of truancy and unstructured behaviour. The housing officer’s file indicates a multi-agency team meeting scheduled for October 2025, aiming to address ongoing needs.\n\nIn this jurisdiction, the court must be conscious of the burden placed on a stretched public housing system. The broader socio-economic context—the rapidly escalating cost of living, reductions in national housing benefit subsidies, and local shortages of affordable stock—have combined to generate increased rates of street homelessness. These trends, while only tenuously connected to the specifics of your offending, form a backdrop that must be acknowledged.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nWhile the statutory sentencing regime provides the legal standards by which conduct is assessed, this court also reflects on the strain endured by healthcare and social services tasked with managing complex caseloads. The National Health Service continues to face unprecedented demand, with psychiatric outpatient waiting lists now surpassing 18 months in some areas of Hampshire. The implications of this are profound: individuals whose underlying difficulties remain inadequately addressed face heightened barriers to desistance.\n\nYour case highlights the consequential impact of these systemic shortcomings. The probation service report, provided on 9 September 2025, notes the engagement difficulties experienced by your allocated supervising officer, citing missed appointments attributed to your transient living arrangement and fluctuating access to mobile communication.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nAmong the material submitted by the defence is a statement from your sister, Ms Theresa H, who outlines your difficult childhood environment, which included episodes of parental neglect and exposure to substance misuse. While such personal histories are not determinative, they provide additional nuance to the court's understanding of character.\n\nThe probation officer’s assessment situates these biographical elements within a wider pattern of early life adversity, eventually manifesting in antisocial behaviour during adolescence and a trajectory that culminated in repeated criminal justice contact for acquisitive offences.\n\nIn line with the principle of joint agency responsibility, the court notes efforts made by local charitable organisations, including “Pathways to Hope” and “Future Steps”, who aim to facilitate re-integration through educational and vocational training. Their written contributions commend your occasionally proactive engagement but lament interruptions caused by chaotic lifestyle factors.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nThe financial impact on the community, while not always immediately visible, is real. Retailers have documented increased shrinkage and have voiced concerns about staff safety—an issue particularly acute in smaller, family-run shops with limited security infrastructure. The economic consequences ripple outwards, discouraging investment, reducing employment, and often disadvantaging the most vulnerable sections of society.\n\nMoreover, repeated offences of this nature may contribute to the normalization of dishonest conduct—thereby eroding social trust. While no direct violence or intimidation was involved in your conduct, the atmosphere of threat and discomfort experienced by shop staff is a significant factor in assessing harm. Victim personal statements, submitted under confidentiality, attest to increased anxiety and impaired sense of personal security.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe court records that you have a criminal record comprising four prior convictions for similar offences, including an admonition in 2018, a conditional discharge in 2020, and two community orders in 2021 and 2023 respectively. These measures included unpaid work and attendance at accredited educational programmes aimed at offending-related behaviour. Unfortunately, none achieved enduring compliance.\n\nThe principle of escalation in sentencing is relevant here: repeated breaches of community orders and persistent reoffending denote a degree of intractability warranting a firm response proportionate to the public interest in deterrence and protection.\n\nSeveral cases reinforce these principles. For example, in R v. Kilner [2018] EWCA Crim 1345, a defendant with a similar profile received an immediate custodial sentence following multiple breaches and continuing theft offences, despite community interventions.\n\nThe court is mindful, however, that custodial sentences carry inherent risks of destabilisation—particularly when incarceration extends periods of homelessness and reduces access to tailored support services. Custody should not be the first resort but reserved for cases where other measures have demonstrably failed or where the culpability and harm so dictate.\n\nIn addition, the co-defendant in a related charge was found to have committed an unrelated offence of affray following a pub brawl earlier this year. This conduct bears no relation to Mr H’s own behaviour and should not influence sentencing considerations.\n\nThe court also notes an unrelated breach of noise abatement orders issued against the landlord of your previous accommodation in Eastleigh. No evidence links you directly to that matter, but such peripheral issues often complicate social welfare assessments.  \n\nThe Legal Aid Application processes in this matter were protracted. The defence’s initial request to commission a psychiatric report met with delayed responses, resulting in a four-week adjournment. The court expresses displeasure at these delays, which are regrettably now a recurring theme in Crown Court proceedings. It is hoped reform initiatives underway within the Legal Aid Agency will address these inefficiencies.\n\nSentencing Considerations  \nThe offences before this court represent a persistent pattern of deliberate shop thefts, accompanied by prior unsuccessful community-based interventions and characterised by minimal engagement with offered social and health support services.\n\nThe late plea of guilty is recognised but must be balanced against the costs of delay and the impact on victims.\n\nThere are mitigating factors: your personal circumstances of housing instability, mental health concerns as outlined by Dr Khalil, and your reported efforts to engage with voluntary agencies. These weigh in favour of a sentence with rehabilitative potential, rather than immediate custody absent further exploration.\n\nNonetheless, the public interest demands a punitive element that reflects the seriousness of repeated theft offences and the necessity of deterrence.\n\nThe court will therefore await receipt of an updated pre-sentence report. This report is to include a full Risk of Harm assessment, compliance history, and recommendations for community-based interventions, including possible Mental Health Treatment Requirements or Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSP), as appropriate.\n\nIn the meantime, you will remain on bail pending sentencing.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at Winchester Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal conviction and sentence pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, with a time limit of 28 days from the date of formal sentence. No reporting restrictions apply under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINCHESTER  \nR v.
