MR H  \nCase No. R2025/14897  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. ALDRIDGE  \nFiled: 14 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for a course of conduct involving shoplifting from various retail establishments in and around Riverdale and adjoining boroughs, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The period under consideration extends from late 2023 through to the early months of 2025, reflecting a sustained and persistent series of thefts targeting multiple small enterprises, notably including convenience stores, independent pharmacies, and newsagents.\n\nProcedural Overview  \nThe case unfolded over numerous procedural stages, beginning with your arrest on 9 April 2025. This followed an investigation launched by the Riverdale Business Crime Reduction Unit, which had collated intelligence from local retailers reporting repeated incidents tied to your description and movements. The complex nature of these matters cannot be overstated. Retail theft investigations demand significant resource allocation despite the comparatively low individual monetary values involved. The system is layered with complexities that span evidential requirements, witness management, and multi-agency communication — all undertaken against the backdrop of stretched police capacity and constrained financial budgets.\n\nDuring the preparatory phase, there were multiple requests for the disclosure of further CCTV footage from different premises, given the often partial or incomplete nature of initial recordings. Correspondence between the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), local police teams, and business representatives involved voluminous exchanges, reflecting the intricate nature of evidence gathering in such cases. The case management hearings were conducted in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, with the relevant case progression milestones observed as reasonably as circumstances permitted. While there were brief adjournments attributable to listing pressures and the unavailability of expert witnesses, these were resolved promptly to avoid undue delay.\n\nThe court notes that the Riverdale Business Crime Reduction Unit coordinated efforts admirably, liaising effectively with the Safer Neighbourhoods Team who contributed valuable community impact information. The Police Digital Forensics Unit, swamped nationally with burgeoning caseloads, nonetheless managed to process relevant mobile and forensic evidence expeditiously. This represents a minor procedural success in a domain frequently hampered by backlogs and resource scarcity.\n\nMental health provision within the locale remains under extreme pressure. Referrals to community psychiatric teams often endure waiting lists extending to three months or longer and crisis support services report being overwhelmed by demand — a systemic challenge that has no easy solution. In this context, requests for clinical assessments undertaken in your case were facilitated as swiftly as practicable, though necessarily involving coordination across healthcare and justice sectors.\n\nYour initial representation was secured under a Legal Aid order, with Mr David Connors instructed as your defence counsel. I record the court’s thanks to Mr Connors for his professional diligence throughout. However, it must be acknowledged that the Legal Aid Agency’s bureaucracy occasionally imposed procedural obstacles, notably delaying approval for the instruction of an independent forensic psychiatrist. Such administrative inertia is regrettable and should be cause for concern among policymakers tasked with safeguarding timely access to justice.\n\nThe matter was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 5 August 2025, at which you maintained a plea of not guilty. Subsequent disclosure included an expanded suite of video evidence, witness statements, and a detailed chronology compiled by the CPS. Shortly before the trial window opened on 12 September, you entered a plea of guilty, which was accepted. The court reminds itself of the guidance in R v McCrory [2022] EWCA Crim 1981, which underscores that credit for a guilty plea depends fundamentally upon the timing of the admission. The Crown is entitled to a degree of credit reflective of efficiency and sincere acceptance of responsibility; pleas entered late afford less mitigation.\n\nI also note, albeit with limited relevance here, the foundational observations in R v Dixon [2019] EWCA Crim 1442 concerning offences of acquisitive crime, where the Court of Appeal drew attention to the cumulative psychological effect on victims and the broader community beyond mere pecuniary loss. Whilst Dixon involved a different factual matrix, the principles bear upon the gravity attributed to persistent dishonesty in retail environments.\n\nIt is appropriate, in this context, to draw on older precedents, such as R v Thorpe [1983] 79 Cr App R 12, which remains cited as an authority on the sentencing of repeated theft offences. Mr Thorpe’s case illustrated the necessity of proportionality in sentencing, balancing the public interest in deterrence against the individual circumstances of offenders. The intervening decades have seen significant legislative evolutions, but the core principles of personal responsibility and sentencing calibration endure.\n\nRecent local experience includes a conviction in Riverdale Crown Court concerning aggravated fly-tipping on protected green belt land (R v Evans, unreported, January 2025), and an unrelated matter involving criminal damage to a historic church noticeboard, which although factually inapposite has placed additional administrative strain on the local clerical services. These background pressures contextualise the present case but do not bear on culpability.\n\nContributory societal observations are also pertinent. The long-term erosion of social trust and public confidence in the efficacy of community institutions has arguably contributed to an environment where petty acquisitive crime is more visible. The conspicuous lack of media interest in cases such as this underscores a societal ambivalence towards non-violent offences that, cumulatively, erode public order and economic vitality.\n\nThe case before me was scheduled for sentence following the preparation of a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric evaluation, both of which were commissioned in timely fashion. I express gratitude to Probation Officer Ms Hannah Sterling and Consultant Psychiatrist Dr Liam Gore, whose reports are comprehensive and have been of assistance in assessing both culpability and mitigating factors.\n\nIt is worth acknowledging the work of the Riverdale Retailers’ Support Group, a voluntary organisation forged from the collaboration of local shopkeepers, charities, and community ambassadors. Their efforts to provide victim support and rehabilitative referrals, despite severely constrained funding, represent an essential component of the local crime reduction strategy.\n\nThe court also notes the multiplicity of overlapping jurisdictional frameworks implicated in such matters. The Better Case Management (BCM) protocols, intended to streamline case progression, intersect with multi-agency risk assessment conferences (MARACs) and, in appropriate cases, statutory safeguarding arrangements. While this is primarily a matter of low-level acquisitive offending, the inter-agency burden is appreciable.\n\nThe court is, however, mindful that the forensic burdens placed upon the police Digital Forensic Analysis Unit (DFAU) have escalated precipitously in recent years. The volume of investigations with digital evidential elements far outstrips capacity, often resulting in prioritisation of more serious crimes. That your case was afforded such resources is reflective of a commendable, albeit limited, allocation decision.\n\nWith this context in mind, I turn now to the facts of the offending:\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe pattern of repeated targeting indicated a familiarity with store layouts and routines, suggestive of premeditation rather than opportunism. Nevertheless, your defence asserted at an early stage that financial hardship and housing insecurity contributed significantly to your conduct — assertions supported, in part, by letters submitted from the Homelessness Intervention Project and from your sister, Ms Rochelle Hammond.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThis defence position was supplemented by psychiatric evidence from Dr Gore, whose comprehensive report noted your presentation with symptoms consistent with an adjustment disorder and mild depressive episodes. Nevertheless, the consultant concluded that these mental health challenges did not absolve criminal responsibility, though they might afford some mitigation by way of personal circumstances.\n\nExtensive information was available on your family background, with documented history of domestic instability and periods spent in local authority care during adolescence. Such histories are increasingly recognised as risk factors for criminal conduct but do not diminish culpability.\n\nThe court has had regard to the extensive statutory sentencing framework. Theft offences attract a sentencing guideline which emphasises factors such as value, planning, previous convictions, and the impact on victims. The particular features of repeat offending, breach of prior disposals, and the cumulative psychological distress to retail staff and proprietors are cited as aggravating features.\n\nThe relevance of rehabilitation is paramount. The Probation Service has noted your inconsistent engagement with support services, including non-attendance at scheduled appointments with a debt advice charity and sporadic participation in alcohol harm reduction clinics. Non-compliance in these respects is unfortunate and militates against a wholly non-custodial outcome.\n\nThe pre-sentence report recommends consideration of a community order with requirements for unpaid work and attendance at cognitive behavioural therapy sessions, albeit noting the risk of non-engagement. It also highlights the lack of any current stable residence, further complicating risk management and intervention strategies.\n\nYour previous record comprises four convictions for theft-related offences, including one breach of a community order issued in 2023. That order was revoked after failures to comply with its conditions, including attendance at an anger management course and curfew restrictions.\n\nThe court also wishes to record that the victim impact statements received describe not only financial loss but also a profound sense of discomfort and fear among staff, several of whom reported altering their work patterns and experiencing stress-related health effects. This community dimension cannot be underestimated.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nHaving considered these particulars, it is clear that your conduct falls within a serious category of offending, distinguished by repetition, planning, and disregard for prior warnings. The Crown rightly emphasises that the repeated offences caused tangible disruption to the operation of small businesses, often staffed by vulnerable individuals.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nThe importance of deterrence looms large. While you are not being sentenced for any offences of violence or threats, the cumulative damage wrought from repeated shoplifting contributes to a climate of unease and economic uncertainty.\n\nThe court is conscious of your attempts, reflected in correspondence submitted on your behalf by ShelterHands, to access support services including housing, budgeting, and mental health assistance. Those efforts, while commendable in aspiration, have not been matched by sustained engagement.\n\nThe sentencing framework to be applied is that laid out in the Definitive Guideline on Theft (Re-offending), published by the Sentencing Council. The guideline advocates for a custodial sentence where offending is persistent and previous community-based interventions have failed.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe primary purpose of sentence in this context includes punishment, deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation. It must, therefore, be calibrated to penalise serious culpability while recognizing any mitigating factors revealed by assessments.\n\nThe court is aware of the strain placed on public services by cases such as this. Police resources dedicated to repeated shoplifting reduce capacity for more serious matters, and probation services managing complex individuals are severely stretched.\n\nIt is notable that the defendant’s cohabitant, while not implicated, is presently subject to unrelated criminal proceedings for benefit fraud — a fact arising in ancillary correspondence but irrelevant to sentencing.\n\nSimilarly, a colleague of yours was subject to a recent prosecution for possession of a bladed article in a school car park, a matter unconnected to your case save for social proximity.\n\nThe defendant’s landlord has previously been subject to a noise abatement notice, again peripheral to proceedings here but reflective of broader neighbourhood challenges.\n\nThe court also notes that this case was delayed briefly due to the unavailability of judicial officers when outstanding reports coincided with scheduled strike action within the judiciary. Fortunately, listing constraints resolved this issue without undue prejudice.\n\nElapsed time since arrest has been approximately six months, during which you have remained on conditional bail. Your compliance with reporting requirements has been satisfactory and is recognised positively.\n\nIn sum, you are an individual who has engaged in a sustained pattern of criminal behaviour, unmitigated by meaningful engagement with support services, and with a significant prior history indicating a high risk of reoffending.\n\nSentencing will follow the receipt of a finalised pre-sentence report to inform an appropriate determinate disposal. The court will consider all available options, including community rehabilitation orders with work requirements, or custodial detention of such length as is proportionate given the offending pattern.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Riverdale. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be sent to the relevant authorities in due course. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days as provided by the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Unless otherwise ordered, no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT RIVERDALE  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. R2025/14897  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J.
