MR H  \nCase No. 2025/MN/45321  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. ALDRIDGE  \nFiled: 14 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in relation to an offence involving shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The matter before this court arises from events occurring between December 2023 and May 2025, situated primarily across the city of Manchester and adjoining metropolitan boroughs.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour arrest took place on 7 May 2025, following an investigative effort involving numerous branches of Greater Manchester Police, supported by cooperation from the Greater Manchester Retail Crime Reduction Board and liaison with local business owners. The multi-agency approach included analysis of CCTV footage, interviews with witnesses, and forensic examination of seized property. This case entered this Crown Court pursuant to the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, designed to encourage early resolution of cases and avoid unnecessary delay.\n\nThe BCM framework aims to ensure timely exchanges of evidence, early indication of pleas, and reduction of avoidable hearings. In this instance, initial listing was on 25 June 2025 for a plea and trial preparation hearing. The case was subsequently adjourned to afford the defence sufficient time to consider medical reports obtained from Dr Sarah Elmwood, consultant forensic psychologist, who provided an assessment focused on your mental health status and risk profile. The court thanks Dr Elmwood for her detailed and professionally prepared report, which is noted but does not alter the primary factual considerations.\n\nThe Crown has been represented at all hearings by Ms Jane Cartwright, whose professionalism has contributed positively to case progression. You have been represented throughout by Mr Thomas Kelsey, who was assigned by the Legal Aid Agency under the representation order dated 1 July 2025. It is incumbent upon this court to acknowledge the regrettable and persistent delays experienced in obtaining authority for expert instruction pursuant to that order—a matter of no small frustration to all concerned.\n\nIt is notable that the Legal Aid Agency, in its role providing funding for legal representation, has demonstrated systemic failings in timely authorisation of expert reports and ancillary services. In this case, the delay of more than five weeks in approving funding for the psychological assessment represents a degree of procedural inertia unworthy of the system. Such delays not only place strain on court resources but can adversely affect a defendant’s ability to prepare an effective case or mitigation. This court formally records this concern and trusts it will be addressed in appropriate policy forums.\n\nIt is important to note that, of the many cases involving theft that appear in this court, those which involve repeat offending against small independent retailers pose particular challenges for law enforcement bodies. The Greater Manchester Business Crime Partnership has reported an increase of approximately 24% in shop theft over the past two years, disproportionately affecting family-run outlets and community pharmacies. This trend is compounded by ongoing resource pressures within the police service, including reductions in front-line personnel and the demands of counter-terrorism and serious organised crime investigations.\n\nOne must also reflect on the wider social backdrop in which this offending took place. The recent years have been marked by socio-economic volatility affecting many residents of Greater Manchester. Housing insecurity, periods of unemployment, and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have created circumstances of hardship and uncertainty. Against this milieu, it cannot be overlooked that opportunistic acquisitive crime risks becoming normalised—a development deleterious to community cohesion and public confidence in the rule of law.\n\nNevertheless, while socio-economic context may provide some explanation, it does not diminish legal accountability. Nor can it serve to excuse repeated breaches of the criminal statute. The courts, as custodians of justice and arbiters of public protection, must balance compassion with the imperative of deterrence.\n\nAt the plea and trial preparation hearing on 25 June, you initially entered a not guilty plea. That plea was maintained until evidence including enhanced video analytics, link analysis of multiple shop incidents, and the results of property tracing convinced your legal team to revise instructions. On the morning of the trial window, scheduled for late September, a plea of guilty was entered. Counsel for the defence urged the court to afford due credit for this plea, despite the lateness, citing the considerable preparation time saved and your eventual cooperation with the prosecution.\n\nRelevant case law makes clear that credit for guilty pleas depends not only on the mere fact of admission but on the timing and manner of the plea. In R v. Wentworth [2023] EWCA Crim 998, the Court of Appeal reiterated that a plea entered immediately upon charge might attract up to 33% discount, whereas a plea only entered at the cusp of trial—particularly when tactical or prompted by overwhelming evidence—may receive substantially less. This principle aligns with long-established jurisprudence, including R v. Mears [2020] EWCA Crim 1123 and R v. Bailey [2022] EWCA Crim 1587.\n\nThe Crown has submitted that, given the history of prior offences similar in nature, a custodial sentence is appropriate and that evidence of failure to engage with community support services militates against a purely rehabilitative approach. Defence counsel has emphasised mitigating factors including familial instability, a recent report prepared by Dr Elmwood documenting mild depressive symptoms, and acknowledgement of wrongdoing.\n\nIt is useful to recall, without necessary implication, the penal consequences of related offences cited by appellate courts impacting sentencing principles in other domains. For example, in R v. Chambon [2019] EWCA Crim 735, the defendant committed aggravated burglary with assault, resulting in custodial sentences upheld at appeal; irrelevant to your matter, this nonetheless shows the court’s regard for deliberate breaches of personal security and property rights.\n\nFurther, in R v. Options Group Ltd [2018] EWCA Crim 411, a corporate entity was sanctioned heavily for environmental offences involving fly-tipping on green belt land—a matter distant in factual matrix from your offending but illustrative of the courts’ firm stance on cumulative harm.\n\nTurning to the factual basis of the offence for which you have pleaded guilty, the Crown’s evidence indicates that you engaged in a series of appropriation acts involving retail merchandise from multiple independent outlets, notably pharmacies and small supermarkets. These incidents were characterised by concealment tactics, including the use of bags and clothing to obscure items, and at times, the deployment of distraction techniques versus retail staff.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\nThis behaviour was neither spontaneous nor incidental. It bears the hallmarks of premeditation and persistence. I note, for context, that the local authority housing department, while not responsible for your accommodation, has documented consistently high demand and scarcity of affordable housing, indirectly framing the environment in which some offenders operate. That said, there is no evidence that housing conditions caused or justified your actions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nAn illustrative example recorded by police includes an incident in which you were observed removing security tags from personal care items under a curtain of deliberate verbal distraction directed at staff. Staff working that day expressed anxiety and later requested changes to shifts to avoid lone working—underscoring the psychological toll of the offending beyond immediate monetary loss.\n\nIt should be noted, parenthetically, that throughout the jurisdiction, other unrelated criminal matters have commanded court time, including a case involving possession of a bladed article in a secondary school car park—a charge unrelated to you but indicative of diverse challenges facing public safety institutions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nThe precise value of the sum total of stolen goods remains modest in monetary terms but should not be understated in its cumulative social impact. Retailers bear the burden not merely of financial loss but of increased insurance premiums, investment in security measures, and staff turnover due to workplace stress.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nI have received, through the probation service, letters from support organisations including the Manchester Community Aid Network and Faithworks North West, commending the caseworkers involved in your supervision efforts but highlighting difficulties in fostering meaningful engagement owing to intermittent cooperation.\n\nThe probation service reports ongoing capacity difficulties, with caseloads per officer exceeding national averages, limiting the depth of individual intervention possible. This systemic problem undoubtedly hampers rehabilitation prospects but is not the responsibility of this court.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\nThe report states that you have not engaged sufficiently with available addiction services, despite longstanding concerns about episodic misuse of licit substances, which may impair judgment and exacerbate impulsivity.\n\nTurning away briefly to note that your case coincided with an increase in operational demands on Greater Manchester Police due to unrelated incidents of affray outside licensed premises in the city centre, and with several unrelated devices found to contain child exploitation material during warrants executed upon associates—not matters concerning you, but again indicative of the broader enforcement landscape.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nIt must be emphasised that while the psychological report notes mild depressive symptoms and certain impulsivity traits, it does not diagnose a major mental disorder sufficient to mitigate culpability. The impulsivity identified by Dr Elmwood, while relevant to sentencing, must be placed in the wider context of personal agency and the rule of law.\n\nFurther, the clinical opinion cautions against over-attributing behaviour to dispositional factors and underscores the importance of structured behavioural interventions combined with social support. Absent compliance with such programmes, risks of recidivism are heightened.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nDuring appellate hearings in unrelated cases, the Court of Appeal has underscored in R v. Dennison [2022] EWCA Crim 700 the critical need for courts to distinguish between causal psycho-social distress and volitional criminal conduct. The line between social determinism and free will is not always clear, but it falls within the remit of sentencing to reflect on where that balance lies.\n\nYou are 34 years of age, with a previous record comprising three convictions for shoplifting, most recently in 2023, for which you received a conditional discharge. That prior conviction relates to offences within a different metropolitan area. A family history letter was tendered by your sister, Ms Elaine H., indicating a history of familial instability and fractured relationships, a narrative familiar to courts in similar contexts.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nI also take note of a letter from the local food bank, commending your efforts to access support but lamenting the chronic strain on such voluntary sector services arising from increased demand concurrent with reductions in grant funding.\n\nThe sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council for theft offences emphasise factors relevant here: the persistence of offending, breach of trust when engaging with community businesses, emotional impact on victims, and previous criminal record. The indications are that a community sentence with rehabilitation requirements is appropriate only if compliance is reasonably assured; otherwise, custody must be considered.\n\nIn respect of your personal circumstances, the court acknowledges the difficult social factors but must balance those against the need for deterrence—both specific to you and general in public protection terms.\n\nThe issue of credit for the late plea is considered in light of authorities, including R v. Milne [2024] EWCA Crim 2041, which advises a reduction in discount when pleas are entered at the point where a defence is untenable, rather than an early acceptance.\n\nThe offences you committed are matters of serious concern to the local business community. Shoplifting is often minimised in public discourse, yet its cumulative effect is to undermine confidence, erode social capital, and impose disproportionate costs on small retailers.\n\nI acknowledge the assistance of the court ushering and administrative staff, whose efforts in managing a markedly busy listing this month have not gone unnoticed.\n\nFurther, there is correspondence on file from the Greater Manchester Safeguarding Board noting an unrelated investigation involving a co-defendant in a different jurisdiction charged with coercive behaviour; this has no bearing on your case but was included in police intelligence reports.\n\nThe court also notes developments in digital forensics that in recent years have enhanced the ability of law enforcement to link disparate theft incidents across borough lines, though the workload remains high and resources stretched.\n\nNo application for ancillary orders such as compensation has been made at this stage, nor has the Crown sought forfeiture beyond the value of recovered goods.\n\nIn summary, your conduct demonstrates a pattern of repeated theft despite previous warnings. You have declined robust engagement with support services, despite ample opportunity. The evidence shows planning and awareness of wrongdoing.\n\nI order the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report. This report should include a full assessment of your risk of reoffending, protective factors, and suitability for community interventions such as a cognitive behavioural therapy programme and possible unpaid work requirements. The probation service is asked to explore feasibility and likelihood of engagement, with recommendations as to both community-based and custodial options.\n\nSentencing is adjourned until the formal hearing fixed for 2 December 2025, at which time the court will consider the pre-sentence report and any updated representations.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued at Manchester Crown Court, Courtroom 4, on 14 October 2025. The hearing was conducted in open court with both counsel present. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal conviction and sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs remain reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. 2025/MN/45321  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J.
