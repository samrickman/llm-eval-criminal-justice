MR H  \nCase No. M2025/03459  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. C. REDFORD  \nFiled: 21 August 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear for sentence in respect of an indictment alleging multiple counts of theft by shoplifting, in breach of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, committed over a sustained period spanning from late 2023 until your arrest earlier this year. The alleged offending has been linked to a series of retail premises within the Greater Manchester area, with some incidents reportedly occurring at night-time hours in neighbourhoods serviced by small independent retailers alongside larger commercial chains.\n\nProcedural History and Preliminary Observations  \nYour case was initially listed before the magistrates’ court on 12 February 2025, where it was sent for trial at the Crown Court pursuant to the features and alleged volume of offences contained within the schedule. This court occupies an intermediate tier within the criminal justice system, entrusted with handling indictable and triable-either-way matters of more serious standing or complexity. The Crown Prosecution Service elected to consolidate the underlying counts into a single representative charge for the purposes of trial and sentencing, a practice commonly employed in cases of repeated offending to avoid distinctly multiplicative sentencing outcomes that might otherwise be disproportionate.\n\nYour matter was assigned to Manchester Crown Court’s Wellstone building, a relatively modern facility inaugurated in 2018 and designed to accommodate a range of trial types, from jury trials to sentencing hearings, as well as combined hearings pursuant to specialist domestic violence and youth justice protocols. The courtroom fashioned for your hearing is Courtroom 5, recently refurbished to enhance digital connectivity and soundproofing — specifics which, while laudable, bear little relevance to the substance of these remarks but serve to highlight the incremental investment being made in infrastructure to maintain operational efficacy amidst ever-growing judicial demand.\n\nFollowing your initial appearance, you were remanded on bail, subject to a curfew monitoring order restricting your movement between 8pm and 6am. The conditions of bail were amended twice, on 2 March and subsequently on 14 April, to accommodate changes in your living arrangements. The delays encountered in the listing of your plea and trial preparation hearing were, regrettably, partly due to an ongoing wave of industrial action affecting court staff — particularly legal clerks and court registrars — which resulted in a temporary restriction of hearing slots during March and early April. Those pressures have imposed profound strains not only on case progression but also on the morale and wellbeing of personnel whose diligent and unheralded efforts are critical to the administration of justice.\n\nThe Better Case Management (BCM) initiative was engaged in your proceedings, enabling robust pre-trial preparation and direct liaison between prosecution and defence counsel along with case officers, with the aim of expediting disclosure, resolving evidential uncertainties, and limiting the necessity for contested hearings where possible. While the BCM process promises to streamline case handling, the practical reality remains that large volumes of material, ongoing investigations, and intermittent disclosure of digital evidence can hinder expeditious resolution.\n\nI should take this opportunity to record the court’s appreciation for the professionalism demonstrated by Detective Inspector Simone Burke of the Greater Manchester Police’s Retail Crime Unit, who has overseen the investigative phases of this matter with commendable assiduity despite well-publicised resource shortfalls and the competing demands of significant violent crime investigations in the region.\n\nIn contrast to these positives, I feel compelled to note, with some regret, the protracted delays in securing prior legal aid approval for expert reports. The initial application to instruct a forensic psychologist — designed to assess the defendant’s cognitive functioning, decision-making capacity, and potential for rehabilitation — faced repeated deferrals and requests for supplementary documentation over nearly six weeks. Such administrative hurdles underscore the ongoing challenges faced by defence practitioners attempting to secure necessary expert input within constrained funding mechanisms. The position is unsatisfactory and places procedural burdens on defendants that are ultimately detrimental to the fair and timely conduct of justice.\n\nUpon plea and trial preparation hearing, held on 30 April 2025, you entered a not guilty plea. However, this court notes with concern that your current guilty plea was entered only on the morning of trial, 17 July 2025, after extensive evidential disclosure, including comprehensive CCTV footage analysis and multiple witness statements were disclosed. This pattern of late plea, though within the defendant’s rights, undermines prospects for significant sentence reduction and carries adverse implications for the efficient use of court resources and for individuals expected to give evidence, including retail staff who suffer the consequences of these offences.\n\nThe law is clear that while credit must be given for guilty pleas, the timing of the plea is material. Consistent with the rulings in R v. Collard [2020] EWCA Crim 1350 and R v. Hamilton [2019] EWCA Crim 1827, credit is diminished where pleas are delayed until the imminence of trial and are not accompanied by genuine remorse or assistance to the court. In this regard, the court must balance the public interest in incentivising early admission of guilt against the need to ensure sentences reflect culpability and promote deterrence.\n\nFramework of Sentencing Principles  \nSection 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. The sentencing approach to theft offences is principally guided by the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2018), which sets out factors including harm, culpability, and aggravating or mitigating features.\n\nThis case engages a category of medium to high culpability due to the planning and persistence evident across multiple incidents. Aggravating factors include the targeting of vulnerable premises and the psychological effect on staff and customers. Mitigation is limited, given the late plea and your prior record.\n\nReference is further made to the appellate guidance deployed in R v. Nixon [2021] EWCA Crim 2005, which concerned theft from charitable retail outlets and emphasised custodial sentences where offences undermine community trust and the essential work of such organisations. While those facts are distinct, the principles regarding proportionate response to offences damaging community infrastructure remain pertinent.\n\nMoreover, I note the decision in R v. Ferrell [2017] EWCA Crim 1759, which observed that acquisitive offending, even where involving relatively low-value items, can warrant immediate custody where the conduct forms part of a persistently habitual pattern and where previous interventions have failed.\n\nIt is alongside this framework that I turn to the particulars of your offending, placed within the factual matrix presented.\n\nGeneral Societal and Institutional Context  \nWe live in times characterised by significant social upheaval and economic precarity. In urban centres such as Manchester, the pressures on public services, from housing support to law enforcement and mental health provision, are intense and enduring. The recent collapse of major retail chains in the region, together with rises in street-level antisocial behaviour and visible homelessness, reflect broader structural failures.\n\nIt is in this environment that shoplifting assumes a complex role — simultaneously symptomatic of social distress, personal hardship, and opportunistic crime. The court notes the observations made in the Home Office Report “Acquisitive Crime and Urban Deprivation” (2023), which highlights a correlation between economic instability and increased frequencies of retail theft.\n\nNevertheless, the judiciary must balance empathy with the imperatives of maintaining public order, safeguarding the vulnerable, and deterring those who exploit hardship as justification for unlawful gain.\n\nNotably, in R v. Lamont [2017] EWCA Crim 58, the Court of Appeal underscored that while a defendant’s socioeconomic circumstances may be considered, they do not excuse criminal behaviour, especially where persistent offending undermines community confidence.\n\nThe facts of the case are as follows:  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nIt is apparent from the evidence that your offending involved deliberate selection of high-demand items, executed with tactics designed to evade detection, including the removal or concealment of security tags and timed movements during busy periods.\n\nThe manner of approach aligns with narratives presented in a recent intelligence briefing by the North West Business Crime Reduction Steering Group, which noted a rising pattern of “layered apparel” concealment techniques deployed by serial shoplifters.\n\nCompounding these offences is the impact on retail workers, many of whom report increased stress and psychological trauma arising from repeated encounters with such incidents. Victim impact statements consensually submitted to this court attest to anxiety, need for workplace adjustments, and in some instances, formal counselling referrals requested by staff.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nDuring the course of investigations, it emerged that the defendant failed to satisfy requirements of prior community resolutions, including an engagement programme with a third-sector agency offering budgeting and employment consultancy. This pattern strongly suggests a lack of sufficient rehabilitative effort.\n\nSituational Factors and Multi-Agency Cooperation  \nThe investigation engaged various local agencies, including the Manchester Integrated Offender Management Team, which attempts to co-ordinate care and supervision of repeat acquisitive offenders. Liaison with the local authority housing teams also revealed fluctuating accommodation stability for the defendant, though not of a nature that provided legitimate grounds for repeated offending.\n\nThis case brings into sharp relief the systemic challenges posed by the limitations of existing intervention programmes. The Probation Service, for example, continues to experience unprecedented caseloads and staffing shortages, undermining its ability to deliver bespoke rehabilitative services. As Coroner’s reports and recent audits reveal, rising caseloads are attributable not only to increased referrals but also to high turnover rates.\n\nIt is further worth noting that your case shares some procedural elements with the recent case of R v. Bentley [2025] MCR 432, where a defendant was convicted of criminal damage and aggravated theft; in that case, custodial sentences were deemed necessary despite pleas in mitigation relating to mental health vulnerability.\n\nThe inclusion of complex psychiatric considerations in multimodal sentencing hearings is increasingly commonplace and presents significant demands on court timetabling and expert resources.\n\nIn the present matter, the psychiatric report composed by Dr Imran Khalid, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was submitted on 14 June 2025. The report is noted for the quality of its detail and professional insight. Dr Khalid’s assessment found no major mental illness but indicated heightened levels of anxiety, low frustration tolerance, and trait impulsivity. The substance misuse history was recorded but noted not to reach the threshold for dependency.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  \n\nThe report suggests that rehabilitation would benefit from structured cognitive-behavioural therapy and supervised engagement with social support services aimed at financial resilience and anxiety management. Unfortunately, the defendant’s engagement with prior voluntary schemes has been inconsistent.\n\nEarlier, on 25 May 2025, the court received a letter from the local charity “Urban Outreach Initiative,” which provides support to homeless and vulnerably housed persons. While the letter lent some support to the notion that Mr H had intermittent contact with their drop-in centre, it made clear the challenges faced in maintaining regular attendance or sustained participation in activities designed to enhance life stability.\n\nThis dovetails with the probation officer’s oral evidence at the sentencing review hearing of 10 August 2025, which emphasised the difficulties in establishing coherent supervision plans absent defendant cooperation.\n\nHistorical case law provides further background, notably R v. Pearce [2016] EWCA Crim 230, which emphasised that persistent disorderly or acquisitive conduct with negligible engagement in rehabilitative interventions often militates in favour of custodial penalties.\n\nThe victim impact statements derived from multiple retail outlets, including High Street Pharmacies and independent grocers, detail the financial and psychological impact of the offences. These stores reported increased shrinkage beyond immediate theft value, attributed to both stock damage and the necessity for heightened security measures — such as additional tags, staff training, and installation of CCTV systems. Such reactive measures impose significant costs, frequently absorbed by small businesses already operating on tenuous margins.\n\nSupporting third parties include the Manchester Retail Support Network, which has engaged with affected stores and offered victim liaison services. Their correspondence reflects ongoing concerns about the normalization of acquisitive crime and its corrosive effect on worker morale and community cohesion.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nSentencing Considerations and Conclusion  \nThe offences before this court constitute a course of conduct involving planning, persistence, and an evident disregard for the impact on victims and community stakeholders. While your guilty plea is formally accepted, it was delivered at the last opportunity and does not attract the full extent of mitigation.\n\nThe court has given weight to the absence of serious violence, the psychiatric assessments, and the mitigating circumstances relating to housing and financial precarity. However, these factors are insufficient to displace the need for a sentence indicative of the offender’s level of culpability and the deterrent principles that underpin public confidence in the criminal justice system.\n\nThere is a legitimate expectation that the court will punish, deter, and seek to rehabilitate when possible, delivering a sentence that reflects the balance of these aims.\n\nA pre-sentence report will be prepared by your supervising probation officer, with particular attention paid to suitability for community-based interventions that incorporate cognitive skills training, financial management support, and mental health engagement.\n\nThe court reserves final determination of sentence pending receipt and consideration of this report, alongside any further representations the defence or prosecution wish to make.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 21 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be duly transmitted to the relevant authorities. You are reminded of your right of appeal within 28 calendar days of this judgment as per the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are in place.
