MR H  \nCase No. T2025/14637  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. GRANVILLE  \nFiled: 17 August 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentence in connection with offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely retail theft, committed across multiple premises in the London Borough of Brixton and adjoining districts. The offending conduct spanned a period from November 2022 through April 2025 and involved repeated incidents of shoplifting targeting small-to-medium sized retail establishments, including but not limited to convenience stores, pharmacies, and charity outlets.\n\nProcedural History and Court Administration  \nFollowing your arrest on 15 April 2025, this case has been managed under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework intended to enhance timeliness and transparency in Crown Court cases. The procedural trajectory has involved several standard hearings: an initial appearance, a plea and trial preparation hearing, and the listing of a sentencing hearing. Throughout, efforts have been made by the prosecution and defence teams to maintain compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules and to secure an effective listing to minimise disruption to the court diary and to the public.\n\nI note with some regret the recurring challenges posed by Legal Aid administration in this jurisdiction. In particular, the defence’s early application to instruct a forensic and clinical forensic psychologist with expertise in patterns of acquisitive offending encountered protracted delay. The Legal Aid Agency’s response was slow and inconsistent, leading to an unnecessary postponement of the expert’s involvement and the subsequent adjournment of this matter in late June 2025. These deferrals have placed additional burdens upon all parties, and, importantly, have delayed the process of addressing your circumstances fully and fairly.\n\nThe BCM process is nowadays seen as an essential mechanism to identify evidential issues at an early stage, to facilitate disclosure, and to avoid unnecessary hearing adjournments. It is a framework for recognising that even relatively low-value theft offences can place considerable strain on the criminal justice system and that an efficient pathway is beneficial to all stakeholders. Here, the parties have endeavoured to uphold the spirit and letter of the BCM provisions, with the Crown providing timely disclosure and the defence engaging to the extent possible given resource constraints.\n\nA plea hearing held on 3 May 2025 saw you enter a not guilty plea. Subsequently, however, following the disclosure of additional CCTV evidence, statements from store management, and the inclusion of forensic analysis, a late guilty plea was tendered on 11 August 2025. This late plea, while accepted, attracts less credit than an early one and demonstrates the type of tactical timing frequently seen in this category of case.\n\nIt is worth observing, as other courts have done, that delayed pleas frustrate the goal of securing procedural economy and can add considerably to the anxiety suffered by witnesses, many of whom are employees on minimal pay and with limited job security. This court does not discount the propriety of exercising one’s right to trial; however, it does maintain a firm view on the consequences of plea timing, as reflected in R v. Hamlyn [2019] EWCA Crim 354, where the Court of Appeal emphasized that “the timing of the plea, in respect of the nature of the evidence assembled, affects the discount due, not the mere fact of the plea.”\n\nThe unfortunate reality—one this court contends with frequently—is the persistent tension between efficient case progression and procedural safeguards designed to protect the rights of defendants. Your case is emblematic in this regard, with no shortage of procedural activity that might strike an observer as complex given the relatively modest financial value of the items involved.\n\nThe court further appreciates the role of the Brixton Business Crime Partnership and the Metropolitan Police Dedicated Shoplifting Team, whose input in collating evidence and victim impact has been noteworthy. I acknowledge their efforts in collating statements and liaising with affected retailers. The social and economic impact on these often independently run businesses must not be underestimated, even when offences appear, on the surface, trifling.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nConsideration of Legal Context and Relevant Authority  \nIt is appropriate at this juncture to reference the statutory and appellate framework within which the court operates. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive the owner of it. While shoplifting at one-time incidents is often handled summarily or diverted, repeated or systematic offending of this nature rightly receives close judicial scrutiny and may warrant custody.\n\nThe Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences, updated as recently as 2024, draws attention to aggravating factors such as persistence, premeditation, the vulnerability of victims, and the impact on trade and employment. Attention must therefore be paid not solely to the value of the goods stolen but to the broader social and economic harms.\n\nI am mindful of the decision in R v. Gallagher [2020] EWCA Crim 1823, which examined the weight to be attached to patterns of organised retail crime. Although the facts there related largely to co-ordinated group offending and the use of deception, the Court underscored that calculated dishonesty inflicts harm beyond monetary loss, undermining confidence in retail safety and posing challenges to employers and employees alike. The analogy serves, where appropriate, to illustrate that offending which might appear isolated can, in aggregate, provoke significant disruption.\n\nThe Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v. Howes [2022] EWCA Crim 1519 further reminds sentencing courts that late pleas—especially those made in the face of extensive evidence including forensic corroboration—necessarily attract reduced discounts. Howes concerned a series of aggravated burglaries in which the defendant maintained innocence until the eve of trial, negating much of the customary benefit accorded to early admissions.\n\nIn similar vein, R v. Summers [2018] EWCA Crim 839 dealt with issues surrounding the willingness of co-defendants to disclose relevant material at full disclosure hearings. It was noted there that incomplete or selective cooperation prejudiced the administration of justice and undermined the legitimacy of any mitigation claim. While no co-defendants feature in the present matter, the principle that cooperation is a hallmark of credit is ubiquitous.\n\nOn a different note, it is worth recording, albeit tangentially, the observations in R v. Baines [2017] EWCA Crim 902, where the Court considered the late disclosure of expert evidence in a case concerning environmental offences linked to illegal waste dumping. The case is cited not for its subject matter but for its robust discussion on procedural fairness and the necessity for timely evidence-sharing—a principle equally applicable in criminal jurisdictions to ensure transparency and equity.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nReflections on Public Services and Institutional Burdens  \nThe court is acutely aware of the growing pressures on public services, especially in urban areas where repeated low-level offending absorbs disproportionate police and community resource. The Metropolitan Police Service, to its credit, continues to invest in dedicated teams addressing shoplifting; yet these teams operate against a backdrop of understaffing, escalating demand, and expanding remit.\n\nDigital forensics reports in this case, prepared by the Central Metropolitan Forensic Science Unit, illustrate the technical effort required to process and authenticate CCTV footage from multiple premises. Such work—once handled by discrete specialists—is now integrated into broader forensic workflows that also manage violent crime and cyber investigations, often resulting in backlogs.\n\nMoreover, the court notes that the Probation Service, already facing considerable reductions in staffing and funding, has struggled to meet expectations in cases requiring nuanced risk management in the community. The post-pandemic environment has exacerbated these challenges, prolonging wait times for assessment and intervention, further complicating sentencing options.\n\nThe NHS, particularly community mental health services, remains similarly stretched. Waiting lists for psychiatric assessments exceed recommended targets, limiting the timely delivery of specialist input in criminal justice cases where mental health issues may be relevant. The recent report by the Lowndes Health Trust underlined systemic deficiencies in resourcing, treatment continuity, and multidisciplinary coordination, many of which impact defendants like you, Mr H.\n\nCorrespondence from ShelterSouth, a prominent homelessness and crisis intervention charity operating locally, was received by the court. Their submission speaks to the spike in begging and street homelessness in this diocesan area, which, while not directly your circumstance, forms part of a broader environment in which acquisitive offences and social distress intersect. Such agencies work tirelessly to ameliorate hardship, yet receive minimal statutory funding—a lamentably common refrain in the sector.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nAssessment Reports and Expert Evidence  \nThe psychiatric report furnished by Dr Helena Marks, consultant forensic psychiatrist at St. Giles Hospital, was comprehensive and professionally articulated. Dr Marks concludes that you do not meet criteria for an enduring mental illness or psychotic disorder. Instead, there was evidence of mild to moderate anxiety and symptoms indicative of depressive episodes, partly linked to chronic unemployment and social isolation.\n\nOf particular note is Dr Marks’s discussion of impulsivity traits compounded by financial insecurity, absent any frank psychopathy or antisocial personality diagnosis. The report cautiously advocates for cognitive-behavioural interventions targeting decision-making patterns and self-regulation, while acknowledging your current reluctance to engage with external services.\n\nThe probation pre-sentence report, prepared by Ms Lucy Farrell, is detailed and sets out your personal history, family background, and offending pattern. It expresses concerns regarding your housing instability and inconsistent employment record, as well as a noted history of non-compliance with prior community remedies.\n\nMs Farrell highlights your reported history of childhood disruption but cautions against overemphasis on early adversity as being determinative of current behaviour. The report stresses the importance of structured rehabilitative programmes and pragmatic case management to mitigate risk and promote desistance.\n\nIt is instructive, albeit tangential, to consider the role of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 in limiting the exposure of minor convictions after specified spent periods. This legislation underscores a societal commitment to reintegration and shuns undue penal perpetuity. Nonetheless, persistent and escalating offending as seen here attenuates the relevance of spent convictions, compelling courts to act proportionately.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nVictim Impact and Community Harm  \nVictim personal statements received from the management of a local pharmacy chain describe anxiety and apprehension among staff, some of whom report feeling targeted during your visits. This translates not merely into economic loss but diminished workplace confidence and elevated stress levels.\n\nSimilarly, a letter from the Brixton Neighbourhood Watch Group draws attention to a perceived uptick in antisocial behaviour, linking persistent retail theft with a broader decline in social cohesion. Whether or not such assertions will withstand empirical scrutiny is beyond this court’s remit. However, the perception of disorder itself constitutes a significant community concern.\n\nRelatedly, reports from the Brixton BID note increased security expenditure by small businesses, including installation of CCTV, employment of private security staff, and reduced opening hours to deter theft and vandalism. While these measures serve legitimate business interests, they also represent a cost ultimately borne by consumers and tenants.\n\nThe court also appreciates correspondence from the Brixton Council Environmental Enforcement Unit referencing a concurrent investigation into fly-tipping and unlicensed waste disposal in the area. Though unrelated to your conduct, these issues contribute to an atmosphere of regulatory challenge and strained municipal resources.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe Broader Social Climate and Offender Accountability  \nThis court acknowledges the complex social and economic landscape within which this offending occurred. We are witnessing ongoing increases in street homelessness and food insecurity, exacerbated by inflationary pressures and disrupted labour markets. These phenomena engender environments where acquisitive crime may find fertile ground.\n\nYet the court must distinguish understanding from excuse. Personal hardship does not grant immunity from the law. The Siracusa Principles—though framed in the context of international human rights—emphasise that rights may be limited proportionately to uphold public safety and order. That balancing act is the essence of judicial decision-making.\n\nSimilarly, the decline of shared community values, the pervasive influence of social media, and transformations in public attitudes towards authority compound challenges for law enforcement and judicial institutions alike. The internet has altered social interaction and perceptions of consequence, where ‘influencers’ glamorise risky behaviour absent tangible accountability.\n\nThe jurisprudential undercurrent is clear: the social fabric is frayed but not beyond mending. The law remains a necessary instrument for preserving order, deterring harm, and articulating the boundaries of acceptable conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nRetention of Agency and the Avoidance of Determinism  \nThe court is cognisant of theoretical debates in criminology regarding determinism and free will, as well as the therapeutic jurisprudence movement emphasising rehabilitative over punitive frameworks. However, it remains a bedrock principle that individuals retain responsibility for their actions, regardless of circumstances or history.\n\nThe oft-invoked narrative of the ‘Troubled Families’ paradigm is, in this context, both a caution and a challenge. While recognising the impact of family dysfunction and early trauma, the court must resist the reduction of adults to mere products of environment.\n\nThere is something unduly reductive in positing that offending is predetermined by upbringing. Such determinism risks excusing behaviour that, however fraught, remains actionable within law and policy.\n\nThe present case reflects clear agency exercised within a framework of conscious decision-making, repeated over an extended time interval.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nComparative Case Law and Sentencing Framework  \nFor completeness, I mention R v. O’Donnell [2023] EWCA Crim 1097, a case similarly involving repeated supermarket theft over a period of eighteen months. Despite the absence of violence, the Court of Appeal confirmed a community order with an unpaid work requirement as appropriate, with emphasis on rehabilitation.\n\nIn contrast, in R v. Finch [2020] EWCA Crim 688, repeated theft involving use of threats was met with immediate custodial sentence. The paramount consideration remains the culpability, harm, and risk profile.\n\nThe Theft Act 1968 offence, as charged, carries a wide sentencing potential, from fines to custodial sentences. The definitive guideline emphasises a structured approach using offence bands considering value, planning, harm, and previous convictions.\n\nYour record, Mr H, includes multiple prior convictions for similar offences, which elevate seriousness. The court must balance deterrence, rehabilitation, protection of the public, and personal mitigation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nConclusion and Next Steps  \nIn light of all the foregoing, I determine that a pre-sentence report is indispensable to inform a properly tailored sentencing outcome. That report shall address risk, amenability to intervention, housing circumstances, and engagement with community resources.\n\nAny recommendations regarding attendance at accredited offending behaviour programmes, cognitive skills courses, or restorative justice initiatives ought to be carefully weighed. Consideration should be given to the potential suitability of a community order incorporating rehabilitative and punitive sanctions consonant with the overall aim of reducing reoffending.\n\nThe report should also explore any necessary and feasible support for underlying vulnerabilities, including mental health and financial advice, though I bear in mind your prior inconsistent engagement.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 17 August 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Brixton. They have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript is maintained for the court record. You are reminded that you have the right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions arising from section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 applicable here.
