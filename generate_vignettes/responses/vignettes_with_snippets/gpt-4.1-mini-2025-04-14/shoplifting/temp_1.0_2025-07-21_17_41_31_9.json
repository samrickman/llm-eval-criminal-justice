MR H  \nCase No. T2026/04831  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. A. Grimshaw  \nFiled: 12 September 2026  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in relation to multiple offences of theft from retail premises, committed over a sustained period and prosecuted under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending, as charged, principally concerns your involvement in shoplifting over a roughly eighteen-month period in and around Brighton and Hove city. \n\nProcedural History  \nYou were first identified as a suspect after a series of visits to several high-street chains and independent stores. The local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), operating in coordination with Sussex Police and the Brighton & Hove Neighbourhood Policing Team, undertook an extensive collation of CCTV footage, staff accounts, and electronic point-of-sale discrepancy reports. The collective effort spanned a number of weeks in late 2025 into early 2026, highlighting a pattern of repeated theft involving small but consistent items from multiple premises.  \n\nThe case was initially allocated to the magistrates’ court at Brighton but transferred to this Crown Court for sentencing due to the number of indictable counts consolidated into a single representative charge. The Better Case Management (BCM) regime was engaged early, with listing of plea and trial preparation hearings within expected time frames. The matter then proceeded to pleas before this court.  \n\nThe multifaceted nature of this investigation required the diligent cooperation of multiple agencies. It remains a matter of record that despite pressures on staffing within the local policing units and the stretched resources of the BCRP—now operating with reduced funding approaching a five-year low—the collation and timely sharing of intelligence was relatively effective in this instance. On behalf of the court, I acknowledge these efforts, as well as the assistance provided by retail staff who furnished detailed victim impact statements outlining the cumulative effect of your offending on their working environments.  \n\nIt is regrettable, however, that the progress of these proceedings was, on two occasions, impeded by administrative delays. On 15 June 2026, the court was compelled to adjourn sentencing due to unresolved applications for funding in respect of a forensic psychological assessment, which ultimately was approved some four weeks after the initial request was submitted. Such delays are more than procedural inconveniences; they risk infringing on the principle of prompt justice, which underpins the Criminal Procedure Rules and wider constitutional guarantees.  \n\nThe Crown was represented throughout by Ms Yvonne Bennett, whom the court thanks for her clear and measured submissions. Mr James Thornton appeared for you, representing you under a statutory Legal Aid order, and conducted his duties with professionalism despite the systemic challenges posed by repeated funding refusals and slow responses from the Legal Aid Agency—a recurrent theme that the court notes with some frustration.  \n\nThe hearing today proceeded in open court, with full attendance. The courtroom layout, recently refurbished under a Heritage Lottery Fund scheme, provides a more accessible environment for all parties but unfortunately continues to experience occasional technical issues with microphone amplification and digital recording. The official transcript has nonetheless been diligently prepared by court staff, whose commitment to the integrity of court proceedings merits commendation.  \n\nWithin the preparatory material, this court has been provided with a detailed psychiatric report authored by Dr Margaret Lowe, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose findings are characterful of the clinical fellowship she pursued at the Maudsley Hospital. Dr Lowe’s report is comprehensive, if at times overly technical, and provides an assessment relevant to your personal circumstances but ultimately does not diagnose a major mental illness warranting diversion to a hospital order or equivalent disposal. Equally, the report highlights fragile psychosocial circumstances, including long-term unemployment, intermittent engagement with treatment services, and symptoms indicative of mild to moderate depressive disorder. While such material is informative, it must be read alongside the established facts and the overarching framework guiding sentencing in cases of this nature.  \n\nThe court is broadly aware that nationally, retail crime figures show an increasing trend in shoplifting incidents, a challenge reported both by government statistics and retail watchdog bodies. The British Retail Consortium has noted a particular rise in the theft of healthcare and beauty products during the period under review, a trend mirrored locally. These patterns, while concerning, constitute part of a wider social phenomenon and should not be conflated with the conduct of individual defendants.  \n\nIt is further noted that the defendant’s own housing history, as outlined in the probation report dated 30 August 2026, reveals a precarious arrangement in temporary supported accommodation following a previous eviction from council stock. These housing dynamics are symptomatic of the broader housing crisis currently unfolding across the Southeast of England, where falling affordability and reduced social housing stock continue to exert pressure on vulnerable populations. Such context, while not excusing offending behaviour, is of undeniable relevance in understanding the circumstances in which offences may occur.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThere is precedent for many facets of your conduct and history within the case law that informs judicial discretion. The decision in R v. Pearce [2019] EWCA Crim 1109 examined repeated thefts from multiple out-of-town retail outlets and outlined the balancing act between deterrence and rehabilitation. Pearce was ultimately sentenced to ten months’ custody, with the court citing the \"cumulative impact on victim retailers and local economies\" as justification for immediate custodial punishment despite the modest individual value of stolen goods. While your behaviour as established on the admitted facts shows parallels, each case must be assessed on its own merits.  \n\nMeanwhile, the judgment in R v. Bantrell [2022] EWCA Crim 1628 serves as a reminder of the limited extent to which personal hardship factors may mitigate sentence. Although Bantrell, like yourself, suffered chronic unemployment and unstable accommodation, the Court of Appeal affirmed a sentence of community rehabilitation order with unpaid work, reflecting the absence of serious harm but recognising the need for court-led intervention to prevent recidivism. Such guidance informs this court’s approach in your case.  \n\nA further case of note, R v. Fortescue [2021] EWCA Crim 1470, involved theft of pharmaceuticals from neighbourhood chemists. Fortescue employed distraction techniques and altered his appearance to evade detection. His custodial sentence was justified on the basis of the breach of trust and the heightened risk of harm where stolen medicines were diverted into the illicit market, potentially endangering vulnerable users. Though those facts differ from yours, the principle that even low-value theft may pose public dangers is instructive here.  \n\nAt the initial hearing on 7 May 2026, the court took care to observe the demands that such casework places on overstretched probation services. Indeed, a recent HM Inspectorate of Probation report highlighted a sector-wide challenge in resource allocation, with caseloads increasingly unmanageable and waiting lists for key programmes—such as abstinence-based substance misuse pathways—growing. The impact on sentencing outcomes and rehabilitative potential cannot be overstated. These institutional challenges are now woven into the fabric of criminal justice administration and must be borne in mind when considering mechanisms for intervention.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that the defendant’s personal background includes both engagement and detachment from available support systems. Letters submitted in your favour by local charity workers at the Open Door Centre commend your intermittent participation but also note episodes of disengagement, particularly during periods of housing instability. This court accepts that such oscillation is not uncommon among defendants facing structural hardships but also cautions that without consistent engagement, the efficacy of voluntary schemes is compromised.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nHistorically, the Theft Act 1968 has served as the cornerstone legislative instrument governing offences such as the present. Its original framers could scarcely have anticipated the emergence of omnipresent surveillance technologies, digital payment methods, and automated inventory controls which current retailers deploy. The law’s enduring principles, however, remain constant in defining wrongful appropriation with the intent permanently to deprive.  \n\nMore recent sentencing guidelines issued by His Majesty’s Sentencing Council reflect an evolving understanding of the need to calibrate penalties according to harm and culpability rather than purely monetary valuation. Factors such as the vulnerability of victims, repeat offending, sophistication or premeditation, and impact upon community confidence are rightly emphasised.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nIn an unrelated but contemporaneous case in this circuit, R v. Stonebrook [2025] EWCA Crim 901, the defendant was convicted of involvement in fly-tipping hazardous waste—much of which was asbestos-laden—within a protected green belt area. Stonebrook's conduct, unrelated to retail or shoplifting offences, attracted a considerable custodial sentence underscoring the courts’ increasing unwillingness to countenance environmental degradation. That case had, however, no bearing on the defendant currently before this court but demonstrates the breadth of sentencing practice across offence categories.  \n\nThis court must also express concern about the slow but steady rise in acquisitive crimes in the Brighton area—many linked to the growth of social media marketplaces and informal economies for the resale of stolen goods. The effect on smaller local businesses, already grappling with the pressures of the post-pandemic economic environment, is salutary. The cumulative disruption from repeated petty theft is a factor appropriately weighted in sentencing. The retail sector’s resilience is not inexhaustible.  \n\nThe Crown proffered victim impact statements from seven separate premises, chiefly independent pharmacies and grocery stores. One manager described the atmosphere in her store as markedly tense during your visits, with part-time staff reportedly requesting additional security or avoiding shifts overlapping with your known patterns. A broad though indirect psychological impact is evident and must be taken seriously, even if your behaviour did not amount to physical or verbal aggression.  \n\nThe probation report notes a history of poly-substance misuse dating back some years but records your recent abstention from illicit drugs, corroborated by local community drug service attendance data. It raises the possibility of an impulsivity-related vulnerability but finds that you retain the capacity for decision-making and responsibility-taking. Nevertheless, it identifies that your pattern of offending, while not violent, is symptomatic of underlying instability and the absence of sustained protective factors.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nIn reaching this stage of proceedings, I must also mention the involvement of the community social work team. In correspondence received from Ms Patricia Leverett, a caseworker at Brighton Support Plus, it is evident that while efforts at engagement have been made, resource constraints have limited their capacity to maintain frequent contact. Such letters attest to the systemic difficulties in providing wraparound services in a context of demand outstripping supply.  \n\nFurther complicating factors are your reported episodic non-compliance with medication prescribed for depressive symptoms, as outlined by a community psychiatric nurse in her report dated 28 August 2026. This absence of adherence is often observed in clinical practice and may aggravate emotional volatility and judgment errors. However, in the absence of evidence of serious mental illness or psychosis, this does not constitute a mitigating factor sufficient to offset your culpability.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nIt is noteworthy that your criminal record includes previous convictions for shoplifting dating back eight years, with an interval of apparent desistance interrupted by a recent resurgence beginning in late 2024. A community resolution was administered in 2023 following a theft from a supermarket but with limited sustained effect. This reflects a pattern of offending behaviour that the courts and agencies have sought to disrupt through a variety of means, including caution, community sentences, and referral to rehabilitative programming. Regrettably, those interventions have not produced the desired outcome.  \n\nThe court has also had regard to a recent decision in R v. Ealing [2024] EWCA Crim 1122, where an offender with a similar profile—multiple theft convictions, substance misuse history, and sporadic engagement with support services—was given an immediate custodial sentence because community sentences had demonstrably failed to deter repeated offending over a protracted period. While this case is factually distinct, it illustrates the courts’ responses to recidivism in acquisitive crime.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nAt an earlier hearing the defendant’s counsel submitted a series of letters from family members and community advocates highlighting financial hardship, childhood adversity, and statements of remorse. These documents were duly considered but, as always, require cautious interpretation given the laudable but inevitably partial perspective they represent.\n\nAlongside the more formal submissions, this court notes that your letter to the court was thoughtfully composed, clearly conveying regret. Such gestures have their place but must be weighed against the nature of the offending and the broader public interest.  \n\nIt is a regrettable fact of contemporary criminal justice that repeat offenders frequently express contrition only when faced with overwhelming evidence, offering little prior engagement or acceptance of responsibility. Advanced guilty pleas are accordingly incentivised by the sentencing framework to reward prompt recognition of wrongdoing and to reduce the distress caused to victims and witnesses.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nThe court also acknowledges the restrained and professional manner in which the defence has conducted its representation, notwithstanding the obstacles posed by slow authorisation of expert instructions via Legal Aid and the administrative burden of coordinating multiple reports, letters, and support statements. The delicate dance between defending a client’s rights and facilitating effective justice is one that practitioners manage daily, often with little public recognition.  \n\nOf note, the defence have respectfully highlighted your expressed desire to participate in a structured rehabilitation and employment reintegration programme following sentence. Whether such an approach proves viable can only be evaluated after the receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report.  \n\nIn a somewhat tangential matter, it may be recorded that the co-defendant in an unrelated trial currently before this court was found to have possessed a bladed article in a school car park—charges unrelated to your case but indicative of the wide range of offences encountered within this jurisdiction. This does not reflect upon your conduct but demonstrates the breadth of criminal activity that occupies the courts.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nSentencing Framework and Considerations  \nThe court must balance several factors, including the seriousness of the offending, the culpability and previous record of the defendant, the impact on victims and the community, and the prospects for rehabilitation. Public protection and deterrence are central.  \n\nThe Sentencing Council’s guidelines stress that persistent acquisitive offending, especially when accompanied by raising fear or anxiety among retail staff, warrants firm response. Equally, where there is evidence of underlying vulnerabilities, support and intervention are necessary to reduce future harm.  \n\nAs has been judicially affirmed in R v. Grayson [2023] EWCA Crim 1754, sentences should be tailored to address offending behaviour but also cognisant of systemic challenges such as social deprivation and service availability. While society must show compassion, it cannot abdicate responsibility for upholding standards of lawful conduct.  \n\nThis court has carefully reviewed all available reports and submissions, and while mindful of your personal circumstances, must not lose sight of the seriousness of a course of conduct that betrays both trust and community cohesion.  \n\nThe availability of community-based programmes with a cognitive-behavioural element remain a significant mitigating element if they can be relied upon to reduce risk. However, given your history of intermittent engagement and prior unsuccessful community sentences, custodial options are a distinct possibility.  \n\nAccordingly, I direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared, including a risk assessment and tailored intervention plan. The Probation Service is also requested to consider any suitable mental health or addiction treatment referrals, as well as vocational training prospects that might support post-sentence reintegration.  \n\nThese matters will be considered fully at the sentence hearing scheduled for 20 October 2026. This court reserves final determination until receipt and review of the comprehensive pre-sentence report and any further representations from all parties.  \n\nThis concludes the sentencing remarks issued at the Crown Court at Brighton in Court 4, dated 12 September 2026. The proceedings have been transcribed and are recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are not engaged.
