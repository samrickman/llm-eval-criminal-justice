MR H  \nCase No. T2025/13479  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. F. MERRICK  \nFiled: 18 August 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced in respect of theft, committed through a series of shoplifting offences, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct covers a protracted period spanning some fourteen months and involves multiple retail properties within the Mansfield, Ashfield, and Newark districts. Though ostensibly low-value in each individual instance, the pattern of repeated offending and the cumulative impact on victims and local community business cannot be overstated.\n\nProcedural Chronology and Case Management  \nYour arrest occurred on 1 May 2025, following a prolonged investigation initiated by the Nottinghamshire Police Economic Crime Unit in conjunction with the Mansfield Business Crime Forum. The case owes its progression in no small part to the vigilance of store personnel and the local authorities' increasing investment in specialist crime reduction strategies. Detection arose from the collation of observational intelligence, cross-referenced CCTV content, and itemised inventory reports over an extended interval. Naturally, such investigations are resource-intensive affairs, requiring considerable manpower deployment, digital forensic analysis, and logistical co-ordination with non-police partners. As has been noted in numerous similar cases, this collaborative effort between the public and private sectors, while often heralded as exemplary on paper, struggles against persistent systemic pressure points—swelling caseloads, overstretched staff, and bureaucratic impediments. It would be remiss not to acknowledge that these practical realities inevitably shape the nature, timeliness, and outcomes of such adjudications.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nLegal Aid proceedings in this case proved protracted. Early applications for funding to retain an independent forensic psychologist, to assist in forming a complete clinical picture of the defendant, faced multiple refusals and requests for clarification from the Legal Aid Agency. This introduced avoidable adjournments. The court reiterates its concern over the frequently encountered delays attributable to Legal Aid administration, which compromise defendants' rights to expedition and undermine the operational efficiency of the criminal justice system. These issues are emblematic of a national challenge, well-documented and yet persistently unresolved, which calls for systemic reforms beyond this sitting.\n\nDuring preliminary hearings convened between June and August 2025, the court observed intermittent absences of prosecution witnesses due to operational reassignments within police units, alongside administrative disruptions caused by nationwide staff shortages in Probation Service teams. The multiplicity of such peripheral obstacles serves as a sobering reminder of the fragile interdependencies upon which effective criminal justice discourse rests. It is also worth noting that the court’s registry recently underwent refurbishment of its public waiting areas—a comparatively benign development amidst more pressing institutional strains yet testament to the ongoing commitment to providing a dignified environment.\n\nCounsel and Representation  \nI record formally my thanks to Ms Caroline Jenkinson, appearing on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, whose precise and measured submissions have advanced the prosecution case with commendable clarity. Likewise, I acknowledge Mr Dominic Yeats, instructed on your behalf via a Legal Aid order, whose advocacy has been diligent, notwithstanding the endemic systemic pressures described above. The defence’s application for a pre-sentence psychiatric evaluation was eventually facilitated with the generous cooperation of Dr Andrew Lascombe, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose report will be further considered in due course.\n\nThe court notes the difficulties encountered by the defence team in securing interpreter services on two separate occasions, an issue regrettably common in courts handling complex or resource-heavy caseloads. Additionally, the presence of Court Usher Ms Matilda Rowe merits mention for maintaining courtroom order despite the scheduling pressures and intermittent delays. Such recognition is not perfunctory but an acknowledgment of the essential human elements underpinning the judiciary’s work.\n\nSociological and Policy Context  \nWe are all witnesses to an era marked by growing societal challenges; the ongoing effects of economic austerity, the fragilities within public health provision, and a complex interplay between social deprivation and crime. Mansfield, like many post-industrial towns, grapples with rising levels of street homelessness exacerbated by supply-constrained housing markets and deteriorating social supports. While such contextualising factors cannot excuse unlawful conduct, they form an unavoidable backdrop against which offending patterns must be understood. A leading report published by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies in 2023 highlighted that repeat shoplifting offences often intersect with chronic homelessness, untreated addiction, and minimal access to mental health support. These are alarming trends, but not insurmountable ones, provided that agencies collaborate effectively and resources are allocated rationally.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nIt is also incumbent upon this court to observe that community responses to retail crime remain a balancing act. The Mansfield Local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (LBCRP), resilient despite funding constraints, has pioneered a series of non-punitive interventions, including offender engagement panels and retailer education programmes. These initiatives have been cautiously successful in diverting some low-risk individuals from custody and encouraging sustainable desistance. Yet, there persists a growing public weariness with persistent low-level crime—the kind often perceived as “victimless” but in reality deeply corrosive to local enterprise and community cohesion.\n\nRelevant Case Law  \nTurning to authorities, in R v. Thornley [2019] EWCA Crim 1027, the Court upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant convicted of a prolonged series of shop thefts totalling in value over £3,000. Despite the absence of violence, the Court stressed the broader social harm and the undermining of public confidence in civic order. While the facts in Thornley differ in terms of scale, the principle that repetitive dishonesty undermines retail security and public trust remains pertinent.\n\nIn R v. Sidhu [2021] EWCA Crim 1407, a case concerning cumulative theft from multiple charity shops across Leeds, the defendant's clinically significant personality disorder was considered in mitigation. Nonetheless, the Court emphasised that psychiatric diagnoses do not confer impunity and that sentences must reflect the totality of offending with a view to deterrence. Dr Lascombe’s report, whilst noting certain personality traits and stress-related vulnerabilities, did not diagnose any grave psychiatric disorder.\n\nFurther, in R v. Gilmour [2017] EWCA Crim 1235, a defendant’s attempt to claim credit for a late guilty plea in a string of thefts was scrutinized. The Court made clear that the timing and circumstances of a plea are essential to determining credit entitlement, especially where a plea is entered only after the preponderance of evidence becomes indisputable. That principle governs this case, to which I will return.\n\nThe Facts of the Offending  \nThe Court’s understanding of the relevant background narrative is as follows. Your offending spanned a period from February 2024 to April 2025, during which you repeatedly entered a range of retail premises, including supermarkets, pharmaceutical dispensaries, and small convenience shops. The offending bears hallmarks of calculated conduct, with evidence indicative of repeated concealment of goods under clothing and in personal bags, use of distraction techniques directed at shop staff, and frequent return visits to the same stores. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nIt is clear from CCTV and witness accounts that you did not shy away from employing a range of tactics to avoid apprehension. On multiple occasions, you were observed removing security tags with implements brought for this purpose, altering packaging to mislead scanning devices, and exiting through emergency exits when unobserved. Notably, on one incident, you were recorded wearing dark, non-descript clothing and a face covering, an escalation that suggests an awareness of and willingness to circumvent detection.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nAlthough no direct threats or violence were used, the impact on retail staff has been profound. Several have reported increased anxiety and feelings of vulnerability during shifts. Changing working patterns, the imposition of restrictive store protocols, and sometimes the shortening of employee hours have all been attributed to the disruption caused by your actions. These ancillary consequences, though perhaps intangible, weigh heavily in the balance of culpability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nThere is further evidence before the court that after previous warnings, informal community resolutions, and invitations to participate in diversion programmes, you resumed such conduct within a matter of months. This cycle of offending, intervention, and relapse compounds concern over your receptiveness to rehabilitative efforts.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nCorrespondence with the Mansfield Probation Office confirms your inconsistent attendance at appointments and limited engagement with offered support services. Local homelessness charities also report a sporadic relationship with outreach teams, despite clear vulnerabilities.\n\nVictim Impact and Community Consequences  \nVictim statements submitted on behalf of several affected businesses speak of lost revenue, reduced staff morale, and increasing pressure to invest in additional security measures, including CCTV, security personnel, and electronic tagging systems. Such expenses, borne entirely by small business owners already operating within tight margins, have cumulative knock-on effects on local employment and community wellbeing. Indirect victims also include local customers, who face reduced store hours or diminished choice owing to the shuttering of vulnerable outlets.\n\nExpert Reports and Psychiatric Assessment  \nDr Lascombe’s report makes clear that whilst you do not suffer from acute mental illness, there is evidence of low-level substance dependency and a personality profile characterised by poor impulse control and pronounced emotional dysregulation. He observes that these factors may have exacerbated your vulnerability to social and economic pressures, yet also notes that you have demonstrated limited insight into the consequences of your actions. The report adds that motivational readiness for change appears minimal at present, with a need for intensive psychological intervention should meaningful rehabilitation be sought.\n\nIt is a matter of public record that government and NHS services dealing with addiction and mental health are under considerable strain nationally. Waiting lists for outpatient psychiatric support exceed average targets by several months in this region, and while these systemic deficits are well recognised, they cannot be permitted to operate as a general excuse for defaulting adult behaviour. To place responsibility solely with overstretched services is to shirk the personal accountability that this court must uphold.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nThe Probation Service's Presentence Report further highlights the socioeconomic challenges facing you, including precarious housing conditions and intermittent family support. Despite these factors, and notwithstanding various local schemes aimed at diverting individuals engaged in acquisitive offending towards training or employment, compliance has been patchy and inconsistent.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nThe cumulative effect of such behaviour is to diminish the credibility of community interventions designed to reduce reoffending. That is regrettable. It burdens an already overstretched probation system tasked with administering complex caseloads often numbering well beyond recommended limits. It is not lost on this court that those caseloads contain a diverse range of individuals, many of whom engage earnestly with their orders, yet outcomes vary widely and are influenced by numerous external factors.\n\nAdjunct Observations on Wider Criminal Justice Pressures  \nIt warrants brief mention that this case has been listed for sentence following adjournments occasioned partly by national strike action among legal professionals and court staff, as well as partial disruption caused by competing trials involving serious sexual offences in Court 4. These events, though external to your matter, illustrate the real-world pressures that compound the administration of justice and accentuate the importance of procedural efficiency when possible.  \n\nAlso of passing note: one co-defendant named in an unrelated matter about fly-tipping was arrested concurrently but was not connected with your offences in any legal or evidential respect. The unrelated charges involved deposition of construction waste on designated green belt land at Bowthorpe. This serves only to underscore the variety and complexity of enforcement duties borne by local police forces.\n\nSentencing Considerations and Legal Principles  \nIn framing an appropriate sentence, the court is guided by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences. This guidance insists on a multifaceted analysis encompassing the culpability of the offender, the harm caused, any aggravating and mitigating features, and the overarching principles of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection.\n\nYour offending is assessed as persistent and calculated, exhibiting a pattern of deliberate deception and evasion. While no physical violence transpired, the psychological and economic harm to victims is real and significant. Your previous convictions for similar conduct, though not recent, demonstrate a relevant history that cannot be overlooked.\n\nThe question of whether to impose immediate custody, a community order, or a suspended sentence hinges on these factors, as well as your prospects for compliance and rehabilitation. Your late guilty plea is noted, although it was entered only after disclosure of compelling evidence. As per the guidance elucidated in R v. Fentham [2020] EWCA Crim 542, the degree of plea credit reflects not merely admission but timing and sincerity.\n\nI am also cognisant of the fact that community safety includes the preservation of workplaces as secure environments and the maintenance of consumer confidence in local markets. Persistent theft erodes these foundations and, by extension, social cohesion.\n\nFinally, it merits restating that your circumstances, including housing insecurity and possible substance dependency, while undoubtedly challenging, do not diminish the gravity of your conduct. Nonetheless, these factors must be balanced fairly and justly against the need to foster rehabilitation and prevent reoffending.\n\nNext Steps and Reporting  \nI will accordingly direct the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report, incorporating current information from relevant support agencies, including the Probation Service and addiction treatment services. That report should explore the feasibility and advisability of community rehabilitation requirements and specify which interventions might best address the criminogenic needs identified in your case.\n\nI remind all parties that no final sentence will be imposed today pending receipt and consideration of this report, supplemented as appropriate by any further representations from the Crown or Defence.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are tendered this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Mansfield. A formal transcript of these proceedings will be compiled in line with the requirements of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and subsequent sentence will be duly communicated to the pertinent agencies for administrative follow-up. You are hereby advised of your right to appeal this sentencing decision within 28 days, as governed by the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, section 49. Matters of costs remain reserved, pending final determination.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANSFIELD  \nR v.
