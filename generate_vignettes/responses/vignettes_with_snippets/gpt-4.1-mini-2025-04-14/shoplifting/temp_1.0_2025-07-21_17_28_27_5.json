MR H  \nCase No. L2025/14739  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. Langworth  \nFiled: 14 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a charge of theft, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct in question took place between November 2023 and June 2025, predominantly within retail premises across Leeds city centre, as well as some outlying districts within the metropolitan area.\n\nThe procedural history of this matter is somewhat protracted. You were initially arrested on 2 July 2025, subsequent to a referral from the West Yorkshire Police Retail Crime Investigation Unit. This Unit acts collaboratively with the Business Crime Reduction Partnership, various local stores, and dedicated crime prevention officers within the force. The investigation, to which a considerable quantum of resources was deployed, relied upon the careful cross-referencing of surveillance data collected over an eighteen-month period. As is now well understood, incidents of retail theft can, of course, have deleterious consequences disproportionate to their monetary value, and the efforts to bring such offenders to justice necessarily entail painstaking collation of fragmented evidence.  \n\nYou appeared first at Leeds Magistrates' Court on 7 July 2025, where you entered a plea of not guilty. The case was then committed for trial due to the value and volume of evidence and disposition of the indictment. A plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 29 August 2025. It was at that hearing, after full disclosure and review of the evidence, that you entered a guilty plea to the counts on the indictment.  \n\nThe timeline here is to be noted. A guilty plea at an advanced stage presents specific considerations in terms of sentencing credit. The Court of Appeal in R v Craine [2019] EWCA Crim 1283 has clarified that the utility of the plea is primarily measured against its timing and the impact on witnesses and court resources. While you do receive some credit for the change of plea, it cannot be at the highest level granted for early admission.  \n\nIt is worthwhile adding that, in the wider context, the judiciary is all too familiar with the pressures placed upon frontline policing and intelligence services tasked with investigating acquisitive offences. For instance, as per the findings of the 2024 National Retail Crime Report, such resources are often diverted from serious or violent crime investigations to address the UK’s growing challenges with persistent shop theft. The strains on personnel and budgetary limitations underscore the gravity with which this court regards offending of this nature, even where injuries or serious violence are absent.  \n\nThe legal framework governing your sentence is primarily found in the Theft Act 1968 and the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (effective since February 2023). The guideline directs that the court evaluate the harm, culpability, and circumstances of the offender. Particular attention is paid to offences involving repeat offending, commercial impact, and emotional harm caused to victims and staff.  \n\nIt is pertinent to recall rulings in appellate authorities such as R v Freeman [2022] EWCA Crim 1051, wherein the Court upheld a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment for repeat shoplifting offences involving the targeted theft of high-value cosmetics and pharmaceutical items. The offender demonstrated a pattern of behaviour accompanied by a deliberate exploitation of vulnerability in retail environments.  \n\nSimilarly, R v Tolley [2020] EWCA Crim 1998 provides guidance concerning the imposition of community orders with unpaid work as an alternative in certain shoplifting cases, emphasising the importance of addressing underlying criminogenic needs through community rehabilitation. This case, among others, informs the multi-faceted approach recommended by probation services and cognate national bodies.  \n\nAt the case management hearing on 18 August 2025, the court adjourned sentencing to allow for reports from both the Probation Service and an independent psychiatric assessment. The Probation Service is widely known to be under significant operational pressure, exacerbated by increasing caseloads and staff shortages nationally, which regrettably can result in delays to the preparation of detailed, person-centred reports. I acknowledge this context, though such constraints cannot excuse the absence of necessary information critical to the sentencing decision.  \n\nThe psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Samuel Hargrave, a consultant forensic psychiatrist with over fifteen years’ experience in adult mental health and criminal justice, offers a considered and nuanced view. Dr Hargrave concludes that you do not meet the diagnostic criteria for a major mental disorder affecting criminal responsibility. He notes traits consistent with episodic low mood and features of an emotionally unstable personality disorder, though not of sufficient severity to impair culpability. The report highlights a history of sporadic engagement with substance misuse treatment services, noting an apparent reluctance to maintain consistent contact, despite referrals.  \n\nIt must be said that while this clinical input is informative, it does not, in this case, diminish personal accountability. It is a fact universally acknowledged that mental health vulnerabilities do not constitute a carte blanche exemption from prosecution or punishment, save where such conditions substantially impair cognition or volition. The court is enjoined, indeed, to balance welfare considerations against public safety imperatives. The expert’s observations, combined with probation assessments and other evidence, assist in forming an enlightened view in that regard.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nIn outlining the factual matrix, the court acknowledges that the offending was neither isolated nor the result of a transient lapse. On the contrary, the evidence before me points to repeated entries into multiple retail outlets over an extended timeframe. The approach was characterised by deliberate concealment and careful evasion of detection, including the use of bags and outerwear to obscure stolen items, as well as feigned phone conversations to distract staff. Such conduct denotes a degree of sophistication and premeditation that aggravates culpability.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nOf note, the prosecution have also adduced evidence that, at times, your behaviour prompted heightened security measures within certain premises. Staff rotations were altered, additional monitoring was employed, and in one particularly telling instance, a lone store assistant felt compelled to resign owing to stress and anxiety exacerbated by your return visits. This underlines the psychological impact on vulnerable store employees, an aspect well-recognised in recent sentencing practice guidance.  \n\nThe court is grateful for the victim impact statements provided by these employees and by the management teams of the affected premises. Such statements convey the genuine disruption and distress occasioned by persistent theft, extending beyond mere financial loss. It is a regrettably common refrain that retail workers face an increasingly hostile and insecure workplace environment—a fact borne out by recent reports from the Retail Trust charity and other industry bodies.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nIt is important, in the interests of completeness, to acknowledge that while no physical violence was directed at any individual, the threat of escalation is a chilling and recurring concern. The potential for confrontation between shop staff and offenders remains a persistent tension in retail crime. In this regard, the court recalls the cautionary stance adopted in R v Mallory [2018] EWCA Crim 2184, whereby the presence of a commitment to non-violence does not necessarily mitigate the overall seriousness when considered within the full constellation of offending.  \n\nFunding for your defence has been provided under a standard representation order, though with regrettable administrative delays. The Legal Aid Agency’s increasingly complex authorisation systems have introduced procedural bottlenecks, impeding timely instruction of expert reports and support for vulnerable defendants. Such systemic issues have been the subject of recent Parliamentary scrutiny and several independent reviews. Though exogenous to this specific case, these delays bear upon the efficient progress of litigation and, by extension, the administration of justice.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe pre-sentence report compiled by probation, by Ms Fiona Rathbone, a senior probation officer with twelve years’ experience, provides a detailed assessment of your background, risks, and rehabilitative needs. Ms Rathbone notes your history of accommodation instability, periods of unemployment, and fractured family relationships. She highlights longstanding struggles with alcohol misuse and intermittent engagement with community services. The report emphasises a moderate level of risk of reoffending, primarily linked to lifestyle factors and poor impulse control.  \n\nMs Rathbone recommends engagement with an integrated Thinking Skills Programme, alongside substance misuse counselling, should a custodial sentence not be deemed necessary. She also stresses the importance of stable housing as a precondition for effective rehabilitation—an issue of considerable public policy concern given the pressures on local authority housing provision. The court is aware that demand currently outstrips supply, with many applicants reliant on temporary or unstable arrangements.  \n\nI recognise the efforts of charitable organisations such as Leeds Housing Aid Network, which operate under severe resource constraints yet provide invaluable assistance to individuals in need. The court has received letters from such groups, which commend your limited but sincere attempts at engagement, while urging all agencies to coordinate support for reintegration and desistance.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThis court must also address the wider societal backdrop. Urban centres in England, including Leeds, have seen an unfortunate rise in begging, street homelessness, and antisocial behaviour over recent years. These phenomena often intersect with acquisitive crime, though it is vital to avoid simplistic or determinist assertions of causality. Offending remains a matter of personal choice and responsibility within the constraints of circumstance. The court is mindful of the persistent narrative of “broken communities,” a term that, while evocative, can serve to obscure the individual agency and capacity for change.  \n\nAuthorities tasked with maintaining order and protecting public safety must balance compassion with firmness. The increasing normalisation of low-level shop theft, particularly when carried out repeatedly by the same individuals, risks eroding the social compact and the rule of law. This court cannot overlook that reality in favour of facile explanations.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nTurning briefly to relevant case law, the decision in R v. Havers [2022] EWCA Crim 1602 remains instructive. There, the Court of Appeal underscored the need for sentencing to reflect both personal culpability and the broader community impact, particularly where there is evidence of a repeated and premeditated pattern of theft involving vulnerable retail operations. A sentence of immediate custody was affirmed in that case, reinforcing the message that repeated acquisitive offending must be met with appropriate deterrence.\n\nIn R v. Haswell [2021] EWCA Crim 1754, the Court held that late pleas of guilty offered little mitigation where the accused had previously maintained a not guilty plea despite overwhelming evidence, resulting in compressive sentences with limited reduction. Although your plea was not at the very last minute, the timing nonetheless tempers any discount here.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nOther appellate authorities, such as R v. Latimer [2021] EWCA Crim 947, distinguish between custodial and community sentences based on individual circumstances, including prospects of rehabilitation. However, Latimer also emphasises that the persistence of offending despite warnings and interventions weighs heavily against more lenient disposal. That principle is engaged where, as here, prior diversion has failed to deter further theft.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThere are no indications of co-offenders or complicity by third parties. Your defence has not advanced any claims of coercion or undue influence. You have denied involvement up to the point of the guilty plea but otherwise made no attempt to dispute the well-documented evidence.  \n\nIn relation to the impact of these offences on the victims and their businesses, the court recognises the careful and measured manner in which the store employees who provided statements have expressed themselves. Their descriptions of distress and diminished sense of workplace security are to be taken seriously. While monetary loss attributable to individual thefts may be modest, the cumulative toll is significant, affecting operational hours, staffing, and morale.  \n\nThe Court notes the Courtroom’s newly refurbished bench and improved hearing technology, introduced earlier this year to enhance judicial efficiency and witness confidence. The usher team, whose efforts in maintaining order and assisting vulnerable witnesses are valued, deserve thanks for their professionalism throughout this hearing.  \n\nThank you are also due to Ms Stella O’Connor, who appears for the Crown, and Mr James Vosper, who represents you pursuant to a Legal Aid representation order. Despite systemic challenges, both have provided comprehensive submissions and have acted with propriety and diligence.  \n\nIn considering the appropriate sentence, the court is bound to balance the severity of the offence, your personal circumstances, any mitigating factors, and the public interest in deterrence and rehabilitation. The court is also conscious of the ongoing difficulties faced by services attempting to support offenders such as yourself—be they probation providers, substance misuse services, or housing support charities—all grappling with demand that outstrips finite resources.  \n\nAcknowledging this, it must be underscored that the law applies equally regardless of circumstance. While the presence of hardship or vulnerability may inform the nature of intervention, it cannot pale the gravity of repeated calculated offending.  \n\nIn light of all of these considerations and in accordance with established sentencing practice, I will reserve sentence pending the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report addressing current circumstances and the suitability of rehabilitative measures. This report shall specifically examine your engagement with local support services, capacity for compliance with community orders, and any assessed risk to the public.  \n\nThe report is to be prepared expeditiously and served upon the court and parties no later than 12 November 2025, when this matter will return to be listed for sentence.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at Leeds Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEEDS  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. L2025/14739  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P.
