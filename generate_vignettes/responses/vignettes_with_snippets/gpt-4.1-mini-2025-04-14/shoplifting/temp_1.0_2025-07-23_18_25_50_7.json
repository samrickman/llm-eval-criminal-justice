MR H  \nCase No. T2025/15423  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. C. ABIOLA  \nFiled: 10 November 2025\n\nMr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced for offences of shoplifting under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge before the court represents a consolidated allegation arising from a series of thefts occurring over the course of several months, predominantly within the Bristol city and Avonmouth areas, encompassing a range of independent retail outlets and national chains. While the aggregate value of the items taken is modest, the conduct alleged speaks to a persistent pattern of acquisitive criminality which has attracted the attention of both law enforcement and retail security agencies.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour first encounter within the criminal justice system in this matter was on 13 April 2025, when you were taken into custody following enquiries initiated by the Avon and Somerset Police Retail Crime Unit. Initially, the case was managed at magistrates’ court level but was subsequently committed to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) procedure, reflecting the volume of evidence, the multiplicity of charged incidents, and the representations of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). It is a salutary note that the BCM framework, introduced nearly a decade ago to enhance efficiency in prosecuting criminal cases, continues to face challenges in this circuit, largely owing to staffing constraints and case complexity. Yet, the present case proceeded without any of the delays now so sadly commonplace — a fact for which all professionals involved deserve some measure of credit.\n\nIt is by no means unusual in retail theft prosecutions for case files to be voluminous and disclosure packages extensive, as one contemplates the necessity of providing detailed CCTV footage, employee statements, stock loss registers, and forensic examination reports. In this matter, the investigation was spearheaded by a dedicated retail crime officer seconded from the Avon Police Retail Partnerships Team, whose efforts spanned several operational cycles. At the time of your arrest, bespoke investigatory measures included covert observation and digital evidence collation, drawing on resources from the police digital forensic unit.\n\nThe CPS presented evidence at the pre-trial hearing held on 16 September 2025, substantiating the case by way of extensive video material and corroboratory eyewitness testimonies. Your initial pleas were of not guilty. However, after several case management hearings and disclosure updates, on 28 October 2025 you entered a plea of guilty to the representative count. It is notable, and regrettable, that the plea was not forthcoming at the earliest reasonable opportunity, which, as the courts have often observed, reduces the quantum of any sentencing discount.\n\nI take this moment to note the tireless efforts of several voluntary sector organisations — including Retail Watch Bristol and the Avon Shopkeepers Support Group — which act as frontline responders to retail crime victims and provide victim impact statements. Their work is essential, often carried out under conditions of limited funding and intense pressure, offering a vital human dimension to offences that may otherwise appear technical and transactional.\n\nThe impact on staff morale and the viability of small businesses must not be underestimated. Retail employees frequently experience heightened anxiety and job insecurity when subjected to recurrent thefts, even in the absence of physical threat. In one instance in this case, a local convenience shop reported a substantial reduction in staff hours to allow for additional security checks and supervision. The broader social and economic ramifications of such offending in deprived urban areas — where retail diversity is limited — reveal the insidious nature of acquisitive crime.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nIn reaching this court, it is important also to place your offending in the context of wider public policy and evolving judicial attitudes to theft. The Theft Act 1968, seminal legislation enacted over half a century ago, has undergone numerous interpretative refinements. The courts have increasingly diverged from earlier, purely monetary valuations towards recognising the psychological and community harms implicit in retail crime. This shift aligns with international trends across common law jurisdictions where victim-centred perspectives have gained prominence.\n\nI am conscious, moreover, of the jurisprudence developed in the Court of Appeal in recent years, which jurisprudence has underscored the necessity of proportionate sentencing. The cases of R v. Halliday [2023] EWCA Crim 1297 and R v. Grayson [2022] EWCA Crim 1005, for example, both relating to serial theft from chain stores, provide useful comparative frameworks albeit in distinct factual matrices.\n\nAlongside the legal framework, I acknowledge the role played by the Legal Aid Agency in this matter. Regrettably, and as has become a familiar refrain within these walls, delays in authorising requests for independent expert assessment were encountered. Your counsel’s application to instruct a forensic behavioural analyst was subject to protracted administrative processing, slowing progression to sentencing. The court records its ongoing concern with such procedural hindrances that inevitably weigh upon defendants’ rights and the timely administration of justice.\n\nA psychiatric report was eventually commissioned, the report authored by Dr Rachael Bhatt, a forensic psychiatrist with extensive experience in acquisitive offending. Her assessment was detailed and methodically composed. Dr Bhatt notes a history of mild depressive episodes in your youth but found no active psychiatric illness or cognitive impairment likely to bear upon your criminal responsibility or rehabilitative prospects. She identifies, however, traits of impulsivity and low frustration tolerance, alongside a longstanding pattern of disengagement from support services offered through the Probation Service.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe Probation Service report, submitted on 29 October 2025 by Officer Sarah Mendez, provides further context to your antecedents and personal circumstances. At 34 years of age, you possess four prior convictions for theft, three of which relate to low-value shoplifting events in neighbouring jurisdictions, including Somerset and South Gloucestershire. Those convictions culminated in community orders, none of which you were fully compliant with. Your unstable housing situation, described as transient and sometimes sofa-surfing, exacerbates your vulnerability, though no link to coercion or exploitation has been identified.\n\nIt bears noting — and I emphasise this — that the strains on housing stock, particularly for single adults unable to access social housing due to eligibility criteria or waiting lists, have been profound in the past decade. The housing crisis, while not an excuse, forms a backdrop against which offences such as yours unfold. The court is, however, vigilant to distinguish between socio-economic hardship and discipline, or lack thereof.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nTurning to the central facts of your offending, the court has received a detailed chronology prepared by the prosecution which identifies at least ten separate thefts occurring between June and October 2025. Video evidence taken from multiple retail locations demonstrates a common modus operandi involving the use of concealed bags, the timing of entries to coincide with staff shift changes, and the selection of high-demand items — including tobacco products, over-the-counter painkillers, and energy drinks.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nIt is notable that you were apprehended following a co-ordinated multi-agency operation involving Avon Police, the local council’s Trading Standards department, and the retail risk management team. Intelligence sharing between these bodies, while complex and at times burdened by competing priorities, was ultimately effective in producing the evidence necessary for prosecution.\n\nThe phenomenon of multi-agency collaboration in reducing retail crime deserves comment. While this integrated approach has been heralded as a best practice model within Home Office policy, the practical challenges of synchronising data, anonymising information in compliance with data protection standards, and aligning operational tempos remain significant. Nevertheless, in the present case, these agencies acted swiftly and collaboratively.\n\nIn a sectoral context, it is relevant to mention the National Business Crime Centre's recent report highlighting the surge in low-level theft offences and the corresponding pressures exerted on retail staff health and wellbeing. The recurring theme of burnout and secondary trauma weighs heavily upon employees required to both be vigilant and customer-facing.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nAn additional perspective arises from the Retail Crime Reduction Forum's annual white paper, which emphasises the economic cost of shrinkage — a term denoting loss from theft, error, or fraud — estimated at £4.5 billion annually in the UK. While your individual offences may appear minor, their repetition contributes to this broader systemic drain.\n\nThe victim impact statements before the court articulate a consistent narrative of financial loss, loss of confidence, and the erosion of community trust. Indeed, one statement from a local pharmacist describes the feelings of intimidation felt after repeated thefts of essential medicines, which not only impacts business viability but endangers vulnerable patients reliant on accessible healthcare.\n\nTurning to your personal circumstances, the defence has offered a statement detailing your educational background, noting that you left school at 16 without formal qualifications, having experienced disrupted schooling due, in part, to familial instability. You assert that economic hardship and estrangement from family have contributed to cycles of unstable accommodation and low self-worth. While offering context, these circumstances do not provide an excuse.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nI pause here to consider the jurisprudential context. It bears recalling that sentencing credit for guilty pleas is governed by well-established principles. The offender who enters a plea at the earliest stage benefits from the maximum discount of up to one-third, reflective of the saving to court resources, the sparing of victims’ anxiety, and the indication of remorse. Where pleas are entered later, as in the present case, a lesser discount applies. In R v. Kingswell [2022] EWCA Crim 1345, the court made clear that delay undermines credit, particularly where the prosecution has advanced a coherent case early on.\n\nMoreover, the decision in R v. Newton [2019] EWCA Crim 578 instructs that factual disputes requiring trial deprive the defendant of mitigating credit. While your plea negated the need for trial, the timing remains a factor in sentence mitigation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nOf particular note is the absence of any evidence suggesting your participation was under duress or coercion. A co-defendant raised in the Crown Court case linked to other counts remains at large. That individual’s unrelated offences included possession of a bladed article found at a school car park and aggravated assault with a chair during arrest, both of which bear no connection to your conduct.\n\nFurther, your former flatmate’s recent conviction for benefit fraud, while noted in ancillary reports, has no bearing on your culpability and must be viewed as an unrelated matter.\n\nAttention has been drawn to the case of R v. Panchal [2020] EWCA Crim 2012, where the appellant was convicted of fly-tipping on protected green belt land resulting in significant environmental damage. This case, and others like R v. Feldman [2018] EWCA Crim 1683 concerning unlawful waste disposal, reaffirm that persistent and calculated regulatory breaches warrant deterrent sentences. While entirely distinct in nature, these authorities underscore the judiciary’s intolerance for serial disregard for legal norms.\n\nSimilarly, in a distinct review, R v. Aldridge [2017] EWCA Crim 800 involved burglary of a private dwelling while the occupants were on holiday. Such matters lie beyond the scope of your offending but serve to illustrate the broader judicial framework addressing property crime.\n\nAcknowledging the multi-faceted challenges faced by public services, I recognise the pressure faced by the adult community probation sector, which, as reported in the Ministry of Justice’s 2024 Annual Report, struggles under staffing shortages and burgeoning caseloads. Despite such strain, probation officers like Ms Mendez continue to deliver thorough assessments and supervision under difficult circumstances.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nAdditionally, the mental health services in Bristol face considerable waiting lists for psychological therapies, with average waiting times exceeding 18 weeks for adult outpatient referrals. This systemic issue, while highly relevant to the health sector, cannot be held as mitigating for those who decline offered interventions.\n\nIn closing, it is necessary once again to stress that persistent acquisitive offending, carried out with deliberate and repeated intent, should be met with appropriate sanctions designed to protect the public, uphold the rule of law, and encourage rehabilitation.\n\nI shall now adjourn sentence to allow for the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report detailing the feasibility of community-based interventions, including cognitive behavioural programmes, financial management support, and unpaid work requirements. An evaluation of your engagement with existing support services and the risks posed by non-compliance will be essential to any final determination.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are recorded this day, 10 November 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction will be forwarded to the relevant prosecuting and civil agencies. You are reminded of your right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2025/15423  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. C.
