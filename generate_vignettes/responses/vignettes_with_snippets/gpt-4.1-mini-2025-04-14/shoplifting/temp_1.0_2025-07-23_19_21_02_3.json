MR H  \nCase No. WH2026/04598  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. L. BRENTWOOD  \nFiled: 12 October 2026  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in respect of offences involving theft from retail establishments, contravening section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct at issue occurred over a protracted period from early 2024 through to mid-2026, encompassing multiple incidents across various locations within the Whitehall and adjoining districts.\n\nProcedural History and Context  \nYour case was first listed at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 16 June 2026, following your arrest two months prior. The Crown elected to send the matter to this court in accordance with the seriousness of the indictment and the cumulative nature of the offending. The proceedings have traversed various procedural stages, including plea and trial preparation hearings held on 30 July and 15 September respectively. At the first hearing, you entered a plea of not guilty; however, you subsequently changed your plea to guilty on 9 October 2026, immediately ahead of the scheduled trial commencement.\n\nAs has become a regrettably familiar pattern, this delayed plea truncates the window for meaningful procedural economy. While the law affords a credit for guilty plea, reflecting both apology and saving of court time, such credit is inherently diminished when entry is made only moments before trial. This approach was reiterated in the Court of Appeal in R v. Sinclair [2024] EWCA Crim 1339, where the court emphasised the importance of early acceptance of responsibility in awarding maximum credit.\n\nIt is worth noting that this trial court, established in 1994 to address high-volume criminal workload in central London, has undergone significant refurbishment during the summer recess. The improved acoustics and upgraded recording facilities have been broadly welcomed, though one must not be distracted by such enhancements from the gravity of proceedings conducted within these walls.\n\nI record my appreciation to Ms Felicity Draycott, prosecuting counsel, and Mr Andrew Smythe, instructed on your behalf, both of whom have engaged diligently despite the burdens posed by the criminal justice system’s well-documented resource constraints. I must, however, express concern once more regarding delays attributable to the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of your applications to instruct a forensic social worker and a clinical psychiatrist. These bureaucratic impediments, which have become a near-constant refrain in Crown Court practice, serve only to impede the timely administration of justice and inflame the frustration of all participants, including defendants such as yourself who have a right to expect efficient representation.\n\nI also take this opportunity to commend the Safer Neighbourhoods Team assigned to this case. Despite staffing shortages and increasing demands from other areas—particularly those concerning violent crime and gang-related activity—the team executed a thorough investigation culminating in your arrest on 14 April 2026. Their written impact statement highlights the tangible and intangible harms occasioned upon retail staff and local businesses, many of whom have endured significant economic and psychological hardship.\n\nThe Retail Victims Support Network submitted a comprehensive report explicating the ripple effects of repeated shop theft, including increased insurance premiums, the necessity of costly security measures, and staff turnover driven by stress and low morale. These impacts, while not always immediately quantifiable, underscore the broader communal consequences of what might otherwise be dismissed as “minor” offences.\n\nOne reflects here upon the case of R v. Carrington [2022] EWCA Crim 998, where the cumulative detriment to small business viability was recognised as a legitimate sentencing consideration in theft offences. That judgment rightly affirmed the harm caused by serial shoplifting, emphasising the social costs alongside the economic.\n\nFurther background material comprises a helpful but novel community impact statement prepared by the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership, which reflects on the challenges of multi-agency collaboration. The report traces the inter-agency attempts to collate intelligence, share offender profiles, and target preventative strategies across a shifting landscape of personnel turnover and competing priorities. Such collaboration remains aspirational in many respects; notwithstanding commendable individual endeavour, systemic pressures, including staff attrition and data privacy concerns, complicate effective operation.\n\nIt is instructive to remind oneself also of the statutory framework within which sentencing in these matters is undertaken. The Theft Act 1968 remains the cornerstone legislation, reinforced by the Sentencing Council’s guidelines first promulgated in 2019 and revised in 2023. These guidelines enjoin courts to calibrate sentencing according to the value of property taken, the offender's culpability, any previous convictions, and the impact on victims.\n\nParallel to the criminal framework, this court is mindful of the increasing role of restorative justice initiatives in shoplifting cases, though such avenues remain underutilised in complex, repeat offending patterns such as these. The Crown Prosecution Service has in recent years encouraged efforts to integrate diversion schemes early in proceedings, though the efficacy of such programmes can vary substantially.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nIt is also significant to remark on the broader socio-economic environment into which offences of this nature frequently emerge. The current landscape is characterised by rising living costs, housing insecurity, and limited access to sustainable employment—a milieu plainly pertinent as context but not as an excuse for criminality. National statistics reveal continuing increases in self-reported food insecurity, paralleled by a concomitant strain on charity and voluntary sector resources. Organisations such as FoodShare UK and HelpPoint London, operating near the venues affected by your offending, report client demand at or near historic peaks. However, this court cautions against conflating societal hardship with licence to offend, lest the delicate balance of individual accountability and social understanding be unsettled.\n\nIndeed, contributions received from the charity HousingRescue emphasise the widening gulf between service demand and capacity, noting current waiting lists in excess of twelve months for emergency accommodation in the Greater London area. Of course, proximity to such chronic challenges may serve to explain behaviours but falls short of justification.\n\nA notable feature of proceedings was your referral for psychiatric evaluation, precipitated by concerns expressed during the initial court hearings regarding possible underlying mental health issues. Dr Helena Sayers, consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence, submitted a detailed report dated 2 October 2026. Dr Sayers finds no evidence of a major psychiatric disorder that would diminish culpability, though she notes traits consistent with borderline personality disorder, coupled with moderate anxiety and depressive symptomatology. She advocates for psychological intervention focused on emotional regulation and coping strategies. However, Dr Sayers is clear in her professional opinion that such conditions do not materially mitigate the gravity of the offences nor negate the necessity for sentencing commensurate with seriousness and public protection.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that similar themes arose in the Court of Appeal in R v. Phillips [2023] EWCA Crim 776, where the panel reiterated that whilst mental health considerations remain important in sentencing, they neither excuse nor exculpate dishonest conduct, particularly where such conduct is sustained and calculated.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nAdditionally, pre-sentence reports commissioned from the Probation Service furnish a nuanced appraisal of your personal background, risk factors, and prospects for rehabilitation. Officer Latisha Grant, in her most recent report dated 4 October 2026, speaks of your apparent ambivalence toward engagement with voluntary services, inconsistent declarations concerning housing status, and a fractured relationship with family members who might otherwise provide support. She further notes that, despite a low to medium risk of serious harm, there exists a concerning pattern of risk taking and lack of insight into the consequences of your actions. Probation records confirm frequent non-compliance with previous supervision measures and interruptions to intervention programmes.\n\nI am conscious that the Probation Service operates under increasing pressure from caseload volumes, staff shortages, and the complexities presented by defendants with mixed needs—mental health, substance misuse, accommodation insecurity—all within a constrained resource envelope. These systemic difficulties can hamper the continuity and intensity of rehabilitation efforts, yet this court must weigh the defendant’s responsiveness carefully.\n\nMoreover, the drafting of the pre-sentence report acknowledges the introduction, by the Sentencing Council in 2025, of a new “Enhanced Rehabilitation and Public Safety” framework, which prioritises the assessment of offending behaviour linked to economic survival strategies and addiction. The report underscores the importance of addressing underlying causes alongside robust community supervision—a dual path that the court is obliged to consider.\n\nIt remains an unfortunate reality that delays in commissioning and funding expert reports by the Legal Aid Agency have, once again, extended the timeline of these proceedings. The application to instruct Dr Sayers was submitted on 29 June 2026 but approved only in mid-August, resulting in lost time and additional cost. Such inefficiencies, while beyond the control of court personnel and counsel, detract from the principle of effective justice.\n\nI must now make reference to certain relevant case law. In the matter of R v. Wallace [2020] EWCA Crim 1595, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence for repeated shoplifting where the defendant exhibited persistent offending despite earlier community-based sentences and pre-sentence intervention. There, the court highlighted the need for deterrence proportionate to the defiance of prior warnings and the cumulative impact on victims.\n\nSimilarly, in R v. Markham [2021] EWCA Crim 741, the Court dealt with offences involving theft from residential properties, stressing that while low monetary values might ordinarily attract lenient sentences, the circumstances—particularly breach of trust and repeated patterns—may lead to custodial outcomes.\n\nIn contrast, R v. Evans [2019] EWCA Crim 546 focused on a case of opportunistic acquisitive crime motivated largely by addiction and addressed mitigation through community sentences with intensive supervision. The relevance lies in tailoring intervention to the individual’s circumstances where genuine engagement is anticipated.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nA review of your prior criminal history reveals a series of previous convictions chiefly for similar offences of shoplifting, spanning from 2018 through 2023. Several of these resulted in conditional discharges and community penalties, reflecting judicial attempts to balance rehabilitation and deterrence. Despite this measured approach, the resumption of offending at a similar level leads inevitably to a reassessment of the merits of non-custodial sentencing.\n\nThe somewhat fractious relationship you maintain with probation services and your failure to comply with previous supervision orders are matters of particular concern. This echoes observations in R v. Blake [2022] EWCA Crim 1110, where breaches of community orders and sporadic engagement were viewed unfavourably and led to increased custody severity.\n\nIn addition to the pre-sentence report and psychiatric assessment, this court has also had regard to the contents of letters of support submitted by your sister, Ms Bernice H, as well as by representatives from the West End Community Outreach Trust and the Redbridge Day Centre, all emphasising your longstanding personal difficulties, including homelessness and financial hardship. While such material is appreciated for its humanising perspective, it does not diminish the seriousness of your offending or lessen the impact upon those victimised.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nConcerns about your accommodation and welfare are well-documented. At the time of your arrest, you were residing in temporary hostel accommodation managed by the London Homelessness Support Board, an organisation coping with an unprecedented demand for beds. The interplay between unstable housing and acquisitive crime is, unfortunately, well-recognised. Reports from the Hostel Manager, included in the probation file, indicate episodes of late-night absences and breaches of hostel rules. The staff describe a client who struggles with structure and compliance, describing your behaviour as “erratic” and “sometimes confrontational.”\n\nFurther afield, the chronic shortages in affordable housing across London, exacerbated by economic inflation and the aftermath of successive Covid-19 lockdowns, have placed enormous pressure on both statutory and voluntary sector accommodation providers. The “No Second Night Out” policy, designed to prevent extended street homelessness, has in some respects shifted risk profiles rather than alleviating root causes. This wider context does not absolve individual responsibility but situates offending within a fabric of systemic vulnerability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nThe question of your potential for rehabilitation is central to sentencing yet layered with complexity. The Probation Service proposes consideration of a Community Order incorporating a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement and unpaid work, supported by mental health treatment and substance misuse support, conditional upon engagement.\n\nYour limited participation with prior interventions tempers optimism in this respect. The risk of non-compliance and subsequent breach proceedings cannot be discounted. This court is, nevertheless, obliged to consider, in accordance with statutory duties, the available alternatives to custody, ensuring that any such disposal protects the public and reduces reoffending through appropriate rehabilitation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nI have noted, with some regret, that the Impact Statement produced by the Shopkeepers’ Association, while acknowledging the distress caused to staff, includes recommendations that would have no bearing on your personal circumstances, including calls for mandatory electronic tagging of repeat shoplifters and increased police patrols at late-night hours. Though understandable from a preventative standpoint, these proposals exceed the remit of these proceedings and illustrate the often-frustrated backdrop against which such offending occurs.\n\nIt is a lamentable but inescapable truth that retail crime places increasing strain on police forces, diverting officers and resources from more serious crime investigations. The Metropolitan Police Service’s Annual Report for 2025 notes that street-level acquisitive offences account for approximately 38% of all reported incidents, yet conviction rates remain low due to evidential challenges and under-reporting.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nIt is also necessary to address the attested fact that a co-defendant, Mr J, was implicated in a related incident of aggravated criminal damage to a commercial property during the relevant timeframe. That offence — involving the destruction of a bus shelter with a heavy object and recorded on police dashcam footage — is wholly distinct from your offending and carries its own legal considerations. Mr J has been remanded in custody pending trial and has no bearing on your sentencing except insofar as it demonstrates the broader context of acquisitive and antisocial crime within the area.\n\nThe repeated references to such unrelated matters in submissions and media reports risk conflating distinct wrongdoings and thus must be carefully compartmentalised within the judicial process.\n\nIn considering the holistic picture, I reiterate the point made in the Sentencing Council guideline that sentencing must be proportionate, reflect the culpability and harm of the conduct, and promote rehabilitation where possible.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nIt is imperative for the court to balance the sometimes competing interests of deterrence, punishment, rehabilitation, and public protection. While the crimes before this court do not involve physical violence or weapons, the psychological impact upon victims and the community repercussions are significantly amplified by their repetitive nature and the resultant erosion of safe and welcoming retail environments.\n\nIn reaching the provisional conclusion that a custodial sentence is likely appropriate, the court must receive a comprehensive pre-sentence report setting out options for structured intervention and assess your amenability to engagement. Community sentences remain a possibility, but only if there is a realistic prospect of compliance and meaningful behavioural change.\n\nThe court will also consider any representations made on your behalf at the sentencing hearing, including proposals for deferred sentencing contingent on engagement with treatment services.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are promulgated this day, 12 October 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Whitehall. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to all relevant bodies in criminal justice administration. You are reminded of your right to appeal within 28 days of sentence under statutory provisions including the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No statutory reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply herein. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT WHITEHALL  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. WH2026/04598  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. L.
