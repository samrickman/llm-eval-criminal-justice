MR H  \nCase No. T2026/04827  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. WORTHINGTON  \nFiled: 14 October 2026  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence in respect of a charge of theft, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from a series of offences committed over a protracted period involving the misappropriation of goods from retail establishments. The offending behaviour, as charged and supported by detailed evidential disclosure, is said to have occurred predominantly within the city centre and adjacent metropolitan districts.  \n\nProcedural Background  \nYour case has traversed a somewhat protracted procedural pathway, commencing with your initial police interview on 26 June 2026. That interview, conducted under caution and recorded in accordance with PACE Code C respectively, took place following a referral from the Birmingham Business Crime Reduction Initiative. This initiative, aptly described in local council documentation as “an integrated and multi-agency response to rising retail theft,” involves close partnership between police constabularies, local authority trading standards, store security personnel, and voluntary sector victim support organisations.  \n\nThe evidence assembled over the weeks prior to your arrest was the result of significant operational effort. Specific surveillance measures were deployed, including fixed CCTV installations vetted by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, covert human intelligence source reports—wholly consistent with the National Intelligence Model—and mobile tracking enabled by judicial warrant. These resources reflect not only the seriousness with which your conduct was regarded but also the evolving complexity of investigative practices in response to low-level but persistent retail crime.  \n\nIt is necessary from a procedural standpoint to observe that there was some delay in securing the appropriate legal aid funding for expert reports. Your defence solicitors lodged an application on 3 August 2026 seeking to instruct a forensic behavioural analyst with experience in shoplifting typologies and offender rehabilitation. That funding was not authorised until late September, resulting in a consequential adjournment of the initial sentencing hearing scheduled for 7 October. While such funding delays are regrettable, the court acknowledges the increasing administrative burdens placed upon the Legal Aid Agency in assessing specialist applications and the imperative of due process compliance.  \n\nThe plea and trial preparation hearing occurred on 14 September 2026. At that hearing, you entered a plea of not guilty, contesting the Crown’s evidential case. Further evidential disclosure was served, including time-stamped retail CCTV footage and third-party witness statements. However, on 5 October 2026, shortly before trial was to commence, you elected to change your plea to guilty on the single representative count.  \n\nThe court reminds itself, consistent with the principles elucidated in R v Carbery [2023] EWCA Crim 978, that the timing of a guilty plea is pivotal to determining the appropriate discount for remission of sentence. Early admissions facilitate the avoidance of the trauma and inconvenience to victims and witnesses inherent in contested proceedings, reduce public expense, and manifest genuine remorse. The courts are wary of tactical pleas entered only at the cusp of trial, frequently intended to attract mitigating credit without a commensurate acceptance of responsibility. The authorities relevant to this principle include R v Ali [2022] EWCA Crim 1407 and R v Lucas [2019] EWCA Crim 1990, among others.  \n\nIt is not for this court, however, to predicate sentence solely upon plea timing, but to approach sentencing in a holistic manner, considering all facts, circumstances, aggravating and mitigating features, and relevant reports.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nIt is instructive to consider the place of such offending in the broader societal and criminal justice landscape. We find ourselves incontrovertibly in the midst of a persistent rise in acquisitive crime, particularly involving retail theft, which not only results in financial loss but also exerts significant psychological impact on staff and customers alike. The consequences extend far beyond the immediate value of stolen goods. This court acknowledges and has carefully reviewed statements from retail employees who describe feelings of intimidation, anxiety, and reduced job satisfaction attributable to repeated theft incidents.  \n\nAdditionally, this court recognises that such offences — though “non-violent” in the classic sense — may precipitate a ripple effect of security tightening, increased operational costs, and decreased public confidence in the safety of the shopping environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe evolution of legislative and regulatory frameworks addressing theft is illustrative of shifting paradigms. The Theft Act 1968 remains the statute landmark governing this domain. However, sentencing approaches have been modulated in light of various statutory instruments and seminal judgments over the intervening decades. For instance, the Sentencing Council’s Theft guideline, published in 2016 and subject to successive revisions, emphasises the cumulative impact of repeated offending, the vulnerability of victims, and the defendant’s previous criminal history as primary considerations.  \n\nIt is useful to reference R v McCauley [2017] EWCA Crim 1506, in which the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial term for a sustained course of shoplifting, recognising that persistence and disregard for prior Community Orders justified a custodial threshold. Although the circumstances of that case differ in detail, the principles remain applicable here.  \n\nIt bears note that this jurisdiction, the Birmingham Crown Court, has witnessed a substantial caseload of such offending during recent years. This has corresponded with concurrent pressures on public services, including probation supervision, policing resource allocation, and voluntary sector victim support networks. The strain on these systems, though not exhausted by any individual case, factors palpably in the administration of justice and public protection. Indeed, the visible effect of resource limitations is perhaps most acute in the duties discharged by probation staff, who continue to shoulder increasing caseloads amidst attrition and vacancies.  \n\nSuch operational pressures mirror national trends documented in Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation reports, which lament chronic underfunding and call for innovative community solutions. Against this sombre backdrop, it is incumbent upon this court to deliver sentencing that both delivers deterrence and affords genuine rehabilitation prospects, thereby promoting systemic resilience.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nI must add that, while your case involves theft, the court is cognisant of matters pertaining to codefendants arising from a wholly separate and unrelated matter currently pending before Leeds Crown Court, involving offences of violent disorder and possession of offensive weapons. These matters bear no nexus to your proceedings and are therefore irrelevant to the consideration of sentence here.  \n\nAnalogously, the recent case of R v Caddell [2024] EWCA Crim 312, concerned a defendant convicted of residential burglary, possession of Class B drugs on school premises, and criminal damage to community infrastructure. That judgment reiterates judicial caution against conflating disparate offences with unrelated matters. You should not be prejudged by the acts of others, nor by offences which do not form part of your indictment.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nTurning to the effect of the offences on victims and affected parties, it is noted that letters submitted by staff and management of the businesses concerned describe alterations implemented in response to theft, including increased security measures, alterations to staff shift patterns, and in some cases, the installation of electronic article surveillance (EAS) gates at significant cost. These letters highlight a climate of heightened anxiety and the erosion of workplace morale.  \n\nThe court is also mindful of the recent communications from the Birmingham Retailers’ Support Forum, which draws attention to the increasing incidence of shop theft involving repeat offenders, rapid product turnover contributing to stock shortages, and the accrual of financial losses exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic aftermath. The Forum’s submissions embody the broader community interest in maintaining safe and viable retail environments that underpin urban economies and social well-being.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nExpert Reports and Psychological Assessments  \nThe court has had the benefit of a comprehensive psychiatric report prepared by Dr Samantha Avery, a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist instructed to assess your mental health and risk of reoffending. Dr Avery’s report, dated 7 October 2026, offers a measured assessment. It recognises that you do not meet diagnostic criteria for any major mental disorder, but highlights a pattern of impulsive decision-making and a degree of emotional dysregulation. Dr Avery notes that your engagement with prior support services was inconsistent, and your willingness to comply with intervention programs limited.  \n\nThe report emphasises that while there may be underlying psychosocial stressors—specifically, periods of housing instability and unemployment—these do not absolve culpability, nor do they sufficiently attenuate the risk you pose without engagement in ongoing rehabilitative efforts.  \n\nProbation services have provided a presentence report, compiled by Probation Officer Helen Matthews on 11 October 2026. This document accords with the Asset Plus framework utilised nationally, offering a detailed offender assessment, risk evaluation, and proposals for targeted interventions. The report identifies your “medium likelihood” of reoffending absent engagement, conditional on adequate support for substance misuse and financial counselling.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nIn this context, the court must acknowledge, with regret, the chronic under-resourcing of public mental health and social care provisions. The NHS Long-Term Plan acknowledges the considerable delays in accessing community mental health teams and addiction services. These systemic deficits impact offenders and citizens alike, frustrating efforts toward rehabilitation and reintegration. Though this grievance lies beyond the scope of sentencing decisions, it is plainly part of the real-world matrix in which such cases arise and are managed.  \n\nFurther complicating matters, recent periodical reports by the Ministry of Justice underscore the rising caseloads faced by probation professionals, noting increased demands for community rehabilitation, enforcement, and safeguarding duties. One fears that the aspirational ideal of a fully integrated offender management system remains aspirational indeed.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nSentencing Considerations and Framework  \nThe sentencing framework applicable to cases of theft involving prolonged patterns of misconduct is well established. The Sentencing Council’s Theft guideline provides tiers of seriousness contingent on the value of goods taken, the degree of planning and sophistication, the vulnerability of victims, and the presence of aggravating or mitigating features.  \n\nIn your case, the pattern of deliberate and repeated offending, the targeting of vulnerable premises, and disregard for prior warnings place you in a higher culpability bracket.  \n\nIt is pertinent the court also weighs your antecedents, which include prior convictions for theft-related offences, and a history of conditional discharges for similar misconduct. Such recidivism militates against leniency absent demonstrable change or exceptional personal circumstances.  \n\nI am mindful that custodial sentences must be reserved for the most serious cases where community sentences are insufficient to achieve the purposes of sentencing outlined in section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003—namely, punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public. The threshold for immediate custody requires careful consideration of these elements holistically and in light of personal and public interests.  \n\nI also observe the importance of considering available community sentencing options, including Rehabilitation Activity Requirements, Unpaid Work, and Cognitive Skills Programmes, designed to address offending behaviour and reduce the risk of reoffending.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nIt is apparent that you have previously been offered opportunities to engage in such interventions, but those were met with limited compliance or premature cessation. That history tempers optimism concerning your current prospects without further evidence of motivation.  \n\nI am reminded that the court, although instructed to treat harshness with due circumspection, must nonetheless impose sentences that will serve both as individual and general deterrents. The general deterrent effect of sentencing in acquisitive offenses cannot be overstated, particularly in populous urban centres with high retail turnover.  \n\nThe court takes note, in passing, of the continued challenge posed by unauthorised waste deposit in green belt areas and environmental offences, which, while not part of this matter, consume public resources similarly strained by acquisitive offending investigations.  \n\nClosing procedural observations include the appreciation for the efforts of Crown Prosecutor Ms Elaine Morris, who presented the case with clarity and professionalism, and for Mr Samuel Dean, instructed on behalf of your defence, whose submissions were thorough and conscientious. I also recognise the support of court staff and ushers, whose contribution is often overlooked but invaluable in maintaining the smooth conduct of proceedings.  \n\nIn the interests of justice and in accordance with the statutory criteria, I shall adjourn for the preparation of a full pre-sentence report by the probation service, to inform final sentencing. This report should consider the viability of community-based orders with a rehabilitative focus and outline the risk assessment framework findings.  \n\nIt is imperative that any sentence imposed reflects not only punishment and deterrence but also affords a reasonable prospect of preventing future offending. The report will assist in identifying any underlying needs or vulnerabilities not fully evidenced in the current documentation and support an appropriately tailored approach.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2026, at Birmingham Crown Court, Courtroom 5. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be forwarded to the relevant authorities. You are advised of your statutory right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2026/04827  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J.
