MR H  \nCase No. B2025/14379  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. A. STRATTON  \nFiled: 12 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of charges brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically concerning allegations of shoplifting committed over an extended period in various retail outlets within the West Midlands jurisdiction. The chronology of offending spans from July 2023 through to the spring of 2025, incorporating incidents in both urban and suburban retail centres, notably including multiple high street chemists, small grocery stores, and convenience outlets.\n\nProcedural and Investigative Background  \nYou were initially arrested on 15 April 2025 following a coordinated investigative effort led by the West Midlands Police Commercial Crime Unit in collaboration with several local Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRP). These operational units have increasingly adopted a multi-agency approach to tackling repeated acquisitive offending in retail environments, combining data gathered from CCTV systems, retailer incident logs, and witness testimonials. The case files reveal that although individual shoplifting incidents might appear minor in isolation, the aggregation of such events presented a pattern indicative of a deliberate course of conduct, meriting prosecution in the Crown Court to address the seriousness and cumulative harm caused.\n\nIt should be noted that this case progressed under the auspices of the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, designed to ensure early clarity on pleas and issues, to facilitate timely trial preparation, and to reduce avoidable adjournments. Despite this framework, the matter did encounter some procedural setbacks, including a delay of several weeks owing to the initial need for further disclosure from a third-party digital evidence custodian, and from defence applications to instruct expert psychiatric assessment, which required approval of Legal Aid funding. Such administrative delays, dishearteningly, remain commonplace within our criminal justice system, notwithstanding efforts to streamline processes. \n\nIt is a matter of considerable regret—and worthy of formal observation—that the Legal Aid Agency exhibited a protracted and bureaucratically cumbersome approach to the timely resolution of expert instruction requests. The defence’s initial submission for funding of a forensic psychologist was made on 17 May 2025, but full authority to proceed was only granted on 23 July 2025 following multiple chaser correspondences and clarifications. This inefficiency introduces systemic friction into proceedings and, regrettably, does so at the expense of all parties and the administration of justice. Similar challenges afflict other areas within the justice system, including delays in psychiatric assessments due to NHS capacity constraints and operational staffing shortages within probation services. These are not isolated to this case; rather, they reflect enduring structural pressures.\n\nIt is also important to record that during the defendant’s custody, a separate incident arose in the West Midlands Custodial Centre involving another detainee. This unrelated episode concerned the assault of prison officers with improvised weapons, resulting in disciplinary investigation and procedural safeguards review. Whilst entirely distinct from the charges presently before this court, it serves as a reminder of the complex social and institutional environments in which justice operates—a milieu often marked by concurrent conflict and disruption, which can weigh heavily upon those tasked with upholding order and safety.\n\nAt the plea and trial preparation hearing, initially scheduled for 8 August 2025 but postponed due to late disclosure issues, you entered a not guilty plea. However, as the prosecution’s evidence—detailed in extensive CCTV footage, forensic analyses, and retailer statements—became overwhelming, you pleaded guilty at the outset of the trial window on 21 September 2025.\n\nSuch late-stage pleas, while permitted by law and recognised within sentencing guidelines, warrant careful scrutiny. The sentencing discount available for guilty pleas is grounded not only in the fact of admission but in the timing and its genuine reflection of remorse. The Court of Appeal, in cases such as R v. Whitlock [2023] EWCA Crim 892, has reiterated that pleas delivered at the “eleventh hour” amidst inevitable conviction do not merit the same degree of reduction as those entered promptly, thereby affording meaningful credit for early acceptance of responsibility.\n\nThe Crown, represented commendably by Miss Abigail Morton, Counsel for the prosecution, has made detailed submissions addressing the full breadth of offending, noting the systemic impact of your conduct on vulnerable retail sectors and the economic burden borne by small businesses. For the defence, Mr Edward Finch, appearing under a representation order, has ably emphasised mitigating features including the defendant’s unstable housing circumstances and financial pressures.\n\nThe court takes this opportunity also to thank the staff and managers of retail establishments affected by your conduct who provided victim impact statements. Their accounts speak of the demoralising effect of recurring theft, the disruption caused to staffing patterns, and the psychological distress imposed on employees fearful of confrontation or customer hostility.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nTo contextualise this offence within the broader framework of acquisitive crime, it is prudent to acknowledge that offences of this nature account for a significant portion of retail shrinkage losses nationally, exerting pressure not only on individual shop owners but also on supply chains, insurance schemes, and policing resources. Reports published by the British Retail Consortium in recent years indicate that losses from retail theft constitute billions of pounds annually, with consequences that ripple through employment, prices, and community wellbeing.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nLegal Context and Relevant Authority  \nThe Theft Act 1968 remains the cornerstone legislation in defining and prosecuting offences involving dishonest appropriation, and section 1 expressly captures the conduct at issue here. Sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council advise that the seriousness of theft should be assessed not merely by financial value, but by factors including premeditation, impact on victims, breach of trust, and recurrence.\n\nIn the present case, the representative charge captures a sustained pattern over months of repeated offending. The courts have held consistently that such cumulative behaviour reflects intent and culpability beyond isolated acts. For instance, R v. Granville [2022] EWCA Crim 1335 concerned a defendant convicted for a series of shoplifting offences targeting high-value beauty products over a sustained period; the Court of Appeal affirmed an immediate custodial term, underscoring the need to deter persistent dishonesty that erodes community confidence.\n\nSimilarly, the decision in R v. Faulkner [2020] EWCA Crim 1804 highlighted that offenders who exploit commerce through stratagem and iteration demonstrate a marked disregard for the law and social order, thereby attracting increased sentence severity. That judgment found particular significance in the manner and frequency of offending, factors readily applicable to your conduct.\n\nIt is worth observing that jurisprudence concerning aggravating features in acquisitive crime increasingly references the psychological toll on retail staff, particularly in small businesses where close community relationships exist. The judgment of Lord Justice Parker in R v. Armitage [2019] EWCA Crim 764 stressed the “erosion of personal security” felt by employees who suffer repeated victimisation, a dimension that must inform sentencing severity.\n\nNotably, I must also reference R v. Birchwood [2021] EWCA Crim 1562, a case where the defendant was convicted of theft from multiple charity outlets, engaging in distraction tactics to evade detection. That case affirmed that even ostensibly low-value thefts, when sustained and conducted with artifice, attract custodial sentences due to the cumulative impact on victim organisations and public trust.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe Court also notes an instructive precedent in R v. Donahue [2023] EWCA Crim 994, which dealt with a defendant involved in the illegal importation and distribution of counterfeit goods, including branded perfumes. Although the factual matrix materially differs from simple theft, the case elucidates court attitudes towards consumer deception and cumulative economic harm, relevant as background context though bearing no direct relation to your own offending.\n\nOf wider interest, there have been recent appeals concerning offences unrelated to theft but involving community safety issues proximate to retail areas. For example, in R v. Fowler [2024] EWCA Crim 311, a defendant was sentenced for affray arising from a pub brawl involving pool cues, a matter to which this court has no direct relation nor relevance here save to note the breadth of crime impacting commercial premises.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nPsychiatric and Probation Assessments  \nI have carefully considered the clinical report prepared by Dr Helen Marks, consultant forensic psychiatrist, instructed upon the defence’s application. Her assessment, conducted over two sessions in late August 2025, determines that you suffer from no severe mental illness. However, she identifies elements of impulsivity, coupled with mild to moderate alcohol dependency, noting that these factors “may contribute to impaired decision-making under stress,” though not amounting to a recognised mental disorder excusing criminal liability.\n\nDr Marks’ evaluation also highlights a “history of inconsistent engagement with support services,” particularly those addressing housing instability and addiction. This finding accords with observations made in the probation service’s pre-sentence report, which emphasises intermittent compliance with appointments and reluctance to pursue longer-term rehabilitation pathways. Such sporadic engagement is regrettably not uncommon among individuals facing entrenched socioeconomic adversity.\n\nThe probation officer, Ms Claire Heng, in her comprehensive report filed on 1 October 2025, advocates for consideration of community rehabilitation with a tailored programme targeting acquisitive crime cognition and impulse control. Ms Heng remarks upon “limited genuine insight” demonstrated by you during her interviews, tempered by a willingness at times to express regret for the impact on victims. She notes, however, that your accommodation situation—currently residing in temporary supported housing following eviction from previous premises—poses a risk factor for reoffending, citing research linking housing instability with increased likelihood of acquisitive offences.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe probation report references the considerable strain on community services in the West Midlands, with waiting lists for substance misuse programmes exceeding six months and housing allocations severely constrained. These systemic limitations undoubtedly complicate rehabilitation prospects, though the report underscores the necessity of your active participation in available interventions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nRecent scholarly commentary on the interplay between acquisitive offending and social welfare has noted that while economic hardship is a factor, it does not inexorably lead to crime. The Justice Policy Institute, in its 2024 report, stressed that “agency and choice remain central to offending decisions” and that criminal justice responses must balance compassion with accountability.\n\nAnalysis of Your Criminal Record and Personal Circumstances  \nYou are currently 34 years old, with a recorded history of five prior convictions for theft-related offences spanning the last eight years. The earliest recorded conviction in 2018 was for shoplifting high-value confectionery, resulting in a conditional discharge. Subsequent offending led to community orders in 2020 and 2022. The latter, issued by a magistrates’ court in Dudley, required completion of a cognitive skills course, which you admitted only partial compliance with.\n\nYour residential history reveals volatility: periods of temporary accommodation interspersed with episodes of sofa-surfing among acquaintances. There is no evidence suggesting gang association or involvement in organised crime, and you have no recorded convictions for violence or drug-related offences.\n\nA letter received from your sister, Mrs Fiona H, and additional correspondence from the community outreach charity “Hope Pathways,” attest to your recent attempts at stabilisation, emphasizing your expressed desire to find employment and abstain from further offending. While these representations are encouraging, their content must be weighed against documented behavioural patterns and the need for public protection.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nIncarceration and Custodial Considerations  \nWhile shoplifting is often perceived as a “minor” offence, persistent and strategic offending that undermines retail security and victim confidence warrants serious consideration of the public interest in deterrence and community protection. The use of community sentences with rehabilitation requirements is appropriate where there is a reasonable prospect of compliance and remediation. However, the court must balance this with the need to signal that repeated shoplifting, even if non-violent, carries consequences proportionate to its societal impact.\n\nThe case also presents a useful point of contrast with R v. Everitt [2019] EWCA Crim 845, where an offender convicted of criminal damage to a church noticeboard received a community order with unpaid work imposed. The relatively isolated and less economically damaging nature of that offence differentiates it markedly from the repetitive, financially oriented conduct before this court.\n\nIt is worth recalling that the Probation Service in the West Midlands faces significant resource constraints, with a frontline workforce under increasing pressure, a factor that risks impairing the intensity and quality of supervision. In this respect, sentencing proposals that include supervision must consider realistic capacity and the potential for genuine engagement.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nConcluding Observations and Next Steps  \nThis court remains firmly of the view that sensory and psychological distress caused to retail employees by repeated shoplifting is deserving of serious acknowledgement. It is a matter of record that the stress engendered in such workplaces has caused some staff to seek transfers or to request reduced responsibilities, and business owners to incur increased security costs. The clear message of the Courts is that such conduct will not be condoned.\n\nFurther, it is evident that while socioeconomic adversity and personal challenges may provide context, they do not excuse persistent criminal behaviour, particularly where assistance has been made available and declined. The offending in this matter involved a clear pattern of opportunism and planning, consistent with deliberate dishonesty.\n\nSentencing will therefore take place following receipt of any updated reports or further representations, including a possible addendum from the probation service assessing progress on engagement with services over the intervening weeks.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of their right to appeal within 28 days of sentence in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. B2025/14379  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. A.
