MR H  \nCase No. 92765/2025  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge G. R. Nathanson  \nFiled: 18 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on an indictment charging a representative offence of theft, committed by a course of conduct involving repeated shoplifting from retail outlets across the Birkenhead borough and neighboring districts over a protracted period. The charges allege systematic acts of dishonesty contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, each count involving the unlawful appropriation of goods belonging to others with the intent to permanently deprive.\n\nProcedural History  \nThe genesis of this prosecution lies in a multi-agency collaboration between the Birkenhead Retail Crime Enforcement Unit and local Safer Neighbourhood teams. This coalition, tasked with curbing the rising tide of acquisitive crime in the area, undertook an intelligence-led approach spanning several months. The investigation benefited from the growing use of digital evidence gathering, including synchronised CCTV feeds, electronic point-of-sale data, and forensic examination of recovered property. This approach was complicated and resource-intensive, reflecting the increasingly sophisticated modus operandi of offenders involved in serial shoplifting.\n\nYou were first detained on 8 June 2025, following a planned operation conducted by officers of the Birkenhead Borough Police in conjunction with the Citywide Retail Link — a coordination body designed to streamline prosecutorial efforts across various independent and chain retailers. The arrest followed a detailed intelligence briefing where behaviours matching previous incidents were corroborated through visual and forensic evidence. This operation required careful orchestration amid heavy demands on police resources, particularly given concurrent pressures from a spate of recent violent crimes in the region.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge ongoing system-wide challenges impacting the administration of justice, including ad hoc staff shortages and intermittent strike threats affecting court listing capacity and available hearing rooms. Nevertheless, despite these institutional headwinds, the case advanced in a generally timely fashion, with hearings allocated and conducted within the frameworks provided by the Criminal Procedure Rules and the Better Case Management (BCM) initiatives. These protocols underpin our commitment to prosecuting efficiently and fairly amid mounting caseloads.\n\nEarly hearings proceeded as scheduled. A plea and trial preparation hearing held at Mersey Crown Court on 3 July 2025 saw you enter a plea of not guilty. The case was then set for trial on 21 October, reflecting the court's usual procedures surrounding pre-trial disclosure and evidence collation. However, on 15 October, you entered a plea of guilty, shortly before the trial appearance. This late plea engagement has procedural implications, which the court will duly consider.  \n\nIt is a regrettably frequent pattern among defendants charged with acquisitive offending to deny responsibility initially, thereby prolonging case preparation and increasing the burdens on victims, witnesses, and the system alike. This court echoes the principle articulated in R v. Walcott [2020] EWCA Crim 1102, where the appellate court emphasised that the timing and nature of a guilty plea are decisive factors in assessing an appropriate discount to sentence — credit is not awarded as a matter of course but as a recognition of early responsibility and the resulting economies of process.  \nBeyond the intrinsics of this case, there exist several instructive precedents bearing indirectly on the sentencing exercise. For example, in R v. Tremblay [2019] EWCA Crim 1234, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence for repeated shoplifting offences in East Yorkshire involving private dwellings’ break-ins ancillary to the theft. Though the facts diverge from those here, the case underscores the courts' willingness to escalate penalties in the presence of calculated persistence.  \n\nSimilarly, the judgment in R v. Chaplin [2023] EWCA Crim 540, relating to fly-tipping on officially protected greenbelt land resulting in significant environmental damage, exemplifies the judiciary’s concern for the broader impacts of repeat offending on community well-being, even where immediate victims are less directly identifiable. The analogies are not exact but serve as reminders of the wider societal gravitas these offences can possess.  \nWithin the local justice forum, partnership arrangements such as the Merseyside Business Crime Reduction Consortium continue to evolve, aimed at bridging communication between retailers, police, and ancillary agencies. These networks endeavour to identify patterns of offending early to facilitate diversion and timely enforcement. Regrettably, the court notes ongoing administrative bottlenecks hamper some of these mechanisms, with delays arising from under-resourced frontline teams and an overreliance on voluntary reporting by often cash-strapped retail businesses.\n\nIn a similarly complex landscape, those working within voluntary sector organisations such as Birkenhead Traders’ Alliance have demonstrated considerable commitment in supporting affected retailers, especially independent grocers, pharmacists, and convenience stores often bearing the brunt of repeated theft. Their timely communications with law enforcement and the courts are a testament to civic resolve, despite operating under prolonged budgetary constraints.  \n\nThe personal and operational pressures experienced by professional staff in these bodies must not be underestimated. The Psychological Wellbeing Network, a local support charity, recently published research highlighting elevated stress and burnout rates among retail security personnel and frontline staff due to frequent theft-related disruptions. Such factors contribute in subtle but manifest ways to the destabilisation of community safety and commerce.\n\nIt is equally vital to recognise the impact of infrastructural changes within the public justice system. The refurbishment undertaken at Birkenhead Crown Court earlier this year—improving disabled accessibility and installing enhanced courtroom technology—reflects efforts to modernise the court’s physical and technological environment. Despite these improvements, occasional delays caused by the delayed arrival of court interpreters and fluctuating judicial rotations remain noteworthy, impacting hearing efficiency.  \n\nWithin this process, the role of Legal Aid, while intended to guarantee fair representation, is not without criticism. In the instant matter, initial applications for funding to instruct forensic psychology experts were mired in procedural complexities and prolonged negotiations, with approval granted only after multiple inquiries by the defence legal team. Such experiences, though regrettable, are far from unique and serve as reminders of systemic pressures on publicly funded legal services. The resulting impact on case timelines undermines defendants’ rights to a prompt hearing and invariably affects overall public confidence.\n\nEfforts by the Probation Service to engage with cases of repeat acquisitive offending continue to confront significant challenges, including staffing shortages and high caseloads. This situation constrains their ability to produce comprehensive pre-sentence reports on schedule and limits the availability of tailored intervention programmes addressing criminogenic needs identified in assessments. Such realities are germane to today’s sentencing deliberations.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe facts of the case, as set out in the indictment and supported by the prosecution’s evidence, demonstrate a consistent pattern of deliberate theft targeting various retail outlets, many of which are small to medium-sized independent stores. The behaviours included concealment, distractions of staff, and the removal of security devices from goods, indicating forethought and a systematic approach.  \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nIt was submitted on your behalf that your offending was driven by circumstances of financial hardship, exacerbated by unstable housing status and limited social support. A psychiatric report from Dr Marina Cheung, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, was prepared and tendered for the court's consideration. Dr Cheung’s evaluation, conducted following an interview on 18 August 2025, describes traits consistent with anxiety and elements of impulsive behaviour but does not identify any major mental disorder constituting diminished responsibility.  \nThe report highlights some experience of trauma during childhood, albeit with limited current symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder or depression under review. Notably, Dr Cheung draws attention to your partial engagement with local welfare services and your apparent resistance to fully participate in alcohol abstinence programmes offered by the municipal community care team.  \nThe probabilistic risk of reoffending, according to the report, is moderate rather than high, conditioned by your unwillingness to participate fully in rehabilitation services. The report concludes that targeted interventions on impulse control and financial planning may benefit in reducing recidivism, assuming compliance with community supervision.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe court is acutely aware that the availability of such services is a product of sustained effort by public agencies contending with systemic underfunding and progressively stretched resources. The National Health Service mental health waiting list, for example, currently extends beyond six months for community-based adult psychological therapies in many boroughs, including the locality from which you hail. Waiting lists for addictions support are similarly prolonged. These factors create a hazardous landscape where vulnerability can potentiate offending absent effective intervention.  \nNonetheless, the court must balance these realities against the imperative of public protection and the undeniable impact on victimised businesses. This balance is at the core of today’s sentencing deliberations.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nAs to your personal history, you are aged 34 years. Your record reveals previous convictions for theft under similar circumstances, with sparse but unsuccessful interactions with diversion schemes and a community resolution recorded in 2022. You currently reside in temporary accommodation provided through local council housing support, a circumstance reflecting the mounting pressures on social housing stock faced nationally.  \nThere have been no indications or allegations of gang involvement nor any suggestion of coercion influencing your actions. The court has noted varying accounts from you about familial support, ranging from estrangement to occasional contact, and observations within reports suggest a somewhat isolated social network.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nIn the course of these proceedings, letters of support were received from Ms Jeanette Milton of the Birkenhead Community Outreach and Homelessness Project, commending your occasional engagement with their services but expressing frustration at your reluctance to accept consistent case management. Similarly, a reference from Mr Evan Rhodes, your former employer in a limited retail position over two years ago, attests to your reliability during that period but cannot mitigate subsequent patterns of behaviour.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nTurning to the impact upon victims, statements from affected stores underline the tangible consequences endured. Losses in stock, the need for increased security measures, and interruptions to the business flow are described with candour. Staff members report heightened anxiety levels, with some requesting alterations to shifts or additional support in the form of CCTV monitoring. The wider economic implications are exacerbated by the fragility of small enterprises competing in a challenging retail environment dominated by larger national chains.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nIt is necessary to recognise the efforts of the Birkenhead Business Improvement District Office, which facilitated collating these victim impact statements and engaged with the relevant statutory partners to discuss possible preventive strategies. Their input has aided this court in assessing the wider ramifications of your conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe Crown’s submissions emphasise the cumulative nature of the offending, the attendant strain on local policing resources, and the distress caused to victims. Particular aggravation stems from your failure to desist following prior interventions, including warnings and community resolutions. I have carefully considered these points.  \n\nPrevious judicial authority underlines the importance of proportionality in sentencing but also confirms that persistence in offending signals increased culpability and a corresponding need for deterrence. R v. Colby [2021] EWCA Crim 1302, dealing with rural shoplifting, emphasised the importance of addressing the breach of community trust inherent in repeated dishonesty, while recognising mitigating factors such as genuine remorse and early plea. While your plea was late, the acceptance of guilt at this stage is a relevant consideration.\n\nIt is acknowledged that you face difficulties including housing insecurity and financial instability. The court sympathises with these hardships but must also note that such challenges do not excuse unlawful conduct. The socioeconomic context may provide reasons to tailor rehabilitative responses utilising community sentences in appropriate cases but does not provide immunity from consequence.  \n\nSentencing Guidelines and Considerations  \nYour offences fall within the scope of the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft and dishonesty offences, revised last in 2021. The guideline stresses the need to consider not only the financial loss incurred but the degree of planning, frequency, and impact on victims and communities. Aggravating and mitigating factors require careful calibration. Among aggravating elements are prolonged offending, targeting of vulnerable premises or individuals, and failure to engage with previous interventions. Mitigating factors include early plea, remorse, and evidence of efforts to address underlying causes.\n\nThe court is mindful that while immediate custody should be reserved for cases of high culpability and/or significant harm, community sentences incorporating rehabilitation and reparative components frequently serve as effective alternatives, especially where addiction or mental health elements are present. I have taken note of these principles in framing the preliminary view of appropriate sentencing.\n\nI wish to place on record my thanks to Ms Eleanor Price, appearing on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Simon Chevalier, representing the defendant under a Legal Aid mandate. Both have conducted their responsibilities with professionalism, ensuring procedural fairness despite the pressures of overburdened caseloads and recent administrative delays. The court notes again, with no little regret, that protracted negotiations around expert instruction delays occasioned avoidable adjournments, underscoring the need for systemic reform in public funding approval mechanisms.\n\nIn conclusion, I will direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, to be provided by the probation service, which will more fully assess your personal circumstances, risk factors, and amenability to community-based interventions. This report will also explore whether structured programmes addressing acquisitive offending, impulse control, and financial management are viable in your case. A detailed plan for possible unpaid work or rehabilitation activity requirements will be requested.\n\nBefore pronouncement of sentence, the court will receive all relevant material, including any further representations from defence or prosecution, and updated victim impact feedback, as appropriate.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued today, 18 October 2025, in Court 5 at Birkenhead Crown Court. The hearing has been conducted in open court in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A transcript of the proceedings will be maintained in the official record. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 do not apply in this case. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRKENHEAD  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. 92765/2025  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge G. R.
