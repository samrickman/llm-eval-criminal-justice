MR H  \nCase No. CR2025/01467  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. Keating  \nFiled: 14 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced in relation to a charge of theft by shoplifting, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct which brings you before this court is characterised as a course of conduct involving multiple incidents spanning from mid-2023 to early 2025. The shops affected were situated primarily within the Brixton borough and adjoining commercial districts.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour case came to the attention of law enforcement following repeated reports made by local businesses, coordinated through the Brixton Business Crime Reduction Unit (BBCRU), a multi-agency partnership which includes police liaison officers, council enforcement staff, and local retailers. The BBCRU, despite enduring ongoing staffing and funding challenges, continues to maintain a central role in collating intelligence in respect of acquisitive offences. Your apprehension followed a detailed and prolonged surveillance operation involving plain clothed officers and covert observations at key retail locations during known shopping peak hours.  \n\nIt is worth recalling that the BBCRU’s procedural framework has evolved significantly since its establishment in 2012, aiming to ensure the swift identification and management of prolific offenders. However, such initiatives face ongoing obstacles, including limitations in inter-agency data sharing and resource allocation. This evidences broader systemic pressures on policing and local authority services, often manifesting as gaps in preventative activity or investigative follow-up, particularly in cases of non-violent acquisitive crime.\n\nAt your initial appearance on 21 February 2025, you entered a not guilty plea. The matter was adjourned for a pre-trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 18 March 2025, which was, however, further adjourned due to delays in securing legal aid funding for defence representation and expert psychological assessment. These administrative delays, while perhaps understandable given current pressures on the Legal Aid Agency, nonetheless have real consequences for the pace and fairness of proceedings. The court notes a recent internal review of Legal Aid processing times by the Ministry of Justice which acknowledged systemic backlogs contributing to protracted durations in criminal case preparation.  \n\nUpon renewed hearing on 12 May 2025, you indicated an intention to contest liability. However, following the service of an extensive disclosure pack including incriminating CCTV footage and forensic evidence relating to clothing fibres, you admitted guilt on 28 June 2025. It is pertinent to observe that your guilty plea was entered only days before the scheduled substantive hearing, sustained by an evident belated recognition of the strength of the Crown’s case. As established in R v. Westbrook [2019] EWCA Crim 1307, late pleas may often reflect tactical calculation rather than genuine remorse, warranting adjusted credit consideration.\n\nThe improvement of electronic evidence gathering and processing since the Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v. Farrow [2016] EWCA Crim 850 continues to challenge defence teams, as enhanced forensic techniques and automated CCTV analysis diminish the feasibility of contesting well-supported prosecution cases. This case is illustrative of these trends, where converging lines of evidence derived from varied technologies converge to build a composite account of offending behaviour.\n\nConcurrent with these proceedings, the court received a series of written submissions on your behalf from voluntary organisations including Brixton Outreach and the South London Welfare Coalition. These letters attest to your ongoing engagement with community support services and the considerable obstacles faced by individuals contending with chronic housing instability, employment barriers, and mental health difficulties in an increasingly precarious socio-economic environment. While commendable, such factors must be carefully weighed against the societal needs for deterrence, accountability, and protection of commerce.\n\nIt is also appropriate here to refer to the recurring strain on probation services in the Lambeth area, frequently noted in both national and local reports for challenges arising from increased caseloads and diminishing resources. The Probation Service’s efforts to provide meaningful supervision and rehabilitative interventions to individuals convicted of acquisitive crime remain praiseworthy, though system limitations inevitably constrain the scope and intensity of engagement.\n\nIn the matter of judicial process, the court makes record of a brief but notable delay on 9 September 2025 occasioned by the late arrival of the court clerk, resulting in a postponement of proceedings for approximately 45 minutes. While seemingly minor, such events further exacerbate the considerable cumulative pressures borne by the criminal justice system in this jurisdiction.\n\nThroughout these proceedings, the defence has been ably represented by Mr Oliver Grant, instructed under a legal aid order which, as previously noted, was not without delay in confirmation. The Crown has been represented by Ms Isabelle Khan, whose diligent and thorough presentation of evidence has been notable for clarity and proportionality.\n\nThe Crown's case was bolstered by the input of specialist crime analysts from the Brixton Digital Forensic Unit, who provided detailed breakdowns of data recovered from surveillance systems. This included mapping of your movements and times of presence near known retail targets. Such digital forensic capabilities reflect substantial investment yet also impose significant workload demands on relatively small specialist teams within the Metropolitan Police.\n\nThe facts of the case are as follows:\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nThe cumulative pattern of offending displayed a methodical approach, exploiting store vulnerabilities during busy hours. Property targeted primarily included personal care products and over-the-counter medications, items readily resold and frequently unguarded.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nYou engaged in a manner that often sought to avoid direct confrontation or detection, utilising casual demeanour and opportunistic timing, as described in victim impact statements submitted by retail staff.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nWitness accounts and recorded CCTV evidence showed a consistent modus operandi, which included the use of multiple garments to conceal goods and the exploitation of unattended till areas.\n\nThe current case must be understood in the wider societal context. Across the country, acquisitive crime presents a persistent challenge to law enforcement and communities alike. It is not simply an expression of economic hardship, but often reflects, at least in part, complex interrelations involving social dislocation, substance misuse, and in some instances, organised criminal enterprise. The court is reminded of the findings in R v. Amos [2020] EWCA Crim 894, where the Court of Appeal underscored the systemic impact of persistent theft on community confidence and the strain placed on policing resources.\n\nAt this juncture it is appropriate to address the contents of reports received from mental health professionals. Mr H was assessed by Dr Fiona Kane, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who provided a comprehensive report dated 1 August 2025. Dr Kane notes that while there is no diagnosis of major mental illness, Mr H exhibits features consistent with adjustment disorder compounded by episodic depressive symptoms. The report emphasises poor coping mechanisms in response to stressors including unstable housing and joblessness, suggesting these underpin risk-relevant behaviours. The report also alludes to a history of polysubstance use, though with no current dependence.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Mr H’s presentation does not fit neatly within the parameters of mental disorder warranting a hospital direction under sections 37 or 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983, as amended. This follows previous appellate guidance, including R v. Lander [2017] EWCA Crim 924, in which the Court emphasized the need for a balance between therapeutic intervention and public safety. Treatment opportunities should be pursued where feasible but must not displace accountability for criminal behaviour.\n\nMembers of the court will also recall institutional commentary on the increasing prevalence of trauma-informed practice within offender rehabilitation, as reflected in the Probation Service National Strategy 2023–2028. Such approaches encourage nuanced understanding of the interplay between past victimisation and offending patterns but are not substitutes for the obligations borne by individuals and communities.\n\nMrs Grace Llewellyn, a probation officer assigned as your supervising officer, submitted a pre-sentence report dated 10 September 2025. She notes your engagement with financial advice workshops and local employability services while also highlighting ongoing concerns relating to impulsivity and your inconsistent attendance at scheduled review meetings. Mrs Llewellyn recommends consideration of a community order inclusive of unpaid work, cognitive skills training, and structured accommodation support.\n\nTurning to legal precedent, the court acknowledges the principles articulated in the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences (effective 1 March 2020), which advocates for graduated sentencing proportionate to culpability, harm, and mitigating factors. The guideline highlights that persistence of offending, targeting of vulnerable victims, and failure to engage with assistance are all aggravating.\n\nThe court also notes the authority of R v. Moffat [2021] EWCA Crim 1579, where the Court affirmed the principle that sentencing must reflect not only individual culpability, but also the deterrent message to would-be offenders and reassurance to affected communities.\n\nCareful consideration was given to R v. Solomon [2018] EWCA Crim 1365, involving repeated theft from community pharmacies that led to substantial service disruption and distress. Although the offending did not involve violence, the Court described the psychological impact on frontline staff as a significant aggravating factor.\n\nThe court is mindful of the difficulties arising from simultaneous management of COVID-19 related operational constraints at the Brixton Magistrates’ Courts during the relevant period, which caused delays and necessitated novel remote hearing procedures. Such procedural adjustments, though necessary, have contributed additively to the wider context of resource pressure faced by the administration of justice.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nAn assessment of the broader institutional landscape reveals persistent challenges faced by ancillary agencies engaged in supporting victims of acquisitive crime, including the Brixton Retail Support Network and smaller business owners associations. Their submissions, while not formal victim impact statements, convey a measured concern about the cumulative consequences of repeated thefts on staff well-being and local economic vitality.\n\nInvestigations in this area underscore the complex balance between appropriate criminal sanction and proportionality, particularly where low-level offences recur without escalation to violence. The court is reminded, however, that the repetitive nature of offending can itself constitute an aggravating element.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\nContemporaneous correspondence from the Brixton Housing Advice Centre reports ongoing housing instability impacting Mr H, noting multiple failed tenancy agreements in the preceding two years. The centre expresses both empathy for your circumstances and frustration at the absence of sustained engagement with available support schemes.\n\nWhile social determinants play a significant role in the genesis of offending, the law must grapple with competing interests. Access to accommodation and services improves individual outcomes and can reduce recidivism but cannot absolve criminal responsibility.\n\nThe court further received documentation pertaining to a recent incident involving a co-defendant in an unrelated case, which, though superficially similar in nature, bears no direct connection to Mr H’s conduct or risk profile. That co-defendant’s involvement in a violent affray on 14 July 2025, resulting in a custodial sentence, is therefore extraneous to this sentencing exercise but illustrative of the variety of challenges confronting urban law enforcement.\n\nIn addition, mention must be made of administrative complexities impacting the Digital Evidence Recovery Unit, as they manage increasingly burdensome workloads extending beyond acquisitive crime into areas such as cyberfraud and child exploitation investigations. The multiplicity of such demands tends to delay investigative turnarounds, which unfortunately can prolong case progression.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  \n\nMr H's criminal record includes prior convictions for theft and possession of cannabis, dating back to 2017. None denote violent offending or offences involving weapons, and there is no intelligence suggesting gang involvement or coercion. Nevertheless, the cumulative nature of the record, combined with a pattern of non-engagement with early intervention programmes, is of relevance.\n\nThe defendant asserts some degree of familial support, albeit inconsistent. Affidavits received from relatives express hope for rehabilitation but acknowledge longstanding difficulties including parental separation and fractured sibling relationships. Such familial dynamics are commonplace and, while they may contribute contextually to vulnerability, do not excuse criminal responsibility.\n\nThis court is reminded by the observations in R v. Wilkes [2019] EWCA Crim 642, where reliance on family support as a mitigating factor was cautionary and subordinate to demonstrable behaviour change.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nRecent reports from the South London Substance Misuse Service, which you attended briefly, indicate partial compliance with prescribed interventions but also flag ongoing risks associated with recreational drug use. It is acknowledged that substance use can exacerbate impulsivity and associated risk behaviours.\n\nThe court echoes concerns arising from a report published by the National Offender Management Service in 2024, detailing the rising complexity of cases involving co-occurring substance misuse and mental health conditions and the consequent need for integrated service approaches.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s handwriting, as observed in letters submitted to the court, is neat and legible, demonstrating considered effort in communication, which the court notes is not always common in cases of acquisitive offending.\n\nTurning to matters of public safety and risk, the court is obliged to consider the potential for reoffending and the risk to local retailers and their staff. Given the pattern of repeat offending and the limited engagement with support services, despite multiple interventions, the risk cannot be characterised as low.\n\nThe court also records a recent letter from the local trader protection organisation, Lambeth Retail Watch, voicing concerns about “shoplifting ‘hotspots’” and calling for enhanced enforcement and community education initiatives.\n\nAt the same time, the court must acknowledge ongoing efforts by local policing teams, notwithstanding chronic understaffing and high rates of attrition within the Metropolitan Police, as referenced in the 2025 Police Federation annual report.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nThe defendant has taken some steps to demonstrate awareness of the impact of his offending, as articulated in a letter of apology addressed to the owners of one affected pharmacy. While such gestures are only one element in a broader rehabilitative process, they are noted.\n\nThe court also received a detailed psychological evaluation submitted by Dr Kane, which, while identifying some underlying vulnerabilities, ultimately emphasises the centrality of personal responsibility in addressing offending behaviour.\n\nRegarding sentencing options, the court has carefully reviewed submissions from counsel. The defence highlights mitigating factors including your age, lack of previous custodial sentences, unstable housing, and mental health considerations. The prosecution, by contrast, emphasises the persistent nature of offending, the impact on small businesses and staff, and the need for a deterrent.\n\nThe Sentencing Council’s guideline suggests that, in appropriate cases, community sentences with rehabilitative conditions, including unpaid work and cognitive behavioural interventions, may be more effective than immediate custody in reducing reoffending, particularly where vulnerability factors prevail.\n\nConversely, immediate custody remains available for cases exhibiting high culpability, poor compliance, or where previous community disposals have failed.\n\nThe court acknowledges the importance of a calibrated and proportionate sentencing response.\n\nIn anticipation of sentencing, this court has directed the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report, incorporating a risk assessment and evaluation of potential interventions suited to the defendant’s criminogenic needs.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Brixton. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant agencies. You are hereby informed of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIXTON  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. CR2025/01467  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M.
