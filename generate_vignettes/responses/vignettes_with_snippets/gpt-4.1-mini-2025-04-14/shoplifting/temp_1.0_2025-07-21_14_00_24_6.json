MR H  \nCase No. B2025/13459  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. L. CORMACK  \nFiled: 3 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in connection with charges arising from repeated thefts from retail establishments. These offences, taken cumulatively, fall under the auspices of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, and span a time frame commencing in mid-2023 and concluding with your arrest earlier this year. The offending predominantly affected stores within the Brighton and Hove locality, extending, on occasion, to neighboring districts.\n\nProcedural and Investigative Background  \nYour apprehension on 12 March 2025 followed an extensive period of investigation led by officers from the Sussex Police Property Crime Unit, operating in conjunction with the Brighton & Hove Retail Crime Partnership. This multi-agency collaboration promotes intelligence-sharing and victim liaison between law enforcement and commercial entities with a view to reducing acquisitive offences committed against local businesses. I note with approval the consistency of effort occasioned by this partnership, which stands as an exemplar relative to regions where communication between stakeholders is less reliable.\n\nThe initial reports of retail theft implicated an unidentified male attending various premises on the city’s main shopping thoroughfare. Over a period of nearly eighteen months, numerous complaints—submitted by both independent outlets and regional subsidiaries—began to form an evidential mosaic. Given the modest value of individual goods, significant detective input was nonetheless directed toward connecting these isolated events and identifying a pattern of criminal conduct. This involved hours of manual analysis of CCTV footage, cross-referencing transactions, and securing witness statements under pressing resource constraints exacerbated by county-wide policing staff shortages, a factor of no small consequence to the efficient administration of justice.\n\nThe investigative process involved cooperation between several civic departments, including city council licensing officers and the Sussex Community Safety Partnership. The cumulative expenditure of public funds, officer time, and ancillary forensic deployment should not be underestimated, reminding us that ostensibly “low-level” offences impose real costs. The Royal Borough of Sussex itself is currently grappling with escalating issues of street disorder and an increase in transient homelessness, which color the environment in which these offences took place.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nA formal interview under caution was conducted on 13 March 2025, during which you exercised your legal right to remain silent initially but subsequently engaged with the questioning. The police collected seizure items from your residence, including clothing and backpacks matching those captured on security camera footage.\n\nIt bears mention that your earlier interactions with law enforcement include a conditional caution in 2021 for a similar offence, at which time referral to voluntary support organisations was suggested but not pursued. Your criminal record also comprises multiple prior convictions for minor thefts, none involving violence or threats, but reflecting a troubling pattern of repeated acquisitive behaviour resistant to prior interventions.\n\nThe case management hearings were scheduled in adherence to the Better Case Management protocols, designed to reduce delay and support swift justice. The Crown’s application to consolidate multiple charges was granted, producing a single representative indictment for efficiency.\n\nThe plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 10 June 2025, at which you entered a guilty plea. It is regrettable that the plea was not entered earlier; while full credit is not foregone, the court notes that remorse and acceptance of responsibility are better evidenced by early admissions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nThe Crown’s legal representative, Ms Philippa Durrant, conducted her submissions with due diligence and professionalism. Mr Samuel Reed, appearing on your behalf under a Legal Aid order, advanced mitigation emphasizing your current unstable housing status and underlying mental health considerations, aspects well documented in the court bundle.\n\nIt is only fitting to express thanks to these barristers for their conscientious advocacy. The support staff and court officers at this venue have also performed admirably, notwithstanding recent refurbishments to the courtroom infrastructure which, while ultimately beneficial, caused inevitable disruption to scheduling and witness availability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nLegal and Sentencing Framework  \nAs the court is well aware, section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the foundational statutory provision governing theft offences. Jurisprudence over the past half-century has solidified the interpretive contours of dishonesty, intent to permanently deprive, and appropriation.\n\nWhile theft is commonly perceived as a ‘victimless’ crime, this reflects a profound misconception. The impact on individual retail staff, shop owners, and the broader community can be substantial, both in terms of financial loss and the psychological toll engendered by repeat offending. The case of R v. Bradley [2017] EWCA Crim 2156 elucidates that repeated thefts from vulnerable small businesses may warrant custodial sentences despite low monetary value in individual transactions.\n\nFurther elaboration was provided in the Court of Appeal decision R v. Grayson [2019] EWCA Crim 789, which held that persistence and calculated targeting of businesses, including pharmacies and independent grocers, increased the gravity of offences.\n\nMoreover, the Sentencing Council guidelines (theft offences) now emphasize that offences involving the exploitation of vulnerable workers or repeated victimisation of smaller, less resilient commercial premises constitute aggravating features.\n\nI remind counsel and the defendant alike that community-based sentencing options remain a central pillar of the criminal justice system; however, these are only appropriate where there is a realistic prospect of rehabilitation without compromising public protection.\n\nReference must also be made, however tangential, to several relevant appellate authorities which, though not directly analogous, reinforce facets of sentencing jurisprudence regarding persistence, late guilty pleas, and the intersection of offending with mental health issues. For instance, in R v. Osman [2023] EWCA Crim 823, the Court considered the limits of reasonable accommodation when addressing offenders with impulse control disorders convicted of acquisitive offences.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nTurning to the probation service, I am mindful of the ongoing challenge they face in balancing comprehensive assessment with rising caseloads and limited resources. Nationally, reports indicate waiting times for community offender rehabilitation programmes have increased substantially, delaying access to vital services. Similar pressures apply within mental health services, where NHS waiting lists for adult psychiatric and psychological support stretch into months, a situation regrettably familiar to families and offenders alike.\n\nYour psychiatric report, submitted by Dr Anjali Sengupta, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, provides a measured evaluation of your mental health. Dr Sengupta notes a mild enduring depressive disorder and comorbid traits indicative of emotional dysregulation, compounded by sporadic substance misuse. The assessor expresses concern regarding your limited engagement with prescribed treatments and a tendency toward minimisation of risks, highlighting that this pattern may exacerbate reoffending risk if unchecked.\n\nI take note of the family letters entered into evidence on your behalf. Your sister, Ms Tara H, in a written statement dated 20 August 2025, describes your history of instability, aspiration for change, and contextual factors including loss of parental support during adolescence. The court accepts these factors are genuine and impactful but reiterates the fundamental principle that personal responsibility remains paramount.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nThe victim impact statements from affected stores, coordinated by the Brighton Retail Support Network, underscore the lived experience of repeated theft. Staff report heightened anxiety, reduced job satisfaction, and in some instances, altered shift rotas and store layouts as coping mechanisms. While no direct threat or violence was perpetrated, the emotional and economic damage should not be discounted. It is noted that one victim business reported a cumulative shrinkage amount exceeding £1,200 over the relevant period, a significant loss for a small independent retailer.\n\nOn the subject of victimology, it is salutary to recall the decision in R v. Furlong [2016] EWCA Crim 2108, where the court emphasised the importance of listening to victims’ voices in determining proportionality and public confidence in sentencing outcomes.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nThe court also takes note of non-offence related matters that have, perhaps unusually, featured in the case file. For instance, a co-defendant unrelated to you, but involved in a separate shoplifting prosecution arising from similar timings and locations, failed to appear for trial and is currently sought by police. This unrelated procedural issue does not affect the present proceedings but underscores the challenges policing faces with transient offender cohorts.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant’s former roommate, found to be in possession of illegal substances during an unrelated police search in late 2024, has been subject to separate proceedings. Such collateral details, while part of the broader narrative tapestry, must not distract from the individual’s own actions and culpability.\n\nFurthermore, the landlord of the property where you resided for much of the period under scrutiny was, during 2024, the subject of a noise abatement order issued by the city council. While of peripheral interest, this bears no material connection to the matters before us.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nRisk and Rehabilitation  \nYour case presents a complex constellation of risk factors. The absence of serious violence or use of force suggests a lower risk level, yet the frequency, planning, and persistence of the offending weigh against complacency. The Probation Service’s pre-sentence victim impact and risk assessment report, submitted jointly with Dr Sengupta’s clinical evaluation, recommend a medium-risk classification pending further engagement.\n\nOf significance is the non-engagement to date with available support services, despite multiple agency offers. This disengagement has included the refusal of referrals to the local Drug and Alcohol Recovery Service and a community-based mental health team, both of which stand ready to offer treatment and supervision aimed at reducing reoffending.\n\nThe court is acutely aware that the space for effective intervention depends largely on the defendant’s cooperation. Absent that, community mechanisms lack force. It is especially regrettable given the manifold voluntary sector organisations in the Brighton area, such as the Sussex Outreach Initiative and the Community Reintegration Alliance, whose unheralded work supports client reintegration and addresses some of the more intractable drivers of acquisitive crime.\n\nIt is also pertinent to mention the strain placed on the local retail sector by repeat shoplifting, which compounds the ongoing economic uncertainty following the pandemic years. Many small businesses operate on narrow margins, and losses such as those described in victim impact statements jeopardise employment, community vitality, and the informal social networks embedded in local commerce.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nThe court acknowledges your stated difficulties with stable accommodation, which undoubtedly compound stress and may contribute to offending pathways. That said, the court must balance compassion with the necessity of reflecting the gravity of your actions and their impact on others.\n\nDelay in these proceedings due to the securing of funding from the Legal Aid Agency to instruct Dr Sengupta was protracted, resulting in a postponement of six weeks. This exemplifies systemic challenges faced by practitioners in preparing robust mitigation and comprehensive assessments, obstacles regrettably not uncommon in cases requiring forensic psychiatric input.\n\nSeveral hearings, scheduled initially without expert reports, involved adjournments as counsel awaited documentation. Whilst unavoidable, such delays impose a burden on all parties and highlight the need for reforms to streamline administrative authorisations.\n\nSentencing Outlook and Next Steps  \nThe offences admitted before the court are serious in their effect and reflect a disturbing persistence despite prior warnings and intervention opportunities. While no physical violence or threat was involved, the cumulative harm impacts victims’ wellbeing and undermines community trust.\n\nMitigating factors include the absence of a significant criminal history beyond similar offences, your current health difficulties, and a guilty plea entered at the earliest practicable stage following disclosure of key evidence.\n\nAfter full consideration, I will order the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report to assist the court in determining an appropriate sentence. Such a report should include recommendations regarding your suitability for community orders incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements, the potential for cognitive behavioural programmes addressing acquisitive offending patterns, and accommodation support.\n\nProbation is also asked to assess the feasibility of integrating debt advice and employability support into any proposed order to address offending triggers effectively.\n\nI do not pre-judge the content but expect the report to address the issue of risk, community safety, and possibility of compliance comprehensively.\n\nThe court reiterates its commitment to balancing the imperative of public protection with proportionality and fairness, all within the framework established by the Sentencing Council’s guidelines and relevant case law.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 3 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Brighton. Proceedings have been recorded pursuant to Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no current reporting restrictions enacted under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.
