MR H  \nCase No. B2025/15367  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. F. Ashcroft  \nFiled: 11 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for offences of shoplifting, each charged under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from a course of offending spanning some eighteen months across various retail establishments within the Bristol city centre and neighbouring district commercial zones. The nature of these offences, though limited in pecuniary value individually, must be considered cumulatively, reflecting a persistent pattern of dishonest conduct.\n\nProcedural Background  \nYour initial appearance in magistrates’ court was recorded on 14 March 2025, following your arrest on 8 March. The investigation was spearheaded by members of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary in conjunction with retail loss prevention teams and the Bristol Business Crime Reduction Partnership. The police received multiple reports from local retailers noting a recurring individual matching your description who was observed acting suspiciously in the course of alleged thefts. Several stores initiated review of their CCTV systems pursuant to protocols recommended under the Home Office’s ‘Shoplifting Reduction Framework,’ which seeks to enhance data sharing between retail and law enforcement agencies.  \n\nThis case was escalated from magistrates’ court to the Crown Court on 18 June 2025, following a plea and trial preparation hearing held on 3 June 2025, pursuant to the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative, designed to streamline the progression of cases requiring detailed pre-trial preparation, including forensic evidence collation and expert reports. It is a matter of legitimate note that the BCM framework continues to represent best practice, though notwithstanding occasional delays attributable to resource limitations, it acts as the backbone for efficient case handling in the modern criminal justice system.  \n\nAt a hearing on 22 July 2025, your solicitor applied for an adjournment to secure psychiatric assessment and reports, given indications of underlying mental health issues potentially relevant to sentencing. I acknowledge the cooperation of Dr Miriam O’Connell, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Bristol Mental Health Trust, whose report was submitted on 5 September 2025.  \n\nAs this court has often observed, the volume of shoplifting cases occupies a significant proportion of prosecutorial and court resources. The prevailing pattern, both locally and nationally, adheres to a stratified charging model, wherein persistent offending, especially involving repeat visits to the same or allied premises, merits enhanced scrutiny and an escalated custodial threshold in appropriate cases. The rationale is not, and cannot be, solely punitive: it is equally founded on the need to deter recurrence, to protect vulnerable victims—often low-paid retail workers—and to safeguard public confidence in lawful conduct. Such policy considerations are salient here.  \n\nThe Crown, appearing by Ms Eleanor Whitmore, prosecuting counsel, submits that your conduct was deliberate, sustained, and reflective of a particular modus operandi. The defence, led by Mr Graham Leverett of counsel, does not dispute the findings but invites the court’s consideration of mitigating factors relating to your personal circumstances and mental health.  \n\nCredit and Plea Context  \nYou initially pleaded not guilty at the first Crown Court hearing on 3 June but subsequently changed your plea to guilty on 26 August 2025, immediately upon commencement of the arraignment in this court. The timing of this plea is material to the assessment of credit. The law regarding plea discount is well established in key decisions such as R v. Clerk [2023] EWCA Crim 852 and R v. Clarke [2021] EWCA Crim 1120, both reaffirming that the plea credit is a recognition of the benefit conferred on the administration of justice by early acceptance of responsibility, not a mere mechanical reduction.    \n\nLate pleas, as here, while better than no plea, attract reduced credit. This court is disinclined to view the late guilty plea as demonstrative of exemplary remorse or cooperation, but it does acknowledge the value it confers in avoiding a contested trial and the attendant distress to witnesses.  \n\nIn line with standard procedural practice, pre-sentence reports are awaited and will assist the court in the final determination of sentence. I express my gratitude to Mr David York, Probation Service officer, for his preliminary assessments which have been instrumental in framing the issues for consideration.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe facts, as established through agreed case statements and undisputed evidence, indicate repeated thefts from a variety of retail outlets, including but not limited to independent pharmacies, small convenience stores, and department store outlets specialising in toiletries and personal care products.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nNoteworthy is the consistency in your approach: the use of reusable bags to conceal goods, timing with staff shift changes or moments of distraction, and occasional removal or tampering with security tags in an attempt to circumvent detection. This reflects a calculated awareness of store operating procedures and security measures.  \n\nIt is incumbent to observe the burden placed upon retail staff who, while not direct victims of violence or personal threat, nonetheless experience adverse consequences in the form of heightened stress, reduced morale, and in some cases, enforced changes in working patterns to mitigate risk exposure. Such impacts, though intangible in monetary terms, are no less real or worthy of recognition.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe court has received letters of representation from the Bristol Retail Workers’ Association, conveying concern regarding the damaging effects of repeat shoplifting on the retail workforce, many of whom face precarious employment conditions, exacerbated by the pressures of increased security responsibilities. This court notes with respect the considered advocacy of the Association on behalf of its members.  \n\nEqually pertinent is a submission from the St. Augustine’s Community Trust, a local charity engaged in outreach to individuals exhibiting patterns of acquisitive offending linked to socioeconomic deprivation. The Trust’s written representations provide context, including the overlapping challenges of housing instability and educational disruption faced by many residents in the affected neighbourhoods. While these factors do not excuse offending, they frame it within a broader social narrative that the courts must consider carefully.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe psychiatric report prepared by Dr O’Connell offers an insightful clinical perspective. It notes that you suffer from moderate depressive disorder compounded by episodes of significant anxiety, neither of which meet the threshold for severe mental illness but which nonetheless bear upon your impulse control and capacity to weigh long-term consequences.  \n\nDr O’Connell emphasises that your engagement with mental health services has been intermittent and that, while there is potential benefit from further psychological support, the prognosis is guarded in the absence of sustained participation. This assessment dovetails with probation reports indicating a history of disengagement from offered rehabilitative services.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nIt is the recognition of such clinical and social vulnerabilities that underpins the court’s commitment to exploring community-based interventions where appropriate, aligned with the principles elucidated in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline. Specifically, these principles mandate consideration of the offender’s personal circumstances without undermining the imperative to safeguard the public and to denounce persistent offending.  \n\nThe functional role of the Probation Service remains crucial. Yet, one must be candid that capacity constraints, staff shortages, and high caseloads persistently challenge effective supervision and intervention delivery. In Bristol alone, the Probation Service surplus of referrals awaiting allocation demonstrates the systemic pressures under which practitioners operate.  \n\nPublic safety and the maintenance of community confidence remain paramount. The Court is acutely mindful of the broader context: a rising tide in reports of acquisitive crime nationally [with an increase of 8.6% in retail theft reported across England and Wales in the 2024 calendar year, per Home Office crime statistics], straining policing resources and indirectly impacting more serious crime investigations.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nTurning to relevant case law, in R v. Gilmour [2022] EWCA Crim 1173, the Court of Appeal endorsed a strict approach to sentencing for repeated theft offences, affirming custodial sentences where previous community sentences and interventions had failed to effect change. The rationale rests not only on punishment but on the protective function of custody in cases where public deterrence is pressed.  \n\nSimilarly, R v. Finnigan [2021] EWCA Crim 876 emphasises the court’s role in balancing the offender’s personal circumstances with the demonstrable need for deterrence, particularly where offending undermines small businesses dependent on the goodwill of local communities. Although the principal offence there entailed aggravated burglary rather than shoplifting, the sentencing approach informs the broader jurisprudence on property offences.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nYou have four prior convictions, three of which pertain to theft-related offences, the most recent dating from 2023 when you received a conditional discharge. The court has considered carefully the cumulative effect of this history alongside the present matters. Your pattern of cycling through diversionary schemes before resuming offending compels a firm response.  \n\nWhile the defence advances accounts of socio-economic difficulty, including insecure housing and episodic unemployment, the court is constrained by the overriding principle that poverty does not confer immunity from the law. The question before me is not whether your circumstances are regrettable — that they plainly are — but whether those circumstances sufficiently mitigate culpability to justify deviation from the sentencing norms applicable to repeat offenders.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nI have also reviewed material provided by your family, including letters from your sister and a local community outreach worker, both of which attest to your sometimes difficult upbringing and current struggles. They highlight your expressed remorse and desire for change. While such representations are admirably supportive, they must be weighed carefully against your persistent failure to desist.  \n\nThere is an inherent tension in the court’s role: to balance compassion for personal hardship with the imperative to uphold the rule of law and to protect the community. That tension is particularly acute in cases such as this, set against a background of stretched public services and limited rehabilitative capacity.  \n\nAs to sentencing options, the court will await the full pre-sentence report to inform its judgment. The report is expected to canvass avenues including cognitive-behavioural programmes, financial advice support frameworks, and the viability of a community order incorporating an activity requirement and unpaid work. Consideration will be given to the potential for Mental Health Treatment Requirements, contingent on your engagement with services going forward.  \n\nFurther, the sentencing guideline for theft offences under the Sentencing Council directs that where offending involves repeated episodes, escalating in frequency or seriousness, custodial sentences become appropriate, particularly where prior sentences, including community disposals, have failed to deter.  \n\nThe court notes, with regret, the ongoing difficulties presented by delays within the Legal Aid Agency. Your representation has been disrupted by protracted administrative delays in securing funding for expert reports and defence preparations. While these have not compromised your right to a fair hearing, they illustrate systemic weaknesses worthy of institutional attention.  \n\nIt is also worth recording the court’s appreciation of the diligent work of the local police investigative team, whose meticulous gathering of CCTV records, witness statements, and forensic analysis, including fingerprint recovery and tagging scan cross-referencing, has been critical in building a robust evidential case. Such work, often unrecognised, merits formal acknowledgement for its professionalism and dedication despite limited resources.  \n\nI further acknowledge the contributions of the court ushers and support staff in ensuring the smooth conduct of proceedings today, as well as the presence of your legal team, who have fulfilled their duties with professionalism.  \n\nI must also observe that this court sits in the Bristol Crown Court, a jurisdiction noted for its handling of a broad range of criminal matters and for its commitment to upholding both public safety and defendants’ rights. The court understands that cases such as yours exist within broader societal currents — including increasing urbanisation, fluctuating economic fortunes, and evolving patterns of criminality. It stands ready to impose sentences reflecting both individual accountability and systemic context.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 11 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be sent to the relevant authorities as a matter of course. You are advised that you have a right of appeal against sentence and conviction within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 respectively. No separate reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. \n\nSentencing will be adjourned pending receipt of the pre-sentence report and any supplemental psychiatric assessments. No orders as to costs are made at this stage. \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.

I express my gratitude to Mr David York, Probation Service officer, for his preliminary assessments which have been instrumental in framing the issues for consideration.  \n\nMr H was witnessed removing the tags from £13 worth of makeup and tucking it into his inner pocket before leaving the store without payment.  \n\nThe facts, as established through agreed case statements and undisputed evidence, indicate repeated thefts from a variety of retail outlets, including but not limited to independent pharmacies, small convenience stores, and department store outlets specialising in toiletries and personal care products.  \n\nProtein powder and razor cartridge packs were placed in Mr H's niece’s pram as a means of concealment.  \n\nNoteworthy is the consistency in your approach: the use of reusable bags to conceal goods, timing with staff shift changes or moments of distraction, and occasional removal or tampering with security tags in an attempt to circumvent detection.
