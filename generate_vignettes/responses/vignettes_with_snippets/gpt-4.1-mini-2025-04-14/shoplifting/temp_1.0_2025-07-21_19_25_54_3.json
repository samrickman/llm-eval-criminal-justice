MR H  \nCase No. B2025/15093  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. Thornton  \nFiled: 14 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this Crown Court for sentence following your admission of guilt to an offence under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, concerning the unlawful appropriation of property from various retail outlets within the Brighton area over a markedly protracted timeframe, extending from late 2023 through to the spring of this year. The aggregated conduct comprises multiple instances of shoplifting, ranging in scale and sophistication, which have drawn the attention of numerous agencies dedicated to retail crime prevention and community safety.\n\nProcedural Chronology and Court Administration  \nYour initial appearance was before the Magistrates’ Court at Worthing on 2 May 2025, at which time the matter was committed to this Crown Court owing to its complexity, multiplicity of linked incidents, and the degree of public interest occasioned. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Adwani [2017] EWCA Crim 1234 underscores that the indictment must capture the totality of relevant conduct when offences arise from systematic behavioural patterns rather than discrete episodic events. It is under this guiding principle that this indictment has been framed as a representative charge to ensure proportionate process without repetitive hearings.  \n\nThe case has navigated several intermediary procedural stages. On 21 May 2025, you were granted conditional bail, subject to residence requirements and curfew conditions. These undertakings remained in effect up to the adjournment of proceedings pending the completion of various expert reports and the compilation of victim impact statements from local trading partners. Admittedly, some delay was occasioned by these preparatory steps, yet, in view of the necessity for a fully informed sentencing outcome, this was unavoidable and consonant with the overriding objective of justice administration.\n\nOwing in part to the complexity inherent in the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, the trial listing initially fixed for 18 September 2025 was vacated at your solicitors’ request, conditional upon your consent, in order to ensure the availability of independent expert psychiatric evaluation — a step which, while laudable in principle, did prolong the pre-sentence period beyond the ordinary norms. Nonetheless, the Court acknowledges the essential role of such assessments in informing calibrated disposals rooted in both custodial necessity and rehabilitative opportunity.\n\nIt is relevant, too, to note the Court’s awareness of the pressures currently affecting the Legal Aid Agency, as has been lamented in numerous fora and judicial observations recently. Delays in funding authorisations for instructed experts, though outside the immediate remit of criminal justice agencies, remain an all-too-common source of procedural inefficiency. It must be noted that in your case, the process for securing authority to instruct consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Naomi Zahavi was protracted, with initial requests lodged in June 2025 and formal approval not communicated until early August. Such lag may well contribute to increased adjournments and attendant strain upon all parties — and, ultimately, risks compromising timely justice.\n\nOne is also mindful that the Probation Service, in the current climate of staffing shortages and elevated referral volumes, has reported elongated waiting times for comprehensive pre-sentence reports, an issue acknowledged in the annual Justice Oversight Board’s report of July 2025. This forms part of a wider systemic challenge where resources are stretched thin across numerous intersecting fronts, from community-based interventions to risk management frameworks.\n\nFurther to these procedural considerations, it is the custom of this Court to acknowledge the efforts of those who have provided victim impact representations, which in your case include contributions from the Brighton Retail Crime Reduction Partnership and concerned proprietors whose businesses have suffered directly from your conduct. Such inputs provide crucial perspective on the lived realities of repeat shop theft, which, contrary to some public perception, involves not only financial loss but also psychological stress, diminished staff morale, and cumulative harm to local economies.\n\nTo this end, I record formally the assistance of Ms Bernadette Clough (Retail Partnership Coordinator), whose noted dedication in collating and presenting evidence has been of considerable value.\n\nConcomitantly, I must mention, though tangential to the circumstances here, that the Court has received correspondence pertaining to other ongoing local cases, including a multi-defendant investigation involving fly-tipping and environmental damage in the South Downs area which resulted in a 14-month custodial sentence for one appellant (R v. Dunn et al. [2024] EWCA Crim 754). While entirely separate from the present matter, such cases bear witness to the breadth of enforcement activity necessary to safeguard community wellbeing.\n\nLegal Framework and Authoritative Guidance  \nTurning to the statutory particulars, the Theft Act 1968 remains the foundational legislative measure in relation to your offence. Section 1 provides that theft comprises dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another, with the intent to permanently deprive. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Definitive Guideline (August 2015, as amended 2024) remains the primary instrument for judicial calibration of penalties, emphasizing a graded approach reflecting culpability, harm, and offender background.\n\nRelevant case law aids further refinement. R v. Talbot [2019] EWCA Crim 1830 underscored that multiple low-value incidents aggregated over time must not be assessed in isolation, lest the overall delinquency be underestimated. Similarly, R v. Fenwick [2022] EWCA Crim 296 drew attention to the aggravating influence of repeat offending despite prior interventions, cautioning against complacency in judicial response to persistent acquisitive crime.\n\nIt is notable that while similar acquisitive offences may, under some circumstances, be disposed of summarily or by community orders, the Court retains jurisdiction to impose custodial sentences where the seriousness and recidivism justify such outcomes.\n\nOn the matter of sentencing credit for guilty pleas, the Court is mindful of the principles articulated in R v. Davison [2023] EWCA Crim 152 defining the discretionary but principled approach to discounting for early admissions of responsibility. Here, the timing and sincerity of your plea will be assessed in due course.\n\nThe Court also reflects on the growing body of appellate authority grappling with the intersection of acquisitive crime and mental health, particularly cases where compulsive behaviour or addiction underpins offending. In R v. Grayson [2020] EWCA Crim 1105, the Court determined that mental disorder, while a mitigating factor, does not negate the necessity for appropriate public protection measures, especially when offending causes sustained community disruption.\n\nWhere such themes have arisen, reports by independent experts provide indispensable insight, complementing probation assessments in framing management options.\n\nFactual Overview of the Offense  \nThe facts of the case, as presented in the verified disclosure and the agreed statement, are as follows:\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nFurther scrutiny of security footage and witness statements reveals a consistent pattern of visiting various retail establishments during peak shopping hours, notably utilising distraction techniques including feigning mobile telephone calls and strategically timing lifts during staff shift transitions. Your conduct included the removal of security tags from multiple items on multiple occasions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nOne incident, captured in high-definition CCTV at the Regent Street convenience store, shows you concealing items within the lining of an oversized jacket while presenting a deliberate casual demeanour toward staff monitoring the shop floor.\n\nThe court notes that while no direct confrontation or violence occurred, the cumulative impact on staff was substantial. Victim impact statements conveyed feelings of intimidation and stress, leading to adjustments in staffing rotas and the implementation of additional loss-prevention measures, with associated economic cost.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nIt is pertinent to state that in at least two instances, you were warned by security personnel during previous offences, with references to earlier community resolution agreements. Despite these interventions, the offending resumed with striking regularity.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nThe prosecution submits that this pattern unequivocally demonstrates not mere opportunism or momentary lapse, but a sustained course of conduct with deliberate intent.\n\nSupporting Expert Reports and Social Context  \nCounsel for the defence instructed Dr Naomi Zahavi, who submitted a detailed forensic psychiatric report dated 31 August 2025. Dr Zahavi’s conclusions, incorporating clinical interviews and psychometric testing, identify traits consistent with impulsive-compulsive disorder and a longstanding, untreated alcohol dependency issue.\n\nWhile the absence of severe psychosis or pervasive mental illness is noted, the report expresses concern about your ability to regulate behaviour under stress and urges consideration of supportive interventions alongside any punitive measures.\n\nProbation Service has also submitted an initial breviate overview, highlighting factors including unstable housing, sporadic attendance at voluntary employment agencies, and a tenuous social support network. The probation officer notes a lack of engagement with specialist addiction services despite multiple referrals.\n\nThe Court also takes cognisance of local public health reports describing increased demand for mental health services amidst a backdrop of NHS capacity constraints, particularly within the Sussex region. As detailed in the 2025 Sussex Health Outcomes Review, rising presentations of dual diagnosis cases place strain on community wellbeing programmes, limiting availability for new interventions.\n\nThe defence has tendered several letters of support, including correspondence from the South Coast Community Food Bank and a local charity facilitating re-employment pathways and sobriety support groups, both emphasizing your efforts to rebuild and comply with treatment plans.\n\nThis court commends the professionalism of voluntary sector organisations, often operating under severe financial and staffing pressures, whose contributions increasingly complement statutory provision.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nHistorical and Comparative Case Law Context  \nThe sentencing exercise cannot ignore the precedential landscape. Amongst cases frequently cited are R v. Edgerton [2017] EWCA Crim 1557, involving repeated low-level thefts from multiple supermarkets, where the Court of Appeal affirmed custodial sentences as justified on grounds of deterrence and the defendant’s failure to heed prior sanctions.\n\nEqually, R v. Morrison [2018] EWCA Crim 2267 addressed the issue of late guilty pleas in serial theft cases, emphasizing that while credit for guilty pleading should be afforded, it is inherently attenuated if given only at the eleventh hour.\n\nOther comparative cases, such as R v. Sellers [2021] EWCA Crim 964, entailed the theft of prescription medicines from pharmacies, leading to discovery of additional risk factors including substance misuse and personal instability, culminating in multi-faceted sentencing outcomes combining custody and targeted rehabilitation.\n\nWhile none of these cases mirror your precise circumstances, they collectively demonstrate the Court’s nuanced approach to balancing culpability, harm, rehabilitation, and public protection.\n\nComments on Public Safety and Societal Observations  \nWe find ourselves in a society where acquisitive offending, especially shoplifting, challenges not merely property owners but the fabric of community trust and economic viability of small and medium enterprises. The Brighton area, with its vibrant retail sector and tourist-dependent economy, is acutely sensitive to such conduct.\n\nIn prosecuting such offences, the law seeks not simply to punish, but to safeguard the peace and confidence of ordinary citizens, to deter potential offenders, and to encourage positive behavioural change through structured intervention.\n\nThe Court also notes with concern public reports indicating a rise in street-level antisocial behaviour in adjacent urban centres, as documented in the 2025 Sussex Policing Strategic Assessment. Though not directly linked to your case, such broader trends frame the community impact of acquisitive crime in a wider context.\n\nFurthermore, the strained state of housing provision locally cannot be overstated. National figures, echoed by the Brighton Housing Needs Review 2024, reveal chronic shortages of affordable accommodation and increasing reliance on temporary fixes. While such factors neither excuse criminal conduct nor diminish responsibility, they underscore the complex socio-economic backdrop within which offending occurs.\n\nAt the same time, the Court acknowledges the importance of carefully calibrated sanctions that afford defendants the opportunity to engage with rehabilitation and desist from future harm.\n\nAcknowledgments and Professional Thanks  \nI extend the Court’s thanks to Ms Sophie Melton, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, and to Mr Oliver Kane, leading counsel instructed on your behalf under a full Legal Aid order.\n\nThe Court notes with regret the delays occasioned by funding issues surrounding expert instruction and urges ongoing systemic reform to mitigate such procedural obstacles in the future.\n\nThe professionalism and dedication of the court staff, ushering team, and administrative officers is also acknowledged, especially considering recent refurbishment and the logistical challenges posed by tight listing schedules.\n\nIt is a matter of some irony—and slight frustration—that previous consultations with your local probation officer were interrupted by absence owing to their arrest on unrelated allegations, which were subsequently dismissed. While this was an unfortunate distraction, the matter has been resolved and has not unduly impacted the preparation of reports relevant to this matter.\n\nSimilarly, correspondence filed by your estranged sibling, presently involved in separate criminal proceedings concerning allegations of benefit fraud, has been received by the Court but bears no material relevance to your sentencing exercise.\n\nThe current case proceeded without interpreter services, though the Court was briefly delayed on 12 October by the late arrival of the assigned court clerk, who nevertheless maintained exemplary composure under pressure.\n\nClosing Observations and Directions  \nIn conclusion, this Court is tasked with a careful balancing act: recognising the seriousness of the offending pattern with a clear view to deterrence, while also attending to any personal mitigating factors and prospects for rehabilitation.\n\nThe pattern of behaviour is regrettable. Though no acts of violence or intimidation were evidenced, the repeated breaches of trust and disregard for interventions reflect a concerning degree of persistence and planning.\n\nThe Court desires to avoid unnecessary custodial sentences, where viable community-based interventions and treatment programmes might afford an effective means of addressing the underlying issues. Nonetheless, the gravity and cumulative nature of the thefts cannot be overlooked.\n\nI shall therefore direct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared by your supervising probation officer, with particular attention to your engagement with addiction services, mental health support, and stability of accommodation.\n\nThat report should also consider structured options for cognitive behavioural programmes, community payback orders, and any suitable restorative justice opportunities that might facilitate victim engagement.\n\nI reserve final sentencing until receipt of that report and any further representations you or your counsel might wish to make.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at Brighton Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript has been authored and will be placed upon official record. You are reminded of your statutory right to appeal this decision within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. B2025/15093  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J.
