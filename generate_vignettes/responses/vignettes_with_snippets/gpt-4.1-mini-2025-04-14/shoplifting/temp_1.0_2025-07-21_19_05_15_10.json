MR H  \nCase No. T2025/14639  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. K. Prentiss  \nFiled: 14 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you are before this court charged with offences of theft from retail premises, specifically multiple counts constituting shoplifting, committed over an extended period within the Sheffield metropolitan area. The proceedings concern a course of conduct culminating in convictions under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968.  \n\nProcedural History and Initial Considerations  \nYou were arrested on 2 July 2025 following an investigation coordinated by the Sheffield City Centre Business Crime Unit, in conjunction with the South Yorkshire Police Safer Neighbourhoods Team and local security operatives. The catalysts for this inquiry were reports by several independent retailers noting a recurring pattern of loss attributed to a person resembling your description, which was corroborated through extensive CCTV surveillance.  \n\nWhile retail theft remains a commonly encountered offence before this court, this case is illustrative of the significant resource expenditure required to secure evidential sufficiency, particularly in the face of protracted and methodical offending. It is worth noting here the findings in R v. Hamilton [2019] EWCA Crim 1353, which observed the cumulative effect of repeated low-value offences on both public confidence and retail business sustainability. Hamilton cautioned against an unduly narrow reading of criminality confined solely to monetary harm, stressing also the emotional and societal toll borne by communities subjected to persistent acquisitive crime. These remarks resonate deeply with the facts now under consideration.  \n\nThe court must also register its appreciation for the engagement of the Sheffield Business Crime Reduction Partnership. Their shared intelligence gathering and coordination played a crucial role in constructing a coherent prosecutorial narrative, proving more efficacious than in many comparable cases which suffer from inter-agency disjunction. Notwithstanding periodic under-staffing and funding constraints impacting such partnerships nationally, this instance exemplified the benefits of multi-sector collaboration.  \n\nIt must be acknowledged with some regret that logistical challenges—among them the withdrawal of several legal aid solicitors across the region—necessitated a series of adjournments prior to the present hearing. This court is familiar with the pressures besetting the Legal Aid Agency, particularly with respect to the approval of funds for expert psychiatric evaluations or social work assessments. Indeed, the jurisdiction continues to await reforms adequate to counteract delays that impose stress not only on defendants but also on witnesses, victims, and judicial resources. The procedural history in your matter stretched from initial charge in July through to this, the sentencing hearing in October, encompassing multiple lists including plea hearings and pre-sentence report adjournments. Such timelines are, regrettably, neither untypical nor, at present, readily ameliorable.  \n\nLegal Context and Case Law Precedents  \nThe statutory framework under which this matter is considered remains principally the Theft Act 1968, section 1. Theft is, by definition, an offence of dishonesty, requiring proof that the defendant appropriated property belonging to another with the intent to permanently deprive. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences underlines the importance of offending behaviour patterns, the scale of loss involved, and the personal impact or vulnerability of victims. Applicable law also requires due consideration to mitigating and aggravating factors.  \n\nThe decision in R v. Elwood [2020] EWCA Crim 2277 is of particular note, as it addresses the issue of repeat offending in the context of low-value theft. There, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence imposed on an offender who targeted small shops over many months, highlighting the detrimental cumulative effect on victims and demographic communities. Moreover, Elwood draws attention to the necessity of a deterrent approach where prior interventions have failed to effect compliance.  \n\nIn construing the discretion to grant plea reductions, I have considered the jurisprudence in R v. Bentley [2022] EWCA Crim 1038, which reminds sentencing judges to make a nuanced assessment of plea timing. Early and unequivocal admissions can attract up to a one-third reduction in sentence, whereas last-minute pleas, especially those entered post-trial preparation or immediately before trial, warrant significantly smaller credit. The judge’s task is to balance the importance of incentivising guilty pleas without inadvertently rewarding tactical delay.  \n\nFurther afield, in R v. Meadows [2018] EWCA Crim 1594, the Court addressed the aggravating factor of offending proximate to vulnerable settings, though this element is not directly engaged in the present matter. Nevertheless, the sentencing principles laid down therein serve as a reminder that the context of offences may substantially bear on the appropriate response.  \n\nThe court also acknowledges the existence of the Better Case Management (BCM) procedures, operational since 2017 in Sheffield Crown Court. BCM aims to promote efficiency, reduce contested elements, and ensure timely exchange of evidence. Your case was managed according to these protocols, albeit with delays attributable primarily to Legal Aid processing and the arrangement of psychiatric assessments.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\nFacts of the Offending  \nThe offences for which you stand convicted comprise a series of thefts from multiple retail shops, predominantly in the Sheffield city centre area, executed over a period of approximately sixteen months. Extensive CCTV footage, witness accounts, and recovered items corroborate the sustained and deliberate nature of your conduct.  \n\nEvidence indicates that you regularly entered the premises bearing empty containers or bags, employing methods to conceal goods in a manner evincing experience with shop security measures. You are seen removing security tags on goods in some instances and exiting without presenting items for purchase. The recurrence and location of incidents suggest a degree of premeditation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  \n\nOn occasion, your accelerants included distraction techniques targeting store staff, exploiting moments of vulnerability such as shift changes or customer queues. You were observed wearing a distinctive blue hooded jacket, which featured in multiple incidents and was recovered at the time of your arrest. This personal identifier was pivotal in advancing the prosecution case.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  \n\nSeveral stores affected reported the cumulative effects on their operational viability, with management implementing altered staff rotas and increased deployment of security personnel. One complainant noted in a witness statement the “great distress” caused to employees fearful of confrontation or further theft. Nonetheless, there is no evidence you resorted to violence or threats in the course of offending.  \n\nVictim Impact and Specialist Assessments  \nIn reaching my determination, I have reviewed comprehensive victim impact statements prepared by both individual shop owners and representatives from the Sheffield Small Business Coalition. These documents articulate not merely the financial consequences of goods stolen but also the psychological effect on staff and community morale. Reports refer to apprehension in opening stores and the erosion of customer confidence in certain shopping areas.  \n\nOf particular relevance is the psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr Imogen Wright, consultant forensic psychologist, instructed to evaluate mental health and risk factors relevant to sentencing. The report, dated 27 September 2025, is detailed and professionally composed. Dr Wright concludes there is no evidence of a major mental illness or cognitive impairment that would diminish culpability. However, traits indicating impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and maladaptive coping mechanisms linked to socio-economic adversity are observed. The report further recommends engagement with community-based substance misuse services, noting a mild dependency pattern relating to alcohol.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nThe probation service provided a pre-sentence risk assessment dated 7 October 2025, highlighting medium risk of reoffending, largely attributable to entrenched behavioural patterns yet noting a stable housing situation and absence of criminal association. The report underscores the necessity of programmes aimed at improving decision-making and addressing underlying financial instability.  \n\nThe role of voluntary sector agencies in Sheffield merits acknowledgement here. Charities such as “Hand Up Sheffield” continue to work under considerable strain, providing vital services in food poverty relief, budgeting assistance, and mental wellbeing. Correspondence from their caseworker, Ms Helen Marks, submitted on 3 October 2025, expresses concern regarding the ongoing impact of acquisitive crime on local businesses. They similarly detail outreach efforts extending toward your case, indicating that opportunities for support were offered but not fully utilised. The court notes this with regret.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\nIt is also salient to record that the Sheffield Housing Partnership recently issued a noise abatement notice to the landlord of your current residence. While this has no bearing on your offending, it reflects a wider pattern of neighbourhood disturbances reported in the area.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  \n\nThe court is aware that managing acquisitive offending within vulnerable populations demands circumspection. The Stroud Review (2019) emphasised the imperative of layered interventions combining enforcement with therapeutic support. Still, the expectation remains that defendants avail themselves of assistance proactively. This has not been demonstrated in your case.  \n\nMoreover, in line with the practical realities observed in R v. Collins [2021] EWCA Crim 789, repeat offenders who do not sustain engagement with support services often precipitate indefinite cycles of custody and release, unmitigated general deterrence, and compromise community safety.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  \n\nPrevious Interventions and Antecedents  \nYou are 34 years old. The criminal record disclosed includes four previous convictions for similar offences of shop theft, the most recent dating from January 2024, resolved by a conditional discharge. Prior to that, a community order imposed in 2022 for theft offences was terminated prematurely due to non-compliance with appointment schedules. While you have made occasional assertions regarding family support and employment prospects, evidence before the court indicates that such claims are inconsistent.  \n\nYour reported living arrangements are stable but modest. You reside within public housing allocated by the Sheffield City Council, with no indications of substance misuse requiring specialist care beyond that identified by Dr Wright.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  \n\nThere is no evidence of gang involvement, coercion, or organised criminality influencing your conduct. Nor is there indication of coercive control or domestic abuse relevant to these proceedings. While the court recognises the profound effects of childhood trauma or adult hardship, these matters are peripheral to the specific charge before me, though they may be relevant to the tailoring of rehabilitative services recommended in the probation report.  \n\nSentencing Framework and Options  \nThe court acknowledges the mitigating factor of your eventual guilty plea, albeit entered late in the procedural timetable, which qualifies for a modest reduction in sentence. The appellate authorities referred to earlier caution against equating such pleas with genuine remorse where they follow prolonged denial. The principles of deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection must guide the ultimate disposal.  \n\nIt remains true that custodial sentences for shoplifting offences should be reserved for cases of marked seriousness, including repeated breaches, substantial financial loss, or where prior community sanctions have been defied. The possibility of imposing a suspended sentence order, accompanied by a rigorous community rehabilitation requirement, remains under consideration, subject to the forthcoming pre-sentence report’s recommendations.  \n\nI invite the probation service to consider options including a cognitive skills programme aimed at developing impulse control, alongside potential unpaid work requirements and financial advice services. The scope for restorative justice engagement should also be explored, though this would depend on victim consent and your willingness to participate meaningfully.  \n\nThere is a further point to be made about the broader context of acquisitive crime within this jurisdiction. The court, supported by the evidence provided by Miss Marks at Hand Up Sheffield and the Business Crime Reduction Partnership, is conscious of the mounting pressure such offending places on already stretched public services. The NHS mental health teams report increased waiting lists, with particular concern for individuals with complex social and behavioural needs. The Probation Service, meanwhile, struggles with caseloads expanded by rising demand, and the Legal Aid Agency’s procedural delays continue to hamper effective defence preparation in similar matters. These systemic deficiencies compound risks across the board.  \n\nRegrettably, the court must also note the delays occasioned in your case by successive applications for extension of time to obtain legal aid funding for expert instruction. Multi-agency collaboration, while laudable in theory, often functions at the mercy of administrative bottlenecks. These practical realities, although external to your conduct, impact the criminal justice system’s capacity to administer proportionate and timely justice.  \n\nFurther procedural history denotes that a hearing scheduled for 16 September 2025 was vacated due to the late delivery of Dr Wright’s report, itself delayed by staffing shortages in the clinical psychology department of the Sheffield Mental Health Trust. This episode exemplifies the current strain on public sector services serving defendants with complex needs. It is of passing interest that during the same fortnight, an unrelated arson case involving commercial premises in Court 5 significantly disrupted listing availability, pushing other matters, including yours, further into the future.  \n\nConclusion and Adjournment for Presentence Report  \nIn final summary, Mr H, you have been found guilty of persistent shoplifting offences, committed with deliberate intent, over a significant period. The adverse effects on victims and local businesses are well documented. Your previous convictions and historical non-compliance with community-based orders aggravate your culpability. While the psychiatric report does not find a major mental disorder, the behavioural profile indicates areas requiring intervention.  \n\nIt is vital for both you and the public interest that sentencing reflects the totality of your offending and the prospects for rehabilitation, as informed by a detailed pre-sentence report. This report must explore appropriate community sanctions, including cognitive behavioural interventions and support for any contributing social factors.  \n\nThe court reserves final sentencing until receipt and consideration of that report. Arrangements have been made for its preparation by the Probation Service, with a listing scheduled for 28 November 2025.\n\nI thank counsel for their submissions today. I also acknowledge the care with which the voluntary sector representatives have assisted the court in understanding the community impact of your offending.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are pronounced this 14th day of October 2025 in Court 6 at Sheffield Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal under sections 108 and 109 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No current reporting restrictions apply under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 or other statutory provisions.
