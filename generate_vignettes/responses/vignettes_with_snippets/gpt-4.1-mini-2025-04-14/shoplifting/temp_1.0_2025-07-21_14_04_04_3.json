MR H  \nCase No. B2025/14567  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. G. Farnsworth  \nFiled: 14 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this Court for sentence on a matter concerning theft from retail premises contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offence arises from a succession of shoplifting events reportedly occurring over a period of approximately 18 months within the Birmingham metropolitan area, including but not limited to districts such as Digbeth, Moseley, and Ladywood.\n\nProcedural Background  \nThe case has followed a somewhat protracted course through the criminal justice system. Initially charged on 2 February 2025 following investigative activity by local police and the Business Crime Reduction Partnership for Birmingham City Centre, the case proceeded under the direction of the Crown Prosecution Service’s Local Casework Unit. Plea hearings were scheduled and re-scheduled owing to several adjournments precipitated by both defence applications and administrative constraints.\n\nIt is appropriate to reflect on the wider context within which this case unfolds. Over recent years, acquisitive crime rates have exhibited fluctuations that correspond to socio-economic changes as well as policing priorities and community reporting behaviours. The role of multi-agency partnerships, such as those manifested in the Birmingham Retail Crime Initiative (BRCI), remains pivotal in gathering intelligence, coordinating preventive measures, and supporting victim businesses. These organisations operate under the strain of resource limitations, high case volumes, and the demand to balance immediate response with strategic foresight.\n\nExcursions into institutional observations further underline the fragility of current support frameworks. The Legal Aid Agency, for instance, has been subject to repeated criticism regarding the timeliness and consistency of its approvals for expert report instructions. In this matter, an early request for a forensic psychiatric assessment was delayed by over six weeks, despite clear indication of mitigating factors raised by the defence. Such delays have a cascading effect — impacting listing availability, prolonging custody durations, and inevitably placing strain on all parties concerned.\n\nA note must be made of the enduring challenge faced by mental health services, including the NHS Trust responsible for adult mental health provision in the West Midlands. Waiting lists for specialist assessments extend into months, and while intermediate support mechanisms exist, their efficacy is hampered by high demand and funding shortfalls.\n\nAgainst this institutional backdrop, the court must endeavour to deliver justice with both firmness and compassion, recognising the complexity but resisting the temptation to conflate structural issues with individual culpability.\n\nEngagement with the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol saw the initial case allocation on 16 February 2025, and subsequent listing for a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing (PTPH) on 10 March 2025. At that hearing, you entered a not guilty plea, though this was amended to guilty with effect from the first day of trial on 15 September 2025. The Crown elected not to proceed with a contested hearing, following extensive evidential disclosure and the arrival of forensic and digital evidence corroborating identification.\n\nThe timing of your plea results inevitably in reduced mitigation for acceptance of responsibility. It is, however, acknowledged that plea was unequivocal and entered in open court having had the benefit of legal advice. The discount available should be tempered in line with appellate guidance, including that laid down in R v. Simmonds [2020] EWCA Crim 1507.\n\nThe Crown, represented here by Ms Anne Dalrymple, has presented detailed submissions supported by CCTV footage, witness statements from retail employees, and multi-agency risk assessments. Defence representation is provided by Mr Oliver Brice, acting on a representation order. The court records its appreciation for their thorough advocacy under challenging circumstances.\n\nIt bears mention that this court has recently undergone refurbishment, including improved accessibility measures and enhanced technology for remote video links, which has been of some assistance given the fluctuating public health constraints and pilot digital initiatives.\n\nThe impact on victims has been set out in victim personal statements supplied through the Birmingham Retail Federation. These describe not only financial loss but the psychological burden borne by staff subject to repeated targeting and the feeling of insecurity engendered in the workplace.\n\nPrior to addressing the substance of offending, the court notes the devotion of volunteer organisations working in community support roles. Of particular relevance is the Birmingham Food Bank Network, whose representatives have written in to acknowledge the complex factors driving some individuals towards economic desperation, but who also underscore that support is available and that engagement with these services is essential.\n\nAnother institutional commentary pertains to the pressing concerns of the probation service, which currently is operating under significant staffing shortages and operational pressures. The availability of tailored rehabilitative programmes for acquisitive offenders, including cognitive-behavioural and motivational interventions, remains limited. This reality constrains the court’s options but does not obviate the need to attempt community-based disposal where appropriate.\n\nIt is also worth noting the evolving jurisprudence on sentencing discount and credit where mental health issues are present. The recent decision in R v. Elmhurst [2025] EWCA Crim 1234 reiterated that while underlying health difficulties may mitigate culpability, they do not exclude a proportionate custodial sentence where public protection and general deterrence demand it.\n\nMoreover, in R v. Clifford [2019] EWCA Crim 405, the Court underscored that repeated theft offences, particularly when involving vulnerable retail settings, require a measured but firm response. Although that case is factually unrelated to this matter, its legal principles remain pertinent in emphasizing the effect of acquisitive crime beyond mere financial calculation.\n\nA review of the Background Reports is germane at this juncture. Mr H’s recorded criminal history reveals three prior convictions for theft-related matters, all within the last five years. Notably, no offences of violence or drug distribution feature. Previous sentences have included community orders and a conditional discharge.\n\nSocial services records indicate a history of childhood instability, marked by periods in foster care and intermittent school attendance. Such information has been assessed and reflected upon by the Probation Service in their pre-sentence overview.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThis court has had the benefit of a psychiatric report from Dr Kamal Patel, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, dated 10 September 2025. Dr Patel observes that although Mr H does not meet the criteria for severe mental illness, there is evidence of emotional dysregulation, a history of substance misuse, and a modicum of chaotic lifestyle factors which have yet to be addressed fully through intervention. Dr Patel commends Mr H’s articulate self-reflection displayed during clinical interviews but warns of the risk of rapid relapse into harmful patterns post-release absent structured support.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nOutside the direct orbit of this matter, it is germane to mention the operational challenges faced by police digital forensics units, which have experienced increasing workloads partly arising from broader cross-jurisdictional tasking. The West Midlands Police Forensics Department handles thousands of devices annually, filtering data of investigatory value from mass stores of irrelevant personal communications. The time taken to process devices often delays case progress.\n\nIt is further observed with regret that the city has seen numerous instances of fly-tipping on designated Green Belt land, attracting enforcement priorities that sometimes conflict with retail crime investigation resourcing. Cases such as R v. Davies [2023] EWCA Crim 1890 serve as examples of the courts’ approach to environmental offences having a wider societal effect, although completely unrelated to Mr H’s conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe court has also reviewed letters from community organisations. The Moseley Social Outreach Group writes of the pressures of rising street homelessness in the Birmingham area and appeals for enhanced collaboration between statutory and voluntary sectors. While these concerns are of high social importance, they do not diminish Mr H's personal responsibility.\n\nLikewise, a statement from Mr H’s sister, Ms Fiona Clarke, has been submitted. She speaks to his struggles with addiction but also expresses hope for his rehabilitation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nI refer next to the procedural peculiarities that have marked this case’s timeline. On 28 April 2025, the listing centre notified parties of a delay owing to court room reallocation and conflicting hearing dates caused by strike action within the judiciary support staff. Such occurrences have become regrettably frequent, straining the administration of justice. The case’s adjournment length, albeit not excessive, reflects these systemic pressures.\n\nThe case management hearings have otherwise followed the expectations of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules (CrimPR) and the Judicial Studies Board guidance on Better Case Management. No pre-trial applications other than defence requests for psychiatric assessment were advanced.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nOn receipt of the psychiatric report, defence counsel submitted supplementary mitigation asserting compounding social vulnerabilities, including housing insecurity and intermittent employment history. These points, while relevant to sentencing disposition, must be balanced against deterrent considerations.\n\nDuring the trial course, the Crown placed particular reliance on the testimony of Ms Jane Whitmore, a retail manager at a store in Digbeth, who described clear disruption to business practices and staff wellbeing arising from repeated incidents attributed to Mr H’s conduct.\n\nOf ancillary note, a co-defendant named in an unrelated matter involving street-level drug supply in Ladywood remains at large following decision to proceed with separate proceedings. No connection is evidenced with Mr H beyond proximity of geographical area.\n\nSimilarly, a landlord of a property rented by Mr H was subject to a noise abatement notice due to unrelated tenancy disputes. Such matters have no bearing on the offence for which Mr H is to be sentenced but were disclosed in ancillary documentation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nThe Sentencing Guidelines Council, in their Theft and Handling guideline (2024 edition), emphasise several factors relevant here, including the offending pattern, harm to victims, and offender’s previous record. While the financial value of stolen goods may be modest, the repeated and deliberate nature indicates a criminal lifestyle requiring inhibition.\n\nInternational developments in rehabilitation models were briefly considered during sentencing workshops earlier this year. Some studies highlight cognitive reinforcing programmes as effective in reducing reoffending among acquisitive offenders. Whether such programmes can be widely implemented within present probation resources remains uncertain.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nIn assessing culpability, the court takes account of the careful summary of legal principles articulated in R v. Duncan [2024] EWCA Crim 1552, noting that persistent offending following community disposal inevitably merits escalation and that mere economic pressure rarely suffices as mitigation.\n\nFinally, the Probation Service’s pre-sentence report, received 7 October 2025, evaluated Mr H’s risk to the public as medium, highlighting his prior history of non-compliance with community orders and mixed record on engagement with previous support programmes. The report recommends that any community order should include intensive supervision and a rehabilitative element targeting acquisitive behaviour, as well as substance misuse components.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the court imposes a short adjournment for the preparation of a final pre-sentence report, taking into account all expert and social agency input. Following receipt, sentencing will be determined with the appropriate level of proportionality, considering all aggravating and mitigating features.\n\nThis hearing has been conducted in open court with all parties properly represented and in attendance. I thank Ms Dalrymple and Mr Brice for their clear submissions and professional conduct. The court also expresses appreciation for the probation officers, psychiatric experts, and victim liaison team whose work has informed these remarks.\n\nThese sentencing remarks have been prepared and filed on this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be retained for the record. Mr H is reminded of his right to appeal against any sentence passed within 28 days pursuant to the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 have been engaged. Costs are reserved pending sentencing.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.
