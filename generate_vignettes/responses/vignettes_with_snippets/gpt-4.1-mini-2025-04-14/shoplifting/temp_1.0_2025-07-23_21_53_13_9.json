MR H  \nCase No. M2025/14523  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. C. FINCH  \nFiled: 16 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on a charge of theft, specifically involving shoplifting from various retail outlets across the Greater Manchester area over a protracted period extending from late 2023 through to the spring of 2025. This matter has been transferred to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management scheme and is subject to the guidelines relevant for theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge before me represents a consolidated count capturing a series of individual offences which, while individually of modest value, taken cumulatively demonstrate a persistent and deliberate pattern of dishonest conduct.\n\nProcedural History and Court Listing  \nYour arrest was effected on 12 April 2025 following a months-long investigation coordinated between local policing teams and the Manchester Retail Theft Partnership. The investigation involved the collation of security footage from multiple retail premises, analysis of point-of-sale data, and interviews with store personnel. Of note, this case was delayed initially due to the defendant’s late disclosure of material to the defence and the difficulties experienced in securing timely Legal Aid authorisation for expert reports, a matter that caused adjournments between May and August of this year. Such administrative delays, while regrettable, are a frequent source of frustration in cases involving complex multi-agency cooperation.\n\nOn 30 June 2025, the plea and trial preparation hearing was conducted, at which point you entered a not guilty plea. This plea was maintained until early September 2025, when you changed your plea to guilty on the first day of trial. The lateness of this plea is a matter to which I will advert in the sentencing analysis. It is well understood that delays in entering a plea can impair the efficient administration of justice, placing avoidable strain on court resources and prolonging the distress experienced by victims and witnesses.\n\nThe hearing today follows the receipt of a psychiatric report dated 30 August 2025, prepared by Dr Helen Mallory, consultant forensic psychiatrist, and an up-to-date pre-sentence report prepared by your allocated probation officer, Ms Sarah Davies. I record my thanks to all professionals involved for their comprehensive reports and the candour with which they have approached the task.\n\nOperational Context and Wider Implications  \nBefore addressing the particulars of your offending, it is worth situating this case within the wider context of acquisitive crime in urban settings. The court is acutely aware of the strain that persistent low-level offending places on community resources, police capacity, and victim confidence. The Retail Theft Partnership in Manchester has highlighted a worrying trend of increased store losses attributed to a relatively small cohort of prolific offenders, demanding a response calibrated not merely to individual culpability but reflective of the systemic challenges faced by retailers and law enforcement alike.\n\nThe pressures on policing in Greater Manchester are well documented. The combination of reduced officer numbers, increased administrative burdens, and competing demands from serious violent crime investigations means that resources are often stretched to their limits. Each instance of shoplifting, while seemingly minor in isolation, contributes cumulatively to a dilution of investigative capacity that imperils the pursuit of more serious and intractable offences such as knife crime, organised drug distribution, and domestic violence. The court is cognisant of this unfortunate reality, though it must balance these concerns against the principle of proportionality in sentencing.\n\nFurther, the impact on victims cannot be understated. Retail employees—often young, low-paid staff—repeatedly face the anxiety of potential confrontation and financial strain experienced by their employers, the small business owners who often operate on the edge of viability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nSuch offences undermine a community’s sense of safety and economic resilience, a fact recognised in guidance issued by the Sentencing Council and reflected in case law. Though individual thefts may involve goods of limited monetary value, the psychological and operational costs can be substantial.\n\nLegal Framework and Case Law Review  \nTurning to legal principles, the fundamental offence is theft as defined in section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 — the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences (effective January 2022) provides a structured framework for courts to assess culpability and harm, taking into account factors such as the value and nature of the goods stolen, planning and persistence, use of concealment and accomplices, and the vulnerability or fear induced in victims.\n\nThe Crown relies on the principle that a course of conduct of this nature, involving repeated thefts and deliberate targeting of vulnerable small retailers, justifies a sentence commensurate with both the need for deterrence and public protection. The court has to consider aggravating factors including the defendant’s previous convictions for similar offences, refusal to engage meaningfully with support services, and impact on victims.\n\nIn R v. Brentwood [2023] EWCA Crim 1187, the Court of Appeal reaffirmed the approach to sentencing persistent retail theft offenders, noting that a custodial sentence is “not inevitable but may be necessary where there is evidence of planning, manipulation of store arrangements, or aggravating behaviour such as threats or intimidation.” That case involved multiple thefts from pharmacy outlets, not unrelated to the type of premises involved here, and was notable for its consideration of victim impact statements expressing fear and anxiety among shop personnel.\n\nSimilarly, R v. Connors [2021] EWCA Crim 615 upheld a sentence of 12 months’ immediate custody for a serial shoplifter who exploited self-service checkouts and distracted staff. The court recognised the cumulative harm on victims and local retail environments.\n\nDrawing from such authorities, this court is obliged to impose a sentence which is just in all the circumstances—balancing mitigation with the necessity to protect the public, including those employed in retail sectors vulnerable to your conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nCase Management and Adjournments  \nI note with some regret that this case was subject to several procedural adjournments placed largely at the behest of the defence. In particular, the grant of Legal Aid to enable the instruction of a forensic psychiatric expert was delayed by almost six weeks due to evidential clarifications sought by the Legal Aid Agency. This delay truncated the preparation interval available to counsel and necessitated a further hearing in July to review progress. Such delays are far from uncommon in modern criminal proceedings and reflect ongoing systemic challenges in the administration of criminal legal aid funding.\n\nI acknowledge that adequate time must be afforded to defendants to prepare their cases and that representation rights are sacrosanct, but the court expresses concern that habitual procedural delays in apparently straightforward theft cases risk undermining public confidence and burdening already stretched court lists.\n\nThe Greater Manchester Courts Reform Unit has recently implemented new protocols intended to expedite the listing of acquisitive crime trials, recognising that protracted delays disserve all parties and hinder the interests of justice. This includes guidelines for earlier psychiatric assessment referrals and mandated listing timetables. The current case predated the full implementation of these reforms but serves as a reminder of their necessity.\n\nVictim Impact and Community Response  \nRetail managers and staff affected by your actions have provided victim personal statements which speak to more than mere financial loss. One store manager describes how your repeated visits led to changes in staff working patterns, a reduction in lone working, and the installation of additional security measures at considerable expense. There is candid testimony about increased anxiety among employees, particularly younger workers worried about potential aggression during attempted thefts.\n\nI have considered a letter of support from the local branch of the Retail Workers’ Association, which highlights the toll that persistent shoplifting takes not only on business viability but on employee wellbeing and long-term community cohesion. Their representatives commend investigative teams for their diligence but lament the lack of consistent deterrence for repeat offenders and urge this court to impose sentences reflective of the real-world impact.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nSuch input is of significant relevance to the court’s consideration of harm, an element weighted heavily within the sentencing framework.\n\nPsychiatric and Probation Assessments  \nDr Mallory’s psychiatric assessment confirms that you do not suffer from any major mental illness or intellectual disability. She notes that you display traits consistent with impulsive behaviour and mild alcohol misuse, though you currently deny dependency. The report suggests a chronic pattern of acquisitive offending, driven in part by financial pressures and poor coping strategies. Significantly, the report highlights that you have declined voluntary engagement with addiction services or social support providers despite offers made through probation and community outreach.\n\nThe pre-sentence report authored by Ms Davies corroborates these findings, stating that your risk of reoffending is assessed as medium to high and that your motivation to comply with community orders appears limited. You live in temporary accommodation arranged by the local authority, with an unstable tenancy history. While your family background is described as fractured, no evidence has been presented that would indicate coercion or exploitation.\n\nMs Davies has recommended that if a community sentence is considered, it should incorporate cognitive behavioural therapy focusing on impulse control and acquisitive behaviour, alongside engagement with debt advice and housing support. However, she is clear that prior refusals to engage present significant obstacles to successful rehabilitation outside custody.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}. {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nThe court is mindful of the constraints faced by probation services, which have seen numbers of officers decline and caseloads increase. The pressures of managing complex cases such as yours amid these resource issues make sustained interventions difficult to deliver, but the prospect of structured rehabilitation remains essential for reducing risk.\n\nContextual Social Observations  \nIt would be remiss not to record the broader social context in which this offending occurs. Manchester, like many metropolitan areas, has suffered from economic shocks and increasing housing insecurity exacerbated by broader structural inequalities. The local authority reports significant homelessness and rough sleeping, while funding for voluntary sector agencies serving at-risk individuals remains precarious.\n\nThe community response to repeated acquisitive offences has involved enhanced partnership working among police, local authority housing teams, and third sector organisations. Initiatives such as diversion schemes, mental health triage, and early intervention panels seek to prevent escalation of offending patterns, though their capacity is limited.\n\nThe court acknowledges these contextual factors not as mitigation but as a backdrop to which individual accountability and public protection must be applied. It is a frequent temptation to ascribe criminality wholly to social deprivation or personal hardship, but experience teaches that many in dire circumstances do not offend. The choice to offend remains a matter within personal agency and bears consequence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nPrevious Convictions and Related Proceedings  \nYour criminal record discloses four prior convictions for theft-related offences, including two occasions where you received conditional discharges and one community sentence imposed in 2020. None involved violence or aggravation beyond dishonesty.\n\nNo co-defendants or associates appear from the evidence. Your sister, referred to in defence submissions and professional reports, is currently under investigation for an unrelated fraud matter, which has no bearing on the offence or your circumstances.\n\nI note, for completeness, that one of your former flatmates was found in possession of a controlled substance during an unrelated police search, which resulted in separate charges unconnected to these proceedings.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nNo application for sentencing under the dangerousness provisions has been suggested, nor is there any indication that enhanced supervision is currently warranted beyond normal probation protocols.\n\nConsiderations on Guilty Plea Credit  \nThe law on credit for guilty pleas is well established. An early plea can significantly reduce sentence to reflect acknowledgment of responsibility and savings to the public purse through avoided trial. Conversely, a plea entered at the last practicable moment, particularly when overwhelming evidence exists, attracts limited or minimal credit, as echoed in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 and R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145.\n\nIn this case, the change of plea at the opening of trial—after extensive preparation by all parties, service of full evidential bundles, and multiple adjournments to secure expert input—does not attract more than a modest reduction. The court regrets the additional burden such late pleas impose on victims, witness availability, and court resources.\n\nTaken together, all factors underscore the need to treat this matter with gravity.\n\nSentencing Options and Next Steps  \nThis court considers that the full range of sentencing options must remain open, from community disposal through to immediate custody. However, repeated offending, demonstrated lack of engagement with assistance, and the impact on victims weigh heavily in favour of a custodial approach, unless the pre-sentence report advises otherwise.\n\nYour personal circumstances, including housing insecurity and substance misuse, call for an integrated intervention strategy. The probation service is encouraged to recommend programmes addressing offending behaviour, alongside welfare support.\n\nThe court also notes the existence of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership across Greater Manchester, which continues to liaise with retailers and enforcement agencies with a view to preventing further offending and protecting local businesses.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nIt is clear that for your rehabilitation to be effective, any sentence must combine elements of deterrence, public protection, and support aimed at tackling root causes. Whether such a sentence can be fashioned outside custody is a matter for further investigation.\n\nConclusion and Adjournment  \nHaving weighed the evidence, considered the reports, and addressed the submissions of counsel, I am currently unable to conclude on the appropriate sentence. I therefore direct the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report incorporating any further relevant information, including risk assessments, personal circumstances, and rehabilitative prospects.\n\nThe matter is adjourned for sentencing on 22 October 2025 at Manchester Crown Court. Both prosecution and defence are to ensure that any supplementary representations or reports are submitted no later than one week prior.\n\nI record my thanks to Ms Amelia Hartley, representing the Crown, and Mr Edward Robinson, acting on your behalf under a Legal Aid order, for their diligent advocacy. I also note with appreciation the work of court staff in maintaining order and facilitating the well-attended hearing today.\n\nThe court further acknowledges the efforts of the Manchester Retail Workers’ Union and the local authorities who assist in addressing the often-overlooked impact of shoplifting on businesses and communities.\n\nThe hearing is conducted in open court; all measures remain in place to ensure transparency and accessibility in accordance with the principles of open justice.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and pending sentence will be communicated to the relevant authorities as required. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Unless otherwise ordered, no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs remain reserved at this stage.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  \nR v.

In particular, the grant of Legal Aid to enable the instruction of a forensic psychiatric expert was delayed by almost six weeks due to evidential clarifications sought by the Legal Aid Agency.

The defendant removed a security tag using a magnet, which was later recovered during his arrest.\n\nThe court is mindful of the constraints faced by probation services, which have seen numbers of officers decline and caseloads increase.
