MR H  \nCase No. T2025/13497  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. P. Bains  \nFiled: 15 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court on indictment for a representative count of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968, pertaining to a series of incidents occurring over a sustained period within the jurisdiction of Derwentshire and neighbouring boroughs. The allegations, now admitted by you, arise from a consistent pattern of shoplifting offence spanning late 2023 through to early 2025. This case, like many within this court’s contemporary docket, poses significant challenges in balancing the delivery of justice with the myriad social, institutional, and procedural complexities attendant to low-level acquisitive crime.  \n\nProcedural History and Case Progression  \nThe origins of this prosecution lie in a protracted and resource-intensive inquiry initiated by the Derwentshire Borough Police Retail Crime Unit (DRU) following repeated reports from multiple independent and chain retail outlets suffering unexplained stock losses. The investigation was coordinated in collaboration with several partners including the Derwentshire Business Crime Reduction Partnership, local council licensing officers, and security consultants commissioned by retail stakeholders. The investigative timeline encompassed close observation spanning approximately sixteen months, supplemented by extensive collation of CCTV, electronic point-of-sale reconciliations, and staff testimonies. These efforts culminated in your arrest on 3 February 2025.  \n\nThe logistical and evidential underpinning for such investigations demands considerable expenditure of public resources. The multi-agency nature of the inquiry required continuous liaison across departments, including the Derwentshire Digital Forensics Unit, involved in analysing digital stores and electronic point-of-sale irregularities. It is worth observing that while theft of goods under the theft threshold value may seem by some to warrant limited attention, the reality for enforcement agencies is that each reported incident triggers a cascade of procedural requirements—statements, exhibits, inventories, and, crucially, victim impact communications—placing onerous pressure on limited staff capacity. Such strains are exacerbated by contemporaneous and often more urgent demands on operational policing, including counter-terrorism, serious violent crime, and cybercrime investigations.  \n\nThe case was initially listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 10 March 2025,  but was adjourned at the defence’s request to permit the preparation and service of a psychiatric report on your mental health, alongside a pre-sentence report outlining background and risk factors. That report was submitted by Dr Kamal Arora, consultant forensic psychologist, on 14 August 2025. I take this opportunity here to note the contribution of experts such as Dr Arora, whose detailed and professionally executed clinical assessments provide this court with a valuable framework for informed sentencing considerations, albeit with the recognition that such reports are, by their very nature, focused on assessment rather than prescription.  \n\nThe service of detailed victim impact statements from several affected outlets was made possible through the diligent work of the Retail Workers’ Support Network (RWSN), a voluntary sector group providing representation and counselling to employees affected by repeat shoplifting. Their engagement has been noteworthy, particularly given the chronic underfunding facing such organisations in the present climate of austerity and rising demand. It is their practical insight into victim experience that lends this proceeding its human dimension beyond abstract legal principles. The RWSN's submissions were marked by a tone of measured concern, eschewing sensationalism while highlighting the cumulative impact of your conduct on staff wellbeing and store operations.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe Defendant’s Background and Relevant Personal History  \nMr H is presently 34 years of age with a documented history of prior theft-related offences, predominantly shoplifting, dating back to 2017. His criminal record reveals multiple convictions, including three previous theft offences for which custodial sentences were alternately suspended or imposed, and a community order breached in 2023. Of note is the pattern of reoffending within a year of each disposal, suggesting recidivism and difficulties in compliance. I acknowledge the defendant’s submissions indicating financial hardship and unstable housing, yet this court must weigh those claims against the evident persistence of offending.  \n\nThe pre-sentence report compiled by Ms Helen Stroud, senior probation officer, provides a comprehensive overview of Mr H’s social circumstances, including current employment status, accommodation history, and familial support networks. It is recorded that the defendant has been unemployed for a protracted period and currently resides in temporary supported accommodation arranged following eviction from prior tenancy due to rent arrears. Attempts by probation and social services to engage Mr H with drug and alcohol rehabilitation provisions have met with limited success, as has encouraging him to enrol in employability programmes.  \n\nThe court must also consider, even if indirectly, the broader systemic environment encompassing resources available for offenders such as Mr H. Derwentshire, much like other similar jurisdictions, is experiencing significant strain on social housing stock, emergency accommodation capacity, and welfare support services. While this context is not determinative, it informs the sentencing matrix, particularly when considering suitable interventions aimed at reducing reoffending and facilitating rehabilitation.\n\nThe legal representatives have also exchanged standard documentation reflecting the defendant’s prior contact with the criminal justice system, including copies of prior probation documents, letters from community support workers, and pay-as-you-go mobile phone records purporting to evidence attempts to contact employment agencies.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe Court is mindful that the defendant has maintained inconsistent engagement with service provision throughout the evolving case trajectory. This pattern is not uncommon among individuals with complex social needs exacerbated by underlying mental health vulnerabilities, substance misuse, and entrenched disadvantage. However, it must be noted that mere vulnerability does not equate to excusability in the eyes of the law.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that Mr H was the subject of a prior community resolution on 14 September 2023 following an incident at a retail outlet in Little Town, whereby he was intercepted attempting to leave the premises without paying for goods. That incident did not prompt immediate prosecution but served as a formal warning with conditions attached, including attendance at a diversionary community programme. Sadly, no meaningful compliance was observed.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nLegal Framework and Sentencing Considerations  \nThe offences with which you are charged are governed by section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. In the modern sentencing context, the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline (effective 2022) must be applied with due regard to the specific facts and patterns of offending behaviour.  \n\nThe court has noted the introductory remarks in the guideline detailing the importance of distinguishing between straightforward opportunistic theft and systematic or organised acquisitive offending, particularly when selectivity and repeat behaviour indicate a deliberate strategy. The harm caused by persistent retail theft extends beyond financial loss; it undermines community confidence, disrupts commercial viability, and imposes emotional burdens on staff required to enforce shop security measures.  \n\nThe recent Court of Appeal decision in R v. Ellison [2024] EWCA Crim 1842 is instructive here. Though concerned with aggravated theft involving coercive tactics, the judgment emphasised the principle that repeat offending reflecting conscious disregard for prior warnings and sanctions commands a more stringent response. While Mr H's circumstances differ materially, the underlying principle—that the persistence of offending hardened by time and opportunity lessens the scope for leniency—must inform this court’s approach.  \n\nSimilarly, the authority of R v. Mackenzie [2023] EWCA Crim 1390, which upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant convicted of burglaries and associated shoplifting offences amounting to a modus operandi characterised by premeditation and concealment, provides guidance on calibrating culpability and harm even where theft values remain modest individually.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nI am obliged to acknowledge that Mr H entered a late plea of guilty in this matter, shortly before trial listing. The defendant’s counsel invites this court to moderate any sentence accordingly. The Court recognises the well-established principle governing credit reductions for guilty pleas as set forth in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and expounded in numerous appellate decisions. It is, however, also mindful—as in the decision of R v. Hutton [2020] EWCA Crim 678—that credit may be substantially diminished where pleas are tendered only after protracted pre-trial preparation and when witnesses have been required to prepare to give evidence.\n\nThe court is informed of the procedural history of this case, including several adjournments occasioned by requests for further psychiatric assessment and defence submissions for letters of support, notably from local charities and the defendant’s immediate family. The efforts of the Legal Aid Agency have been, regrettably, subject to delay and procedural complexity. An application for funding to instruct an independent forensic psychologist was submitted on 12 March 2025 but only approved on 2 June after multiple enquiries and resubmissions. Such delays are unwelcome, particularly when they impact access to expert opinion essential to just outcome.  \n\nI would also note concerns expressed from time to time in court regarding the reduced availability of suitably trained probation officers, owing to recruitment shortfalls and retirement waves. This has practical consequences for the preparation of comprehensive reports and follow-through on community orders, factors inevitably linked to sentencing outcomes.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe court also mentions, by way of peripheral observation, the regrettable prevalence of co-defendants absent without trace in cases involving similar offence types. It is a feature of area policing that such absences complicate investigative efforts and prejudice victims' expectations of closure. While no such circumstance applies herein, the Court has available recent illustrative jurisprudence concerning co-defendants who have failed to appear. For example, in R v. Bromley [2022] EWCA Crim 923, the defendant's partners in a conspiracy were both absconded, prompting an extended adjournment whilst authorities sought extradition proceedings.  \n\nLikewise, I note the broader context of related criminal activity sometimes shadowing shoplifting matters but ultimately irrelevant to this case—such as the concerns about possession of bladed articles near schools or gang-related violent offences, of which no suggestion has been made regarding Mr H.\n\nVictim Impact and Supporting Agency Submissions  \nThe court has considered carefully the submissions of the RWSN and associated retail management representatives. They highlight not only loss of stock but also the chronic stress experienced by frontline retail workers—often young, minimally trained, and performing a role fraught with daily risk. Victim impact statements consistently refrain from exaggeration but convey palpable anxiety and frustration. Some staff members report requiring stress leave, and others taking precautionary measures such as locking certain aisle displays or requesting store transfers.\n\nThe thematic observations from these statements reinforce the essential truth that the effects of shoplifting offences ripple beyond immediate monetary calculations. There is an attendant moral and psychological harm undermining trust and safety. One must not underestimate the cumulative damage caused by repeat shoplifting incidents, especially where intervention and prevention are viewed skeptically by those charged with enforcement.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nThe defendant’s statements to probation and liaison officers, as well as recent forensic psychiatric input, demonstrate a mixed picture: acknowledgement of personal hardship compounded by limited engagement with rehabilitative opportunities. The cognitive-behavioural analysis submitted suggests underlying impulsivity, difficulty in emotional regulation, and episodes of substance misuse. None of these factors, however, justify offending but rather provide a framework for commensurate intervention.\n\nExpert Psychiatric and Psychological Reports  \nThe court wishes to place on record its gratitude to Dr Kamal Arora for his thorough psychosocial evaluation, which includes consideration of both mental health and criminogenic need. Dr Arora’s assessment reveals no evidence of major mental illness but delineates personality traits including low frustration tolerance and decision-making deficits. The report emphasises the defendant’s failure to attend previously recommended support services and thereby perpetuating cycles of impulsivity and vulnerability to environmental stressors. Of particular note is the identification of episodes suggestive of mild substance dependence, which, in Dr Arora’s view, could be addressed via targeted intervention.\n\nWhilst the report commendably avoids pathologising behaviour and maintains a balanced view, it underscores the importance of structured community-based programmes aimed at reducing reoffending risk. Such interventions could include Cognitive Skills Training, Substance Misuse Services, and financial management assistance.\n\nMr H’s letter to the court, submitted on 8 September 2025, is composed in a legible and measured fashion. It conveys remorse but is tempered by expressions of frustration at life circumstances and perceived systemic failure. This letter, while sincere in tone, must be weighed alongside objective evidential material.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nBroader Commentary and Observation on Systemic Context  \nThis court is mindful that the pressures on institutions charged with supporting individuals like Mr H have been steadily increasing. Probation service capacity continues to be challenged by recruitment shortfalls, retention issues, and rising caseloads — a point recorded in the recent report by the Ministry of Justice: “Probation Services Capacity and Effectiveness, 2024.” The census of engaged probation officers per 100 offenders is at its lowest recorded level. Equally, mental health services are often beset by extended waiting times and stretched resources, constraining timely access to care.  \n\nIt is appropriate to note the tireless efforts of voluntary sector organisations such as the Derwentshire Outreach Network and Hope at Hand, who act as invaluable adjuncts to formal services, frequently bridging gaps left by funding shortfalls. Their input in providing letters of support and facilitating engagement opportunities is gratefully received, yet unequivocally insufficient to address systemic deficits.  \n\nThere is, regrettably, a tendency in public discourse to trivialise acquisitive crime or dismiss it as ‘victimless’—a misconception refuted by the realities documented here. The cumulative burden on small businesses, often already struggling in a rapidly changing retail environment, is severe. The closure of local shops, reduced staffing, and increased security costs are tangible consequences of the type of offending pattern exhibited in this case.  \n\nWhile society’s responses must avoid conflating poverty with criminality, the law remains unequivocal in holding individuals accountable for deliberate breaches of its rules. The twin aims of sentencing—punishment and rehabilitation—must be achieved without compromise to public protection.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nClosing Procedural Remarks  \nThis hearing having been conducted in open court, with all parties present and represented—Ms Helena Marwick for the Crown and Mr Ian Pollard for the defence under Legal Aid provisions—I commend their submissions and professional conduct throughout these proceedings.\n\nI am constrained to remark upon the persistent challenges facing practitioners, agencies, and the court itself in securing timely access to appropriate expert reports. The delays occasioned by protracted Legal Aid grant processes, while not unique to this case, remain a source of frustration. It is to be hoped that ongoing reforms addressed by the Ministry and Legal Aid Agency will ameliorate these systemic shortcomings and enable more efficient administration of justice.\n\nI shall adjourn sentencing to allow a comprehensive pre-sentence report to be prepared. This report should incorporate a full risk assessment, consider the defendant’s prospects for engagement with rehabilitative services, and include proposals for any community-based requirements and interventions that may be appropriate, including a consideration of unpaid work as a component of any custodial or community sentence.  \n\nThe report should also include a consideration of public safety, likelihood of reoffending, and any protective factors demonstrated by Mr H. The court requires a measured and thorough analysis to inform the delicate balancing act sentencing demands in a case of this nature, where mitigation and societal protection must be weighed with equal care.\n\nThese are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge D. P. Bains, issued this 15th day of September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Derwentshire. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal the sentence once passed, within 28 days, under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged.
