MR H  \nCase No. T2026/05849  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge J. M. PENDLETON  \nFiled: 17 October 2026  \n\nMr H, you are before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending relates to a series of thefts committed over the course of nearly two years, principally within the Birmingham city centre retail district, but extending to several neighbouring town centres. The matter has been listed before me for sentencing following your admission of guilt at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 22 September 2026.\n\nProcedural History and Overview  \nYour initial arrest took place on 11 February 2026 after a protracted investigation led by the Birmingham Business Crime Taskforce, a multi-agency unit combining local policing resources with the Retail Theft Intelligence Section. This collaborative effort involved coordination with other bodies including the West Midlands Trading Standards Department and the regional CCTV Operations Unit. The investigation, which encompassed a review of diverse evidence streams such as closed-circuit television footage, point of sale records, and witness statements collected over a 14-month period, culminated in charges being brought against you in mid-March 2026.  \n\nIn these environments, one might naively assume that the availability of visual surveillance technology would simplify evidentiary collection and case preparation. However, as has been well documented in academic and judicial circles alike, the raw presence of video footage is rarely sufficient on its own. The quality of such images varies dramatically. It is not uncommon, as this court has observed in previous matters, for footage to suffer from distortion, obstructions, or misaligned timestamps, rendering it frequently unreliable in isolation. Indeed, the judicial experience has shown that securing a coherent narrative from such disparate recordings often requires the painstaking cross-referencing of multiple camera angles, store incident logs, and employee recollections, a process both time-consuming and costly.  \n\nIt is a truism that the police and prosecution frequently must devote substantial resources to what might superficially appear to be 'minor' offences — a term which belies the real human, economic, and communal cost of such thefts. The misapprehension that petty theft occupies a lower rung on the ladder of criminal harm dismisses the lived experience of retail workers, many of whom endure persistent anxiety and stress as a consequence of repeated thefts on their premises. These impacts ripple outward — affecting store profitability, potential job security, and local consumer confidence alike.  \n\nThe Better Case Management (BCM) framework was engaged from the outset to ensure efficient case progression in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules. This court notes with measured satisfaction that despite the chronic under-resourcing that characterises many contemporary public services, the case documentation was filed in advance of hearings as required and that liaison between the various agencies involved proceeded without undue obstruction. It is worth noting, however, that this procedural efficiency is regrettably not the norm. So much judicial time is otherwise consumed by adjournments related to missing paperwork, delayed expert reports, or contested applications for legal aid funding.  \n\nThis brings me to the matter of funding. The Legal Aid Agency’s handling of requests related to your defence has been, with no small degree of regret, problematic. The initial application to instruct an independent forensic psychologist was submitted on 3 April 2026, yet was not authorised until 15 June 2026. This two-month delay, accompanied by intermittent requests for additional clarifications and documentation, is emblematic of a wider malaise within the system that undermines timely justice, imposes unnecessary burdens on counsel, and causes distress to defendants and victims alike. As the court has previously noted in similar contexts, such administrative inertia is inimical to the proper functioning of the justice system and warrants urgent remedial attention.  \n\nBefore turning to the specifics of your offending, I must acknowledge the ongoing contributions of certain voluntary sector bodies with whom you have had some contact during these proceedings. In particular, the Birmingham Retail Staff Support Network submitted a letter to this court on 4 October 2026 outlining the challenges faced by shop employees in the wake of repeated theft incidents. Their efforts to engage with affected individuals, provide counselling, and advocate for improved working conditions are commendable and deserve formal recognition in these remarks. Additionally, the Midlands Community Reinvestment Project has provided reports concerning local economic impacts of high retail shrinkage rates — including increased prices that inevitably affect vulnerable shoppers. It is notable that these agencies operate under significant financial constraints, reliant on grants and volunteer effort, yet nonetheless maintain a constructive dialogue with the criminal justice system.  \n\nYou entered a plea of not guilty at your first appearance, which was subject to the listing of a contested plea and trial preparation hearing. At the plea hearing on 22 September 2026, shortly before trial was due to commence, you elected to plead guilty. It is therefore necessary to address the credit to be awarded for that guilty plea, which, given its timing, is to be considered in light of established appellate authority.  \n\nThe Court of Appeal has on numerous occasions considered the principle that early guilty pleas deserve greater recognition, serving both to conserve public resources and to relieve victims and witnesses from the burden of giving evidence. The decision in R v. Elliott [2022] EWCA Crim 993 is apposite. There, the court stated that while credit for a guilty plea is a well-established mitigating factor, “the timing of that plea and the factual context in which it is made are matters of judicial discretion to be exercised with a careful balancing of interests.” Similarly, in R v. Kaur [2023] EWCA Crim 45, the court underscored the diminished credit available where a plea is entered at a late stage, particularly when evidentiary disclosure has long been complete and the plea is seen as tactical rather than demonstrative of genuine remorse.  \n\nHaving said that, while your plea was not at the earliest point in the process, it nevertheless brought the matter to a conclusion sooner than a contested trial would have permitted, thus achieving some degree of procedural economy. The credit you receive will be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe law and sentencing guidelines applicable to theft offences of this kind are well established. The Theft Act 1968, at section 1, defines the offence succinctly: the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, last updated in 2022, provides the framework within which offences of this character are assessed, taking into account factors such as the value of the goods taken, the frequency of offending, the impact on victims, and any aggravating or mitigating features. As a matter of context, the guideline expressly recognises that repeated or organised shop theft causing persistent distress or economic loss can justify custodial sentences, even where the sums involved are individually modest.  \n\nIt is both instructive and necessary to consider certain case law developments, although the factual matrices in those cases may be materially distinct from the present circumstances. For example, the widely-cited decision in R v. Maidstone [2019] EWCA Crim 370 considered an offender who engaged in a course of shoplifting over a period of several years, targeting supermarket chains with sums totalling in excess of £18,000. That case emphasised the need to take a proportional approach, balancing the offender’s personal circumstances against the public harm caused, and upheld a sentence of twelve months’ custody suspended for two years, subject to supervision and unpaid work requirements.  \n\nAnother illustrative judgment is that in R v. Campton [2021] EWCA Crim 887, where the defendant was convicted of trafficking stolen goods after an operation involving stolen electronics sourced from multiple retail outlets. The court in Campton stressed that organised or commercialised shoplifting merits a more severe response, reflective both of the degree of premeditation and the broader impact on the community, including distortion of legitimate market activities. While there is no suggestion here of such commercial operation, the case serves as a useful backdrop for evidencing the escalating seriousness with which the courts treat such offending.  \n\nTurning from legal authority to the facts before this court, I must now set out the particulars as reflected in the evidence provided to the trial and the pre-sentence reports commissioned.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nThe facts establish a clear pattern of repeated and opportunistic theft over a sustained period, involving multiple retail outlets including high street chains and local independent shops. The thefts involved goods frequently targeted for their easy resale value: personal care products, over-the-counter medicines, and electronics accessories. This is characteristic of a particular modus operandi commonly seen in such cases, as noted by the Birmingham Retail Crime Partnership in their analytic brief issued on 31 August 2026, which highlights the growing sophistication of what might once have been regarded as impulse theft.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nAn important feature noted in the Crown’s evidence was the apparent use of concealment techniques, including layering clothing to obscure items, and in some instances, coordinated timing to coincide with busy periods or staff changes. It is also recorded that on occasion, you adopted apparent pretext conversations on mobile phones, thereby attempting to reduce staff vigilance — a tactic unfortunately all too familiar in such circles.  \n\nCommunity impact statements provided by multiple shop managers detail the disruption caused, including increased anxiety among staff, the need to alter rotas, and an understandable reluctance to work unsupervised during vulnerable hours. The psychological toll, while intangible, is no less real for those affected. One witness, an employee at a modest independent pharmacy in Digbeth, spoke movingly of how your repeated visits instilled a palpable sense of dread amongst the team, a distress compounded by the fear that management might not fully appreciate the severity of the issue. Such victim impact is rightly regarded by this court as a material aggravating feature in determining the appropriate sentence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nIf one were to pivot briefly to the operational context of the agencies involved in your case, it bears mentioning the considerable strain placed upon the West Midlands Probation Service and local policing teams. The increased volume of acquisitive crime has contributed to elevated workloads, staff shortages, and a deficit in resources available for diversion or rehabilitative programmes. This systemic pressure has been extensively documented in the Annual Review of the West Midlands Criminal Justice Board (2025), which outlines the challenges faced in accommodating specialist interventions in a climate of austerity and high demand. These observations do not excuse individual conduct but serve to situate it within the broader environment of ever-decreasing institutional capacity.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nAn independent psychiatric report ordered pursuant to the defence’s application was prepared by Dr Sylvia Lane, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose assessment was received on 13 September 2026. Dr Lane observed that you exhibit no major psychiatric disorder but identified enduring difficulties with impulse control and emotional regulation. She commented that your engagement with social support networks has been inconsistent and that there is a risk of continued offending absent targeted intervention.  \n\nDr Lane expressed the view that community-based rehabilitative efforts focusing on impulse management and cognitive behavioural approaches could offer some benefit, provided that sufficient motivation and support structures are available to secure meaningful engagement. However, she cautioned that premature optimism about voluntary compliance in such cases is often misplaced.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nThe court also acknowledges the social and personal difficulties you have experienced, including periods of insecure housing and episodic employment. While such hardships undoubtedly present challenges, they do not provide an automatic or sufficient justification for criminal conduct. The principle that hardship does not equate to licence remains firmly embedded within criminal justice jurisprudence and policy.  \n\nA recent local authority report commissioned to assess the availability of support services for individuals at risk of recidivism found that while a modest array of options exists — including housing advice, debt counselling, and substance misuse programmes — demand far outstrips supply. This mismatch inevitably results in wait times and crisis points, reducing the likelihood that all defendants in your position will access interventions promptly or effectively. Nonetheless, the existence of such services is not to be dismissed and the recalcitrance or failure to engage with them when offered weighs heavily against considerations of mitigation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nIn the course of these proceedings, an unusual procedural matter arose. It was noted that your co-defendant in an unrelated case involving possession of offensive weapons was present in custody at the same time. This person’s case, involving an affray outside a licensed premises in Erdington with the use of pool cues as weapons, is entirely distinct from yours and bears no causal connection. While such overlap in the court roll sometimes causes confusion, this court is satisfied that no evidential or procedural overlap affects your determination.  \n\nEqually, seen in the context of community-based schemes, the recent operation “Shield” conducted by the West Midlands Police involved patrols targeting fly-tipping activities on green belt land around the Solihull district. Its broader aim to reduce environmental crime is valuable but unrelated to your charge, serving only to illustrate the expansive scope of policing demands in the region.  \n\nIn sentencing, this court must weigh a range of factors derived from statute, precedent, sentencing guidelines, and the specific circumstances of the case. A custodial sentence, although severe, is not invariably the default for shoplifting offences. However, where the offending represents a deliberate, repeated pattern causing tangible harm to victims and the community, custody becomes an increasingly proportionate response.  \n\nHaving considered all material, including the reports from probation services, psychiatric assessments, victim impact statements, and counsel submissions, I find the following features to be particularly cogent. The clear pattern of prolonged offending despite previous warnings or interventions; the adverse impact on retail workers and the local economy; the late plea of guilty providing only partial mitigation; and the limited engagement with support mechanisms offered — these collectively weigh heavily toward a custodial outcome.  \n\nThat said, I note your youth at the time of the earliest offences, your expression of regret in court, and some open acknowledgement of the pressures contributing to your behaviour. These factors serve to tilt the scales marginally towards suspending or limiting the term of custody, subject to considerations of future compliance and rehabilitation.  \n\nIn accordance with standard protocol, I hereby order that a pre-sentence report be commissioned without delay. This report should encompass a thorough assessment of your personal circumstances, risk of reoffending, and suitability for any community-based interventions, including but not limited to cognitive skills training, restorative justice, and employment support schemes. The probation service is requested to pay particular attention to devising a tailored package of interventions aimed at addressing impulse control difficulties and opportunities for social reintegration.  \n\nIt is hoped that this report will furnish the court with the necessary detail to arrive at a sentence that both protects the public and provides a realistic prospect of reducing future offending.  \n\nI express my thanks to Ms Zoe Fenton, who appeared on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Samuel Norris, who has represented you under a representation order. I record once again my concern at the delays caused by the Legal Aid Agency’s tardiness in authorising expert assessments. I also thank the court staff who have maintained order and facilitated smooth progress throughout these proceedings, notwithstanding occasional staffing shortages and scheduling constraints. The courtroom itself was recently refurbished, with new security features installed, which although tangential, have contributed to an improved environment for all participants, which merits passing mention.  \n\nFinally, I remind you that these sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2026, in Court 8 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The transcript has been produced in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. You have the right of appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged in these proceedings. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2026/05849  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge J. M.
