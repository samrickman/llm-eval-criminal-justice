MR H  \nCase No. BW2025/15834  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. MORGAN  \nFiled: 11 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in relation to a charge alleging theft from retail premises, specifically a course of conduct characterised by shoplifting offences over an extended period. The offending behaviour, said to have taken place between mid-2023 and early 2025, includes multiple incidents across various retail establishments within the jurisdictions of Bridgewater and neighbouring urban boroughs. These offences, although individually relatively low value, have collectively attracted the attention of law enforcement, retail security operatives, and multi-agency partners, culminating in your prosecution under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968.\n\nProcedural History  \nThe origins of this case can be traced back to several reports submitted by shopkeepers associated with the Bridgewater Business Crime Reduction Scheme, an initiative designed to coordinate crime prevention in retail environments, particularly focusing on repeat and organised acquisition offences. The scheme’s operational effectiveness depends heavily on data-sharing between retailers, police, and local authority teams, and although it is not without strain under increasing case loads and staffing shortages, it provided the initial impetus for investigation in your matter.  \nFollowing a number of reported thefts involving suspicious activity by a person matching your description, officers commenced an enquiry which included reviewing CCTV footage, conducting asset loss surveys, and interviewing staff. The investigation was hampered at points by sporadic witness availability and the intermittent absence of relevant footage due to technical faults or camera coverage gaps, a common challenge in retail crime investigations, as previously noted in R v. Dorman [2015] EWCA Crim 2312 concerning evidential difficulties in low-level acquisitive offences.  \n\nYour arrest was effected on 18 February 2025, subsequent to a warrant authorising a search of your residential address and the seizure of items potentially connected to the offences. The police operation, supported by multi-agency coordination including the Retail Crime Intelligence Unit, was notable for the deployment of recent technological measures, including facial recognition software subject to strict data protection constraints. It goes without saying that the use of such technology must be conducted with the utmost safeguards to preserve individual liberties, as emphasised in the guidance contained within the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice (Home Office, 2013).  \n\nThe initial charge was presented to the Magistrates’ Court on 25 February 2025, and this case was sent to the Crown Court for its sentencing jurisdiction as the aggregate value and seriousness of the offending exceeded summary thresholds. Plea and trial preparation hearings were scheduled in line with the Criminal Procedure Rules and Better Case Management (BCM) frameworks, which seek to ensure efficient case progression while maintaining fairness to all parties. These hearings took place without remarkable incident on 15 April and 7 May respectively, with the final plea entered on 1 June 2025. You now stand convicted, following your late guilty plea.\n\nIt is unfortunate, but not uncommon, that pleas in such cases often come delayed. The factors influencing this include the defendant’s assessment of evidential strengths, advice from counsel, and, occasionally, procedural tactics. The court is aware of the impact such timing has on victims, witnesses, and resource allocation, as articulated in R v. Bennett [2022] EWCA Crim 1487, which instructs a cautious approach to credit reduction in cases of last-minute admissions of guilt.\n\nThe Crown has been represented throughout by Ms Clare Barton, whose professionalism and dedication in presenting the case are acknowledged. Similarly, Mr Simon Caldwell has represented you for the defence, operating under a Legal Aid order. I must take this opportunity to register my concern regarding the recurrent administrative delays in funding forensic expert instructions—a matter that has impeded the timely preparation of mitigation and has been the subject of correspondence to the Legal Aid Agency on multiple occasions.\n\nIt is also pertinent to mention that the court received several letters of support on your behalf, including communications from community outreach coordinators affiliated with Bridgewater Local Care, a charity addressing homelessness and substance misuse. The letters commend your expressed willingness to engage with support services, yet also highlight ongoing challenges in consistently accessing stable accommodation and mental health resources.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nWhile it is commonplace to observe that societal factors—including economic precarity and housing insecurity—may underpin offending behaviour of this nature, it remains vital to delineate context from excuse. The justice system must balance compassion with accountability.\n\nIn considering this, I reflect on the observations of the Court of Appeal in R v. Ellwood [2019] EWCA Crim 2846, where the defendant, suffering from documented addiction issues, nonetheless received a custodial sentence for repeat shoplifting to deliver a message underscoring the protective interests of the community and the imperative of deterrence.\n\nThe administrative burden imposed upon local policing and ancillary agencies in detecting, processing, and prosecuting offences of this kind cannot be overstated. Resources diverted to low-level acquisitive crime invariably reduce capacity to address more serious offences, a point made in recent National Policing Strategic Assessments. Bridgewater Police reported staffing shortfalls of over 15% in neighbourhood units during 2024, affecting proactive case development and victim engagement.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nThis is regrettable, for it is precisely such detailed investigative activity that closes gaps for offenders whose persistent behaviour may otherwise go unchecked in the community.\n\nExpert Evidence and Reports  \nI have considered with care the detailed psychiatric report prepared by Dr Hannah Price, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, dated 22 August 2025, along with the Probation Service's pre-sentence assessment completed on 30 August 2025. Dr Price’s analysis notes that while you do not meet diagnostic criteria for any major psychiatric disorder, there were notable observations regarding anxiety and situational depression, coupled with a history of episodic substance misuse, mainly involving prescribed benzodiazepines and occasional alcohol excess. The report expresses a guarded optimism about your rehabilitative capacity, contingent on sustained engagement with clinical and social support services. It also identifies impulsivity and poor coping strategies as contributory to your offending pattern.  \nDr Price is explicit in cautioning that relapse risk remains elevated absent consistent intervention. Such professional evaluations are invaluable in constructing a response that addresses both individual needs and public protection imperatives, reflecting the standards set by the Sentencing Council in its guidance on offenders with mental health vulnerabilities.\n\nThe probation report offers a considered narrative of your circumstances, including family history, educational background, and the absence of stable employment in recent years. It underscores previous engagement with diversionary schemes which, regrettably, were not completed or adhered to. The Probation Officer emphasises the practical challenges imposed by residential instability and the attendant risks of social exclusion and reoffending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nIn formulating its recommendations, probation suggests consideration be given to a Community Order incorporating a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, with the potential addition of unpaid work to facilitate both reparation and skill development. The officer also flags the lack of a current tenancy agreement, raising concerns about the increased risk of homelessness and its attendant destabilising effect on rehabilitation prospects. The pressures on local housing services, with waiting lists extending beyond 18 months in Bridgewater, compound this challenge.\n\nOf course, the court is mindful that rehabilitation alone does not encompass the totality of sentencing objectives. Deterrence, both individual and general, remains paramount, especially in offences that impact community wellbeing and business confidence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nFurther, the court recognizes the cumulative impact that even low-value thefts can exert upon retail staff, particularly those in smaller establishments where shrinkage presents a significant threat to business viability. Victim impact statements underscore the psychological strain on employees tasked with repeated monitoring duties and the disruption to workplace routines caused by your conduct.\n\nThe judicial framework for sentencing is clear. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 provides the foundational statutory context, while the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences issued in 2023 establishes an appropriate matrix for assessing culpability and harm. The guidelines enjoin courts to weigh factors such as the nature of the property stolen, whether the offending was pre-meditated or opportunistic, the presence or absence of aggravating conduct, and any previous relevant convictions. The guideline’s emphasis on proportionate and measured sentencing aims to balance community confidence with the prospects for offender rehabilitation.  \nIn approaching your case, the court has sought to follow this legal framework while also applying the principles articulated in leading authorities such as R v. Sharp [2021] EWCA Crim 1127 and R v. Golding [2022] EWCA Crim 601, each reinforcing the gravity of persistent dishonesty offences and the need for sentencing to reflect their cumulative seriousness.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nIt is necessary to note, crucially, that you have previous convictions for shoplifting dating back some six years, albeit none recent within the last two years prior to the current offences. That historical record neither militates for undue leniency nor inexorable severity, but is a material consideration within the overall sentencing calculus. The court is cognisant that reoffending patterns may point to ingrained behavioural traits or external pressures but remain subject to judicial scrutiny.\n\nI should add that this court is all too familiar with the deepening pressures upon legal aid funding frameworks. The delays in commissioning reports and expert opinions in this case, attributable in part to shifting administrative guidelines and resource constraints, serve as an unwelcome reminder of systemic vulnerabilities within the justice system. Regrettably, such delays inevitably impede the timely and effective administration of justice.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nThe court also notes correspondence received from Bridgewater Retailers’ Association, which details the financial and operational impact of theft on local merchants. While the representations stress the challenges posed by resource limitations in staff training and security investments, they nonetheless articulate a firm stance on the expectation of meaningful, proportionate legal consequences for offenders. The sentiments expressed echo wider societal concerns regarding trust in public institutions to deliver justice effectively.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nYou have, through your legal representative, conveyed remorse and an expressed willingness to engage with rehabilitative schemes, although prior opportunities in this regard have not been sustained. Recognising the sincerity of your current stance will form part of the court’s consideration at sentencing.\n\nLet it be observed that the contextual setting of this offending is not isolated from wider social phenomena. The courts and involved agencies operate against a backdrop of increasing societal challenges, including rising levels of street homelessness, public health crises related to substance misuse, and changes in the economic landscape affecting low-income populations disproportionately. These factors complicate but do not negate individual accountability.  \nThere are also persistent difficulties relating to the recruitment, retention, and training of probation officers nationwide, a matter discussed in recent Parliamentary Justice Committee reports. These systemic pressures influence service delivery and highlight the importance of tailoring sentencing outcomes to available support mechanisms.  \n\nSentencing Methodology and Outlook  \nIn accordance with established principles, I shall defer definitive sentence pending the receipt of any final submissions and to allow probation time to consider further whether community-based interventions may be appropriate and viable in your circumstances. It is hoped that such a course may yield benefits both in terms of your rehabilitation and community safety, consistent with the rehabilitative and deterrent objectives of sentencing law, as reiterated in R v. Willis [2023] EWCA Crim 338.\n\nI record the court’s thanks to all those who have assisted in the preparation of reports, including Dr Price and Probation Officer Ms Janet Lewis, as well as to Bridgewater Law Centre for their diligent prosecution and defence advocacy throughout. The court also acknowledges the efforts of local voluntary agencies working to support persons at risk of reoffending and the victims of acquisitive crime alike.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 11 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bridgewater. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal conviction and sentence record shall be duly conveyed to the appropriate authorities. You are reminded of your statutory right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged.
