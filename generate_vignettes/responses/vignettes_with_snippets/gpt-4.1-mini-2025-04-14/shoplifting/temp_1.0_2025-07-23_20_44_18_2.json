MR H  \nCase No. T2026/01456  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. DARNELL  \nFiled: 16 September 2026  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court having been convicted of offences committed against several retail premises within the Merthyr Tydfil and surrounding districts, under the provisions of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct spans a period from the autumn of 2024 through to the late spring of 2026, culminating in the incidents presented before this court. For clarity, the charge before you is drawn as a representative count embracing this course of conduct.\n\nProcedural History  \nThe journey to this point has been protracted, reflecting a multiplicity of procedural steps typical in acquisitive crime cases in recent years. After your initial arrest on 22 May 2026, following a sustained investigation co-ordinated by the Merthyr Tydfil Neighbourhood Policing Team and the South Wales Retail Crime Partnership, the matter was promptly referred to this Crown Court for trial and sentence under the Better Case Management principles. The BCM regime, designed to improve efficiency in the handling of contested and non-contested cases alike, has been adhered to as far as practicable given the complexities herein. I note with some regret that the case suffered a short adjournment owing to delay in securing representation funding from the Legal Aid Agency, reflecting ongoing systemic pressures on its administrative capacity.\n\nIt is of interest, though only tangentially related to the charge, to record the history of successive interventions attempted by various agencies prior to prosecution. The defendant’s engagement with community-based diversion schemes, designed to forestall further offending, was sporadic at best. For example, in late 2025, an offer to participate in a Shoplifting Diversion Framework programme was accepted in principle but was attended irregularly, with noted failures to comply with appointments.\n\nIn an era where resources across public services face relentless strain, it is worthwhile reflecting briefly on the inter-agency cooperation involved in matters such as this. Despite serious budget reductions in policing, social care, and probation services, the pragmatic pursuit of public safety rests heavily on the commitment of officers and professionals working within these constraints. The Merthyr Tydfil Retail Partnership, though modest in scale, has maintained effective liaison with the police and local authority trading standards. Their efforts in collating intelligence, gathering victim impact statements, and coordinating a strategy for offender management are commendable.\n\nIt is further appropriate to place on record the noteworthy assistance provided by the Merthyr Tydfil Civic Advocacy Group, who, operating on a voluntary basis, offer support to victims of low-value crime. Their representatives have submitted detailed accounts of the financial and psychological toll on shopkeepers and employees alike, underscoring the real-world impact of persistent thefts that might otherwise be dismissed as inconsequential.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nThe instant offence presents as yet another strand in a pattern of conduct of concern. The Crown submits, and I accept, that the charges encapsulate sustained and deliberate theft targeting vulnerable retail premises operating on slim margins and staffed by individuals often lacking sufficient training or resource to counter persistent shoplifting.\n\nI must also acknowledge the professional contributions of the prosecution counsel, Ms Eleanor Bridgman, QC, whose cogent submissions assisted the court greatly. The defence was ably represented by Mr Marcus Linton, barrister instructed under a representation order. Both counsel conducted themselves with the professionalism and courtesy that befit these proceedings.\n\nThe court is, as always, mindful of the balancing exercise required in sentencing: the legitimate aim of punishment and deterrence must be balanced against the imperatives of rehabilitation, reintegration, and justice tempered with mercy where appropriate. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline dated August 2021 provides a framework structured by culpability and harm. While the seriousness of shoplifting offences varies widely, features such as repeated offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, or failure to heed previous sanctions represent significant aggravating considerations.\n\nThe court has reviewed relevant appellate jurisprudence. In R v Pearson [2023] EWCA Crim 1457, the Court of Appeal stressed that persistent acquisitive crime must not be trivialised, noting the cumulative community harm and inflation of public sector burdens imposed. The court’s approach to credit for guilty pleas is informed by R v Gill [2022] EWCA Crim 2118, which emphasised that late pleas entered after prolonged contest necessitate a proportionately reduced discount. These and other authorities, while factually diverse, offer valuable guidance on sentencing theft and related conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nIn parallel, attention has been paid to the impact on local resources. The financial and social strain exacted on police teams tasked with investigations of acquisitive offences has grown considerably in recent years. Officers involved here reported significant time allocated not only to assembling evidence but to multi-agency meetings and partnership panels. This reflects a shift toward intelligence-led policing models which, while broadly effective, rely heavily on meticulous administrative work and cross-departmental cooperation—tasks often overlooked in the headline narratives of crime prevention.\n\nFrom the defendant’s perspective, and as outlined in the pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Annabel Hoover of the Probation Service, risk factors identified include episodic unemployment, intermittent accommodation instability, and a history of low-level substance misuse. These are common features in the profile of many offenders in similar cases, but by themselves do not mitigate the serious implications of the offending pattern.\n\nProbation services, as noted in recent Ministry of Justice briefings, operate amidst ongoing personnel shortages and elevated caseloads. The complex needs of offenders combining acquisitive crime with mental health or addiction histories challenge an already overstretched infrastructure. That said, Ms Hoover’s report is diligent and demonstrates thorough efforts to appraise the prospects for rehabilitation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nMental health assessment was sought at the defence’s request, and a report was obtained from Dr Mohinder Banerjee, consultant forensic psychiatrist. His evaluation, submitted on 1 September 2026, concluded there is no diagnosable severe mental illness. However, it identified moderate traits of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, with a need for targeted interventions on substance use. The report also highlighted a history of untreated anxiety and low self-esteem. Dr Banerjee emphasised the need for structured community supervision with psychiatric liaison and access to therapeutic activities, noting potential benefit from a cognitive-behavioural programme.\n\nThe court is aware of the ongoing debate—not least in academic circles—regarding the extent to which underlying psychosocial factors should influence sentencing outcomes in acquisitive crime. Arguments stressing systemic neglect or economic inequality as root causes must not obscure individual accountability. The law, after all, sets behaviour standards essential to societal order.\n\nMoreover, in the case of R v Jennings [2024] EWCA Crim 529, the Court of Appeal declined to lessen sentences on the basis of hardship alone, affirming that while judge’s must consider personal circumstances, they cannot yield to excuses that would dilute the deterrent function. This remains the current jurisprudential compass.\n\nSeveral of the premises subjected to theft in this case are small, locally owned retailers operating at the margins of viability. The impact on their turnover, employee morale, and security costs is neither theoretical nor trivial. Indeed, written representations were received from the Mid-Valley Business Alliance, detailing the cumulative effect of repeated losses and the consequent rise in insurance premiums.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nElsewhere, the case file contains photographic documentation and inventory reports from Birchwood Pharmacy, illustrating the depletion of certain high-demand items during peak periods. Staff testimony recorded some anxiety about repeat visits by the defendant, leading to altered staffing arrangements, including the deployment of two-person teams at risk times. The psychological toll on frontline retail workers in such contexts must not be underestimated.\n\nThe National Retail Federation’s latest annual report underscores how persistent shoplifting harms not only businesses but jeopardises local economies through lost jobs and reduced commercial investment. While this court must avoid policy exhortation, these broader implications remain relevant background.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nIt is pertinent to note, albeit with no adjudicative weight, that the defendant’s familial circumstances are complex. Letters submitted on behalf of a sibling, Ms Teresa H, detail longstanding family tensions, historic episodes of neglect, and intermittent contact. While family dynamics are not ordinarily material to sentencing, the court recognises that supportive relationships can contribute positively to rehabilitation efforts.\n\nThe defendant’s own letter to the court, thoughtfully composed and hand-written in neat script, expresses remorse and a desire to break free from the cycle of offending. Such sentiments are received with cautious encouragement.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nFrom a procedural perspective, the case reflects some of the ongoing complexities in modern criminal practice. Defence efforts to secure expert reports, including a cognitive neuropsychological assessment, were met with bureaucratic delays. These encountered obstacles within the Legal Aid Agency’s system, with applications pending for over four weeks before approval was granted. Such delays, regrettable though they are, are increasingly commonplace and represent a pressing challenge to efficient justice administration.\n\nIt is worthwhile, if only in passing, to observe the historical evolution of the Crown Court sitting in Merthyr Tydfil. Established under the Courts Act 1971, this venue has seen many changes, including extensive refurbishment in 2019 to enhance access and accommodate emerging digital evidence systems. The improved technology has allowed for clearer presentation of CCTV evidence in cases such as this and has contributed to more efficient judicial processing.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nOne must recognise, however, that even as infrastructure improves, human and financial resources remain in short supply. The court clerk, court ushers, and security staff have performed admirably throughout, ensuring the smooth conduct of proceedings and maintaining due order despite occasional interpreter delays. Their roles, though unsung, are vital to the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nThose interested in the procedural attention to detail may wish to consider the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Rules made in April 2025, which sought to clarify disclosure obligations in cases involving digital evidence. Although not central here, the principles outlined in CPD 5A have informed the handling of the CCTV footage relied upon by the prosecution.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nIn conclusion, the court is satisfied that the conduct in this matter was deliberate, sustained, and deserving of sanction proportionate to the harm caused and the need for deterrence and rehabilitation. The defendant has demonstrated some remorse, albeit tardily, and presents with needs requiring structured community support to reduce risk of reoffending.\n\nIt is therefore appropriate to request a detailed pre-sentence report to be prepared by the Probation Service, with particular focus on risk assessment, suitability for cognitive skills and substance misuse interventions, and the feasibility of any rehabilitative programmes suitable for the defendant’s profile. The report should also consider the extent to which practical support regarding accommodation stability and employment prospects may be incorporated into a community sentence, should the court deem it suitable.\n\nThe court reserves final sentencing to a subsequent hearing, pending receipt and consideration of the comprehensive pre-sentence documentation, including any supplementary psychiatric or psychological input that might further inform the response.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Merthyr Tydfil. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions in respect of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MERTHYR TYDFIL  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2026/01456  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M.
