MR H  \nCase No. T2025/14798  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. R. DALTON  \nFiled: 14 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of offences involving theft from retail premises, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct in question represents a course of offending extending over an appreciable period during 2024 and 2025, principally within the commercial districts of Canterford and the adjacent boroughs of Holmfirth and East Carlton. Your case has traversed the criminal justice process with a degree of complexity arising from the multi-agency investigation, the involvement of expert assessments, and intermittent delays occasioned by administrative and procedural factors.\n\nProcedural History  \nThe allegation against you crystallised following the accumulation of evidence by the Canterford Retail Crime Unit in cooperation with the Canterford Business Crime Partnership, a body established in 2016 to foster collaborative efforts among retail operators, police forces, local authorities, and community safety organisations to tackle acquisitive crime more effectively. The initiative, while methodologically sound in principle, is frequently challenged in practice by the operational demands and fluctuating resource allocation that characterise modern policing and commercial sector engagement.\n\nYour arrest occurred on 17 May 2025, subsequent to a series of witness statements, CCTV footage collation, and the utilisation of digital forensic technology to match items recovered at your place of residence to those linked to multiple theft incidents across diverse retail outlets. The investigative phase involved contributions from several agencies, including the Canterford Police Prosecutions Unit, the City Technical Crime Lab, and the local Safer Neighbourhood Teams. Importantly, the coordination across these units adhered to the data protection and evidentiary standards set forth in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, reflecting the procedural diligence required in cases of this nature.\n\nThe case was initially set for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 4 June 2025, but was adjourned to 22 August 2025 due to a request from defence counsel for additional disclosure, including surveillance data from the affected stores and a forensic audit report concerning the seized items. It is notable that the Legal Aid Agency’s authorisation of funding for an independent psychological evaluation of yourself was delayed by nearly six weeks, a factor contributing to procedural elongation with attendant consequences for timely justice. Such delays are regrettably emblematic of systemic challenges facing legal aid provision nationwide, a matter of repeated judicial notice.\n\nIt was only at the hearing of 22 August 2025 that you entered a plea of guilty to the representative count of theft. The plea was tendered following comprehensive disclosure by the prosecution and anticipated expert testimony from the appointed consultant forensic psychiatrist and the probation service. The timing of this plea will, of course, be a material consideration in the calculation of any allowance for mitigation by way of guilty plea credit. The principles governing plea discounts are well-established and were recently restated in R v. Nwosu [2024] EWCA Crim 752, where it was affirmed that the earliest manifestation of genuine acceptance of responsibility warrants the highest degree of credit, commensurate with procedural economy and victim impact reduction.\n\nIt is worth recalling that the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, instituted nationally since 2015, seeks to ensure that cases proceed with expedition and that parties adhere to predetermined timetables for disclosure, evidence provision, and procedural steps. While the BCM has generally been a positive development in the administration of justice, its efficacy is frequently diminished by factors ranging from witness availability to fluctuating counsel calendars. In this case, notwithstanding the delay in the funding decision noted, the parties have otherwise observed the court’s procedural directions diligently.\n\nIn the wider context, cases such as this are symptomatic of the ongoing challenges faced by the criminal justice system in managing acquisitive offending against retail businesses. The socio-economic disruptions occasioned by recent years’ public health crises, inflationary pressures, and labour market volatility have repeatedly been observed to underpin patterns of low-level criminality, though of course causation is complex and multifactorial. The court therefore sits at the confluence of individual accountability and recognition of social context.\n\nThe court acknowledges the contributions of prosecuting counsel, Miss Emily Sandford, for her careful and measured submissions, as well as the efforts of defence counsel, Mr Julian Marks, under a Legal Aid representation order, whose professionalism throughout should be noted. Further, the patience and dedication of court staff and clerks in ensuring the smooth conduct of the proceedings amidst ongoing operational demands merit appreciation.\n\nLegal Context  \nThe conduct charged against you falls squarely within the ambit of the Theft Act 1968. Section 1 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. Shoplifting, a common manifestation of theft, represents a signature offence where minor or supposedly negligible acts cumulatively erode the confidence of retailers and the public alike.\n\nThe Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, last updated in 2023, places emphasis on harm, culpability, and mitigating factors. The court must assess the totality of your conduct rather than isolate individual incidents. This approach was endorsed in R v. Burrow [2023] EWCA Crim 345, where the Court of Appeal upheld a substantial community order in relation to repeated thefts involving small but cumulative value, with particular regard to disruption caused to staff and premises' operations.\n\nIt is also pertinent to consider established case law concerning plea credit. In R v. D’Arcy [2022] EWCA Crim 392, the Court underscored that while guilty pleas reduce custodial sentences, the timing of such pleas may significantly influence the extent of reduction. Consistency in application of these principles upholds public confidence and judicial integrity.\n\nIn addition, the court has before it several victim impact statements provided by management and staff from the affected retail outlets. These statements articulate the psychological and operational burden imposed by repeated theft, underscoring the non-material harm attendant on such offences. The statements have been collated by the Canterford Retail Association and were provided with the assistance of the local Safer Neighbourhood Policing Team.\n\nBefore turning to the facts of the offending, the court makes reference to an unrelated matter, R v. Hinson [2024] EWCA Crim 2007, concerning aggravated burglary involving a forced entry to a private residence and threats to occupants, resulting in custodial terms exceeding four years. While legally significant and relevant in the abstract discussion of sentencing principles, this case bears no factual or procedural connection to the matter before this court save in illustrating the contrast between different categories of theft offences.\n\nTo provide historical context, it may be noted that the Crown Court at Canterford was established in 1978 and has undergone several refurbishments to its hearing suites, including the addition of secure video link facilities and modern evidence presentation technology. These improvements are designed to assist the often complex evidential tasks in cases involving digital forensics and multi-agency data.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe facts as presented, following your plea, reveal a pattern of repeated offending across numerous retail establishments predominantly concentrated along the High Street and industrial precincts of Holmfirth. As has been common in this jurisdiction over recent years, the offending pattern is characterised by an apparent focus on readily marketable items — both high turnover consumer products and personal care goods — often in circumstances evidencing premeditation and methodical planning.\n\nYour involvement was brought to light not merely through eyewitness reporting but was corroborated with technological evidence from multiple premises, including digital image captures, stock management systems, and recovered stolen goods. The thoroughness of the evidential compilation owes much to the dedication of retail security operatives, as well as to the application of forensic techniques applied at the City Technical Crime Lab.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nIt may appear paradoxical to those unfamiliar with retail crime investigations that such minor thefts command the attention of multiple layers of the criminal justice apparatus. Yet, this underlines the broader public interest in maintaining commercial viability and public order. The court has been made aware of the strain imposed on staff, many of whom are part-time or temporary workers, experiencing anxiety linked to repeated encounters with suspected offenders.\n\nBetween incidents reported in 2024 and those seized upon in early 2025, there appears to be no substantial break in your active engagement in offending behaviour. Such continuity is of serious concern.\n\nThe court has received and reviewed a psychological assessment prepared by Dr Simon Fraser, consultant forensic psychologist, who conducted interviews and cognitive testing over two sessions in September 2025. Dr Fraser’s report situates your offending within a profile indicating borderline impulsivity and mild depressive symptomatology, but no diagnosable major mental disorder. The assessment underscores a lack of engagement with available support services, a factor which the court regards with appropriate caution.\n\nIt is observed that the report’s testing protocols conformed with standards described in the latest iteration of the British Psychological Society’s Guidelines on Forensic Assessment (2024), including provisions for cultural and socio-economic factors. The conclusion that rehabilitation prospects would likely be enhanced by tailored cognitive behavioural interventions is consistent with the extant literature.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe court also notes that a pre-sentence probation report has been ordered but was not available at the time of these sentencing remarks. The report will be crucial in forming recommendations concerning appropriate community order requirements or custodial thresholds.\n\nDuring the course of these proceedings, the honourable Mr Justice Alford’s guidance on theft sentencing, as encapsulated in Sentencing Council Worksheet 5B, has been taken into account. This document emphasises proportionate sentencing that reflects both individual circumstances and the need for deterrence.\n\nIt is also regrettable to report that an unrelated co-defendant in a separate robbery case — R v. Sanderson [2025] — failed to appear for trial and remains at large. There is no linkage to the present matter other than to expose the challenges in apprehending suspects in complex proceedings, often exacerbated by inter-agency communication difficulties.\n\nThe court wishes to place on record the exemplary professionalism of Detective Inspector Clare Baxter, who oversaw the investigation, coordinating between police units, retail security, and forensic services. Such multi-agency collaboration is crucial in managing acquisitive crime, despite the pressures of limited staffing and increasingly digitised crime patterns.\n\nRegarding case management, particular thanks are due to Lisa Gregory, Crown Court listing officer, whose organisational efforts ensured the smooth scheduling of hearings despite recent court clerks’ strikes which have affected several districts nationally. Indeed, these industrial actions have risked compromise of justice timeliness across numerous jurisdictions, but it is a credit to the Canterford Crown Court team that the present matter proceeded with minimal disruption.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nAmong procedural matters worthy of mention is the renewed emphasis on the role of court ushers and floor staff in maintaining order and assisting vulnerable participants in the justice process. The refurbishment of the public gallery area, completed in late 2024, has upgraded accessibility features, benefiting witnesses who may require additional support.\n\nThis court also acknowledges ongoing concerns within the Probation Service about caseload volumes and staff retention, as outlined in the National Probation Directorate’s 2025 Annual Report. These challenges inevitably affect the pace and depth of pre-sentence investigations and supervision post-sentence.\n\nWhile unrelated to the charges against you, the court was made aware of an adjacent case involving the theft of copper cabling from a rail depot, a matter prosecuted by the Eastern Circuit Crown Prosecution Service and resulting in consecutive custodial sentences. The two cases share no common defendants but serve as a cautionary illustration of the variety of acquisitive crime facing contemporary law enforcement.\n\nAdditionally, correspondence has been reviewed from the local homeless outreach charity, Hope Haven, which has recently reported increased street sleeping in the Canterford city centre. This societal context provides background but does not attenuate individual responsibility. The charity’s letters express concern about the balance between enforcement and compassion in community safety initiatives.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nIn the realm of victim impact, Canterford Retail Association’s comprehensive survey focused on the psychological impact on retail staff who repeatedly witness theft or are confronted with covert attempts to conceal goods. Many staff reported heightened stress, a sense of vulnerability, and the financial consequences of lost commission or reduced working hours during investigations.\n\nThe court takes such considerations seriously, recognising that theft offences are not victimless and that the human element must be factored into sentencing decisions.\n\nThe history of your engagements with the Criminal Justice System comprises several prior convictions for similar offences, mainly involving shoplifting in various localities. It is noted, however, that no previous custodial sentences have been imposed, but rather community penalties and conditional discharges.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nIt is further observed that among your stated personal circumstances is a period of unstable housing and intermittent employment in low-wage sectors. While these facts may explain certain pressures, they do not excuse the repeated decisions to offend. Furthermore, the court is aware through official channels that you have declined several invitations to participate in voluntary community rehabilitation schemes and support services designed to address offending behaviour.\n\nThe case is placed in relief against the background of an ongoing national concern regarding pressure on retail staff arising not only from theft but also from antisocial behaviour, aggressive interactions with customers, and workplace stress. Enforcement agencies continue to wrestle with the challenge of balancing public protection, offender rehabilitation, and community safety in this complex environment.\n\nIt must be said that, notwithstanding these pressures, many individuals in similarly difficult circumstances choose lawful ways to cope with adversity.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nThe Court also draws attention to the evolving jurisprudence on reduction for guilty pleas from R v. Hawkes [2023] EWCA Crim 1045, which clarified that reductions should not be mechanistic but lawful exercises of judicial discretion influenced by the totality of circumstances.\n\nThis principle is germane here, where your plea was entered at a relatively late stage, after extensive engagement by the prosecution in evidence gathering and disclosure.\n\nYour counsel has submitted that mitigation should focus on your expressed remorse, acknowledgment of the impact of your conduct, and a commitment to engage with support services post-sentence. These submissions are noted and will be given appropriate weight.\n\nExpert assessment, probation input, and victim impact considerations will jointly inform the final sentencing determination.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nIn formulating a final sentence, the court will weigh the following factors: the seriousness and persistence of the offending; the impact on victims and retail operations; your personal history and circumstances; the timing and nature of the guilty plea; and the potential for rehabilitation with appropriate intervention.\n\nIt would be remiss not to mention briefly the contemporary phenomenon of social media’s influence on public perceptions of criminality. The proliferation of platforms such as TikTok and Instagram has led to some trivialisation of offences like shoplifting, with certain “influencer” content glamorising petty theft. While this cultural trend has no bearing on your case, it represents a societal challenge to norms of legality and propriety.\n\nSimilarly, reports have highlighted the increasingly common occurrence of video appeals by retailers to the public to assist in apprehending suspects, sometimes leading to misidentification and social media outcry. These developments underscore the fraught interface between technology, public engagement, and justice.\n\nTo return to the matter at hand, the court notes that you have neither a history of violence nor evidence of gang affiliation. No threats to staff were recorded during incidents, nor were weapons involved. This limits aggravating factors but does not diminish the repeated and calculated nature of the thefts.\n\nSentencing will be deferred pending the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service, which will make recommendations concerning the suitability of a community order involving unpaid work, rehabilitation activities, or whether a custodial sentence is warranted.\n\nCounsel and the parties are directed to ensure that all supplementary material and representations be submitted before the next hearing date, currently fixed for 10 November 2025.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Canterford. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal against any sentence imposed within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT CANTERFORD  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2025/14798  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. R.
