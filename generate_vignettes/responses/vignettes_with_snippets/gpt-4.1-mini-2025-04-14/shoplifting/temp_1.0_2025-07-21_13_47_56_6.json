Mr H  \nCase No. T2025/14739  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L. Archwell  \nFiled: 15 August 2025  \n\nMr H, you are before this court today for sentence relating to offences of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct occurred over an extended period spanning from September 2023 to February 2025, involving multiple locations across the city and surrounding boroughs.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour first appearance at this court took place on 12 March 2025. The matter was originally listed before the Magistrates’ Court at Lewes, but the seriousness of the charges and the amount involved necessitated committal to the Crown Court for disposal under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme instituted in 2016. I record, with some relief, that this case was processed within the indicative time limits mandated by the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR), albeit with a short adjournment that was sought by the defence to allow for further disclosure requests.\n\nThe Better Case Management system, as established by CPR Part 3, mandates early identification of issues, timely disclosure, and efficient listing of hearings. While the system aims to reduce delay and avoid unnecessary adjournments, reality often falls short. In the course of this case, the court witnessed an amicable but protracted process with diligent engagement from all parties. I acknowledge and thank counsel for their consistent cooperation despite the often cramped listing schedules affecting the Crown Court registry.\n\nThe availability and clarity of evidence was initially constrained by incomplete CCTV footage from certain premises, which only became centrally available following liaison between separate local policing units and the city council’s Business Crime Reduction Partnership. This multi-agency collaboration, while laudable in principle, revealed the ongoing challenges faced by institutional partners in managing fragmented information streams and disparate data formats.\n\nThere was also an unfortunate and avoidable delay occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted consideration of the defence application for expert psychiatric evaluation. Initial requests submitted on 7 May 2025 were not approved until mid-June, resulting in a truncated timetable for the defence expert. Such recurrent administrative bottlenecks warrant continued scrutiny and reform, given their impact on the timely delivery of justice.\n\nYou initially pleaded not guilty at your first hearing on 12 March but entered a guilty plea on 1 July 2025, just days before the scheduled trial window. The court observes with some concern that this late admission of guilt, while now accepted, deprived witnesses of the relief of avoiding the ordeal of trial preparation and attendance.\n\nCredit for a guilty plea is apportioned in accordance with the guidelines set out by the Sentencing Council and the established common law on this matter. The Court of Appeal in R v Hamer [2021] EWCA Crim 1441 has emphatically reminded sentencing courts that the timing of a plea is critical to determining the degree of discount, with earlier pleas meriting greater credit in recognition of the procedural economy and expression of genuine remorse. Late pleas entered at the lump-sum point of inevitable conviction carry significantly reduced credit.\n\nIt remains necessary to remind all parties that the goal of sentencing is not merely to respond to the crime but to reduce reoffending and protect the public. Repeated acquisitive offending is regrettably linked to entrenched criminal careers and often exacerbated by unmet vulnerabilities, social deprivation, or mental health challenges.\n\nOne cannot discuss such cases without reference to the expanding body of domestic and comparative case law that grapples with the nuanced boundaries between culpability, welfare considerations, and the demands of public protection. For instance, in R v. Wilkes [2019] EWCA Crim 334, the court dealt with an individual exhibiting complex needs and multiple supporting interventions. While that case involved drug-related acquisitive offences rather than straight theft, it is instructive in suggesting how a court might calibrate sentencing to reflect both risk and reformative potential.\n\nSimilarly, it is worth recalling the dicta in R v. Weatherill [2020] EWCA Crim 496, where the Court of Appeal emphasised that repeat shoplifting, while often viewed tritely by the public, inflicts real harm upon small business owners, erodes community confidence, and places burdens on an already strained criminal justice system.\n\nIn the course of this case, the court received and considered a number of witness statements and victim impact reports. I commend the patience and professionalism of retail staff and managers who repeatedly encounter the anxiety and disruption caused by opportunistic theft. It is a misconception to regard such offences as victimless — they have tangible ramifications for employees’ sense of safety and the financial viability of small enterprises.\n\nMoreover, this court notes with appreciation the work of the Brighton Business Crime Partnership, which has endeavoured to provide both procedural assistance and moral support to affected businesses amidst rising crime rates. Their submissions underscore the cumulative toll even “low-value” theft imposes on shop floor morale, staff turnover, and security measures.\n\nThe defendant resides within the city borough and has no registered employment. Attempts were made by the Probation Service to engage you with community-based support initiatives, although these were somewhat hampered by your inconsistent cooperation.\n\nSimilarly, input from the mental health services was facilitated following instruction of a forensic clinical psychologist, Dr Sally Brant, whose report was received just prior to sentencing. Dr Brant notes the absence of a formal psychiatric diagnosis but remarks upon traits consistent with impulsivity and limited capacity for future planning. She also highlights an underlying history of substance misuse and social instability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nI turn now to the detailed facts as proven at trial or admitted through your plea. The conduct represents a patterned and repeated approach, rather than an isolated lapse. This sustained offending involved deception, disguise, and actions calculated to avoid detection. The modus operandi included concealment of goods in clothing and the deactivation or removal of security tags.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe court heard evidence that at times you conducted offending in the presence of other individuals who were either known associates or casual acquaintances. This raises questions about potential ancillary influence or encouragement, though no charge was brought against any purported co-offender.\n\nThe wider issue of co-defendant involvement is well exemplified in other cases, such as R v. Partridge [2022] EWCA Crim 682, where complex networks of opportunistic thieves coordinated their approaches to avoid suspicion. No such extensive conspiracy was found here, but courts remain alert to signs of organised involvement as an aggravating factor.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe court also considers the impact on local business proprietors, some of whom reported recoding losses in the several hundreds of pounds over the period of your activity. Security enhancements, including the installation of additional CCTV and staffing adjustments, were deployed, further straining operational budgets and staffing resources already affected by post-pandemic economic pressures.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nOften neglected in sentencing are insights from frontline workers who experience an erosion of safety culture. The reports submitted on behalf of the employers document heightened anxiety and diminished job satisfaction among staff who feared confrontation or reprisal. This is regrettably paralleled by an uptick in aggressive incidents, including verbal threats and occasional physical altercations unrelated to the present defendant yet contributing to an overall climate of fear.\n\nIt is within this backdrop that community safety partnerships strive to contain wider antisocial behaviour and its attendant harms.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe submissions filed by your legal representatives highlight certain mitigating matters, including a history of childhood instability and educational disruption. Reference was made to a letter from a longstanding family friend, Ms Joanne H., testifying to your early struggles with housing insecurity and episodic neglect.\n\nThere was also mention of the impact of longstanding socio-economic deprivation on your educational outcomes and personal self-efficacy.\n\nThe psychological report, while not evidencing a diagnosable condition, acknowledges deficits in impulse control and emotional regulation which may be relevant to your offending profile.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nHowever, any such mitigation must be balanced against the persistence of offending despite prior warnings and attempts at early diversion. Over recent years you have accumulated several previous convictions and community resolutions for related conduct.\n\nYour previous sentencing history includes a custodial order for an unrelated offence of criminal damage committed in 2021, which underlines a pattern of defiance towards authority. The impact of such antecedents upon current sentencing is well settled; see for example R v. Stevens [2019] EWCA Crim 827.\n\nIt must also be remembered that credit for late guilty plea is necessarily limited under the established framework.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nParole and probation officers involved in preparing precursor reports have noted your sporadic engagement with allocated support services. That is regrettable, given the array of community resources at your disposal through the local authority and voluntary sector. Agencies like the Brighton Outreach Network and SafeSpace Brighton have been proactive in extending offers of assistance. Copy correspondence received from SafeSpace highlights their repeated invitations to you for counselling and financial advice, all of which went unanswered.\n\nThe probation officer references the burdens faced by frontline staff who, amid chronic underfunding and high caseloads, strive to maintain continuity in supervision and rehabilitation. The strain on such resources is well documented in government reports and parliamentary inquiries.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nIn considering the appropriate sentence, this court is guided not only by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences (2020) but also informed by jurisprudence on culpability and harm from the Court of Appeal. The categorisation of offending within these guidelines hinges upon factors such as frequency, sophistication, the value of goods stolen, and the consequent effect upon victims.\n\nEven though the aggregate monetary loss here might be considered modest in absolute terms, the constellation of aggravating features — including repeated offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, and failure to respond to prior sanctions — legitimise a firm approach.\n\nThe court is mindful of the principle of proportionality enshrined in section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which demands balancing retributive, preventive, and rehabilitative objectives.\n\nIn assessing the line between community-based sanctions and immediate custody, the nature of the offending pattern and the demonstrated disengagement from support services weigh heavily.\n\nIt is a serious challenge to balance the need to foster rehabilitation with the imperative to deter, particularly in cases exhibiting entrenched recidivism.\n\nThe court also gives due regard to the increasing body of evidence linking cognitive behavioural interventions with reductions in offending among acquisitive criminals. The Probation Service’s forthcoming pre-sentence report will therefore consider the extent to which such programmes, perhaps combined with financial counselling and substance misuse support, might be feasibly integrated into any community order.\n\nIt is rare for a case of this sort to be resolved without some degree of custodial sentence, but the final determination must await all relevant reports.\n\nThis court also regrets the absence of media coverage of this case, depriving the public of insight into the broader social harms occasioned by what some may deem “minor” offending. Transparency remains a cornerstone of democratic justice, even when headlines are marked by the lack of sensationalism. The reality of criminal justice is often more humdrum but no less vital.\n\nIn closing, I record my thanks to the Crown prosecution advocate, Ms Elaine Barlow, and to your counsel, Mr Thomas Fenton, both of whom have ably represented their respective clients and navigated the procedural complexities herein.\n\nI further acknowledge the patient and diligent service of court staff, ushers, and clerks, whose efforts underpin the administration of justice amid often heavy caseloads.\n\nI reserve sentence pending receipt and consideration of a detailed pre-sentence report, encompassing assessments from probation and liaison with mental health and social care providers.\n\nYou are reminded that this court expects full engagement with any rehabilitation activities ordered and that failure to comply will attract swift and robust response.\n\nThe court will give due consideration to all relevant aggravating and mitigating features and is particularly interested in learning whether a tailored community sentence might feasibly reconcile the competing objectives of public protection and rehabilitation.\n\nFurther hearing is provisionally listed for 16 October 2025 in Court 5 at Brighton Crown Court.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities for registration. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing pursuant to section 108(1) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged here. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. T2025/14739  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L.
