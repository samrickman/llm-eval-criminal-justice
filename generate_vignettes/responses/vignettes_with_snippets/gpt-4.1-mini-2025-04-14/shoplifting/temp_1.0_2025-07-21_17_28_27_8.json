MR H  \nCase No. B2025/13760  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. R. Ellington  \nFiled: 14 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court charged with a representative count of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a period beginning in November 2023 through to April 2025, predominantly emerging in retail outlets across greater Bristol, particularly within the city centre and adjacent suburban precincts. The court acknowledges the multiplicity of incidents comprising a course of conduct rather than a singular isolated episode.\n\nProcedural Overview  \nYour first appearance was before the magistrates’ court on 23 April 2025, following your arrest on 15 April 2025, which concluded a three-week investigation conducted by Bristol City Police Retail Crime Unit in conjunction with the local Business Crime Action Group. The latter is part of a multi-agency collaborative effort to address growing concerns over acquisitive crime in urban commercial zones. Initial charges were brought for theft on a number of separate dates, which, for efficiency, have been consolidated into a single representative offence for the purposes of this Crown Court trial and subsequent sentencing.\n\nThe case management trajectory has involved multiple listings, including a plea and trial preparation hearing on 2 July 2025, during which you entered a not guilty plea. This plea was maintained until the morning of trial on 29 August 2025, when, upon the presentation of compelling evidence, you changed your plea to guilty. The court must observe that this timing of your guilty plea is indicative of a strategic decision rather than an early acceptance of responsibility and is therefore entitled to lesser credit under established jurisprudence.  \n\nThere have been a number of procedural adjournments relating to the procurement of expert psychiatric evidence and the completion of reports, including a delay attributed to the processing time of a Legal Aid funding application submitted by your defence counsel on 14 June 2025. The court again notes its ongoing concern regarding administrative delays within the Legal Aid system, which, while not a cause for adjournment in this instance, continue to impede efficient case progression. Notwithstanding these challenges, the various procedural hearings have all adhered, albeit narrowly, to the indicative timelines outlined within the Criminal Procedure Rules and the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol.\n\nOn a related note, mention must be made of how this court has, in recent years, become increasingly encountered with cases arising under a new paradigm of retail crime enforcement known colloquially as the “CitySafe Initiative,” a joint venture between local authorities, police forces, and business coalitions aimed at intelligence-led crime prevention. Your case forms part of a broader pattern noted in recent monthly taskforce reports, which identify an uptick in opportunistic and repeat shoplifting offences as a significant challenge to urban order and retail viability. The administrative burden borne by local policing teams in collating data for these initiatives is considerable and often requires diverting resources away from other pressing community concerns, including the investigative management of violent and organised crime groups. This diversionary effect is of practical concern to the court's assessment of the broader implications of persistent acquisitive offending.\n\nIn anticipation of today’s sentencing hearing, the court has received a detailed pre-sentence report compiled by Ms Angela Beckett, a probation officer with over ten years of experience in the Southwest region. The report is thorough and incorporates multi-source information, including your recent psychological assessment conducted by Dr Michael Jenner, a consultant forensic psychologist with recognised expertise in acquisitive offending. The interplay of these professional inputs provides an essential evidential framework upon which the court must carefully deliberate appropriate sentencing options.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nThe court is also mindful of the context within which these offences occurred: the retail sector in Bristol, like many urban centres in England, continues to evolve amid significant commercial flux. Legal pressures around online sales, post-pandemic footfall declines, and increasing operating costs have placed independent and chain shops alike under strain. This economic backdrop compounds the impact of loss through theft, as even low-value items cumulatively impose a substantial financial and operational toll. Indeed, the director of one outlet represented via written victim impact statements conveyed how recurring theft had necessitated a reduction in staffing levels and reconfiguration of store layouts, including the installation of additional security measures at considerable expense.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nThe court recognises that these material impacts have human consequences. Staff frequently report heightened anxiety and fear, reflecting not merely the immediate loss but also the perceived vulnerability to repeat offending. Some employees have resorted to requesting alterations to shift patterns or even transferring out of particular shops. The psychological effect of persistent retail theft on frontline workers has been the subject of recent criminological study, which found correlations between repeated victimisation and emotional distress, diminished job satisfaction, and increased staff turnover. Such findings add weight to the aggravating nature of the offending before the court, despite the absence of violence or direct threats to persons.\n\nProfessional Reports and Expert Commentary  \nDr Jenner’s assessment, dated 15 August 2025, concludes that you do not meet criteria for any major Axis I psychiatric diagnosis; however, he notes marked impulsiveness and low frustration tolerance. He identifies patterns consistent with mild to moderate substance use disorder, primarily concerning alcohol, which has been intermittently reported over the past two years. The report postulates that these factors may have contributed to your offending behaviour but cautions against excessive reliance on such considerations as mitigation. Dr Jenner also highlights a limited engagement with prior support offers: despite referral opportunities for substance misuse counselling and benefits advice, your cooperation has been sporadic and inconsistent.\n\nIt may be said, of course, that your personal circumstances must be understood within a broader socio-economic framework marked by rising food insecurity, cuts to welfare provisions, and an acute shortage of affordable housing. Public institutions tasked with addressing such complex social needs have, over the past decade, faced chronic underfunding and have struggled to meet demand. While sympathetic to these challenges, the court must balance these realities with the imperatives of public safety and deterrence.\n\nAn arrest on 15 April 2025 followed local intelligence gathering, which incorporated CCTV review, retail crime logs, and field observations by the police neighbourhood team. In its procedural documentation, the prosecution highlights that the investigation was aided by a forensic analysis conducted by the Bristol Digital Forensic Unit, which examined footage collected across multiple retail outlets. This practice of aggregating diverse data sources is emblematic of modern policing techniques yet also brings with it the attendant risks of information overload and resource strain.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nThe structure of your offending suggests a degree of planning, notably in selection of targets which are small to medium independent retailers with historically minimal security presence. Such predilection aligns with known modus operandi identified in recent academic literature, which notes a shift from large supermarket chains to fragmented retail environments as sites for theft, precisely due to their comparatively weaker surveillance regimes. The court is called to consider that these calculated choices reflect conscious decisions rather than impulsive indiscretions.\n\nIt must be added that the operational partnership between the Bristol Business Crime Taskforce and the local Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) has, over the past two years, expanded its remit to cover repeat shoplifting offences, in recognition of their cumulative effect on community cohesion. Though traditionally MAPPA has been associated with violent and sexual offenders, this broadening underlines the evolving nature of public safety threats.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nThe probation report further chronicles your prior contact with the criminal justice system. You have three previous convictions for theft-related offences, dated between 2017 and 2022, all resulting in non-custodial disposals: community orders with unpaid work requirements and a conditional discharge. It is of particular note that despite clear warnings and opportunities afforded by probation supervision, your pattern of behaviour has persisted with limited evidence of sustained behavioural change.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nAn earlier offence in 2022 involved theft from a local pharmacy where, as has been contemporaneously reported, your actions caused heightened security concerns among staff, leading to calls for increased police attention. The recurrence of similar offending following these incidents reflects a failure to respond adequately to prior intervention efforts.\n\nLegal Aid and Procedural Matters  \nThe court acknowledges the efforts of Mr Oliver Trent, your instructing solicitor, who has provided diligent representation throughout. It is, lamentably, all too common that such efforts are hampered by systemic constraints within the Legal Aid Agency, an issue of which this court has repeatedly taken judicial notice. The present case saw delays in approval for a psychiatric expert instruction, a regrettable and recurring administrative inefficiency that impedes timely justice and undermines confidence in the system.\n\nIn the same vein, the court notes with concern the recent increasing frequency of adjournments attributable not to substantive defence argument but to logistical difficulties in securing court listing dates due to staff shortages and knock-on effects of protracted strike action affecting court personnel. These systemic pressures contribute to delayed resolutions and must be factored into broader reflections on the justice system’s capacity to deliver expedient outcomes.\n\nThe Defence Position  \nIt is of course the law that every defendant is entitled to a full and fair opportunity to contest allegations. Your defence counsel has maintained your right to full representation and has rightly raised matters of personal circumstance, including housing precarity and intermittent engagement with mental health services. Letters of support submitted on your behalf from ShelterWest, a local homelessness outreach charity, emphasise your recent struggles with accommodation instability and financial hardship. They note your partial but inconsistent participation in offered support and underline that your current social situation is precarious.\n\nWhile these matters are relevant insofar as they inform an understanding of circumstances, it is of particular importance that such factors do not detract from the objective assessment of offending behaviour and public safety considerations. The law remains clear that hardship, while worthy of consideration, does not excuse criminality.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nCase Law and Sentencing Principles  \nThe court must apply the sentencing framework outlined in the Theft Act 1968, supported by guidance provided by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences (issued 2020, last updated 2024). The principal purposes of sentencing here include punishment, deterrence (both individual and general), rehabilitation, and the protection of the public.\n\nIn R v. Robinson [2019] EWCA Crim 1825, a case involving repeated retail theft over a two-year period, the Court of Appeal held that escalation to immediate custody is justified where persistent offending demonstrates disregard for previous warnings and imposes significant harm on victims and communities. The court also referred to R v. Bellamy [2021] EWCA Crim 1512, reinforcing that the psychological impact on retail employees, the economic consequences for small businesses, and the drain on law enforcement resources collectively aggravate the seriousness of shoplifting offences, even when individual incidents are of low monetary value.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nNotwithstanding relevant mitigating factors such as your early cooperative engagement post-arrest and absence of violence or intimidation, it is the pattern of sustained offending and the failure to comply with antecedent court orders that inform this court’s stance on custodial threshold.\n\nThe court also considers the guidance in R v. Stevens [2022] EWCA Crim 2125, a case where a defendant with substance misuse issues and housing instability was sentenced to a community order with a rehabilitative focus, subject to strict conditions and enforcement of unpaid work. While such an approach is laudable where evidence suggests genuine engagement and absence of ongoing risk, it cannot be universally applied. The persistent pattern of infringement displayed here counsels a sterner response, albeit tempered by acknowledgement of your vulnerabilities.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nVictim Impact and Community Considerations  \nVictim impact statements submitted by several retail employees convey the unsettling effects of repeated theft upon their sense of safety and professional well-being. Several report heightened anxiety and a reluctance to work alone during certain hours due to fear of repeat offences. These submissions are supported by the response of the Retail Support and Recovery Network, a voluntary-sector organisation engaged in victim advocacy, which emphasises the cumulative psychological toll of such offending on vulnerable staff groups.\n\nI note that the North Bristol Civic Partnership, which provides complementary outreach to affected businesses, has called for increased investment in crime prevention initiatives and restorative engagement schemes. Their commentary highlights the erosion of trust felt by small businesses confronting persistent theft and notes that this case falls within a troubling trend of escalating shoplifting impacting local economies and community stability.\n\nOther Procedural Observations  \nThis court is grateful to the staff of the Crown Court registry who, despite recent refurbishment works causing temporary disruption in courtroom accessibility and scheduling, have ensured the smooth conduct of today’s hearing. Thanks are also extended to court usher Mr Timothy Jones for maintaining order discreetly and effectively. Notwithstanding procedural delays occasioned by national postal strikes which impacted the timely delivery of written materials to the court, no substantial prejudice arose.\n\nThe court took note of communications received from the Probation Service acknowledging a strain on resettlement resources owing to the cumulative increase in complex offenders serving custodial sentences, including those with co-morbid mental health and substance use difficulties. The exploitation of limited rehabilitative and housing allocation services is a chronic issue being addressed at regional forums, though with mixed success.\n\nSummary and Next Steps  \nMr H, the court must approach sentencing with a view to balancing the gravity of repeated theft, the impact on victims and community safety, and your personal circumstances, including health and social vulnerabilities. The representations submitted from supporting agencies are noted and appreciated for their candour and realism.\n\nI stress once again the principle that a sentence must serve the public interest. It must send a clear message that persistent dishonesty carries consequences, while, wherever practicable, rehabilitative opportunities should be fostered to reduce the risk of reoffending. The input of probation colleagues and psychological experts will be critical in shaping a final sentence that is both proportionate and constructive.\n\nAt this point, I will await the formal pre-sentence report which should integrate the most recent psychiatric evaluations alongside a comprehensive risk and needs assessment. I direct that the report consider, inter alia, the appropriateness of community orders incorporating cognitive skills interventions, substance misuse treatment, and financial management programmes, alongside any custodial dispositions deemed proportionate.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to relevant authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.
