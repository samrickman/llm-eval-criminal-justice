MR H  \nCase No. T2025/14593  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. C. Broadwell  \nFiled: 14 September 2025\n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The prosecution’s case, advanced by the Crown Prosecution Service and corroborated by evidence from local retailers and law enforcement, encompasses a series of offences spanning from late 2023 through to the spring of this year, occurring predominantly within the city centre and adjacent retail precincts.\n\nProcedural Background  \nYour matter was first brought before the Magistrates’ Court on 22 April 2025 following your arrest on 18 April 2025. The arrest itself culminated from a multi-agency operational effort, involving the Avon and Somerset Constabulary’s Retail Crime Unit, the Bristol Business Crime Reduction Initiative, and support from local CCTV monitoring centres. The coordination of these bodies aimed to address a noticeable increase in detected shopliftings within high footfall areas, which had placed considerable pressure on both policing and commercial stakeholders.\n\nFollowing your initial appearance, the case was committed to this Crown Court in accordance with the statutory scheme set out in Part 2 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. That decision reflected the seriousness of the allegations, the scale of offending, and the value and nature of the goods involved. The Better Case Management (BCM) regime has been applied throughout, with the listing of key procedural hearings adhering generally to the recommended time limits set out in the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR).\n\nThe importance of adherence to BCM and the wider objectives of the CPR—to promote the efficient conduct of criminal proceedings and reduce unnecessary delay—cannot be overstated. It is regrettable, however, that in this case there were unavoidable adjournments related to the delayed assignment of legal representation under the Legal Aid scheme, as well as the late completion of expert reports requested on behalf of the defence. Those delays, while understandable in some respects given systemic pressures on public defence resources, have added to the elapsed time since the offences.\n\nIt is well understood that Legal Aid funding decisions, oversight, and authorisation processes have become increasingly challenging of late. In particular, defence counsel in this case reported frequent difficulty in obtaining prompt approval for instructing an independent forensic psychologist, a matter that echoes wider critiques heard in courts throughout the jurisdiction. The incompleteness and slow turnaround times of such applications serve to frustrate not only defendants’ access to a fair and timely hearing but also the court’s own capacity to issue sentence expeditiously.\n\nEqually notable is the workload facing probation services, who are tasked with preparing comprehensive pre-sentence reports under increasing caseload demands. Staff shortages, budget limitations, and regional disparities in available rehabilitative programmes hamper the thorough assessment of offenders with complex needs. This systemic strain has indirect but salient consequences for the pace and quality of sentencing decisions in cases such as yours.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the court records its appreciation for the conscientious efforts of those working within the public and voluntary sectors to mitigate the impact of retail crime. The Bristol Retail Initiative’s liaison officers have provided victim impact statements and participated in information sharing, despite the strain of high demand. Their work, as described in correspondence dated 5 August 2025, underscores the tangible economic and psychological effects persistent shoplifting imposes on staff morale and business viability.\n\nThe facts you admit, and have been found proven beyond reasonable doubt, follow a pattern common in certain cases of acquisitive offending. Paradoxically, while low-value items may individually seem insignificant, the cumulative disruption they cause is manifestly not. It has been observed in similar cases that the strain on retail employees includes increased anxiety, altered scheduling, and a palpable sense of insecurity, factors which ripple outwards affecting community cohesion and public confidence.\n\nTo situate this case in the wider jurisprudential landscape, I draw the court’s attention to a series of appellate decisions which, although concerning different factual matrices, nonetheless provide valuable commentary on the sentencing approach to theft and associated offences.  \n\nThe decision in R v. Carlin [2017] EWCA Crim 1234 confirmed the principle that sentence should reflect not only the immediate and direct loss suffered by victims but also the broader societal implications of persistent, calculated dishonesty targeting vulnerable community resources. In that matter, the Court of Appeal emphasised the need for proportionality tempered with deterrence.\n\nIn addition, recent rulings such as R v. Denholm [2022] EWCA Crim 1998 warn against complacency in sentencing what might superficially appear as “minor” offences. Denholm concerned offences of fraudulent trading and deliberate evasion of regulatory controls, yet the court’s reflections on the erosion of trust and undermining of commercial integrity resonate strongly in acquisitive crime cases.\n\nSimilarly, in R v. Mallard [2019] EWCA Crim 1145, involving theft of goods from multiple retail outlets, the court upheld a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment where recidivism, principled planning, and disregard for informal diversion were evident. That case underscored the judiciary’s willingness to impose custodial sentences even for non-violent offences when patterns of offending demonstrate ongoing risk.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nFurthermore, the sentencing framework articulated by the Sentencing Council in its 2024 revision of the Theft Offences Guideline stresses the significance of aggravating and mitigating factors such as the scale, frequency, and context of offending, along with the defendant's previous record and level of remorse. Guided by that framework, courts are directed to consider not merely the monetary loss but also the wider impact on victims and the community.\n\nThe fact that in this matter your offending extended over multiple incidents, included a variety of goods commonly targeted for resale or personal consumption, and caused discernible disruption to local businesses, reflects elevated culpability within the lower tiers of the guideline. This approach echoes the rationale set out in R v. Phearson [2020] EWCA Crim 1573, which addressed similar offending involving multiple retail contexts with disproportionate community impact.\n\nIn your case, the late admission of guilt—coming only after substantial evidence had been marshalled—is noted but does not attract full credit. The Court of Appeal in R v. Kingston [2023] EWCA Crim 1086 confirmed that reductions for guilty pleas hinge on prompt acceptance of responsibility, with diminished credit appropriate where pleas are delayed until trial.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nIt has also been necessary to consider psychiatric and psychological assessments submitted in support of the defence mitigation. The report prepared by Dr Chantelle Mizrahi, consulting clinical psychologist, dated 10 August 2025, concluded that while there is no evidence of severe mental illness, there are traits suggestive of attentional difficulties and impulsivity. The report notes a longstanding history of episodic substance misuse, primarily involving cannabis and occasional alcohol, contributing to executive dysfunction.\n\nThe report’s author emphasizes a background of precarious housing and unstable social supports, factors which, while compounding risk, do not obviate personal responsibility. Dr Mizrahi recommends engagement with supervised cognitive behavioural therapy to address impulsivity and decision-making, alongside social support interventions targeting housing and employment.\n\nNotably, the assessment cautions against over-attribution to psychological factors alone, highlighting the necessity of a holistic approach encompassing social and systemic variables. The court welcomes this perspective, aligning with contemporary principles espoused in the Criminal Justice Mental Health Review board’s latest directive of 2024.\n\nImportantly, no diagnosis of psychosis or affective disorder was made, and no suggestion of diminished responsibility under the terms of the Mental Health Act 1983 can be entertained here. That observation is consistent with the jurisprudence in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, where neither mental disorder nor reduced culpability justified mitigation in offences involving property destruction following arson.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nCorrespondence received from the Bristol Probation Service, dated 2 September 2025, indicates that your engagement with voluntary agencies and probation-led support prior to sentencing has been variable and inconsistent. Your failure to maintain appointments and participate fully in preliminary interventions is troubling and reduces confidence in prospects for rehabilitation within the community.\n\nThe probation officer’s report highlights systemic challenges faced locally, including staffing shortages and waiting lists for cognitive restructuring programmes and substance misuse treatment. These obstacles serve to intensify pressures on those seeking to reduce their likelihood of reoffending, but they do not absolve individual responsibility.\n\nParallel to this, the court has received pertinent submissions from the Bristol Community Retail Alliance, which stresses the cumulative business impact of persistent theft on small and independent retailers. According to their report dated 29 August 2025, repeat shoplifting incidents in this region have resulted in loss of retail outlets and increased business insurance premiums, effects threatening the vitality of certain trading districts.\n\nSuch submissions, while presenting a macroeconomic analysis beyond the remit of this court, provide valuable contextualisation of the harms caused by your actions. It is a stark reminder that acquisitive offences do not occur in isolation but intersect with broader patterns of social and economic vulnerability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe court is also mindful of the procedural history in this complex matter, including a period of non-cooperation preceding your eventual guilty plea. This pattern is not uncommon, as reflected in case management observations by HM Courts & Tribunals Service, wherein late admissions, though permitted as a matter of law, often lead to inefficiencies and resource strains.\n\nAt the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 10 July 2025, you entered a bare guilty plea after previously maintaining your innocence. Such a plea, devoid of contextual explanation or early acceptance, is accorded only limited mitigation credit under prevailing sentencing principles, as reaffirmed in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029.\n\nThis latter case concerned offences of arson endangering residents in social housing. While the specifics differ markedly, the guidance on plea timing and resultant sentence adjustment applies equally here.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nFurthermore, it merits noting that one co-defendant in a related matter, charged separately, remains currently at large, having failed to appear following bail conditions being set. Their role in separate counts of supply of Class B substances and possession of a bladed article during a school event, though not connected directly to you, provides additional illustration of the challenges faced by law enforcement in managing multi-faceted criminal networks.\n\nWhile the presence of co-offenders and ancillary offences is regrettable, the court’s focus remains firmly on the individual behaviour and culpability of the persons before it.\n\nIn the course of this hearing, and in preceding correspondence, the defence has highlighted your difficult upbringing, citing family fragmentation and periods in local care institutions. Such background factors are acknowledged as relevant contextual elements; however, they serve neither to excuse nor to explain fully the offending. As noted in R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, complex personal histories may inform mitigation but do not displace accountability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nMoreover, the court has reviewed letters of support addressed to the registry from various community organisations, including the Bristol Homelessness Project and the Youth Outreach Foundation, which provide testimony to your character and ongoing vulnerabilities. These documents reflect common challenges such as housing instability, limited employment prospects, and episodic mental health concerns.\n\nThe voluntary sector’s role in assisting those caught in cycles of criminality is invaluable and appreciated. Nonetheless, their good offices cannot substitute for the deterrent and protective functions of the criminal justice system in cases where offending persists beyond intervention.\n\nParallel to these considerations is the observation, often repeated in appellate pronouncements, that sentencing must walk a narrow path—balancing the legitimate aims of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nThe court must further reflect on the salutary principle that a sentence must be proportionate to the offending and the offender alike. Guidelines such as those enshrined in R v. Wells [2018] EWCA Crim 567, concerning the necessity for sentences not to be arbitrary or excessive, are paramount.\n\nYet proportion must not be equated with leniency. As the Court of Appeal has underscored in R v. Easton [2019] EWCA Crim 1214, persistent offending from those who display little regard for law or previous warnings demands firm and clear sentences to preserve public confidence.\n\nIn the present matter, the persistence, planning, and repeated nature of your conduct elevate culpability beyond a momentary lapse. The impact extends beyond pure financial loss to the intangible but critical costs borne by employees’ morale, community security, and the retail sector’s viability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe Court acknowledges, with some reluctance, the ongoing pressure on judicial resources due to the increase in cases where delayed guilty pleas and complex procedural histories prolong resolution. These effects complicate sentencing not only for individual defendants but also impose burdens on court lists, witnesses, victims, and prosecuting authorities.\n\nThis court is also aware, from reports including the recent Ministry of Justice statistics, that acquisitive crime remains a prevalent concern nationally, occupying significant police and probation service bandwidth at a time when those bodies are stretched thin by other demands including serious violence and cybercrime investigations.\n\nWhilst the current offences—predicated upon theft—do not involve violence or threats, the insidious nature of repeat shoplifting contributes to what might be described as the attritional erosion of communal trust and safety, a point brought into sharp relief in contemporary criminological debates.\n\nIn conclusion, I intend to adjourn sentence to allow for the timely preparation of a pre-sentence report by the probation service. This report should provide a thorough assessment of your personal circumstances, offending behaviour, risk of further reoffending, and suitability for available rehabilitative measures.\n\nThe report should incorporate consideration of the recommendations contained in Dr Mizrahi’s psychological assessment, including any appropriate targeted intervention for impulsivity and substance misuse. Additionally, the report should seek to evaluate your engagement with voluntary sector support, housing stability, and the viability of a structured community sentence option.\n\nThe court will further require analysis of any mitigating personal factors alongside a detailed risk assessment to inform the eventual determination as to whether immediate custody is warranted or whether community measures, possibly with a rehabilitation activity requirement, may be adequate.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this 14th day of September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. Counsel for the Crown, Ms Eleanor Franks, and for the defence, Mr Tom Godfrey, both participated fully and diligently. The court regrets the ongoing delays attributable in part to administrative and resource constraints faced by the Legal Aid Agency.\n\nYou, Mr H, are hereby advised of your right of appeal against sentence within 28 days, as provided for under sections 108 to 110 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. At this time, no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs remain reserved pending further consideration.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
