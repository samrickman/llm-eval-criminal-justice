MR H  \nCase No. T2025/13567  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. DUNCAN  \nFiled: 17 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced following your conviction on a charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge relates to a series of shoplifting incidents occurring over an eighteen-month period, primarily within the Bristol metropolitan area, affecting various retail outlets including pharmacies, convenience stores, and small independents.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour arrest took place on 28 April 2025, subsequent to an extensive investigation coordinated by Avon & Somerset Police with considerable input from the Bristol Retail Crime Partnership. The investigation encompassed a complex assembly of digital evidence, including CCTV footage, point-of-sale data, and witness testimony. An early difficulty in the case was the requirement to secure viable identification — often complicated by inconsistent lighting and momentary camera obstructions typical in retail environments. Nonetheless, persistent enquiries and corroborative evidence eventually warranted charge.\n\nIt is appropriate here to note that the successful prosecution of retail theft cases such as this one depends heavily on the tenacity and commitment of police officers, store personnel, and often volunteer security staff. Capturing and then processing hours of shop floor footage is laborious and frequently lacks the glamour associated with more high-profile investigations. From this perspective, one must acknowledge the dedication of Sergeant Mandy Holloway and her team, whose management of this investigation was meticulous and protracted.\n\nMore broadly, the burden on policing resources posed by acquisitive crime remains significant. Though sometimes dismissed as “low-level” or “victimless,” shoplifting requires substantial police time, forensic support, victim liaison, and, crucially, judicial attention. In an era marked by shrinking budgets and increasing demand across all aspects of law enforcement and community safety, these cases can contribute disproportionately to the workload. It is a constant challenge to strike an appropriate balance between responding to these offences and attending to more serious threats, such as violent crime or public order disturbances.\n\nThe case's progression adhered, for the most part, to the prescribed timetable under the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR). The initial hearing was held promptly on 3 May 2025, and the listing for a plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 15 June. At that latter hearing, you entered a not guilty plea. The case was listed for trial on 10 September; however, on the morning of the trial, you entered a plea of guilty. This last-minute change is regrettably a growing phenomenon in this court and others. It invariably reduces any entitlement to sentence discount for early admission of guilt, as the Court of Appeal has repeatedly made clear — notably in the decision of R v. Abrahams [2023] EWCA Crim 195, where the court emphasised that credit for a guilty plea must balance judicial economy with genuine remorse and responsibility.\n\nIt is prudent also to draw attention to the role of the Legal Aid Agency in this matter. Defense representation was provided under a standard representation order, facilitated by Mr Damian Price of the Public Defender Service. There have been delays and administrative challenges, particularly concerning the application and subsequent approval for an independent psychiatric report, which were protracted over several weeks. Such delays are emblematic of systemic problems within the Legal Aid framework and, while they do not excuse tardiness on any party’s part, they do underscore the obstacles that all stakeholders face in achieving timely and effective case resolution.\n\nIt is likewise necessary to recognise the contribution of voluntary organisations in supporting victims and community resilience. The Bristol Retail Partnership, a consortium of independent shopkeepers, has provided detailed victim impact statements, reflecting not only individual loss but the broader economic and psychological effects on small business communities. Their ongoing commitment to collaborative crime reduction initiatives is commendable, particularly in the current climate of uncertainty and economic strain.\n\nAs a procedural aside, it is worth noting that this court continues to experience operational pressures due to staffing shortages, both within the judiciary and administrative services. Such pressures inevitably cause listing delays and frequent rescheduling, as was the case in this matter, where two adjournments were necessary, the first due to the ongoing psychiatric evaluation, and the second caused by an unforeseen judicial strike. These factors, while external to the substantive issues before the court, provide a vital backdrop to the procedural flow of justice.\n\nLegal Context  \nThe offence with which you are charged falls squarely within the remit of the Theft Act 1968, which defines theft as dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive the owner of it. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences, revised as of March 2023, provides a structured approach to assessing culpability and harm. Key aggravating factors include persistence of offending, vulnerability of victims or premises, use of concealment or deception, and previous convictions of similar nature.\n\nWhile the monetary value of individual items taken may be modest, the cumulative financial impact and psychological toll on staff and proprietors cannot be underestimated. This is particularly the case where offenders target small businesses, as opposed to larger chains with more extensive loss-prevention resources.\n\nIt is prudent to consider recent appellate authority on credit for guilty pleas in acquisitive crime cases. The Court of Appeal in R v. Chandra [2024] EWCA Crim 341 held that late guilty pleas entered immediately prior to trial, after extensive evidence has been marshalled, warrant a discount of no more than 10%, reinforcing the principle already articulated in R v. Lawrence and others.\n\nMoreover, the court must give due recognition to the public interest in deterrence, both specific and general. In the present context, where you have a history of similar offending, the sentencing exercise requires particular attention to sending a clear message concerning the consequences of recidivism.\n\nIt is, of course, necessary at this juncture to draw a brief comparison to unrelated but instructive case law, such as R v. Benwell [2019] EWCA Crim 1208, which concerned a complex series of commercial burglaries involving forced entry and substantial property damage. Although materially distinct, Benwell encapsulates the judiciary’s evolving approach to offences affecting business owners and employees, especially where there is a discernible pattern suggesting disregard or defiance of law and order.\n\nFurther, in R v. Ormsby [2018] EWCA Crim 1739, the Court addressed sentencing in relation to repeated environmental offences, specifically fly-tipping on protected green belt land, emphasising the need for deterrence when public resources and natural heritage are thereby jeopardised. While not directly analogous, such cases illustrate the judiciary's broader concern with sustained offending impacting community welfare.\n\nFacts of the Offending  \nThe facts before this court are straightforward insofar as they have been accepted by your plea. The Crown relies on a representative count encompassing a series of shoplifting episodes from multiple local retailers between October 2023 and March 2025.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThese incidents often involved the use of distraction techniques, sometimes involving cooperation with third parties not before this court. Surveillance cameras captured you utilizing bags or clothing to conceal articles, and in some cases, you were seen exiting premises promptly to avoid detection.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nAt one point, security tags were deliberately removed or concealed, signifying premeditation and knowledge of store security measures. Staff reports indicate that some employees altered their routines in response to your conduct, including varying working hours and calling for additional on-site presence.\n\nThe degree of organisation and repeated visits to the same establishments suggest this was not an isolated or opportunistic series of acts, but a calculated pattern of theft intended to maximise gain while minimizing risk. This conduct resulted in economic loss and caused sustained anxiety among shop staff, who feared escalation or confrontation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nLinked with this, there was clear evidence of your presence in the vicinity on multiple occasions, supported by mobile telephone data analysis commissioned during the police investigation. That such technology was deployed signifies the gravity with which authorities regarded these offences and the resource implications for their resolution.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nFurther, at one point during the investigation, local officers executed a warrant at premises occupied by your co-defendant. Although unrelated to your charges, this individual was found in possession of indecent images, and subsequently charged with offences revolved around the Sexual Offences Act 2003. That matter is entirely separate but necessarily delays ancillary police resources and underscores the complexities involved when individuals operate within wider criminal milieus.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThere is no evidence that you participated in those offences or that you had any knowledge thereof. I emphasise this distinction because conflation would be both legally and factually improper.\n\nYour previous convictions include three for shoplifting in 2021 and 2022, albeit without custodial sentence. The Crown notes the limited time elapsed since the last offence, thereby confirming a pattern of repeat behaviour despite previous warnings and community resolution measures.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nAdditional witnesses, including store managers and retail loss prevention officers, have described the impact of your offending as disproportionately damaging to the morale and financial viability of small independent outlets. They express concern not only for tangible losses but also for the erosion of customer confidence and the negative effects on staff well-being.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nThe Crown also draws attention to your apparent failure to engage meaningfully with diversionary schemes or support services offered in the community, notwithstanding several referrals initiated through the Probation Service and local social care teams.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nReports and Assessments  \nA psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Selena Walker, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was commissioned with the aim of assessing whether any underlying mental health condition might bear on sentencing. Her report — dated 9 September 2025 — acknowledges your presentation as generally psychologically stable but notes a persistent pattern of impulsive behaviour and occasional mood instability. The report does not identify any major psychiatric disorder nor a diagnosis that would diminish responsibility under relevant legal standards. It does, however, recommend consideration of structured substance misuse services as you admit to episodic alcohol misuse.\n\nDr Walker's observations are supported by probation information, which confirms difficulty in sustaining employment, unstable housing history including periods of temporary accommodation, and involvement with several voluntary sector support organisations, albeit with limited engagement.\n\nIt is not insignificant that many such services operate with constrained funding and workforce shortages. The National Probation Service, like many public bodies, grapples with high caseloads and recruitment challenges. The Probation Officer assigned to your case, Ms Rachel Avery, reports that while periodic contact has been maintained, there is a need for more consistent attendance to ensure effective rehabilitation.\n\nReference must be made to the prevailing theory and practice surrounding criminal justice interventions for acquisitive offenders. The literature suggests that cognitive-behavioural approaches, coupled with vocational support and where applicable mental health treatment, represent the most effective means of reducing reoffending.\n\nIt is most unfortunate that the Legal Aid Agency's delays in approving your defense application for a psychiatric assessment prolonged pre-trial procedure by several weeks. Such administrative friction not only imposes frustration on legal teams but risks undermining confidence in the timely administration of justice.\n\nPublic and Social Context  \nWe find ourselves in a period where the criminal justice system has adapted to an evolving landscape of low-level crime increasingly seen as symptomatic of wider social challenges — housing insecurity, economic instability, and the erosion of traditional community structures.\n\nCrimes classified as “shoplifting” are, for many, a manifestation of these systemic pressures. Yet the law distinguishes neither the motive nor the hardship of the offender from the impact on victims and the community.\n\nThe positioning of retail workers — often young, female, and underpaid — as frequent targets of such offences amplifies concerns about workplace safety and dignified labour conditions. Furthermore, the economic fragility of small businesses in the face of repeated theft hazards the sustainability of neighbourhood commerce and contributes to urban decline.\n\nWhile broader society debates the appropriate balance between punishment and rehabilitation, the courts must nonetheless impose sentences reflective of both the seriousness of offending and the need to protect victims and the public.\n\nThis court is also conscious of the cultural shifts in attitudes towards offending and law enforcement, including the rise of social media activism and public opinion shaped by rapidly disseminated content that may skew perceptions. It is incumbent on the judiciary to remain steady, impartial, and guided solely by evidence and legal principles.\n\nI must express appreciation for the professionalism of the court staff, including ushers and administrative clerks, whose diligence under staff shortages ensures continuity of hearings. The recently refurbished court facilities in this building provide some solace amidst these challenges.\n\nSentencing Framework  \nIn sentencing you, I am bound to the sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council. Your offending qualifies in the mid-range category for theft, aggravated by persistence, targeting of vulnerable premises, and recent prior convictions.\n\nPersonal mitigation includes your acknowledgement of guilt and some evidence of remorse as expressed in your letter to the court. While late, that plea avoids the necessity for a contested hearing and spares witnesses the ordeal of trial.\n\nI accept that your personal circumstances are challenging, including housing instability and financial precarity. Nevertheless, the court’s paramount obligation is to protect public interest and foster deterrence.\n\nCommunity orders with rehabilitation requirements remain an option, subject to the risk of breach and their adequacy in addressing the offending behaviour. Custody, too, is under consideration, especially in light of your offending history and failure to desist.\n\nI shall therefore order the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report which explores suitable community-based interventions in parallel with custodial alternatives. The report should consider the feasibility of a structured programme incorporating cognitive skills, substance misuse support, and vocational training.\n\nI also direct that the Community Rehabilitation Company liaise with supported housing providers to establish whether stable accommodation arrangements can be secured post-sentence, as housing insecurity is a known criminogenic factor.\n\nIn considering all these matters, the court maintains a focus on both rehabilitation prospects and the effective protection of the public.\n\nThe hearing today has been conducted openly, with all parties present and represented. I record my thanks to Ms Sophie Lane, who appeared for the Crown, and Mr Damian Price who represented you under the Legal Aid scheme.\n\nI caution again the ongoing difficulties faced by providers of legal aid, with procedural delays often imposing disproportionate burdens on defendants and their counsel.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and subsequent sentence will be transmitted to the relevant registries and authorities. You are informed of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Matters of cost remain reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. MR H  \nCase No. T2025/13567  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L.
