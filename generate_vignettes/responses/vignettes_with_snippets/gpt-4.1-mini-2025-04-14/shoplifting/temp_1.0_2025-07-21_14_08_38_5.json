MR H  \nCase No. K2025/13422  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. MALCOLMSON  \nFiled: 18 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on a charge of theft, specifically a course of conduct involving shoplifting offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour extends over a significant period and encompasses multiple retail premises within the Dartford and Gravesham boroughs.\n\nProcedural History  \nYour arrest on 16 April 2025 came after an extensive multi-agency operation involving the local Dartford Police Division, the Kent Retail Crime Partnership, and civilian security teams from several affected stores. This prolonged investigation was marked by painstaking collation of surveillance material, staff interviews, and forensic analysis. The pattern of offending was identified only after multiple incidents were reported and linked, a task that, as this court has noted repeatedly, requires significant resources and collaboration, often testing the limits of law enforcement capacity.\n\nThis case was initially listed before the magistrates given the low-level nature of the thefts, but due to the cumulative value and repeat character of the incidents, the charge was committed to this Crown Court for sentence pursuant to the direction under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The Better Case Management (BCM) protocol has governed the progression of this matter, and the court acknowledges the efforts of all parties in adhering, as far as practicable, to the timelines set out in the Criminal Procedure Rules.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that this particular case fortunately avoided some of the more common delays afflicting similar cases in the current climate. Notably, the timely instruction of counsel, the consistent communication between the Crown Prosecution Service and defence representatives, and minimal last-minute adjournments enabled the matter to proceed, albeit with some understandable procedural pauses resulting from Legal Aid Agency review processes. I commend both Ms Rebecca Lowell for the Crown and Mr Daniel Drummond for the defence for their measured and professional handling of these proceedings.\n\nThe court is painfully aware, however, of the systemic issues posed by the chronic underfunding and administrative inertia pervading Legal Aid authorisations. It remains a source of ongoing concern that requests for expert reports, including psychiatric and psychological assessments, linger unanswered for extended periods — a problem that compromises effective case preparation and, in the worst cases, risks undermining defendants’ rights.\n\nIt is pertinent to observe, though perhaps expeditious to note, that on this occasion funding for a forensic assessment was expeditiously granted following a protracted exchange of correspondence between Mr Drummond’s chambers and the Agency. The psychiatric report, compiled by Dr Karen Sterling, was received and served in timely fashion, enabling the court to consider it fully alongside other expert reports and victim impact statements.\n\nThe defendant has entered a guilty plea at the earliest possible stage practicable, that is, at the first opportunity when the prosecution evidence had been clearly established and before the matter reached interview or trial. Credit for this plea is accordingly given in accordance with well-established jurisprudence such as R v. Liveridge [2021] EWCA Crim 1579, which underlines the importance of recognising early admissions of culpability as a mitigating factor in sentencing.\n\nWe live in a time when acquisitive crimes such as shoplifting present unique challenges to local policing and community welfare. The court is reminded of the recent report by the Home Office entitled “Retail Crime and its Impact on Consumers and Businesses,” published earlier this year, which identifies a troubling increase in repeat offences affecting small and medium-sized enterprises. Whilst this case may not reflect the more organised or gang-related theft operations that feature in national statistics, it exemplifies the persistent and corrosive effect such offences have on staff morale, public confidence, and the viability of local commerce.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  \n\nIn considering these facts, the court is compelled to contextualise the offence within the broader social patterns noted by commentators and researchers alike. The normalisation of low-level dishonesty and the often-trivialised status of retail theft belie the very real consequences experienced by victims — from financial loss and increased security measures to psychological distress and diminished job satisfaction.\n\nAmong the many victims in this case are employees of the “Greenvale” pharmacy chain who, in written statements, have described operational disruptions necessitated by your repeated intrusions. Staff anxiety reportedly increased to the point where shift patterns were altered, with lone working discouraged during times of previous offence. Such measures are costly, disruptive, and speak to the seriousness with which these crimes are taken by businesses despite their occasional minimisation in public discourse.\n\nIn the domain of case law, it would be remiss not to mention R v. Carling [2020] EWCA Crim 1231, which concerned a defendant who repeatedly stole toiletries and accessories from various convenience stores, employing distraction techniques and the use of accomplices. Although Carling involved arguments over the role of organized crime, the principles articulated regarding the impact of sustained acquisitive offending on small businesses resonate with the present circumstances.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  \n\nThe court pauses to recall the notable judgment of Lord Justice Cooke in R v. Hodgson [2018] EWCA Crim 998, where it was reiterated that while the culpability of theft offences is necessarily assessed by reference to factors such as value, planning, and persistence, the psychological and economic toll on workers and community members requires considered weight.\n\nBeyond the immediate legal landscape, a wider phenomenon merits reflection: the escalating strain placed on local authorities and voluntary organisations by ongoing acquisitive crime. Charitable entities such as \"SafeStep,\" which provide support and advocacy for retail workers, have reported rising numbers of clients suffering from workplace stress attributable to theft-related incidents. Their correspondence to this court highlights a systemic need for greater recognition and resources devoted to staff welfare in sectors frequently targeted by such offences.\n\nEqually, there is cause for concern regarding the capacity of probation services and rehabilitative frameworks to respond effectively to recidivist acquisitive offenders amid mounting caseloads and staff shortages. The court notes correspondence from the Kent Probation Trust underscoring the challenges posed by increased pre-sentence workload combined with the management of multi-agency public protection arrangements. The persistent imbalance between demand and resource availability is well documented and regrettably continues to hamper the delivery of tailored interventions.\n\nIn a similar vein, multiple judicial authorities have commented on the benefits and limitations of community sentences in mitigating repeat offending. The report prepared by Ms Joanne Hartley, probation officer assigned to this case, provides an insightful analysis of the necessity for focused cognitive-behavioural programmes addressing impulsivity, financial management, and addiction support, all of which may be pertinent in your circumstances.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  \n\nDr Sterling’s psychiatric evaluation, which has been given careful consideration, acknowledges that while you do not meet the criteria for any major psychiatric diagnosis, there exist significant personality traits marked by emotional dysregulation and intermittent substance misuse, which may have contributed to your criminal behaviours. She observes that these factors, coupled with socio-economic hardship and a lack of stable accommodation, present a complex and challenging rehabilitation profile.\n\nIt is unfortunate that, despite previous offers, your engagement with available support services has been inconsistent. This is regrettable not only from the standpoint of your own wellbeing but also in terms of the broader imperative to reduce reoffending and protect the public. The court must emphasise that access to community resources, while important, cannot substitute for individual commitment.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  \n\nThe sentencing framework in cases of theft has developed over many years. The Sentencing Council's definitive guideline on Theft Offences (September 2021) provides comprehensive structure for assessing seriousness and appropriate ranges of penalty. Aggravating factors include persistence, targeting of vulnerable victims, and previous convictions; mitigating factors may encompass early guilty pleas, genuine remorse, and demonstrable efforts to address underlying causes.\n\nAmong the principles reinforced by appellate courts is the limited, though important, role of personal circumstances in outweighing public protection objectives. In R v. Newell [2019] EWCA Crim 1457, it was stressed that courts must balance compassion with deterrence and the need to uphold societal expectations of responsibility.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  \n\nThe courts do not lose sight of the difficult social environment in which many offenders find themselves. The rising prevalence of street homelessness, as widely reported in regional studies last year, and the resulting risks of exploitation, substance misuse, and mental health deterioration, all contribute to an environment conducive to criminal behaviour. However, as Lord Justice O’Connor noted in R v. Sidhu [2023] EWCA Crim 2125, these factors should inform but never dominate sentencing determinations.\n\nYour personal history, while replete with challenges, falls within this familiar category. The chronicity of offending despite multiple interventions underlines the complexity faced by those attempting rehabilitation. It also highlights the importance of public protection considerations, particularly given the risk of escalation or diversification of offending behaviour if left unchecked.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  \n\nThe court must consider also the broader context of multi-agency collaboration in the management of offending risk. The Kent Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) have developed refined strategies for risk assessment and offender management, but their focus naturally remains on higher-level risks – violent, sexual, or organised crime. Low-level acquisitive offending does not typically engage MAPPA protocols but nevertheless demands attention from local safeguarding partnerships to prevent entrenchment and harm to communities.\n\nIt is notable that the defendant’s previous interactions with police and probation authorities, according to recorded case files, display a sporadic pattern of engagement, with several referrals to diversion programmes failing to yield sustained outcomes. The probation note dated 1 August 2024 records the defendant’s disengagement from a community order imposed then for similar offences. Such patterns constrain sentencing options and inform the court’s assessment of appropriate custodial or community-based sanctions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  \n\nThe evidence confirms that your offending conduct has been deliberate, calculated, and repeated despite previous warnings. Items targeted were often high-demand consumer goods such as health and beauty products or over-the-counter medicines — goods readily resalable and thus of continuing interest to offenders motivated by financial gain.\n\nAccounts from retail managers depict a palpable sense of disruption not only to operational efficiency but also to staff morale. The fear of collision with a known offender during lone shifts and the subsequent stress symptoms reported by employees were corroborated by a workplace health and safety audit commissioned in April 2025.\n\nSuch intangible harms are often overlooked in the quantification of loss but speak to a broader societal cost. The impact of your conduct on the willingness of small business owners to maintain storefronts in vulnerable areas, or on local economies as a whole, though hard to measure precisely, must nonetheless be recognised.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  \n\nThe court further notes that the present case does not involve allegations of violence or threats thereof. Your conduct, whilst persistent and damaging, appears confined to non-violent means, which ought to be considered when calibrating an appropriate sentence. Nevertheless, it should be understood that non-violent offences may nonetheless inflict serious psychological distress and cumulative harm.\n\nIt is also important, in a reasonable exercise of discretion, to refrain from conflating this case with offences committed by unconnected co-defendants or associates, or the importation of drugs and other serious crime in the local area which, while concerning, bear no factual relevance here.\n\nIn a recent judgment, R v. Delaney [2024] EWCA Crim 3032, the Court of Appeal dealt with the issue of co-defendant conduct in multi-party cases and reminded sentencing judges of the necessity to isolate personal culpability from that of others. The present proceedings comply fully with that principle: the focus is solely on your actions and responsibility.\n\nConclusion and Sentencing Pathway  \nIn determining the disposition in this case, the court must weigh the seriousness of your repeated, opportunistic offending and the harm caused, against any mitigating personal circumstances and prospects for rehabilitation.\n\nWhilst your guilty plea is noted and welcomed, it comes against a backdrop of multiple prior convictions and unsuccessful diversion attempts. This pattern signals a degree of persistence that requires decisive intervention. The court must balance the need to protect retail staff and the public, to deter others, and to foster rehabilitation.\n\nAt sentencing, the court will consider all available options, including custodial sentences, community orders incorporating rehabilitative requirements such as accredited Thinking Skills Programmes, unpaid work, and attendance at drug and alcohol support services should these be recommended. It is essential that the sentence imposed is proportionate, structured to reduce risk, and mindful of the broader interests of justice.\n\nAccordingly, the court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith, addressing not only your offending history and personal circumstances but also any identified mental health concerns, accommodation stability, and willingness to engage with support services. The report should explore the suitability and feasibility of community-based sentences, conditions likely to promote compliance, and the likelihood of desistance.\n\nI note that the hearing today has been conducted in open court, with due regard to the interests of all parties. I thank Ms Rebecca Lowell and Mr Daniel Drummond for their efforts, and acknowledge the invaluable assistance of forensic and probation professionals whose input has informed these remarks.\n\nThe defendant is reminded of the right to appeal sentence within 28 days under the relevant legislation. There are no reporting restrictions or anonymity orders at this stage.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 October 2025, in Court 6 at Dartford Crown Court. The proceedings are transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be sent to the appropriate authorities for processing.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT DARTFORD  \nR v.
