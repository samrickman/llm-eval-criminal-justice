MR H  \nCase No. T2025/12856  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. A. RICHMOND  \nFiled: 17 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of a charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, in consequence of which you have entered a plea of guilty.\n\nProcedural History  \nThis matter originated following an investigation by officers from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, prompted by reports from several independent retailers within the central Bristol area. The offences, as charged, represent a pattern of shoplifting incidents committed over a period extending from approximately October 2024 until March 2025. The investigation involved cooperation between police units, store security personnel, and the Bristol Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), a multi-agency collaboration established in 2016 aimed at addressing acquisitive crime within the commercial districts.  \nThe BCRP's approach involves the collation of incident reports from affected retailers, dissemination of offender descriptions, and strategic deployment of police resources to hotspots. Despite the initiative’s commendable intentions, the court is aware from both submitted materials and prior experience that the efficacy of such schemes varies considerably. Staff shortages, shifting priorities, and competing demands often constrain sustained efforts.\n\nMoreover, the Better Case Management process was engaged in this prosecution, with a plea and trial preparation hearing conducted in May 2025. The case was duly allocated to the Crown Court given the volume of evidence and the sustained course of conduct alleged. The initial hearing was adjourned twice, once to allow for disclosure of additional CCTV evidence and again to permit the commission of a pre-sentence psychiatric report. Both adjournments were reasonably necessitated, although counsel for the defence expressed frustration about procedural delays attributable in part to difficulties in securing Legal Aid approval for expert instruction.\n\nThe court acknowledges the ongoing challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency. In this instance, the application for funding of a forensic psychologist was initially refused on grounds of insufficient justification, which, in retrospect, appear unduly stringent. Following formal representations and the intervention of the Legal Aid helpline, approval was granted three weeks later than anticipated, contributing to delay. Such occurrences, unfortunately, are not atypical in contemporary criminal proceedings and warrant sustained professional concern.  \n\nThe police investigative team, in addition to working with the BCRP, utilised conventional means including witness statements, forensic examination of clothing and recovered goods, and CCTV footage from multiple retail premises. Mobile phone footage submitted by the first victim’s partner was also presented, though its evidential weight was limited by quality issues. The court notes the frequent reliance on consumer-grade recording devices in retail theft cases, which can both aid and hinder investigative clarity.\n\nOn 5 June 2025, you appeared before the Magistrates’ Court where you indicated a not guilty plea. Following enhanced disclosure and the filing of an expert report, the matter was committed for trial to this court. On 14 August 2025, you changed your plea to guilty at the earliest practicable stage before the trial date.\n\nIt is a regrettable but established feature of cases involving repeated shoplifting that defendants often delay admission of guilt until the evidential case has become overwhelmingly strong. While the law correctly permits such procedural rights, it also recognises that the sentencing credit available for late pleas should correspond with the timing and circumstances of the admission. The Court of Appeal’s position in R v. Pickering [2023] EWCA Crim 1018 remains authoritative: a plea entered only at the threshold of trial attracts markedly less reduction than one entered soon after charge. It is a fine but important distinction, intended to incentivise early acceptance of responsibility and to respect the interests of all parties, including victims.\n\nThe Crown, represented by Ms Eleanor Shaw, has provided clear and cogent submissions concerning the impact of your offending on the retailers and their staff. The defence is represented by Mr Simon Clozier of counsel, who has candidly acknowledged the difficulties encountered in progressing this matter expeditiously. I express my gratitude to both counsel for their professional conduct throughout.\n\nLegal and Contextual Framework  \nThe Theft Act 1968 remains the principal statutory instrument governing offences of theft. Section 1 delineates the core offence, requiring proof of dishonest appropriating property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving. The legislative framework is supplemented by a detailed Sentencing Council guideline, last updated in 2022, which emphasises the balance of culpability, harm, and offender personal mitigation.\n\nThe court also considers relevant case law, including the seminal House of Lords decision in R v. Ghosh [1982] QB 1053, which, although superseded on the test for dishonesty (see Ivey v. Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67), remains instructive in its broader themes regarding intent. The more recent Court of Appeal authority in R v. McClean [2024] EWCA Crim 2067 directs sentencing courts to take account of patterns of offending rather than isolated acts when the charge represents a course of conduct.\n\nNotably, while certain offences in the criminal law involve heightened protections—such as those protected under the Dangerous Offenders regime or involving sexual harm—the present case, being non-violent and primarily property-based, falls within the mid-range acquisitive crime category. Nevertheless, risk of reoffending, impact on victims, and previous history are crucial factors.\n\nIt is also instructive to reflect on the challenges facing the Probation Service nationally. Resource constraints, high caseloads, and the growing complexity of cases are well documented—particularly for those offenders whose social circumstances include unstable housing, unemployment, or comorbid mental health issues. In the present matter, the allocated probation officer has reported significant difficulties in engaging you meaningfully.\n\nFurthermore, NHS mental health services, under pressure from soaring demand and limited funding, frequently struggle to provide timely assessments or interventions for defendants exhibiting mental health vulnerabilities without acute risk markers. Despite this, the cooperation of Dr Sarah King, Consultant Psychiatrist at the Avon and Somerset Mental Health Trust, has been instrumental in providing a competent forensic assessment on your behalf.\n\nThe facts of this case are as follows: \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nTurning to the modus operandi, it is apparent that your offending was systematic and deliberate, involving both concealment techniques and opportunistic timing. The use of distraction tactics, such as engaging staff in ostensibly innocuous conversation while removing goods, indicates a level of sophistication not commonly found in first-time or incidental offenders.\n\nFurther, the evidence suggests you deliberately targeted small or independent retailers, presumably perceiving these as softer targets compared to larger chains with more robust security measures. While arguably pragmatic, such conduct particularly damages community cohesion, as independent shopkeepers often lack both the resources and institutional support of larger enterprises.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nIt is significant that victims’ statements were obtained from store managers, many of whom have expressed ongoing concern regarding loss prevention and personal safety. Several reported consideration of altered staffing rotas to avoid lone working during peak hours when your presence was anticipated. This state of affairs engenders an erosion of community trust and workplace morale.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nIn addition to the police and Crown Prosecution Service’s efforts, local voluntary sector organisations have maintained contact with the commerce community affected. The Bristol Retailers Support Network, although operating on limited funds, furnished an impact statement which highlights the psychological toll of repeat theft on small businesses, sometimes leading to premature closures or displacement.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nOn behalf of the defence, a forensic psychiatric report compiled by Dr King concludes that while you do not suffer from any major psychiatric disorder, traits associated with low mood, impulsivity, and an absence of behavioural regulation were noted. Dr King cautions against interpreting this as an excuse for criminality, instead suggesting targeted therapeutic intervention might reduce reoffending likelihood.\n\nOf note, Dr King points out a history of unstable accommodation, periodic unemployment, and familial estrangement, all factors which collectively compound personal stress and impair judgement.\n\nExperts are of course mindful that presence of psychological or social difficulties does not equate to absence of agency. This court has repeatedly observed that mental health vulnerabilities, while warranting compassionate consideration, cannot absolve individuals of responsibility for deliberate wrongdoing.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTo provide broader context, the sentencing guidelines recommend particular focus on whether there has been repeated offending, the impact on victims and local businesses, and any steps taken by the offender to acknowledge wrongdoing or commence rehabilitation. Credit for guilty pleas must be weighed meticulously, taking account of the timing and genuineness of the admission.\n\nThe court notes that during pre-sentence enquiries it became evident that you have declined offers of support from both the Probation Service and local voluntary organisations designed to assist with housing and employment. Despite multiple referrals, you have not engaged with budgeting or skills programmes, leading to reasonable concerns about your willingness or capacity to address the underlying causes of offending behaviour.\n\nRecent data compiled by the Avon Probation Service illustrates the difficult position faced by practitioners dealing with offenders harbouring entrenched patterns of acquisitive crime compounded by social marginalisation. The caseload is described in internal memoranda as “unsustainably high” and staff turnover is an ongoing issue.\n\nIt is worth reflecting briefly on related case law in this section. For example, R v. Fenwick [2022] EWCA Crim 778 concerned a defendant convicted of repeated theft from supermarkets, who exhibited both a pattern of covert concealment and opportunistic timing around staff shift changes. The Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 10 months’ custody, while highlighting the cumulative impact of persistent offending on local business viability and public confidence in retail safety.\n\nSimilarly, in R v. Allerton [2023] EWCA Crim 1054, the defendant’s conduct involved a series of offences including theft, handling stolen goods, and associated fraud. While the offences were partially distinct from Mr H’s conduct, the appellate court drew attention to the broader harm inflicted on the business community and public order.\n\nI do not suggest that these cases are precisely analogous, but they provide a useful frame of reference to illustrate judicial attitudes towards acquisitive crime involving persistent patterns.\n\nIt is also prudent to make passing mention of the operational challenges of digital forensic units within contemporary police forces. The current case saw requests for enhancement of certain CCTV footage met with initial reservations due to backlog and technological constraints. The court is aware that digital evidence gathering remains a resource-intensive and rapidly evolving field.\n\nThe court further observes, without attributing any particular relevance, that the relevant Legal Aid arrangements have once again been a source of difficulty in this matter. Funding applications for psychological and ancillary reports have been reviewed and initially rejected on technical grounds, contributory to delay. This is despite a national framework intended to expedite access to such support services in appropriate cases. Such procedural fragility ought to be addressed by administrative reform.\n\nThe facts, while clear, show unmistakably a pattern of persistent dishonest conduct. The defendant resorted to multiple entries into various retail premises, timed to avoid detection during shift turnover. Frequently, goods of modest value but high resale potential were removed and concealed within bags or clothing.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe impact on victims has been documented through statements describing emotional distress, loss of revenue, and a pervasive sense of unease among staff. Although no violence or threat thereof was present, the psychological harm cannot be underestimated. The phenomena of “reassurance gap” described in criminological literature is relevant: repeated offending erodes community confidence in law enforcement and increasing fear among shopkeepers.\n\nThe court is cognisant, moreover, of the wider implications for public safety and resource allocation. While offences of this nature may appear relatively minor when viewed independently, the cumulative effect of repeated acquisitive crime is to consume disproportionate police and prosecutorial resources. That diverts attention away from more serious or violent crime, thus indirectly affecting overall community safety.\n\nWhen considering sentencing outcomes, the court must weigh aggravating factors — including the continuity of offending, the breach of trust implicit in repeated self-service theft, the impact on victims, and the pattern of non-engagement with rehabilitative opportunities — against mitigating features such as early plea, acknowledged personal difficulties, and absence of prior custodial sentences.\n\nWhile the scale of the offences is modest in financial terms, public interest mandates a robust response to sustained acquisitive crime. The court notes the significant number of resource hours dedicated over months to monitoring, evidence collation, and prosecution. This is not trivial.\n\nDrawing together the various threads, I intend to direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report from the National Probation Service. The report is to encompass an assessment of risk, diversity considerations, psychological and social support needs, and the appropriateness of community-based rehabilitative programmes. Particular attention should be paid to expenditure of time and capacity, in order that proposals can be put forward addressing both the likelihood of compliance and the imperative of public protection.\n\nFinally, I wish to record formal appreciation for the efforts of the Bristol Business Crime Reduction Partnership. In an era marked by tightened public sector budgets and previous cuts to policing numbers, their coordination and support to small businesses are invaluable. While uneven, their contribution to community cohesion and crime deterrence is well beyond decorative.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal transcript will be lodged with the court record. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 s.49 apply. There are no further directions as to costs.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
