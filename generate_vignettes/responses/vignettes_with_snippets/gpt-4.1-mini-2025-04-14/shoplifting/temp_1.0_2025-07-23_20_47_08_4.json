Mr H  \nCase No. M2025/13451  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. Hartfield  \nFiled: 14 November 2025  \n\nMr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in respect of a charge brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, alleging a course of conduct amounting to shoplifting, with offending spanning a period from mid-2023 through to early 2025. The offending took place at multiple retail premises across the Greater Manchester area.  \n\nProcedural Context  \nYour prosecution arises from a series of incidents identified by investigators working under the aegis of the Manchester Retail Theft Taskforce, an initiative set up in collaboration with local police, business improvement districts, and the city council’s community safety teams. The expansion of this Taskforce was a response to an observed increase in retail thefts affecting not only chain supermarkets but also smaller, independent shops, primarily clustered in the suburbs of Didsbury, Withington, and Sale. The multi-agency coordination employed for your case typifies current efforts to marshal limited public resources to counter low-level crime with disproportionately extensive impact.  \n\nWhile the nature of the offences you face might seem minor when considered individually, the cumulative toll on business confidence and worker safety is anything but trivial. It bears noting that in another, quite unrelated matter, the Court of Appeal addressed the consequences of sustained offending in R v. Foster [2022] EWCA Crim 1487, in which a defendant involved in a series of daytime shoplifting incidents in West Yorkshire was sentenced heavily not on the basis of individual theft value, but due to the effect on local small businesses — a principle which carries resonance here. Foster reiterated the importance of recognising the broader community harms occasioned by offences often dismissed as victimless.  \n\nIt must be stated, with the court’s customary candour, that the justice system often grapples with the distinction between offences regarded as low risk in isolation and those which pose a systemic threat to public safety by virtue of their persistence and frequency. Your case sits squarely within this tension.  \n\nOn 3 January 2025, you were arrested by officers following a coordinated operation initiated by the Taskforce. This operation made use of CCTV analysis drawn from multiple premises, enhanced by data-sharing agreements facilitated by the Manchester Business Crime Forum, which sought to establish a pattern of offending consistent with repeated breaches of trust and deliberate avoidance of detection. While the technology employed — including real-time facial recognition software trialled on select transport nodes — warrants mention for its evolving role in crime prevention, it is equally noted for sparking debate regarding privacy and proportionality, matters well beyond the purview of sentencing but significant in public discourse.  \n\nIt is also of interest that the Legal Aid Agency encountered administrative delays in the early stages of your defence. An application to secure funding for an independent forensic assessment was submitted on 19 February 2025 but was not authorised until 14 March, requiring multiple follow-up contacts from your representative, Mr Oliver Grantham QC, appointed under a representation order granted on 28 January. Such delays are regrettable and raise broader systemic concerns about the availability and responsiveness of professional support in low-level acquisitive crime, which justice literature continually highlights as a barrier to equitable outcomes.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nYour initial police interview, conducted on 6 January 2025, was notable for your early denial of involvement. It was only following the presentation of a detailed chronology of incidents and corroborative forensic evidence — including fibre analysis linking fibres recovered from a plastic shopping sack to yarn found on your clothing — that you chose to enter a guilty plea at a hearing on 9 October 2025. It will be necessary to consider the timing of this plea in accordance with established principle, mindful of the authorities discussed below.  \n\nIn R v. Greaves [2020] EWCA Crim 904, the Court of Appeal underscored that prompt guilty pleas, submitted at the earliest opportunity, are deserving of significant credit as they conserve court resources and spare victims unnecessary trauma. Conversely, pleas tendered late in the process must be accorded correspondingly less mitigation, particularly where delay prolongs uncertainty or imposes additional burdens. This court is conscious that your plea was entered only shortly before the anticipated start of trial.  \n\nIn keeping with tradition, the Better Case Management protocols were observed with reasonable expedition. Following initial listing on 14 March 2025 and a plea and trial preparation hearing on 3 June, scheduling pressures—partly attributable to judiciary strike action earlier this year—necessitated several adjournments. These events serve as inconvenient reminders of the ongoing strain under which our criminal justice system operates.  \n\nThe conduct of trial and administrative staff merits commendation. The smooth transition to hybrid hearing arrangements, necessitated by Covid-19 restrictions earlier in the decade and now standard, has ensured continued access to justice despite fluctuating public health and staffing challenges. The court records its thanks to court clerks Jane Latham and Simon Peel, whose diligence in case management facilitated continuity in this matter.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe social and economic backdrop against which these offences were committed should not be overlooked. The period in question saw persisting instability in local labour markets, with unemployment remaining above pre-pandemic levels, especially among young adults. Retail environments faced increasingly difficult conditions, including the encroachment of e-commerce and consequent pressure on physical store viability. The presiding narrative in social policy circles is shifting towards acceptance that systemic pressures may exacerbate opportunistic criminal behaviours, particularly in areas suffering from reduced investment and fragmented community cohesion. While contextual understanding informs the justice approach, it does not excuse or obviate individual accountability.  \n\nAn unrelated case, R v. Cheung [2019] EWCA Crim 1156, concerned fraudulent acquisition of goods through misuse of loyalty schemes. Although it involved a different mode of dishonesty and a distinct offender profile, the court there emphasised the importance of deterrence in offences that erode trust in commercial transactions, a principle applicable across theft offences regardless of modality.  \n\nIn your case, the cumulative effect of your actions on the local community and on frontline retail staff is a salient factor. A victim impact statement submitted by the manager of a boutique pharmacy highlighted the emerging climate of anxiety and reduced morale among staff, leading to increased absences and requests for transfer. Such collateral consequences, while intangible, weigh heavily in the court’s sentencing calculus.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nTurning to the psychiatric and psychological input, the court has considered with care the detailed report prepared by Dr Fiona Wallace, consultant forensic psychologist, instructed on behalf of the defence. The report, dated 30 September 2025, outlines that you do not suffer from a defined major mental illness but presents traits consistent with borderline personality features, notably impulsivity, heightened emotional reactivity, and unstable interpersonal relationships. This profile may offer some explanatory context but does not mitigate culpability. Dr Wallace recommended, as a component of sentencing, consideration of an appropriate community intervention scheme incorporating cognitive behavioural therapy aimed at improving impulse control and decision-making.  \n\nOf interest is the continued professional debate surrounding the appropriate interface between custodial sentencing and therapeutic jurisprudence. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court of Appeal deliberated at length on the bounds of custodial sentences where mental health complexities are present. While that case involved arson and explicit public danger, the principles articulated concerning the balance between treatment and containment remain instructive. Notwithstanding significant differences in index offences, the underlying reasoning informs this court’s reflection on available sentencing options.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nIt is also pertinent to note recent research published by the National Offender Management Service which highlights enduring challenges faced by probation officers in engaging with defendants exhibiting borderline personality traits, particularly when compounded by substance misuse. The National Probation Service in Greater Manchester reports staffing shortfalls of approximately 12%, compounding difficulties in delivering consistent supervision. Such realities underscore the importance of crafting enforceable and tailored sentences that offer realistic prospects of compliance and rehabilitation.  \n\nTurning now to the matter of previous convictions, the court has been provided with a comprehensive disclosure from the Probation Service. You currently have four prior convictions for shoplifting offences, extending from 2017 to 2022, including one incident subjected to a conditional discharge. No antecedents involve violence or threats against persons. You have no recorded convictions for possession or trafficking of controlled substances, though local police records note two instances of separate drug-related warnings for minor possession of cannabis. Also, in the unrelated police files, a co-resident of your household is currently subject to investigation for benefit fraud, a matter unconnected to you and noted purely for completeness.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe court further notes that no evidence was adduced linking you to any organised criminal activity. Liaison with local enforcement divisions confirmed a clean record in respect of violence or weapons offences, and there were no allegations that you were under the influence or coercion at times relevant.  \n\nPublic safety considerations remain paramount. The court is well aware that the proliferation of acquisitive crime remains a top priority for policing and community safety partnerships, not only for the direct material loss suffered but for its corrosive effect on neighbourhood stability and business confidence. For many small retailers in Greater Manchester, repeat theft has been cited as a principal factor in decisions to reduce opening hours, employ additional security measures, or close premises altogether. The economic and social ripple effects are considerable, though often unquantified.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nIn considering the sentencing framework, the court is guided by the Theft Act 1968, the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences (last updated 2021), and relevant case law. The Sentencing Council posits a starting point that reflects the monetary value of goods taken, the degree of planning, and any aggravating or mitigating circumstances.  \n\nThe aggravating factors identifiable here include your history of unpaid work breach, failure to engage meaningfully with community resolution opportunities, and the impact on vulnerable victims. Mitigating factors consist principally of your early acceptance of guilt once presented with unassailable evidence, your cooperation during police interviews, and the absence of prior violent offending.  \n\nIn relation to awarding credit for plea, the guidelines and case law — notably R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 — caution that courts must be vigilant not to grant disproportionate discounts where pleas are entered at very late stages or through tactical necessity rather than genuine contrition. Here, your guilty plea was tendered shortly before trial listing, limiting but not extinguishing the entitlement to credit.   \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nIt is also apposite to consider recent local developments within Manchester’s partnership agencies. The Safer Neighbourhood Team has observed mounting pressures due to a 20% increase in acquisitive offences during the last 18 months and has advocated for enhanced offender intervention panels focussing on repeat shoplifters identified through data analytics. These emergent schemes seek to balance public protection with rehabilitative support, a duality reflected in your own forthcoming pre-sentence report recommendation.   \n\nIndependent third-sector organisations, notably the Manchester Retail Recovery Network, have provided written representations describing the ongoing challenges the retail sector faces from persistent theft, loss of revenue, and diminished staff morale. Their submissions commend the court’s attention to community impact as an appropriate consideration beyond mere quantification of stolen goods.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe court is cognisant of concerns raised by defence counsel regarding your housing stability, which is presently precarious due to tenancy disputes and temporary accommodation assignments. These difficulties, while unfortunate, are not unique and are being experienced by many across the North West, particularly in light of the ongoing national housing crisis. Nevertheless, as highlighted in R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145, while personal circumstances may inform sentencing discretion, they cannot, in themselves, provide shield against accountability for repeated acquisitive crime.  \n\nSimilarly, your expressed financial hardship, while not discounted, is to be weighed against the availability of support services provided by Manchester City Council and local charities, including budgeting advice, food banks, and mental health counselling. While there is no evidence that you have fully availed yourself of these supports, the court expects that continued engagement post-sentence will be encouraged.  \n\nIn view of the foregoing, I will adjourn sentencing to allow for the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by probation, including risk assessment and potential interventions. The report should examine options encompassing unpaid work, cognitive skills training, and structured financial guidance, as well as any suitability for a deferred sentence or community order with treatment requirements, should such measures be compatible with your circumstances and risks.  \n\nI thank Ms Aisha Mumtaz, who appears for the Crown, for her clear and measured advocacy, and Mr Oliver Grantham QC, for the defence. I also acknowledge the assistance of probation officer Mr Lee Hargrave, whose preliminary assessment facilitated listing of this matter for sentencing.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 November 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester South. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal sentence will be notated on the record accordingly. You are hereby reminded of your statutory right to appeal sentencing decisions within 28 days under the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. No reporting restrictions apply pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER SOUTH  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. M2025/13451  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M.
