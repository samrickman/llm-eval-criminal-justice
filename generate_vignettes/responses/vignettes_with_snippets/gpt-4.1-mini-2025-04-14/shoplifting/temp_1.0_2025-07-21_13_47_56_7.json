MR H  \nCase No. N2025/05621  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. Fenwick  \nFiled: 15 September 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentencing in relation to a series of theft offences from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This case concerns a sustained pattern of shoplifting across multiple commercial outlets within the Ellesmere borough and surrounding districts over an extended period commencing in mid-2023 and culminating in early 2025.\n\nProcedural History and Case Background  \nYou were arrested on 12 March 2025 following a multi-agency investigation coordinated primarily by the Ellesmere City Police Retail Crime Unit, with support from the local Business Crime Partnership and forensic analysis teams. The process leading to your arrest involved a considerable degree of collaboration across retail establishments, metropolitan intelligence services, and the Crown Prosecution Service, reflecting the resource-intensive nature of investigations into serial acquisitive offending.  \nIt would be remiss not to acknowledge the challenges confronting agencies tasked with the investigation of offences often dismissed or minimised in the public imagination as “petty theft.” Yet, the forensic and investigative work required is far from trivial. Officers devoted long hours to the painstaking examination of CCTV footage from various shops—much of it grainy or incomplete—cross-referencing with stock audits, employee statements, and movement analytics. The coordination between retention teams, surveillance units, and retail security officers has been exemplary in this matter. This court notes with approbation the diligence of Detective Sergeant Matthews and her team.\n\nThe case’s progression was also affected by several procedural matters of note. Initial committal proceedings at Ellesmere Magistrates’ Court took place on 2 April 2025, where the indictable nature of the offending required transfer to this court. The matter was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 16 June. At that stage, you initially pleaded not guilty, electing to contest the allegations.\n\nThe Better Case Management (BCM) framework, established to facilitate the efficient and proportionate administration of Crown Court business, was engaged. It is worth noting the relative smoothness with which this case has moved through BCM stages, particularly given the complexity of the evidential materials—including digital exhibits, witness statements, and expert reports. The Clerk of the Court and Case Progression Officer, Mr Lewis, are to be commended for their efforts in maintaining listing timeliness amidst wider staff shortages impacting the region.\n\nIt also merits recording that this court is cognisant of ongoing systemic pressures on the probation and mental health services, which, although peripheral to the core prosecutorial matters here, influence the delivery of ancillary assessments and sentencing recommendations. Frequent underfunding, staff attrition, and pandemic-induced backlogs have all impacted the capacity of these vital services, with implications for rehabilitative interventions that this court must inevitably consider.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nLate Plea and Credit Considerations  \nYour change of plea to guilty was tendered on 4 September, shortly before trial was due to commence. Such late pleas, while permitted and routinely encountered, attract a reduced discount in sentencing by virtue of procedural and resource implications. The law is clear: credit is a recognition of genuine remorse, early acceptance of responsibility, and an avoidance of the need for contested proceedings. Where pleas are delayed until evidence is overwhelming, or the trial imminently due, the scope for such credit diminishes markedly. This principle was robustly articulated in the Court of Appeal decision in R v Casswell [2019] EWCA Crim 653, where it was emphasised that procedural economy achieved through early pleas justifies enhanced sentencing concessions.  \nAdditionally, the decision in R v Mbeki [2020] EWCA Crim 802 highlighted that a plea entered late, particularly in cases involving corroborative forensic or surveillance evidence, must be carefully scrutinised for authenticity of remorse, with sentencing discounts curtailed accordingly. This court applies these principles here.  \nIt is therefore appropriate to record that, while your guilty plea is welcomed, it falls short of the ideal timing envisaged in the sentencing guidelines. The discount available will be calculated in accordance with your delay.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nSupporting Reports and Professional Input  \nAs part of the sentencing process, this court received a comprehensive pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Janette Howells. The report details, inter alia, your background, previous convictions, social circumstances, and potential rehabilitative needs.  \nMs Howells notes you reside in temporary accommodation provided by the council, with a history of occasional homelessness. Employment is not currently held, and there is documentation of intermittent substance misuse, primarily involving over-the-counter analgesics and sporadic alcohol consumption.  \nThe report carefully considers your prior offending history, which includes multiple convictions for theft, none of which appear to have precipitated sustained engagement with support services or evident behavioural change.  \nAmong the salient points raised is your reported disconnection from family support networks, with strained communication ascribed to longstanding interpersonal difficulties. Several letters of support from voluntary organisations, including the Ellesmere Community Food Bank and the Hope Outreach Project, outline your participation in their services, albeit irregularly and without demonstrable sustained progress.  \nSuch reports are invaluable, offering a nuanced insight beyond the sterile facts of offending. They provide a framework for the court to consider not only punishment but the prospects of rehabilitation and the imperative of public protection.\n\nIn addition to the probation report, the court received the expert psychiatric report authored by Dr Nisha Patel, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at the East Midlands NHS Trust.  \nDr Patel concludes that while no formal diagnosis of serious mental illness can be made, there are features consistent with an emerging personality disorder, characterised by emotional regulation difficulties and impulsivity. The report underscores that your offending appears to be linked in part to attempts to manage psychological stress and socioeconomic adversity, though emphasising that such factors do not excise responsibility.  \nDr Patel advocates for a structured treatment plan combining cognitive behavioural therapy with community psychiatric oversight. The report was prepared following instruction at the defence's request and funded via Legal Aid. Notably, there was delay in commissioning the report, owing to protracted administrative procedures within the Legal Aid Agency, which has been the subject of increasing judicial criticism nationally.  \nThe court joins in the sincere hope that such procedural impediments are addressed in the near term to ensure timely access to expert assessment, particularly for those defendants with potential vulnerabilities.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nThe Broader Context of Retail Theft and Public Safety  \nThe court is bound to consider the broader societal ramifications of offences such as these. Retail theft, while often minimised in public discourse, imposes a heavy burden on business owners, their employees, and the local economy. It contributes to what is identified as “shrinkage,” increases insurance premiums, and can lead to the closure of small enterprises, eroding community cohesion and employment opportunities.  \nRecent data from the Metropolitan Police Service reveal a rise in acquisitive offences of this character, placing heightened strain on policing resources that might otherwise be directed towards more serious crime types.  \nThe Business Crime Reduction Partnership model, operational since 2015, is predicated on combining the efforts of retailers, police, social services, and local government to proactively manage repeat offenders and foster safer commercial environments. Yet, the efficacy of such networks varies significantly according to regional funding, staffing levels, and inter-agency goodwill.  \nIn the present instance, the Ellesmere Partnership has demonstrated commendable engagement, providing victim impact statements and facilitating witness support. This court particularly notes the fortitude of frontline retail workers, who often bear the brunt of disrespect and intimidation despite the “low-level” classification of theft offences.  \nSuch offences are neither victimless nor inconsequential.\n\nIt is also necessary to briefly consider the state of local judicial infrastructure. This courtroom recently underwent refurbishment, including updated digital evidence display technology, which facilitated the presentation of video evidence.  \nWhile this may seem peripheral, the efficiency and clarity of trial proceedings are materially assisted by such enhancements. The court registrar, Mr S. Blundell, provides invaluable support in ensuring procedural fluidity.  \nThe importance of well-functioning institutions must not be underestimated in maintaining public confidence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nJudicial Reflections on Related Case Law  \nIt is pertinent to recall several appeals which, while not directly on all fours with the instant facts, provide valuable principles relevant to sentencing.  \nR v. Keating [2018] EWCA Crim 17 concerned a defendant convicted of repeated shop thefts involving organised distraction techniques and collusion with others. The Court upheld an eight-month custodial sentence, emphasizing that deliberate planning, targeting vulnerable premises, and resultant psychological impact on staff constitute serious aggravating factors. The decision established important calibrations of culpability in repeated acquisitive crimes.  \nIn R v. Brannigan [2023] EWCA Crim 254, the Court addressed sentencing in cases involving defendants with complex mental health profiles. While recognising the mitigating potential of disorder, it held that where the public danger remains significant, rehabilitation-oriented approaches must be supplemented by appropriate deterrence.  \nA further decision, R v. Sharples [2019] EWCA Crim 1091, focused on the consequences of late pleas. The Court underlined that while credit is discretionary, penalties for tactical delay serve the interests of justice and resource conservation.  \nWhile these cases are neither identical nor directly determinative, they offer signposts to the measured exercise of sentencing discretion here.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nVictim Impact and Wider Service Response  \nVictim impact statements entered by affected businesses detail not merely the monetary loss but elevated stress experienced by staff. Managers report altered working hours and rota adjustments to mitigate risk, with recruitment and retention increasingly challenging in this climate.  \nThe Retail Support and Community Network, a voluntary organisation specialising in victim assistance, provided written representations to the court. They highlight the cumulative toll of repeated thefts on staff morale and workplace atmosphere, noting that multiple victims requested anonymity out of concern for reprisal or reputational damage.  \nThis court is mindful of the courage required by victims to participate in the criminal process, especially where the offences are “low profile.” Their contributions are vital and valued.  \nI also note the correspondence from Ellesmere Social Services which outline ongoing efforts to engage you with rehabilitative resources. The letters commend your sporadic attendance at support groups but express concern over inconsistency and lack of sustained commitment.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nMiscellaneous Observations and Procedural Comments  \nIt bears mentioning that the present case experienced some delay due to the unavailability of key witnesses, necessitating adjournments. Such delays are regrettable, given the strain on court lists exacerbated by nationwide recruitment difficulties among judiciary and court staff.  \nIndeed, this court joins the growing chorus of judicial voices calling for enhanced investment in criminal justice infrastructure, recognising that efficiency is not an end in itself but directly impacts fairness and victim confidence.  \nAlongside those challenges, the Legal Aid system's bureaucratic hurdles, as previously referenced, place additional strain on all participants. The protracted process in securing funding to instruct expert evidence in this case is a lamentable example.  \n\nIt may be of passing interest that a co-defendant, Mr D., charged in related proceedings with possession of a bladed article at a school car park, entered a guilty plea but is not connected to your offending. That matter proceeds separately, and no inference should be drawn here.  \nSimilarly, a different individual residing in the same building as you is under investigation for alleged benefit fraud; these proceedings are wholly unconnected to your case.  \nSuch distinctions are essential to avoid conflating collocated but unrelated offences.  \nIn parallel, this court also notes unrelated community disorder incidents during the period, including an affray at a local pub involving pool cues and subsequent prosecutions, and an unrelated arson at a disused commercial premises on the industrial estate, both matters having no bearing on the charges here.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nConsiderations of Sentencing Options and Rehabilitation  \nIn determining the appropriate sanction, the court must balance the objectives of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection, as consistently emphasised in sentencing guidance and statutory framework.  \nGiven the absence of physical violence or threats, and your current vulnerability due to housing and health issues, custodial sentences remain discretionary rather than obligatory. However, the persistence and planning demonstrated in your offending weigh heavily as aggravating factors.  \nI note the existence of various community order requirements tailored to address offending behaviour, including cognitive skills programmes, mental health treatment mandates, and structured unpaid work components. Such interventions, when diligently applied, can significantly reduce recidivism and promote social reintegration.  \nThe court anticipates that any pre-sentence report will explore the feasibility and appropriateness of these measures, given your individual circumstances.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nIn conclusion, Mr H, the court acknowledges the seriousness of your offending and the wider impact on the victims and community. The late plea is noted and affects the degree of credit for remorse available. The multiple reports and representations highlight a mix of personal hardship, limited engagement with assistance, and a persistent offending pattern. These matters weigh heavily in the sentence to be imposed.  \nSentencing will be deferred pending receipt of an up-to-date pre-sentence report and consideration of any further representations. In preparation for the formal sentencing hearing, the probation service is asked to address questions of risk, rehabilitative potential, and the suitability of community-based disposals.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Ellesmere. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will accordingly be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged.
