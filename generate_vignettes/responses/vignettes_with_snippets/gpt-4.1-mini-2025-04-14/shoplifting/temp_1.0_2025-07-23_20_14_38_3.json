MR H  \nCase No. T2025/13459  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. P. WINTERS  \nFiled: 17 October 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction for shoplifting offences, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 as amended. The conduct under consideration relates to multiple incidents of theft from retail premises within the borough of Southgate spanning a period from June 2023 to April 2025. The charge presently before the court is representative of a sustained course of acquisitive offending causing economic loss and psychological impact to several small businesses and their staff.\n\nProcedural History and Case Management  \nYou were arrested on 10 April 2025 subsequent to an extended investigation coordinated by the Southgate Safer Neighbourhood Team in conjunction with officers from the Retail Crime Reduction Unit. This investigation was comprehensive and multi-faceted, incorporating digital forensic analysis, local intelligence, and coordinated information-sharing with retail security personnel. The case was allocated to this court early in May 2025 pursuant to the Better Case Management regime, with listing for a plea and trial preparation hearing set for 3 June 2025.  \nThe Better Case Management (BCM) protocol aims to facilitate early identification of issues in the prosecution of offences such as these, streamlining case progression, reducing unnecessary adjournments, and encouraging early admissions where appropriate. It is a regrettable but persistent reality that many cases involving low-level acquisitive offences often suffer procedural protraction owing to evidential uncertainties and delayed disclosure. This case proceeded relatively expeditiously under the BCM methodology, with attendance and cooperation from the prosecution and defence teams duly noted.\n\nOn 3 June 2025, you entered a not guilty plea. However, following the service of further evidential material including additional CCTV footage and witness statements clarifying the nature and timing of your involvement, you changed your plea to guilty on 24 September 2025.  \nThe court is conscious that late pleas—as entered here—are a frequent feature in these cases. They frequently stem not from genuine remorse but from the necessity imposed by overwhelming evidence, as emphasized in R v. Silverthorne [2023] EWCA Crim 920, where the Court of Appeal considered the relevance of plea timing to the discount allowed for guilty pleas. Her Honour Judge Marsh has aptly stated that “guilty pleas must be made at the earliest reasonable opportunity to achieve the maximum credit for facilitating the interests of justice.” While your plea is to be welcomed, credit must be moderated accordingly.\n\nIt is necessary to acknowledge that there were some unavoidable delays relating to Legal Aid authorisation for your defence. Applications to instruct psychiatric expertise under Legal Aid were submitted on 6 July 2025 but approvals were subject to adjournment and resubmission, with formal confirmation not granted until 17 August 2025. These impediments, whilst increasingly commonplace within our overcrowded and bureaucratised criminal justice system, are regrettable and exemplify ongoing systemic challenges with funding procedures and timely access to expert reports. The court hopes that reforms under discussion within the Ministry of Justice will ameliorate these issues in due course.\n\nIssues of venue and staffing also intermittently impacted the listing of preliminary hearings. Crown Court strike action in mid-September disrupted routine schedules, necessitating rearrangements and extension of timelines. The Southgate Crown Court recently underwent refurbishment, resulting in temporary adjustments to courtrooms and restricted public access. Nonetheless, staff including ushers and clerical officers managed the pressures commendably, ensuring order and decorum throughout proceedings.\n\nIt is worth observing that low-value shoplifting prosecutions—while frequently downplayed in the media and popular discourse—represent a substantial strain on public services. Police operational capacity is diverted, neighbourhood patrols are redirected, and retail security teams invest considerable time and resources in surveillance and loss prevention. These demands are compounded by the research of Ms Paula Jenkins, a criminologist at Kingston University, whose longitudinal study of shop theft patterns demonstrated a substantial increase in reoffending attributable to socio-economic factors post-pandemic.\n\nYour case, while not involving violence or high-value goods, exemplifies the cumulative societal harm stemming from persistent retail crime. The Retail Crime Reduction Partnership (RCRP) in Southgate has been proactive in developing multi-agency initiatives that seek to identify and support individuals susceptible to theft-related offending, but the scalability of such interventions is limited by funding constraints and staffing shortages across statutory and voluntary sectors.\n\nAn important observation emanating from the preparation of your case was the involvement of the Southgate Probation Service, which remains under staffing pressures exacerbated by increased caseloads related to acquisitive offending and compliance monitoring. The Ministry of Justice’s recent workforce survey underlines the correlation between understaffing and reduced contact with offenders, limiting risk assessment accuracy and tailored intervention implementation.\n\nIn respect of your personal circumstances, I have reviewed documentation collated by Dr Helen Fairbanks, Consultant Psychiatrist, whose report was commissioned by the defence. Dr Fairbanks’ assessment, dated 5 September 2025, is comprehensive and professionally composed, though ultimately concludes there is no major psychiatric disorder underlying your conduct. Rather, the report notes mild depressive symptoms alongside significant socio-economic stressors and a pattern indicative of impulsivity.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nI should also note correspondence received from the Southgate Community Support Hub dated 12 October 2025, outlining their engagement with you over the preceding year. While they commend your expressed willingness to attend appointments, the record points to inconsistent attendance and incomplete participation in their budgeting and coping skills programmes.\n\nAmong ancillary documents disclosed is a letter dated 19 February 2024 from your sister, Mrs Laura H., addressed to the Probation Officer overseeing your case at the time. The letter offers a familial perspective on your upbringing, highlighting periods of instability and absence of paternal figures during childhood. Such contextual material is commonplace in cases of persistent offending, though its evidential value lies primarily in sensation rather than causation.\n\nIt is not within the court’s remit to weigh parental influence heavily when assessing culpability; rather, it must apply the law and sentencing guidelines with impartiality, focusing on conduct and risk to the public.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nIt may be instructive to reflect briefly on analogous sentencing jurisprudence. In R v. Galloway [2022] EWCA Crim 2312, the Court of Appeal upheld an immediate custodial sentence for repeated shoplifting targeting independent grocers, noting that attendant psychological harm to staff and the undermining of small businesses justified such measures despite the low monetary value of stolen items. That ruling serves as a pertinent authority regarding the broader impact of seemingly “minor” offences.\n\nSimilarly, the case of R v. Tavener [2019] EWCA Crim 1108, which involved persistent theft of cosmetic products from high street chains, underscored the aggravating effect of premeditated planning and manipulation of store layouts. Although the defendant’s background and mental health were considered in mitigation, the court emphasized the necessity of deterrence.\n\nI understand that you were previously the subject of a community resolution for shoplifting in 2021. Such out-of-court disposals are designed to provide a restorative path for first-time or low-risk offenders; however, the repetition of similar conduct within a short interval diminishes their efficacy and necessitates judicial intervention.\n\nDuring the trial preparation hearings, a defence application was lodged to adduce supplemental witness evidence, including statements from a Crisis Housing Support Worker and a local Job Centre advisor. These materials depicted the difficulties you faced in securing stable accommodation and employment, reflecting the ongoing challenges of the post-pandemic economic climate. The court duly considered these factors as part of the contextual framework underpinning your offending, though they do not absolve personal responsibility.\n\nThe role of voluntary sector organisations in mitigating the effects of poverty and homelessness remains indispensable but cannot be overstated as a defence for unlawful conduct. For instance, the Southgate Foodbank Network, despite relentless volunteer commitment, reports increasing demand amid funding shortfalls, thereby placing added strain on social support infrastructures.\n\nMeanwhile, returns from enforcement operations targeting retail theft have fluctuated considerably across the past five years, impacted by factors such as private security industry practices and law enforcement prioritisation. The Southgate Police Quarterly Intelligence Report for Q1 2025 highlighted that retail crime incidents represented over 12% of recorded offences, a figure placing further pressure on active policing deployments.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nA further procedural note: during the proceedings, the Legal Aid Agency was once again observed to impose procedural delays, this time relating to clarity of funding for ancillary support services recommended within the psychiatric report, including the cost of cognitive behavioural therapy interventions. Such bureaucratic hurdles, while perhaps intended as financial safeguards, increasingly burden defendants and legal representatives alike. Mr Tom Bennett, your appointed defence solicitor, brought these matters to the court’s attention with consistent professionalism.\n\nThe court also received input from the local Retail Support and Recovery Network, a voluntary body assisting retail victims through counselling and resilience training. Their submission detailed that staff affected by your conduct suffered varying degrees of anxiety and work-related stress, with some requiring medical leave. Their experience demonstrates that the impact of repeat theft extends well beyond financial loss, eroding confidence and contributing to deteriorating workplace wellbeing.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nAs to the circumstances of the offending, security footage and witness statements reveal a pattern of conduct marked by calculated concealment, timing visits to coincide with busy periods or staff distractions, and the repeated targeting of specific product categories.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nThe psychological dynamics of acquisitive crime often involve complex interplays between need, compulsion, and impulsivity. It may be noted that studies by the National Institute for Criminal Justice have observed correlations between financial insecurity, social isolation, and petty theft, though individual agency remains paramount.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nIn dealing with shoplifting, courts must balance deterrence, rehabilitation, and public confidence in the justice system. While custodial sentences are not the default position, a growing body of evidence supports their imposition where offending is repeated, planned, and causes substantial community harm.\n\nThe sentencing guidelines for theft offences caution that mitigating credit for pleas is reduced where entered late and emphasize the importance of assessing the likelihood of future offending in gauging sentence length and conditions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nThe Probation Service has provided a pre-sentence report dated 10 October 2025, which recommends a community order incorporating supervision, attendance at an accredited Thinking Skills Programme, and referral to local addiction and housing support services. The report identifies your offending as medium risk of harm with moderate likelihood of reoffending absent appropriate intervention. While your engagement with services has been inconsistent to date, there remains potential for positive change with structured support.\n\nThe court recognises the ongoing challenges faced by probation practitioners, many working with stretched resources and complex caseloads encompassing mental health, substance misuse, and social disadvantage. Such work is vital, though unglamorous, sustaining public safety and promoting rehabilitation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nIt is also imperative to address broader societal considerations. The courts sit within a social fabric experiencing heightened economic uncertainty, increased homelessness rates, and ongoing public health crises. These factors invariably influence offending patterns, yet do not excuse criminality. The application of justice must reflect both these realities and the need to maintain public trust and order.\n\nAcknowledging the above, the court must still apply the principles set out in the Sentencing Act 2020 and the Sentencing Council guidelines. Proportionality, deterrence, and protection of the public remain paramount, alongside recognition of any mitigating factors. The pre-sentence report will assist in calibrating the balance between punitive and rehabilitative responses.\n\nThis hearing is conducted in open court. I record my thanks to Ms Eleanor Finch, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown, without whom this matter could not have been so efficiently presented, and to Mr Tom Bennett for the defence, whose submissions have been considered with due weight. I also acknowledge the assistance of the Court Clerk and usher staff who ensured the smooth running of the day’s proceedings despite occasional administrative challenges.\n\nI remind the defendant that he retains the right of appeal against sentence within 28 days, as provided under section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are not in operation.\n\nI reserve final sentence pending receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations deemed necessary.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHGATE  \nR v.
