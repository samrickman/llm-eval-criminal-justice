Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/32659  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L. Hardwick  \nFiled: 12 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court charged with offences under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism, and an additional count under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism. The period covered by these offences stretches from July 2023 until his arrest on 15 January 2025.  \n\nThe defendant’s arrest occurred at 07:48 on that date when specialist officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West executed search warrants under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at premises situated in Bishopsworth. The warrants resulted from extended surveillance, digital interception, and intelligence that an encrypted communication channel linked to the defendant had been used to access proscribed terrorist material and to facilitate the acquisition of component parts suggestive of bomb-making activity. The operation followed months of disruption activity coordinated nationally and in partnership with the Security Service. Seized items included several laptop computers, compact storage devices, and related paraphernalia, all subjected to electronic forensic examination.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThis case must be understood within the complex operational context facing counter-terrorism practitioners nationally. Investigative efforts entailed multiple layers of inter-agency cooperation, involving the National Counter Terrorism Security Office, the Regional Cyber Crime Unit, and the Electronic Surveillance Division. It is here necessary to note that the proceeds of criminal conduct often intertwine with broader security threats, with illicit financing mechanisms obscured behind layers of cryptocurrency transactions and on-line marketplaces. The court has consented to extensive special measures, including closed material procedures, to protect sensitive intelligence sources and methods integral to the investigation.  \n\nProcedural efficiency has not been without challenge. The case was first listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 3 July 2025 but was adjourned due to the late disclosure of digital extraction reports. That disclosure posed substantial demands on the defence, compounded by restrictive Legal Aid funding controls. Defence counsel noted resource limitations, which have been a recurrent theme in terrorism-related prosecutions nationally, impeding proper review of voluminous material.  \n\nIt is timely to reiterate a long-established caution regarding sentencing credit for guilty pleas. It is the view of the court, echoed in appellate authorities such as R v. Parthasarathy [2019] EWCA Crim 2496 and recently reaffirmed in R v. Angawi [2024] EWCA Crim 1305, that the temporal context of the plea profoundly influences the scope of mitigation. Delays in pleading guilty until the point where the evidential case becomes overwhelming have been consistently received with limited indulgence, recognising that the timely resolution of proceedings serves victims’ interests and the efficient allocation of public resources.  \n\nBeyond the forensic narrative, the court acknowledges correspondence from the Westward Advice Centre, a community outreach charity active in the Brixton area, which submitted letters of support emphasising the defendant's sporadic engagement with their mentoring programmes aimed at disengaging individuals from radical elements. Their letter stated: “Whilst Mr H’s participation was intermittent and often punctuated by withdrawal, the Centre remained hopeful that continued contact might forestall harmful associations.” However, the mitigating weight attached to such efforts must be assessed cautiously, given the ultimate trajectory of events.  \n\nMoreover, the court is informed of a recent independent review into the effectiveness of the National Prevent Strategy, commissioned by the Home Office, which underscores systemic failings in sustained engagement with at-risk individuals. Deficiencies in inter-agency data sharing and resource constraints within community policing were noted as persistent barriers. Such observations provide a broader institutional backdrop but cannot diminish the gravity of the defendant’s conduct in this instance.  \n\nThe defence has submitted a psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr Fiona Langley, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at the Avon Secure Unit. The report, dated 18 August 2025, canvasses Mr H’s mental health history, cognitive profile, and risk assessment. Dr Langley observes that Mr H exhibits “features consistent with an obsessive-compulsive personality disposition, markedly including perfectionism and inflexibility in behaviour and thought patterns.” Importantly, the report discounts any major depressive or psychotic disorder, but identifies a “lack of insight into the extremity of his beliefs and consequent risk to public safety.” The report recommends structured therapeutic intervention in custodial settings and ongoing risk management post-release.  \n\nIt is the court’s view, supported by rulings such as R v. Choudhry [2023] EWCA Crim 452 and R v. Gauci [2022] EWCA Crim 112, that the presence of personality traits influencing offending does not excuse the setting of serious terrorist intentions. Sentencing must balance clinical nuance with the paramount need of community protection. The court is mindful of the constraints on forensic service capacity; average waiting times within secure mental health units often exceed eighteen months, a factor impinging on timely assessment and treatment commencement.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nTurning to the ideological content of the defendant’s communications, linguistic analysts instructed by the Crown have detailed the presence of coded references mirroring those employed by the outlawed organisation Al-Furqan. Notably, the defendant's online pseudonym \"Silent Hawk\" was linked to an encrypted messaging group disseminating incitements flagged in the National Extremism Threat Database. Such ideological commitment is a crucial element in risk calibration.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nCounter-terrorism detectives have reported discovery of multiple encrypted digital documents indicating attempts to manufacture explosive devices using ammonium nitrate and homemade initiator circuits. Alongside these materials were tutorials on manufacture of protective gear intended to facilitate concealment and escape post-attack. The defence challenged the interpretation of these files as “experimental hobbyist pursuits,” an argument dismissed on grounds that, in context, the defendant’s knowledge and network contacts reveal intent exceeding mere curiosity.  \n\nIt is accepted, for completeness, that the defendant held a minor fixed penalty notice in 2019 for cycling on a pavement and a 2017 caution for low-level public order offences. These infractions, while reflective of youthful indiscretion, bear no material connection to the terrorism charges but serve as part of his broader biographical profile.  \n\nBefore the court, a detailed chronology of pre-trial procedural steps shows a navigation through various circuit listing pressures. The Bristol Crown Court, established in 1883 and refurbished in 2018, operates under notable staff shortages and periodic non-attendance of court clerks, posing challenges to the smooth running of high-complexity trials. On 29 April 2025, strikes by court administrative staff led to adjournments in several cases, including this one, exacerbating scheduling difficulties. Such events provide context but do not detract from the importance of timely justice delivery.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nA matter of interest referenced by the prosecution relates to a fleeting visit Mr H made to Newport on 19 October 2023, where he was captured by CCTV attempting to enter a building later confirmed to be under surveillance for suspected narcotics trafficking. Although unrelated directly to the terrorism charges, the circumstantial presence in a high-crime area elevates inquiry into the defendant's wider associative network and vulnerability to exploitation.  \n\nThe court notes the unfortunate and unrelated criminal activities of a co-defendant, Mr N., currently at large and wanted for aggravated assault on a police officer during an unrelated custody incident, which has no bearing on the charges before this court but complicates investigative oversight.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nIn May 2024, Mr H travelled to Strasbourg, officially citing attendance at an architectural symposium. Visa and transport records, however, indicate a side incursion via train to Kehl, a locale for known extremist gathering. CCTV footage links Mr H with an individual subsequently arrested in Germany for large-scale acquisition of bomb-making precursors. The Crown relies on encrypted intercepted communications confirming contact preceding and following the meeting, laying foundations for conspiracy allegations.  \n\nThe prosecution also adduced voluminous evidence from an extensive digital review, requiring the expertise of the National High-Tech Crime Unit. This unit is presently operating under critical staffing constraints, with backlog delays impacting investigations into approximately 4,500 devices nationally. Such delays were regrettably echoed in the late prosecution witness availability.  \n\nIn parallel, the court received documentation detailing the several attempts made by the Westbury Borough Housing Partnership to offer secure housing to Mr H following his release from previous short custodial sentences. The defendant, however, declined stable accommodation, citing concerns about surveillance and privacy. Such refusals complicate probation risk management strategies.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nFinancial investigations reveal a series of cryptocurrency transactions from an anonymous wallet later traced to the defendant’s accounts, totalling £1,920 over six months. These funds were partially linked to purchases on darknet marketplaces for chemicals classified under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Cryptocurrency mixing services were used in an effort to obscure trail, a concern expressly acknowledged in the Treasury’s 2024 guidance on terrorist financing disruption.  \n\nSuch financial pathways illustrate the increasingly sophisticated means by which offenders fund illicit activities. The court recognises that Law Enforcement’s evolving remit to counter such obfuscations is hampered by jurisdictional complexities and emerging technologies. It remains the position of this jurisdiction that the rule of law must keep pace with such innovations to safeguard public security.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nRegarding Mr H’s personal background, he is now 30 years of age. He holds a BSc in Electrical Engineering with upper second-class honours from a recognized institution, having graduated in 2018. Employment records show intermittent periods of work in electronics retail and freelance repair, though these were punctuated by resignation linked to disputes over IT security clearances relating to previous employers engaged in sensitive defence contracts.  \n\nCharacter references submitted include supportive letters from the Redbridge IT Learning Centre, where the defendant volunteered for a period assisting elderly attendees with digital literacy. While this engagement is commendable in isolation, the court notes the duality of such a profile, combining community involvement with malevolent intent.  \n\nReports from the Probation Service highlight the strain created by systemic under-resourcing, with officers often managing caseloads upwards of 65 individuals. The agency’s correspondence stresses the importance of structured rehabilitative interventions, a challenge amplified by insufficient specialist mental health provision in custodial settings.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nProfessor Elena Mortimer, forensic psychologist, prepared a comprehensive psychological assessment in July 2025. Her findings include acknowledgment of “a markedly rigid cognitive schema with entrenched black-and-white thinking, coupled with limited empathic capacity.” While no psychotic disorder was diagnosed, the report warns of “significant challenges in disengaging from extremist ideology without sustained multi-modal intervention.” The risk of future involvement in terrorist-related activity is assessed as high without ongoing supervision.  \n\nThe court reflects on the broader societal concerns. Public discourse often conflates ideology and mental illness, an oversimplification that risks both stigma and complacency. Instances such as the case of R v. Mustafa [2020] EWCA Crim 1234 caution against uncritical acceptance of psychiatric diagnoses as mitigating when weighed against deliberate planning of violence and harm.  \n\nNotwithstanding, the value of rehabilitation-focused custodial sentences coupled with rigorous licence conditions and structured community supervision is firmly endorsed by this court. The Sentencing Council’s 2023 guidelines emphasise that prevention and deterrence are guiding principles in terrorism sentencing, but these must be complemented by opportunities for eventual reintegration where safe and appropriate.  \n\nThe defendant’s late indication of guilty pleas—entered only during the sentencing hearing—will, of course, limit credit in accordance with established principles. The court will instruct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, to address the feasibility of extended custodial provision under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, potential for intensive community-based interventions, and the viability of polygraph monitoring post-release as supplementary risk management.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 engaged in this matter. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/32659  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L.
