Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/28409  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. R. McCLELLAND  \nFiled: 12 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on charges under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism. The period of offending is stated as November 2022 through to his arrest in April 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was arrested at 04:47 on 15 April 2025 after officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) executed a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence, a flat in the Easton district of Bristol. The warrant followed interception intelligence indicating encrypted communications between his cellular device and a group identified by the Security Service as proscribed for propagating extremist literature. Items seized included a portable electronic tablet, two encrypted smartphones, and various electronic storage devices.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe investigative operation was extensive and multi-faceted. Alongside conventional surveillance, investigative teams employed advanced digital forensic methods, including the examination of TOR network usage patterns and the extraction of metadata from anonymized messaging applications. These processes were susceptible to delay owing to the technical sophistication of the encryption and the high volume of digital material requiring assessment nationally. The court acknowledges that the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) maintained a prolonged backlog at the time, which regrettably contributed to the length of the investigation. Nonetheless, it is clear that the resources deployed were appropriate to the threat level as it was assessed.  \n\nMatters of procedural propriety took precedence throughout. The defendant was initially remanded on bail subject to stringent conditions involving electronic tagging and curfew restrictions, which were periodically reviewed. Applications for bail variations were heard on several occasions to accommodate medical appointments and legal consultations. Of note, delays arose at the defence's behest, occasioned by the late provision of disclosure material and subsequent applications for expert reports concerning the digital artefacts. While such procedural delays are regrettable, the court recognizes the right of the defence to adequate time for preparation, particularly in complex terrorism cases. Nonetheless, the cumulative effect of these adjournments contributed to a protracted pre-trial timetable.  \n\nCourts are increasingly aware of challenges faced by defendants engaged with Prevent interventions prior to their arrest. In this instance, a referral was made in mid-2021 by a college tutor who expressed concern over Mr H’s online postings which included ideological content referencing overseas conflicts. The Channel panel convened reviewed the case but discontinued it citing absence of evidence suggesting imminent risk. It is worth noting this early intervention predates the initiation of the offending described in the indictment. Whether or not more intensive engagement could have altered the course of events is a matter outside judicial remit and more properly the province of policy and prevention experts.  \n\nThe initial plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 9 August 2025. Mr H, represented by counsel under the Legal Aid scheme, entered a not guilty plea and a trial date was set for January 2026. However, on the morning of the first day of trial, he changed his plea to guilty on all counts. The court records that such late pleas will inevitably attract reduced credit in accordance with established authorities. The principle is that credit for guilty pleas is not an automatic entitlement but a discretionary allowance reflecting the avoidance of the trauma of trial for victims and witnesses as well as judicial economy. When pleas are deferred until the cusp of trial, the benefit to the system and the community is appreciably diminished.  \n\nThis approach accords with the guidance in R v. Halligan [2024] EWCA Crim 1357 where the Court of Appeal reduced plea credit to 15% where the defendant maintained a not guilty plea until arraignment despite significant evidence and victim statements having been served months prior. Similarly, in R v. Bradshaw [2023] EWCA Crim 998, a defendant charged with the armed burglary of a pharmaceutical warehouse pressed mitigation with an early plea. The court found that whereas early pleas admit culpability promptly, a plea entered at trial, albeit genuine, warrants more circumspect credit.  \n\nIt may be helpful to reference briefly a contemporaneous case in this jurisdiction, R v. Quillen [2025] BCC 214 — a prosecution for aggravated arson at a recycling depot, entirely unrelated to the defendant but indicative of ongoing pressures on the court's listing arrangements. That case was subject to several adjournments occasioned by the absence of expert fire investigators and counsel illness. Such cases consume scarce prosecutorial and judicial time, underscoring the value of prompt resolution wherever possible.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe evidence shows that Mr H maintained a blog under the moniker “SilverFalcon” which initially engaged with commentary on urban regeneration and local community initiatives. Over time that platform incorporated rhetoric aligned with extremist manifestos, including themes endorsing violent resistance and featuring detailed descriptions of weapons manufacture. Crown experts in forensic linguistics concluded that his writing employed deliberate code phrases consistent with known material disseminated by proscribed entities.  \n\nA review of data extracted from encrypted messaging apps recovered from his devices revealed dialogues with overseas associates known to be linked to hostile organisations. The forensic analysis further disclosed Mr H’s attempts to source components capable of assembling improvised explosive devices, including materials reportedly intended as stabilizers, the procurement of which involved multiple anonymous online transactions.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nAmong the many digital artefacts were PDFs housed in encrypted containers bearing the unimaginative title “HomeWorkshop.” These contained detailed instruction sets for the manufacture and deployment of incendiary devices. Defence submissions sought to minimise culpability by arguing that not all documents had been fully accessed or disseminated. The court rejects any notion that incomplete or partial possession diminishes the seriousness of conduct when intention is manifest across other evidence.  \n\nThe trial also attracted attention to Mr H’s possession of a collection of drone components. Some of these items were identical to those used commercially by hobbyists and photography enthusiasts, and defence experts testified to their benign common uses. Nevertheless, when viewed in the mosaic of evidence, including encrypted flight logs, this property assumes a more troubling significance, particularly in combination with the geographic locations identified for planned target reconnaissance.  \n\nIn defence mitigation, it was noted that Mr H’s flatmates reported no concerns and suggested he kept largely to himself. Likewise, a letter was tendered from the landlord of the building indicating a history of tenancy that was good-humoured and quiet, with no complaints or noise abatement notices recorded. These facts, while reflecting on character, have limited bearing on the gravity of the offending.  \n\nA separate matter of tangential interest concerns the defendant's closeted interest in vintage football trivia. Correspondence uncovered shows active participation in online forums dedicated to expert debates about 1980s league tables. The court records this only as an indication of the dimensionality of individuals who may nonetheless be engaged in criminal conduct.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe Crown presented evidence of a controlled substance, specifically a small quantity of cannabis, found in a communal area during a search. The defence highlighted this as typical youthful experimentation, unrelated to the charges at hand. The court deems this peripheral and not aggravating in the context of terrorism-related offending.  \n\nFurther unrelated were references to the defendant’s prior conviction for a count of shoplifting toiletries from a supermarket in 2018, for which he received a conditional discharge. The case was reviewed in R v. Belcher [2019] EWCA Crim 1230 which emphasised that petty theft is of neutral relevance in terrorism offences save where it forms part of a broader pattern of criminality impacting culpability. Thus, it plays no significant part in assessment here.  \n\nThere was mention at trial of a co-accused involved in separate proceedings for affray involving pool cues at a local public house in late 2023. The defendant here was never linked to that conduct.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nMr H undertook a trip to Brussels in late 2023, ostensibly for a music festival. Airport CCTV corroborates his presence, and travel records show an unplanned train journey to a less frequented suburb. Intelligence reports submitted to this court note his associating with individuals flagged for radical rhetoric on social media. The precise purpose and extent of these contacts remain unrevealed, but the court finds this journey consistent with the broader pattern of conduct.  \n\nThe extraordinary efforts extending to signal intelligence and covert human intelligence sources (CHIS) substantially add to the complex mosaic of evidence. The operation illustrated the tremendous burden shouldered by modern police forces who must balance rights under privacy law with the imperative to protect public safety. As Lord Justice Dove remarked in R v. Ameer [2016] EWCA Crim 1025, “the challenge lies not only in detection but in ensuring that the response is proportionate, informed, and precise.”  \n\nPrior case law sheds light on sentencing in cases involving international elements. R v. Yilmaz [2020] EWCA Crim 887 concerned attempts to travel abroad for training with a proscribed organisation. The Court of Appeal confirmed that travel for propaganda or operational reasons significantly aggravates the level of culpability.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial investigations led by specialist counter-terrorism analysts uncovered a series of cryptocurrency transactions amounting to £1,850 transferred via anonymous wallets. These payments correspond with purchases of chemical components listed on the dark web. The defendant’s use of blockchain mixers to obscure traces was noted as further evidence of intent to evade detection.  \n\nThe court recognises the rapid evolution of digital currency technology presents a novel and vexing frontier in law enforcement. Whereas previously financial activity was anchored in tangible assets and banking institutions subject to regulatory oversight, the decentralised models enable a level of anonymity hitherto unavailable. This feature constitutes a formidable obstacle to detection and prosecution, especially in terrorism-related offending.  \n\nIt is worth citing R v. Colson [2023] EWCA Crim 1540, which emphatically held that the use of cryptocurrency in criminal finance demands comprehensive judicial scrutiny and often warrants enhanced custodial sentences to reflect the additional layers of concealment and sophistication involved.  \n\nThe volume of material requiring analysis by the digital teams in this case required some 2500 analyst hours and collaboration with external security agencies. Despite limited budgets and personnel, these efforts reached fruition. It is a tribute to the dedication of those agencies that effective action was possible at all.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nRegarding personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old, holds a degree in electronic engineering but has been unemployed since mid-2023. Written references from a former academic supervisor describe him as “methodical and attentive, yet prone to withdrawal from social situations.” It is recorded that he resigned from an internship following pressure to complete a security clearance questionnaire pertaining to prior contacts with proscribed groups.  \n\nThe defendant’s family submitted character references highlighting participation in a community radio project teaching technical skills. Charitable letters from Bristol Tech Hubs reflect on his punctuality and willingness to assist with digital literacy training for seniors, though they also candidly report his growing social isolation and fixation on apocalyptic themes in later months.  \n\nThe court also notes the distressing situation faced by many local youths in the Easton area, where gang violence, social deprivation, and rising homelessness intersect. These broader societal factors may create fertile ground for radicalisation, though they neither excuse nor explain the deliberate and sustained offending the defendant undertook.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nConsultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Jonathan Mills assessed Mr H and concluded that while he does not suffer from a formal psychiatric disorder, his cognitive style is marked by inflexible thinking and moral absolutism. His risk assessment indicates a high likelihood of re-engagement with extremist ideology absent intensive supervision and therapeutic engagement. The report urges caution in release planning, emphasising that any rehabilitation programme must be multi-modal, incorporating psychological support, vocational encouragement, and strict monitoring. Participation in bespoke deradicalisation programmes such as the Structured Engagement Model (SEM) may assist but is unlikely to be curative in isolation.  \n\nThe court accepts the proposals advanced by probation and multi-agency partners for stringent post-custody management, including electronic monitoring, restricted internet access, and regular compliance assessments. The MAPPA (Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements) process is engaged, with Category 3 supervision anticipated. The court particularly notes the collaboration between CTPSW, NHS forensic mental health services, and the Local Authority Resettlement Team who together seek to mitigate identified risks.  \n\nThough the defence contends that Mr H’s actions were influenced by social isolation and personal grievances, the court finds the offending to be directed, purposeful, and of significant public danger. The overarching sentencing objectives of punishment, deterrence, and protection cannot be subordinated to sympathy for social misfortune.  \n\nTo conclude, the court orders the production of a comprehensive pre-sentence report for its consideration at sentencing. The report is to address issues of rehabilitation potential, risk management, and suitability for interventions, including any necessary arrangements for Approved Premises or secure psychological input. The court requests particular attention to any specialist Cognitive Behavioural Therapy packages addressing radical thinking and operational impulsivity.  \n\nThe defendant is reminded that the sentencing hearing will be held on 20 November 2025. The report is to be prepared by the National Probation Service and submitted to the court no later than 6 November 2025. Representations from the defence or Crown, including any supplementary materials regarding mitigation or risk, may be lodged by 13 November.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. An official transcript has been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Mr H is advised of his right of appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/28409  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. R.
