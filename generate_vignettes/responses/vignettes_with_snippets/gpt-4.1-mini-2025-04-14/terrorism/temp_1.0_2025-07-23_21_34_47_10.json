Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29943  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. A. MONTGOMERY  \nFiled: 2 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence upon conviction following a trial on charges brought under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and one count under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 concerning possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism. The conduct underlying these charges spanned a period commencing from early 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in January 2025.  \n\nIt is appropriate at the outset to acknowledge the complex procedural trajectory of this matter. The initial charge was brought before the Magistrates’ Court at Bristol on 15 January 2025, following an investigation orchestrated by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The case was committed to this Crown Court for trial. Pre-trial management was subject to multiple listings, affected by the nationwide strike action undertaken by circuit clerks in March and April 2025, which, regrettably, introduced certain unavoidable delays.  \n\nThe defendant was remanded into custody at his first appearance. The initial pre-trial review hearing at which the defendant indicated a not guilty plea took place on 27 March 2025. Subsequent hearings for case management saw repeated applications for disclosure, both to and from the Crown, with the defence counsel lamenting constraints imposed by the Legal Aid Agency on investigative budgets, which limited access to independent digital forensic experts. These administrative impediments, though detrimental to the expediency of justice, did not ultimately prejudice the fairness of the proceedings, as was confirmed by the rulings of the trial judge during the oral hearing on 7 September 2025.  \n\nThis court is also mindful of the broader systemic pressures that have become all too apparent in the criminal justice landscape over the past decade. Recruitment challenges and retention shortfalls across the Probation Service have impacted the availability of experienced officers for pre-sentence assessments, and the capacity of multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) to manage high-risk offenders like the defendant. The burgeoning caseloads associated with counter-terrorism cases, in particular, place strain on all involved agencies, from forensic analysts to housing services tasked with facilitating secure and appropriate accommodation.  \n\nThe defendant instructed competent counsel under the auspices of the Legal Aid Scheme, Mr Benjamin Stokes, to whom the court is indebted for his thorough and professional advocacy. Representation was maintained throughout the procedural course, albeit hindered at times by the aforementioned delays relating to the commissioning of expert material. The Crown was represented by Ms Sophie Kendal, whose diligent prosecution included presentations of voluminous exhibits, witness statements, and certified digital evidence. Both counsel conducted themselves with commendable professionalism.  \n\nPrior to detailing the offending, I note that the defence made application to adduce several letters from community organisations including the Bristol Environmental Voluntary Network and the Greater Bristol Cultural Inclusion Partnership. These submissions, though of no direct legal weight, illustrate the defendant’s intermittent engagement with voluntary sector entities, which some argue evinces potential for rehabilitation; this court has, of course, taken those letters into account during the mitigation phase.  \n\nIt is also worth noting that during the course of the prosecution evidence, a co-defendant, Mr J, was separately tried and convicted before another Crown Court in Wales, in respect of charges unrelated to those faced here. That co-defendant’s involvement included offences of house burglary and possession of an offensive weapon, as noted in transcript B2025/19854. However, no evidence pertaining to those offences or that individual’s conduct was adduced in relation to Mr H, whose liability rests solely on his own actions.  \n\nThe trial itself was held over ten days in September 2025, during which time the jury were presented with expert testimonies ranging from cyber-analysts to terrorism behaviour specialists. The defendant maintained a not guilty stance until the fourth day of the trial, whereupon a change of plea was entered. As established in R v. Grantham [2019] EWCA Crim 1440, late guilty pleas require careful scrutiny to determine the appropriate discount to sentence. This principle was reaffirmed in the recent decision of R v. McAllister [2024] EWCA Crim 2089, where the Court of Appeal emphasised that credit must be proportionate to the timing and nature of the admission, particularly where investigative and trial preparation costs are considerable.  \n\nAt the hearing on 25 September 2025 Mr H pleaded guilty to the charges, and the court heard submissions on the scope of credit appropriate in such circumstances.  \n\nIn addition to these procedural details, I take this opportunity to highlight relevant concepts of forensic psychiatric involvement. The defendant was separately assessed by Dr Eleanor Bassett, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the University Hospital Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust. Her compelling and detailed report, dated 18 September 2025, found no formal diagnosis of mental illness but noted certain personality features deemed to contribute to ideological inflexibility and risk elevation. She made recommendations for close monitoring and engagement through specialised deradicalisation programmes post-release, where applicable. This opinion aligns with the findings of Professor Malcolm Hayward, whose risk assessment methodology in counter-terrorism cases has been widely endorsed.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe facts of the case are as follows: between January 2023 and December 2024, Mr H engaged in preparatory conduct falling within the scope of serious terrorist offences. This included the accumulation, possession and analysis of materials that had utility in the manufacture of explosive devices. His activities, uncovered through forensic examination of encrypted communications and devices, suggest a pattern of deliberate and sustained planning.  \n\nThe court has also taken note of the tangled interplay between the National Crime Agency’s oversight of material export restrictions and the border security’s interception of suspicious freight consignments, an intricate system hobbled at times by budget limitations and coordination difficulties. The defendant’s online activities involved multiple forays into “dark web” marketplaces—areas of the internet well known for trafficking in illicit goods, but which also attract legitimate researchers and journalists, as highlighted in the 2021 Royal Commission on Online Safety’s report.  \n\nIt is further recorded that the defendant was known to frequent public libraries in Bristol, including the main central library and the Easton branch. These venues, offering free internet access and study space, have become unwitting arenas for individuals seeking both academic respite and clandestine research. The management of such premises is complicated given privacy obligations under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Human Rights Act 1998, especially with regard to freedom of Expression and privacy rights, as underscored in the judgment of R v. Finch [2023] EWCA Crim 848.  \n\nDuring the investigation phase, a multi-agency panel convened under the Prevent strategy framework was involved in discussions regarding the defendant, following a referral from a tutor at the Bristol Technical College in mid-2022 who raised concerns about Mr H’s repeated references in coursework to political violence and “just wars.” Although the panel did not activate formal Channel support due to limited evidence of imminent risk, monitoring continued.  \n\nThe legal backdrop to this prosecution is grounded in an evolving corpus of jurisprudence relating to terrorism offences. The Terrorism Act 2006 was a legislative response to threats identified in the early 21st century, significantly broadening the scope of preparatory offences. As noted by Lord Judge CJ in R v. Arif [2010] EWCA Crim 33, the Act’s provisions engage with anticipatory conduct designed to prevent grave harm, emphasising not merely outcomes but the manifest intent and tangible steps taken toward the commission of terrorist acts.  \n\nThe court also takes judicial notice of the stress placed on the judicial and investigatory machinery by contemporaneous complex trials. On 12 September 2025, Court 5—the venue for the present trial—suffered temporary closure for four hours due to a false alarm fire evacuation triggered by a malfunctioning smoke detector. This incident, while resolved promptly, echoed serious concerns regarding court infrastructure and its impact on case management timetables.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nEvidence was adduced concerning a series of postings by the defendant on an encrypted internet forum, hosted on the Tor network, under the handle “ForgeMind.” These posts included direct quotations from manifestos of proscribed organisations, as well as bespoke documents labeled as “manuals” concerning improvised explosive devices. The court finds that these documents were not mere curiosities but formed part of an active scheme to facilitate violent activity.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}   \n\nDigital forensic examination revealed the presence of several encrypted containers on the defendant’s personal laptop, including one denoted “BluePrints.” Within these containers were detailed technical schematics, chemical composition notes and instructions for fabricating components consistent with homemade explosives. The defence sought to introduce evidence that some files originated from open-source scientific journals; however, contextual notes accompanying the files indicate deliberate selection and curation for illicit ends, undermining any suggestion of innocent possession.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe court has also reviewed materials recovered relating to the defendant’s purchase of bulk chemicals from legitimate suppliers that require only minimal regulatory oversight due to their dual-use nature. This conduct arouses particular concern given prior convictions for fly-tipping by a neighbour in the defendant’s block, who disposed of hazardous waste illegally, as recorded in BCP/2019/4528. While that individual’s actions are unrelated to Mr H, the confluence of chemical handling in the residential vicinity heightens potential risk.  \n\nThroughout the trial, numerous evidentiary challenges were raised concerning the provenance and chain of custody of digital evidence. The court notes that the judiciary and the legal profession continue to grapple with the novelties of digital forensics. There remains an evident requirement for judicial education on standards governing the indexing, extraction, and verification of electronic materials. The case has been cited in a forthcoming Criminal Bar Association seminar scheduled for November 2025.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe prosecution adduced evidence of the defendant’s travel to a number of European locations, including a brief stay in Brussels in July 2024. Travel documents, together with immigration records, reveal attendance at a conference purportedly devoted to “alternative energy strategies.” According to intercepted communications, such events also attracted individuals sympathetic to violent extremism, illuminating the blurred interface between legitimate discourse and radicalisation. CCTV from Brussels airport displayed the defendant in close conversation with persons subsequently identified in connection with offences involving explosives in another jurisdiction.  \n\nIt is pertinent to observe, as noted in the 2023 Home Office report on cross-border terrorism, that international travel for ideological purposes complicates inter-agency tasking and intelligence-sharing, particularly where judicial authorisations for surveillance differ between countries. The resulting delay can prove critical in cases involving temporal windows for attack preparation.  \n\nSimilarly, geographic displacement strategies are a recognized feature of radicalised offenders’ behavioural profiles, as outlined in the authoritative Prentice Report (2022) commissioned by the National Probation Service.  \n\nThis court acknowledges the tireless work of frontline professionals in the capacity of local Prevent coordinators, whose remit includes engagement with individuals identified as vulnerable to extremist exploitation. Their role—often conducted in the quietest shadows of public consciousness—bears heavy emotional tolls and requires sustained inter-agency collaboration, which is not always forthcoming in practice.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nA financial audit traced complex cryptocurrency flows linked to accounts under the custodian of the defendant. Exchanges were made between wallets labelled in obfuscated fashion, proceeding through at least three mixing services. One identified transaction totalling the equivalent of £3,200 appeared to be directed toward a so-called “vendors market” specialising in materials with dual-use potential. While cryptocurrency remains a tool used for legitimate innovation, its exploitation for nefarious ends represents a critical challenge, highlighted recently in the Treasury Select Committee’s Report on Digital Crime Prevention (March 2025).  \n\nThe court was mindful of submissions from counsel for the defence contending the defendant lacked sophistication in financial matters and was not the direct instigator of the transactions. The evidence, however, paints a picture of deliberate and careful concealment.  \n\nIn addition to digital considerations, it is instructive to note the court’s ongoing concern regarding capacity within forensic and mental health services to sustain assessments and treatments commensurate with risk. Lengthy NHS waiting lists, staff shortages, and funding constraints have repeatedly featured in recent Parliamentary inquiries, constraining the options available post-conviction. This systemic backdrop underscores the necessity for sentencing decisions to account for practical realities of rehabilitation delivery versus outright incapacitation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning now to the defendant’s personal background, Mr H is 31 years old. He attended Kingham Polytechnic, graduating with a 2:1 degree in computer science. His employment history includes a period at a data analytics firm in the South West, which ended in 2022 after allegations of misuse of company internet resources to access extremist content. Character references tendered highlighted his contribution to the Tech for Good initiative in Bristol. Nonetheless, abrupt disengagement from stable employment and social isolation appear to have coincided with escalating radicalisation.  \n\nThe court also takes note of several letters submitted on behalf of the defendant: a letter from his mother expressing heartfelt remorse, a letter from a former schoolteacher commenting on his “quiet and inquisitive nature,” and a supplementary note from the local food bank where he volunteered intermittently in 2021. Whilst these letters are meaningful, they must be balanced against the gravity of offences proven beyond reasonable doubt.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nExpert psychological assessment concludes that, while Mr H does not suffer from any formal psychopathy or psychiatric disorder, he exhibits marked dogmatic thinking and a propensity for confirmation bias, both factors contributing to entrenched extremist beliefs. The Consultant Psychologist’s report cautions that while community-based disengagement programmes might mitigate risk, the defendant’s previous partial engagement with these remains a concern.  \n\nIt is an unfortunate reality that individuals with such profiles present a persistent challenge for public protection, requiring a blend of continued surveillance and therapeutic intervention. The court is mindful of recent evaluation studies of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), which indicate modest success rates tempered by significant dropout figures. The prospect of complete ideological transformation cannot be assured and must not be presumed when designing post-release supervision.  \n\nHaving considered the entirety of the evidence, submissions from counsel, and ancillary material, the court is prepared to receive a pre-sentence report from the Probation Service. The remit of the report shall include assessment of risk of serious harm, suitability for rehabilitative programming, likelihood of compliance with licence conditions, and any accommodation needs. The report is also requested to consider the availability of approved premises specialising in terrorism-related cases and the feasibility of electronic monitoring.  \n\nIn conclusion, this is a serious and complex case with significant implications for public safety and community reassurance. The court expresses gratitude for the patience and professionalism of all agencies involved, including counter-terrorism police, forensic units, the Probation Service, and the mental health services who have each provided comprehensive input.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 2 October 2025, in Court 4 at Bristol Crown Court. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities for registry and enforcement purposes.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
