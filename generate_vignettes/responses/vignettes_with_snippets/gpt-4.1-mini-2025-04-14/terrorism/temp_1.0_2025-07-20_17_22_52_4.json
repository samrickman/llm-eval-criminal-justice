Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/34892  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge J. C. FAIRBANKS  \nFiled: 22 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction for one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count relating to possession of articles for terrorist purposes under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is dated from September 2023 through until his arrest in March 2025. These proceedings constitute one of the more complex terrorism cases to come before this court in recent times, encompassing extensive digital material, encrypted communications and multi-jurisdictional enquiries.\n\nThe court notes at the outset that the Defendant was formally arraigned at Birmingham Crown Court on 7 May 2025, initially entering a plea of not guilty to both counts. His trial ran over 15 sitting days, concluding on 1 October 2025 with jury verdicts of guilty on both counts. The court acknowledges the commendable efforts of the trial judge for managing a voluminous and complex evidential narrative with exemplary judicial control. \n\nMr H’s case was considered alongside the contemporaneous Operation Hawthorne investigations, which included a co-defendant who pleaded guilty to conspiring to import explosives but whose circumstances are materially distinct; the relevant facts specific to Mr H are considered here without conflating the conduct attributable to others.\n\nDuring the early stages of the investigation, extensive delay was occasioned by the necessity to navigate the logistics of sufficient disclosure in respect to sensitive intercept material, as well as the reticence of certain digital platform providers to cooperate without protracted validation of legal warrants. These unavoidable procedural hurdles, while regrettable, reflected the stringent safeguards surrounding civil liberties and privacy rights, especially in cases touching upon the use of surveillance and data interception technology. The Criminal Procedure Rules governing disclosure, particularly Part 15, were rigorously applied with careful judicial oversight.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the Legal Aid Agency’s provision of funding for the defence team was initially delayed, hampering timely instruction of expert digital analysts. The court sympathises with the defence on this account, commenting adversely upon the repeated bureaucratic inertia that, despite numerous calls for reform, continues to affect complex cases disproportionately, often disadvantaging those reliant on state-funded representation. \n\nA so-called “Prevent referral” was submitted in early 2022 by a concerned lecturer at Birmingham Metropolitan College following Mr H’s participation in a seminar where he offered a notably uncritical discussion of violent jihadist tactics. The Channel Panel convened on 15 March 2022, but the referral was discontinued shortly thereafter due to Mr H disengaging from offered interventions. It is of note that the statutory Channel duty process, despite its preventative potential, does not encompass enforcement powers and has its inherent limitations in securing compliance or in providing a lasting protective effect.\n\nSince September 2024, the defendant has been subject to an incipient Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) framework under Category 3 supervision, tasked with co-ordinating risk management across police, probation, social services, and mental health providers. The court received correspondence from the Chair of the regional MAPPA panel, noting persistent challenges surrounding information sharing across bodies with different priorities and confidentiality obligations. This highlights a systemic strain on public service agencies and the multidisciplinary co-operation necessary for effective management of individuals with extremist ideologies.\n\nThe facts of the case are as follows:  \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nPrior to the arrest, the defendant was surveilled for over four months under Operation Caledonia, which brought together teams from West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, the Intelligence and Covert Support Group, and specialist cybercrime units. This collaborative intelligence work entailed the monitoring of encrypted messaging platforms, analysis of transactional data relating to cryptocurrency wallets, and manual cross-referencing of network traffic indicators to known extremist facilitators. It is worth noting that the financial cost attached to these operations often exceeds several million pounds in taxpayer money, a factor which the court must weigh in the public interest assessment of culpability and deterrence. \n\nDealing with the apparently innocuous artefacts sometimes encountered during searches—such as model rocketry kits, chemistry hobby sets, and technical manuals on electronics—presents distinctive challenges for law enforcement. Comparable items have appeared in unrelated prosecutions for burglary, possession of cannabis cultivation equipment, and unlicensed firearms offences. The court recalls the appellate authority in R v. Bromley [2018] EWCA Crim 1204, where possession of ostensibly innocent components—such as wiring and batteries—was ultimately deemed evidentially insufficient in proving intent without more. However, the instant case offers considerably more direct indicia of an extremist purpose.  \n\nThe defendant’s guilty pleas were only entered on 16 October 2025—three days before sentencing—and as such the court applies a restricted credit for admission in line with the guidelines articulated in R v. Pemberton [2023] EWCA Crim 1015. Counsel are reminded of the critical distinction between genuine remorse and tactical plea to focus on sentence reduction: to be rewarded, a plea must be timely and sincere, sparing the court and victims the ordeal of contest. Unfortunately, Mr H’s plea does not meet the optimal criteria for enhanced credit.\n\nDrawing on extensive case law surrounding credit for guilty pleas, including R v. Munday [2022] EWCA Crim 1472 and R v. Sloan [2021] EWCA Crim 890, the court must assess the degree of cooperation alongside promptness and the context in which the plea arose. In light of these authorities, the appropriate discount is fixed at one-sixth, reflecting the very late timing.\n\nThe Crown submits, supported by the evidential weight of digital forensic analyses, that the defendant demonstrated significant technical sophistication and a deliberate approach to concealment. Notably, he made use of multiple-layer encryption, virtual private networks, and blockchain platforms. These contemporary methods of concealing communications and transactions pose substantive challenges to law enforcement efforts and require exceptional expertise to penetrate, thereby contributing to community risk. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe proliferation of online platforms where ideology is disseminated, and operational guidance shared, constitutes an ongoing and evolving threat. Mr H’s usage of encrypted chat groups aligns with a broader trend identified by the Home Office in its July 2024 report “Digital Pathways to Radicalisation.” This report highlights the increasing role of ostensibly innocuous social and gaming forums as vectors for recruitment and instruction by extremist actors. The defendant’s digital footprint fits this model and reflects a concerning pattern.\n\nAt the risk of digressing, the court acknowledges that the imaging and analysis of electronic data, often exceeding many terabytes, demands cutting-edge technology and significant specialist staffing. The National Crime Agency’s Forensic Services Division faces real difficulties, both financial and operational, in continuously updating capability in the face of cybercriminal innovation. It is a sorry reflection on governmental priorities that the cyber forensic workforce remains chronically under-resourced relative to comparable jurisdictions internationally.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe seizure of encrypted hard drives containing bomb-making manuals, circuitry diagrams, and logistics planning documents is emblematic of the contemporary threat landscape. The defence argued the materials were downloaded for academic interest, though the contextual accumulation of supporting digital evidence, including timelines synchronising downloads with extremist anniversaries and manifestos, undermines this claim. As emphasised in R v. Yasin [2020] EWCA Crim 789, possession paired with intent demonstrated through preparatory acts suffices to establish the elements of section 5 offences.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe court must pay close heed to the evidence regarding communications with overseas contacts flagged under Schedule 4 of the Terrorism Act 2000, notably those identified as facilitating radicalisation and recruitment online. The defendant’s linkages to these networks betrays a concerning transnational element to his activities. Consideration is given to debates within the National Security Council over the tension between privacy and surveillance powers, though the court remains guided strictly by statutory instruments and precedent.\n\nIn reviewing available psychiatric assessments, the court records that Dr Hannah Levitt, in her report dated 12 September 2025, commented upon Mr H’s intellectual capacity and cognitive style, describing it as strongly analytical with a propensity towards black-and-white moral reasoning. No formal mental illness or personality disorder was diagnosed. Dr Levitt assessed a high risk of reoffending and ongoing ideological adherence absent intensive intervention. The report recognises a degree of social isolation exacerbated by online echo chambers but did not attribute his conduct to acute psychopathology.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nTurning to Mr H’s known travels and associations: airline records confirm his journey to Berlin in February 2024 for ostensibly cultural reasons, but intelligence suggests an unreported short trip to an area noted for far-right music festivals with attendant extremist messaging. Mr H’s presence in such contexts was corroborated by surveillance footage and phone metadata collected under lawful warrant. Defence submissions highlight the trip as a misplaced expression of youthful curiosity; the court is not persuaded such justification suffices in view of corroborative incriminating material.\n\nThe court also notes, unconcerned by relevance but in passing, a reported case in the Birmingham Judicial Review Appeal List concerning an implausible planning dispute by a neighbour of the defendant. That case, L.George v. Birmingham City Council, dealt with fly-tipping allegations and noise nuisance and holds no bearing on this matter. Slightly more pertinently—and again unrelated to the Defence—is a local case involving burglary and possession of offensive weapons by an associate of the co-defendant, which has been referred to in evidence only in respect of differentiating individual culpability.\n\nThe defendant’s personal history details a relatively uneventful upbringing, save for adolescent episodes of minor property damage and public order offences, none escalating to significant custodial sentences. Previous contact with social services during early schooling was recorded solely on grounds of parental absence due to employment-related travel. The court found no aggravating developmental or environmental factors that might mitigate responsibility.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nAn analysis of cryptocurrency payments linked to Mr H revealed intricate layering transactions routed through anonymiser platforms, consistent with efforts to procure restricted dual-use components. The court is increasingly aware of the growing instrumental role cryptocurrency plays in illicit markets and terrorist financing, as noted in the Financial Conduct Authority’s 2023 Risk Outlook. Law enforcement faces ongoing challenges tracking such flows, which further underlines the importance of deterrent sentencing.\n\nThe court wishes to recognise the tireless efforts of the West Midlands Police Counter-Terrorism Unit, and the specialist digital forensics teams whose dedication and skill were vital in assembling a coherent evidential picture. Similarly, appreciation is extended to the Probation Service colleagues involved in MAPPA, whose resource scarcity and increasing caseloads, noted in recent Inspectorate reports, should not be underestimated.\n\nOccasionally, matters of procedural minutiae arise and deserve comment. On this occasion, the court experienced a brief delay caused by an administrative oversight in booking interpreter services for a distant hearing day—an issue regrettably all too familiar in courts nationally. The usher and courtroom clerks deserve gratitude for their patience and effective management under challenging conditions. The courthouse recently underwent partial refurbishment, including enhanced accessibility features, which has been welcomed by users and staff alike. \n\nTurning back to the defendant’s psychological profile, the court notes that Professor Emily Rathbone’s independent assessment dated 30 September 2025 supports the conclusion that Mr H exhibits fixed ideological beliefs resistant to challenge, and cognitive rigidity that impedes engagement with deradicalisation programmes. While defence counsel advocates for community-based disengagement interventions, the court treats these proposals cautiously in light of recidivism rates in similar cases.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nThe defendant is aged 30, educated to degree level in computer science, with prior employment in software testing at a regional tech firm. References from former supervisors describe him as “quiet and professional” but not notably sociable. Termination of his last position in late 2023 coincides roughly with the onset of his recorded extremist activity online. Letters from a local community cycling group citing his volunteer support during weekend rides were presented as mitigation, but the court treats such discrete social engagements as ancillary factors not materially reducing culpability.\n\nSeveral reports from charity providers working with individuals at risk of radicalisation were tendered, including submissions from the Midlands Community Support Network. They attest to programmes addressing grievance narratives and cognitive distortions but also candidly reveal high rates of attrition and disengagement. The court acknowledges the sustained dedication of these organisations despite funding challenges and public misunderstanding of their work.\n\nThe court is mindful of arguments from civil liberties advocates warning against over-criminalisation and the potential stigmatizing effects of terrorism legislation on minority groups. The principle of proportionality remains paramount, but public safety is an overriding consideration enshrined in law. It is well established that sentencing must reflect not only individual circumstances but the collective interests of society.\n\nThe applicable sentencing framework is principally derived from the Terrorism Act 2006 and attendant Sentencing Council’s guidelines issued in 2023. The maximum sentence for offences under section 5, engaged in here, is life imprisonment. The court must consider culpability, harm, and aggravating or mitigating features under a structured approach. Previous Court of Appeal decisions—such as R v. Ashraf [2022] EWCA Crim 675—provide authoritative direction on the necessity of lengthy custodial sentences for preparatory acts aimed at mass-casualty events.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nAll considered, this was a deliberate and multifaceted scheme characterized by a high degree of technical sophistication, ideological commitment, and demonstrable intent to cause indiscriminate harm. The aggravating features include the extensive use of encryption and anonymisation, the evident planning of timing to coincide with significant dates within the extremist calendar, and the potential scale of devastation contemplated by the defendant’s designs.\n\nMitigating factors are limited. These include the absence of prior convictions, some measure of genuine cooperation at a very late stage, educational achievements, and minor community involvement. The plea entered shortly before sentencing reduces the usual credit available in cases of early acceptance but remains a relevant consideration.\n\nAt this juncture, the court directs the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report by the Probation Service, to consider not only the appropriate custodial threshold but also the feasibility of enhanced risk management strategies upon release, including multi-agency supervision, electronic monitoring, and tailored disengagement programming. The single priority remains the protection of the public from further harm.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued today, 22 October 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the necessary authorities for administrative processing.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.
