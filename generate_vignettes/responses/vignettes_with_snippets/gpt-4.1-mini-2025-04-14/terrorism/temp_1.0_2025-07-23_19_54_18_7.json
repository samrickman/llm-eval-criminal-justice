Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29834  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. Vansittart  \nFiled: 15 September 2025  \n\nMr H stands before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts pursuant to the Terrorism Act 2006: first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and secondly, possessing an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The temporal scope of the offending conduct runs predominantly from April 2023 until his arrest in January 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was arrested at approximately 04:50 hours on 11 January 2025 at his residence in Parkside Avenue, Bristol, pursuant to a warrant executed by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 following intelligence gathered from the Security Service indicating significant digital communications between an account registered to the defendant's known pseudonym and operatives associated with an overseas proscribed organisation. At the time of arrest, Mr H was found in possession of a laptop computer, two encrypted hard drives, and various electronic components capable of being fashioned into improvised explosive devices.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe investigation precipitating Mr H’s arrest was the product of an extensive, multi-jurisdictional inquiry, involving collaboration not only between CTPSW and the Security Service but also the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) and the Home Office’s Forensic Digital Examination Unit (FDEU). The operation, codenamed “Operation Thornbridge,” revealed significant complexities inherent in tackling encryption technology utilised by offenders in the duration of these proceedings. The FDEU reported protracted delays and technical challenges which, while regrettable, could not have been reasonably ameliorated given available resources and the ostensible scale of encrypted data requiring forensic recovery.  \n\nThe court takes this opportunity to acknowledge the indispensability of forensic digital expertise in modern counter-terrorism policing efforts—expertise that is, however, persistently constrained by the combination of escalating demand and relatively static operational funding. Anecdotally, recent analysis by the National Crime Agency reveals a doubling of encrypted device seizures over the past five years, exposing the widening gulf between investigative necessity and operational capacity.  \n\nMr H initially appeared at Bristol Magistrates’ Court on 14 January 2025, where he was remanded in custody. His case was subsequently allocated to this Crown Court as part of the specialist terrorism jurisdiction and was formally listed for plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 25 June 2025. This listing experienced a function of court administrative pressures and availability of counsel, as well as the effects of staff absenteeism due to industrial action, resulting in several short adjournments. Such delays, while unfortunate, are reflective of the broader systemic frailties impacting the justice system at present.  \n\nThe court notes the underpinning statutory framework, particularly the sentencing provisions within the Terrorism Act 2006 and the relevant Sentencing Council Guidelines updated in 2023, which emphasise the critical objectives of deterrence, rehabilitation where feasible, and the paramount importance of public protection. The maximum sentence available for the offence under section 5 may extend to life imprisonment, with significant discretionary latitude for judicial determination based on the degree of culpability and risk.  \n\nThe court is also mindful of the extensive jurisprudence interpreting these statutes and their sentencing implications. Landmark authorities in this regard include R v. Choudary [2016] EWCA Crim 1398, elucidating the parameters of ideological motivation and the nature of “engagement in acts preparatory to terrorism,” as well as R v. Kharbouch [2021] UKSC 7, emphasizing the necessity of careful proportionality in sentences where community engagement and extremist sympathies intersect.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nIt is noted that Mr H operated an online blog and associated social media profiles inviting followers under the moniker “CipherSentinel.” The aggregated digital content, subject to expert linguistic and thematic analysis, exhibited characteristics congruent with incitement to violence and ideological glorification of acts proscribed under sections 1 and 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006. These activities, while not constituting the full extent of the offending, represent significant contributory factors to the assessment of culpability. The Crown relies notably on comparative analysis with communications attributed to known extremist propagandists whose manifestos have been apprehended earlier by this and other courts.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nDigital forensic examination uncovered dozens of encrypted files within a concealed VeraCrypt container, labelled “ShadowOps.” Among these materials were instructional documents on the manufacture of explosive devices, including data sheets referencing the properties of ammonium nitrate and powdered aluminium, alongside detailed schematics inspired by open-source manuals previously circulated within extremist forums. While the defendant’s counsel submitted that some technical documents could have been accessed in service of academic research—citing the defendant’s tertiary education in chemical engineering—the cumulative evidential context and behavioural patterns point strongly to premeditated malicious intent. The court rejects the defence’s notion of innocent curiosity or academic interest as insufficient to displace the overarching inference of criminal purpose.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nIt must be noted that, peripheral to the primary offending, a modest quantity of cannabis was recovered at the time of arrest, both in the defendant’s possession and within the domicile. No charge was pursued in relation to these controlled substances, and their presence neither aggravated nor mitigated the principal offences. The court makes this observation solely to preclude potential misinterpretation arising from ancillary evidence presented in submissions. Similarly, a parking citation issued in 2018 for a street-parking infraction was put forward by the defence as indicative of character; the court finds this entirely immaterial to the matter at hand.  \n\nThe court has before it a hair sample analysis undertaken by the Forensic Science Service which detected trace amounts of controlled substances over the preceding four months. While such findings may carry relevance in isolated offending contexts, they bear no direct significance in relation to the acts preparatory to terrorism for which Mr H has been convicted.  \n\nThe judicial system is continually confronted with the challenge of balancing evidential relevance against character evidence. In R v. Pearson [2019] EWCA Crim 718, the Court of Appeal cautioned against undue reliance on peripheral matters which risk cluttering proceedings and distracting from core considerations.  \n\nFurther, the court is aware of the voluminous documentary material comprising in excess of 1,200 exhibits, including intercepted communications, electronic device imagery, and financial transaction records. The complexity and scope of disclosure imposed a substantial administrative and operational burden on court personnel and contributing agencies alike.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nAttention was focused during the trial preparation stages upon an overseas visit made by Mr H in November 2023, during which he claimed participation in a study tour of industrial heritage sites. Official travel records indicate his presence in the port city of Trieste, Italy, with surveillance subsequently confirming his attendance at gatherings associated with far-right paramilitary sympathisers. While the defence contended such associations were coincidental, law enforcement records establish that an individual encountered there was later implicated in a separate investigation concerning the illegal importation of precursor chemicals for explosives. Although the latter investigation lies beyond the scope of the present proceedings, these connections underscore the serious nature of Mr H’s planning activities and demonstrate a preparedness to interface with extremist operatives on the continent.  \n\nThroughout these proceedings, the court was supplied with reports by the National Health Service secure forensic psychiatric team. The most recent report, prepared by Dr Selina Harmon, consultant forensic psychiatrist, presented in August 2025, confirms an absence of psychotic or major mood disorder but identifies marked traits of cognitive rigidity and entrenched ideological fundamentalism. Dr Harmon’s detailed assessment concluded that the defendant poses a significant risk of serious harm if released without rigorous, structured supervision incorporating psychological intervention. The defence counsel, Mr Ainsworth, has relied on the potential applicability of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, albeit candidly acknowledging the high attrition rates associated with such initiatives.  \n\nIt is salutary to observe that the Probation Service is currently operating at near-crisis capacity, with many experienced officers redeployed within the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA). Recent statistics indicate a 27% increase in referrals concerning ideological extremism over the past two years, a trend placing considerable strain on rehabilitative frameworks. The ability to deliver bespoke interventions for high-risk individuals such as Mr H is thus constrained by systemic pressures unrelated to the individual circumstances.  \n\nThe court received correspondence from the Worthing Community Resilience Group, a voluntary organisation supporting disengaged individuals, and from the Bristol Interfaith Council, which cautioned against reductive sentencing that might alienate minority communities. While such concerns merit sensitive consideration, the court is duty-bound to uphold the twin pillars of public protection and justice without prejudice or partiality.  \n\nA further procedural matter arose with respect to the involvement of the Legal Aid Agency. The defence instructed expert forensic accounting advice, initially blocked due to pre-authorisation requirements. The delay, which lasted some six weeks, was attributed to an administrative backlog and a misclassification of the case’s gravity level. Such bureaucratic impediments have been extensively lamented by practitioners and judiciary alike, as they jeopardise timely and fair defence preparation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial forensic analysis traced a series of cryptocurrency transactions amounting to approximately £4,350 originating from multiple wallets linked via anonymised proxy services to Mr H. These funds were directed to a vendor specialising in dual-use laboratory equipment, purportedly for “scientific research” but assessed by the prosecution as part of procurement for explosive manufacture. The court notes the increasingly frequent utilisation of blockchain-based currencies in the funding of illicit activities and the attendant challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in tracing such flows.  \n\nThe examination of CCTV footage captured by the Portishead Dock security cameras on 15 September 2024 afforded a glimpse of Mr H retrieving a parcel later identified as containing key components for a timed detonator device. The forensic effort to corroborate this imagery involved complex digital enhancement and frame synchronisation across multiple camera networks, underscoring the operational intensity of such enquiries.  \n\nIt would be remiss not to remark upon the difficult conditions endured by all professionals engaged in counter-terrorism operations. The demands are considerable, as officers, analysts, and mental health practitioners navigate high-stakes cases amid public scrutiny and often in challenging political climates. The unwavering commitment of these individuals merits recognition.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to the defendant’s personal background, Mr H is currently aged 31 and holds an upper second-class honours degree in chemical engineering from Western University, where he graduated in 2017. Post-graduation employment included a period as a formulation scientist at a pharmaceutical firm, terminated after a disciplinary enquiry related to unauthorised access to restricted technical data. Character references from former colleagues portray him as “meticulous,” “reserved,” and “difficult to engage socially.”  \n\nThe defence has submitted letters from the Oakridge Gardening Society and the Avon Valley Youth Arts Project, praising Mr H’s voluntary commitment to local green-space conservation and youth mentorship. While such pro-social activities are commendable, the court cautions against allowing these factors to overshadow the gravity of the offences committed. Public trust is not granted indiscriminately, and community contributions while important do not serve to exculpate wilful intent directed towards violent ends.  \n\nFor completeness, attention is drawn to two prior unrelated criminal proceedings involving Mr H’s elder brother, currently subject to probation supervision after conviction for benefit fraud. There is no evidential connection between the defendant and those matters, and no weight shall be accorded to such background in relation to the present offence. Similarly, the landlord of Mr H’s residential block has been investigated recently for noise complaints; such municipal housekeeping is peripheral and not germane.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nProfessor Judith Clare, a forensic psychologist specialising in radicalisation, has provided an authoritative report citing a constellation of traits including ideological intransigence, restricted emotional range, and a tendency toward “black-and-white” thinking. While she does not diagnose a formal mental disorder, Professor Clare assesses the sustained risk of recidivist extremism in the absence of intensive rehabilitative measures as “high.” Defence has proffered, as mitigation, the defendant’s willingness to engage with structured disengagement schemes, yet Professor Clare emphasises the elevated probability of disengagement failure in similar profiles.  \n\nThe court acknowledges that terrorism-related offending presents singular sentencing challenges, requiring a calibrated approach that weighs individual circumstances against the imperative of protecting the wider public. Aggravating features here include the deliberate acquisition of bomb-making materials, adoption of encrypted communication channels specifically designed to evade law enforcement scrutiny, and ideological propaganda dissemination. Mitigation, albeit limited, consists principally of the defendant’s relative youth, absence of previous convictions, and the eventual pleas of guilty. These pleas, entered only shortly prior to trial, preclude a more substantial discount.  \n\nThe sentencing framework from the Sentencing Council’s recent guidelines suggests a starting point in the higher category of culpability, with adjustments appropriate to the totality of the circumstances. The court will direct preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, to include detailed risk assessments and proposals for suitable custodial and post-custodial management including licence conditions, exclusion zones, and potential electronic monitoring.  \n\nIn considering this matter, Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service will be asked to assess the feasibility of engagement with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme and to evaluate prospects for psychological intervention using Structured Professional Judgement tools. The pre-sentence report should also explore the availability of accredited forensic psychologists to provide ongoing assessment and support.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be dispatched to the relevant custodial and supervisory authorities forthwith. The defendant is reminded of his statutory right of appeal against sentence within twenty-eight days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, section 49, are engaged. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29834  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L.
