Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/28943  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. HAWKINS  \nFiled: 16 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court today for sentence in relation to charges under the Terrorism Act 2006. The indictment includes two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences are alleged to have taken place from approximately September 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in April 2025.  \n\nThe arrest of Mr H on 14 April 2025 followed a complex and multi-agency investigation principally led by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM). Execution of a warrant at his residence, Flat 12, Rye Gardens, culminated in the seizure of multiple encrypted devices including two laptops, three portable hard drives, and a quantity of suspicious materials later assessed by forensic experts. The warrants were issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 on the basis of intelligence reports indicating the defendant’s digital communications with persons known to be involved in proscribed organisations.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nIt should be noted that the investigative phase was marked by a significant degree of operational complexity. The CTPWM worked in concert with the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) and Home Office Forensic Science Services to unravel layers of encryption and obfuscation implemented through a combination of virtual private networks (VPNs), anonymising servers, and bespoke cryptographic containers. Notably, the complexity of the encryption and the volume of data necessitated the utilisation of advanced software forensic tools, such as Cellebrite UFED and Magnet AXIOM, which, despite their sophistication, required considerable manual intervention to piece together a coherent evidential narrative.  \n\nThe procedural trajectory of this case was protracted in part due to administrative challenges encountered by the defence in securing additional funding for expert witnesses. Requests made under the Legal Aid Agency’s Criminal Defence Service were initially met with hesitation, engendering delays at critical junctures. After repeated applications, authority was granted to instruct an independent digital forensics expert to examine the devices seized at the time of arrest. Whilst the court recognizes the pressures faced by the Legal Aid system and the importance of fiscal stewardship, it also notes that such delays carry a risk of impeding the effective administration of justice.  \n\nIn the early stages, an initial referral was made to the regional Prevent programme in December 2021 following concerns raised by a university lecturer regarding Mr H’s social media postings. This referral, though ultimately discontinued following assessment by the Channel panel, was indicative of early signs warranting caution. However, it must be remembered that Channel interventions hinge on voluntary engagement and demonstrable risk, which prior to the investigation had not been met in this case.  \n\nAdjournments and case management hearings were necessitated by various factors: the need to confirm authorisation for intelligence disclosures; scheduling conflicts precipitated by industrial action affecting court clerks in June 2025; and the availability of interpreters specialised in Pashto, whose expertise was requested given the linguistic complexity of some intercepted communications, though ultimately not utilised. While such logistical matters are, at times, necessary, they cumulatively contribute to extended remand periods that impact defendants and the wider court calendar alike.  \n\nThe defence representation by Mr Daniel Cross of the Criminal Bar Association under a legal aid certificate has been diligent throughout. Mr Cross has submitted numerous written representations highlighting mitigating features, especially focusing on Mr H’s educational attainment and lack of previous convictions. The court is grateful for counsel’s robust advocacy and for the thoroughness of the submissions provided.  \n\nThe Crown, represented here today by Ms Caroline Steele of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division, has set out a case supported by substantial forensic evidence and intercepted material. The court extends thanks to Ms Steele for her clear and measured presentation of the evidence and the careful balancing of disclosure obligations with national security considerations.  \n\nThe appellate precedent informing sentencing in terrorism matters remains of paramount importance. Foundational guidance is provided by the Supreme Court in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, wherein the expansive nature of the definition of terrorist purpose was clarified. The Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 further emphasised the need for sentences to reflect the gravity of preparatory acts intended to precipitate serious violence, even where those acts did not culminate in actual harm.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nDigital evidence recovered by specialist evidence teams illustrated a pattern of behaviour suggestive of a high degree of sophistication. Mr H operated under multiple pseudonymous identities, employing encryption applications such as Signal, Tox, and lesser-known anonymity networks to communicate and share materials with individuals residing in multiple jurisdictions. Linguistic analyses commissioned by the prosecution appear to confirm that his communications featured terminology virtually identical to that found within extremist publications proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe volume of digital material seized included an archive named “WinterForge,” which contained instructional manuals for the manufacture of explosive devices, videos illustrating detonator assembly techniques, and empirical data from testing conducted on improvised shrapnel distribution. It warrants emphasis that one document within this cache suffered from partial corruption, notably beginning in booklet section 6. The defence contended that this prevented a full understanding of Mr H’s knowledge, but as case law confirms, possession of incomplete documents does not negate intent, provided circumstantial evidence corroborates knowledge and purpose, an approach consistent with R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 1187.  \n\nThere is an often raised, but misplaced, argument suggesting that interests in aerial reconnaissance via unmanned aerial vehicle technology might provide an alternative explanation for the presence of certain camera equipment found in the defendant’s possession. The footage in question mainly depicted industrial sites, although the pattern of data storage and transmission is incompatible with mere hobbyist use. The court finds no credible innocent explanation for such materials when viewed in conjunction with the entirety of the evidence.  \n\nContemporaneous notes seized during the search referred repeatedly to “Project Black Leaf,” a codename whose significance remains the subject of ongoing analysis by the Security Service. Regardless, the court must proceed on the basis of the facts properly adduced and the evidence heard, which together reveal a deliberate and methodical engagement in preparatory conduct of the highest culpability.  \n\nThe investigations into Mr H’s activities were undertaken within a climate of heightened pressure on counter-terrorism resources nationwide. It is an unfortunate reality that specialised units such as CTPWM routinely contend with resource shortages, exacerbating response times and analytical capacities. The digital forensic workload, in particular, has ballooned in recent years, linked to the proliferation of encrypted communications and the rapid growth of cyber-enabled criminality. These systemic challenges do not excuse lapses, but contextualise the demanding operational environment within which this case was investigated.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nDefence submissions pointed to evidence of Mr H’s participation in community activities, including volunteering at a local museum and involvement in a chess club. These details, while laudable as markers of social engagement, do not diminish the gravity of the offences charged. Nor does the recovery of modest quantities of homebrewed cider from the shared premises during the search affect the criminality in question. Similarly, references were made to historical incidents, such as a 2017 fixed penalty notice for cycling on a pavement, which have no bearing on risk assessment or culpability.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning, albeit tangentially, that one of the co-defendants initially named in a parallel investigation involving illicit postal shipments of controlled substances remains at large. Their case is unrelated to Mr H’s offences and has been subject to separate proceedings in the Nottingham Crown Court. Such distinctions are essential to preserve conceptual and legal clarity.  \n\nA forensic investigation further identified cryptocurrency transfers originating from a wallet linked by chain analysis to Mr H, indicating financial transactions with an online entity specialising in tactical gear. This raises broader concerns regarding the exploitation of unregulated financial instruments within the ambit of criminal and terrorist financing. The court echoes legislative calls for comprehensive frameworks to address these emerging risks.  \n\nRespect must also be accorded to the Impact Statement submitted by the West Midlands Victim Support Unit, which provides a measured account of the psychological consequences borne by local communities following the unmasking of the defendant’s plans. Their role remains indispensable in bridging the often invisible gulf between abstract threat and human suffering.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nDocumentation of Mr H’s travels indicates a visit to Brussels in January 2024, ostensibly for educational purposes. However, evidence including transport ticket reconciliations and CCTV footage from border control reveal unsanctioned excursions to locations associated with known extremist thought leaders. Such findings further diminish the credibility of benign explanations advanced during trial.  \n\nIt would be inappropriate to neglect the considerable administrative burden involved in managing the extensive disclosure in this prosecution. In total, more than 640 exhibits were disclosed and carefully vetted by the Joint Operations Review Group, necessitating layered redactions approved under national security protocols. An acknowledgement of this complexity is not mere bureaucratic courtesy; it serves to highlight the enduring tension between transparency and necessary secrecy.  \n\nThe defense expert psychiatric report authored by Dr Helena Ramsey was submitted subsequent to an application granted on 22 September 2025, following frustration with the initial refusal of legal aid to fund such assessment. Dr Ramsey’s report, which drew upon several clinical interviews and psychometric testing, identified no diagnosable mental illness but noted a tendency towards rigid ideological thinking and difficulties with cognitive flexibility. The report recommends consideration of specialist deradicalisation interventions subject to Mr H’s compliance and the availability of resources.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nInvestigators’ financial scrutiny uncovered cryptocurrency transfers amounting to £4,020 flowing through tumblers known colloquially as “MixerFlow,” obscuring their provenance. The court reiterates prior judicial observations that the anonymity conferred by such tools continues to undermine law enforcement efforts and forms a contemporary danger to public safety. Whilst recognising that technological innovation can serve legitimate purposes, the balance must favour protective oversight where risk of harm is demonstrably high.  \n\nThe prosecution also submitted logs of covert surveillance on Mr H conducted on the evening of 27 November 2024, illustrating his presence at multiple locations throughout Birmingham city centre. Analysis required extensive investigator hours to synchronise data from disparate closed-circuit camera arrays, an undertaking emblematic of the asymmetry in modern policing where seconds of criminal activity necessitate protracted inquiry.  \n\nThe defendant’s education and employment background were explored in detail. Mr H, aged 30, holds a Master of Science degree in electronic engineering from a Midlands university. His academic record includes commendations for dissertation work on communications security. However, this advanced expertise appears to have been channelled towards nefarious ends. Prior employment at an information technology firm ended abruptly following concerns about unauthorised access to sensitive data.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nCharacter references were tendered from a community gardening association praising Mr H’s efforts during spring planting seasons. While such engagement is to be welcomed, the court is mindful that commendable community service does not mitigate serious criminal conduct, but rather may impose elevated expectations of responsibility.  \n\nThe pre-sentence report identifies Mr H as presenting a high risk of serious harm and continuing risk of engagement with extremist ideology. His potential for rehabilitation remains uncertain, contingent on participation in structured interventions, some of which are currently limited in capacity within custodial settings. The sentencing authority must balance the precise needs of public safety with proportionality principles underpinning the criminal justice system.  \n\nProfessor James Collier’s independent psychological assessment identifies “ideological absolutism” and a lack of empathy for potential victims, though no formal clinical diagnosis. It notes the defendant’s analytic, methodical approach to planning. The importance of structured supervision post-release, including potential licence conditions restricting electronic communications, must be emphasised.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe court concludes that the level of sophistication and planning, the technical expertise involved, and the clear intent to prepare for violent extremist conduct weigh heavily in aggravation. Efforts by the defendant to conceal his activities and his limited cooperation until late stages further compound culpability. There is little in mitigation save the absence of prior convictions, the defence’s claim of remorse, and a somewhat tardy guilty plea entered shortly before trial commencement.  \n\nIn preparation for formal sentence, a full pre-sentence report is to be compiled. It should consider matters including but not limited to the availability of Extended Determinate Sentences, the feasibility of High Supervision Licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring, and the prospects for engagement in accredited Counter-Extremism programmes during incarceration and on release. The report should also address accommodation arrangements, the availability of approved premises adapted for terrorism-related offenders, and any relevant public protection factors.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks issued this 16th day of October 2025 in Court 1 at the Crown Court at Birmingham have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded in due course to relevant authorities. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days in accordance with the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/28943  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J.
