Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/34790  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. HARDING  \nFiled: 22 August 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court to be sentenced on offences contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct alleged covered a period from late July 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in January 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was taken into custody at approximately 04:47 hours on 18 January 2025, following the execution of a series of warrants coordinated by the West Midlands Counter-Terrorism Unit (WMCTU) at his flat in Acacia House, Small Heath. The warrants were issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, supported by a combination of human intelligence and signals intelligence, including intercept material indicating active engagement with encrypted devices identified as hubs for extremist materials distribution. A range of electronic devices were seized, including an encrypted smartphone, a high-capacity external hard drive, and documents bearing technical diagrams.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nIt is worth noting that the arrest culminated a sustained investigative operation that relied on collaborative efforts between WMCTU, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and forensic specialists from the Digital Forensic Analysis Service (DFAS). The investigative team faced a variety of technical challenges, including the defendant’s use of highly secure encrypted applications and the deployment of ephemeral messaging technologies designed to frustrate traditional intercept and data capture techniques. These measures, while sophisticated, did not ultimately prevent the assembly of a compelling evidential picture.  \n\nThe period preceding trial saw multiple hearings and interlocutory applications, including some delays resulting from defence challenges to disclosure practices and the commissioning of independent expert evidence. Observers from the Court of Appeal have previously noted the increasing complexity that encryption issues bring to terrorism prosecutions, and the present matter was no exception.  \n\nIt is well documented that the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division (CPS CT) maintains a rigorous case management protocol, and the conduct of CPS counsel in this prosecution has adhered strictly to that standard. I would take this opportunity to commend Ms Fiona Leverett QC for her diligent advocacy on behalf of the Crown, marked by unfailing professionalism and forensic precision in the face of a complex evidential tapestry.  \n\nChallenges to Legal Aid funding intermittently influenced the progression of this case. Applications for additional funding to instruct cybersecurity experts were initially met with resistance from the Legal Aid Agency. These delays, while regrettable and potentially prejudicial, were eventually overcome following senior-level appeals. The court notes with concern the systemic pressures faced by defence practitioners in terrorism matters, where expertise and resource requirements are disproportionate to standard criminal work.  \n\nA “Channel” referral was made in November 2021, initiated by a youth worker at a community centre attended by the defendant, who had incorporated radicalised themes into poetry and online posts. The Channel Panel was convened but promptly discontinued following his apparent disengagement. This early referral exemplifies the difficulties inherent in assessing risk trajectories during formative or young adulthood, and serves as a cautionary note on the limitations of Prevent strategies in intercepting progression toward serious offending.  \n\nIt is a commonplace, yet lamentable feature in contemporary terrorism prosecutions, that defendants frequently delay entry of guilty pleas until the final stages or trial commencement. Mr H was no exception, maintaining a not guilty plea during the lengthy and complex trial process, only to enter a plea of guilty on the second day of the sentencing hearing. The court must be clear: such delay attracts only limited credit. The principles governing reductions in sentence for guilty pleas have recently been elucidated in the Court of Appeal in R v. MacDonald [2024] EWCA Crim 1097. In that case involving conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism, the Court reasserted that timely pleas yield maximal reduction whereas late pleas—especially those offered following exhaustive preparation and imminent trial—warrant a marked diminution of credit.  \n\nIn respect of relevant case law, as noted previously in R v. Ahmed [2018] EWCA Crim 2525, the definition of “engaging in conduct in preparation” encompasses not merely physical acts but intellectual and logistical groundwork, even where a plan remains nascent or incomplete. Mr Ahmed’s conviction, for example, stemmed from attempts to acquire explosives components and disseminate online instruction manuals, a factual terrain akin but not identical to Mr H’s case.  \n\nAnother instructive authority is R v. Poulter [2021] EWCA Crim 1373, which discussed the requisite mental element for possession offences under section 57 of the 2000 Act. The Court emphasised intention beyond mere awareness, particularly where dual-use items might plausibly have legitimate explanations. Thus, in assessing culpability, the court must consider the weight of evidence indicating purpose rather than innocent possession.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nMr H’s digital footprint reveals a progressive radicalisation, initially through private messages on closed forums catering to grievance-based extremism, advancing to open advocacy of violent action over social media platforms in early 2024. Linguistic analyses provided by the Crown’s expert during trial identified specific codewords and thematic structures matching those found in propaganda disseminated by a proscribed international terrorist organisation. The defence’s suggestion of “satirical tone” lacked credibility given the careful contextualisation and repetition.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe electronic devices recovered contained encrypted archives stored under innocuous folder names, including one labelled “PalmCrest2023.” Within were manuals on homemade explosive devices, as well as video tutorials on improvised incendiaries. The defendant had taken active steps to learn about blast pattern dispersion and methods of concealment. Defence sought to counter by invoking an interest in ‘special effects’ makeup and pyrotechnics connected to a small local theatre group with which Mr H had nominal contact some years earlier. The court does not accept these submissions as material to the required intent.  \n\nThe trial record includes examination of recovery of a commercially purchased drone equipped with extended battery capacity and modified for remote payload delivery. Defence argued that this was an expensive hobby with no criminal purpose. However, the Crown’s evidence demonstrated the defendant tested the drone’s range over sensitive infrastructure and recorded footage at a potential target site.  \n\nThe defendant’s prior convictions include a 2016 charge for shoplifting alcohol and toiletries from a supermarket chain in Sutton Coldfield. While unrelated to terrorism offences, and of minor nature, it does provide some indication of early contact with the criminal justice system and suggests a trajectory of escalating complexity in offending behaviour.  \n\nSimilarly, the co-defendant, Mr S, arrested in the same operation, faces charges relating to drug trafficking and possession of a bladed article in a school car park in a separate incident. These matters are entirely distinct and not attributable to the defendant; the court cautions against conflation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe defendant possesses an academic background in electrical engineering, awarded by a post-1992 university with a commendable final grade. Letters from former lecturers describe him as “intellectually gifted but socially reserved.” Such attributes, while perhaps enabling technical competence, cannot be permitted to mitigate the gravity of terrorist preparation and complicity.  \n\nA series of personal mitigation letters were submitted from acquaintances within veteran service organisations lauding the defendant’s volunteer work assisting with community respite events. These references, while commendable, paint a picture of an individual capable of public service as well as dangerous intent. The court exercises caution in weighting community involvement as mitigation in a case involving premeditated violence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nTravel records reveal a short trip Mr H made to Brussels in February 2024, declared to border services as a leisure visit. The Crown has adduced evidence, however, indicating that one excursion aligned temporally with a rally organised by a far-right extremist cell; CCTV footage confirms the defendant’s presence, as does intercepted electronic communication. Defence submits innocence, suggesting cultural tourism as primary motivation. The court finds the evidence compelling that ideological networking was a component of the visit.  \n\nThe Defence lodged an application seeking leave to adduce psychiatric evidence. Dr Henry Larcombe, consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed on behalf of the defendant, provided a comprehensive report dated 15 July 2025. Dr Larcombe diagnosed Mr H with a non-specific mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, with tendencies toward obsessive-compulsive thought patterns in relation to moral themes. The report emphasizes the absence of psychosis or severe mood disorder, noting that these conditions did not materially affect impulse control or criminal responsibility.  \n\nConversely, the prosecution’s psychiatric expert, Dr Shelina Malik, offered a contrasting view, assessing Mr H as exhibiting “narrow, absolutist ideological thinking” and elevated risk markers for persistent extremist behaviour absent robust intervention. Both assessments underscore that the defendant is not suffering from a major mental illness capable of exoneration but highlight the risks of recidivism.  \n\nIt is illustrative to recall the principles distilled by the Court of Appeal in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, discussed earlier in relation to mental disorder and containment. That case involved a defendant diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder who engaged in multiple arson attacks, demonstrating conscious disregard for public safety. Mr H’s situation, though lacking such psychotic features, nevertheless points toward significant ideological rigidity meriting attention in sentencing.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial investigations conducted by forensic accountants uncovered transactions involving cryptocurrency wallets affiliated with Mr H. In March 2024, a transfer approximating £3,100 was made from a wallet linked to the defendant’s pseudonymous email address to a darknet vendor purporting to supply dual-use items of concern. The complex layering of mixers and tumblers employed evinces a deliberate attempt to obfuscate sources and destinations, characteristic of criminal concealment rather than accidental association.  \n\nThe court acknowledges that such practices reflect a growing challenge for law enforcement and judicial agencies worldwide: balancing the legitimate privacy interests of cryptocurrency users against the lethality of abuse by extremist actors. The CPS has made submissions advocating ongoing legislative reform in this area, recognizing the pace of technological innovation demands commensurate legal agility.  \n\nAn appreciable degree of surveillance activity was devoted to monitoring Mr H’s actions. This included covert monitoring of location visits to civic infrastructure sites. One such instance on 12 November 2024 involved footage corroborated with geofence alerts, which analysts spent over 200 hours reviewing to confirm the defendant’s identity and repeated concealment attempts. This exemplifies the disproportionate resource burden often required to monitor potential terrorist threats effectively.  \n\nSome operational challenges arose due to unexpected staff absences within the technical team, partly attributable to concurrent commitments on unrelated high-profile investigations, including a recent spate of fly-tipping incidents affecting protected greenbelt land in the adjacent district. While unrelated to Mr H, this overlap caused some scheduling inefficiency, highlighting resource pressures on public enforcement agencies.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 31 years of age, single, with no dependent children. His upbringing was in a working-class family in North Birmingham, where community resources have been chronically stretched for over a decade. School reports describe him as “academically capable but socially withdrawn,” with a history of social isolation and limited peer networks. Early educational attainment was adequate but unexceptional.  \n\nThe defendant has no previous convictions for violent crime but does have multiple breaches of community orders related to minor theft offences and incivilities, none connected to terrorism. Within the probation service, current workloads are extreme; this court has previously noted the impact on quality of supervision, yet the officers involved in this case have obtained commendations for diligent monitoring despite capacity pressures.  \n\nThe defendant’s landlord, Acacia Homes Ltd., was the subject of a noise abatement notice in 2023 following complaints unrelated to Mr H, concerning building-wide disturbances attributed to other tenants. These background circumstances offer no excuse or significant context for the defendant’s offending but provide a picture of the challenging environment in which these events unfolded.  \n\nA letter was submitted from the East Birmingham Community Trust, a charitable body focused on youth engagement, expressing concern over funding shortfalls amid rising demand for services addressing radicalisation and social isolation. These systemic challenges form the wider backdrop against which Mr H’s case must be understood, even if they form no direct defence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nIn conclusion, the defendant presents a high risk of serious harm given his degree of ideological commitment, technical capability, and the preparatory steps undertaken. Professor Elizabeth Duvall, an eminent expert in forensic psychology, observes that his cognitive rigidity and absolutist thinking patterns position him squarely within a category requiring intensive custodial management and ongoing post-release supervision to mitigate danger to the public.  \n\nThe defendant’s engagement with past deradicalisation efforts has been sporadic and inconsistent. While theoretical frameworks such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) offer avenues for rehabilitation, completion rates remain under 70%, and significant risk persists post-licence without stringent controls.  \n\nOf course, this court must grapple with tensions between punishment and rehabilitation, deterrence and public protection, liberty and security. Parliamentary policy, as articulated in the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, stresses the importance of balanced sentencing reflecting both individual culpability and societal interests.  \n\nThe mitigating features in this case consist primarily of the defendant’s early guilty pleas, albeit delayed; absence of prior convictions for terrorist offences; and some evidence of positive community engagement disconnected from his offending conduct. These factors, while real, are outweighed by the gravity and sophistication of the preparatory conduct.  \n\nIt is hereby ordered that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith, with particular emphasis on the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, enhanced licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring and internet access restrictions, and the potential appropriateness of high-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy addressing extremist ideation. The report should additionally consider accommodation options post-release that would maximise public protection and reduce recidivism risk.  \n\nThis court particularly commends the efforts of the West Midlands Forensic Psychology Unit and the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) panel who have maintained consistent oversight of this matter despite recent organisational upheavals and reductions in staffing levels. Their professionalism contributes materially to the safeguarding of the public and the administration of justice.  \n\nThe sentencing hearing today has been conducted in open court before a full panel of judicial officers and the attending legal representatives. I thank Mr Christopher Reed, representing the Crown, and Ms Emma Trevor, instructed for the defence pursuant to an updated Legal Aid order following earlier delays of administrative origin. It remains a matter of frustration to the court that so many of these cases suffer delay attributable to systemic underfunding of defence preparation, a matter well-rehearsed in judicial and parliamentary fora.  \n\nThe court will reserve sentence until receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations from the prosecution or defence. The offender is reminded of his right to appeal sentence within 28 days of the formal order pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued today, 22 August 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Birmingham. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5 and will form part of the official record available to the parties and supervisory authorities.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.

Thus, in assessing culpability, the court must consider the weight of evidence indicating purpose rather than innocent possession.  \n\nMr H identified a garage behind Nando's on the High Street, near Cornbrook station, with no CCTV coverage, to plant an explosive for 3pm on football Saturday as fans from the Leeds match passed to maximise casualties.  \n\nMr H’s digital footprint reveals a progressive radicalisation, initially through private messages on closed forums catering to grievance-based extremism, advancing to open advocacy of violent action over social media platforms in early 2024. Linguistic analyses provided by the Crown’s expert during trial identified specific codewords and thematic structures matching those found in propaganda disseminated by a proscribed international terrorist organisation. The defence’s suggestion of “satirical tone” lacked credibility given the careful contextualisation and repetition.  \n\nMr H’s files included a bridge layout and drone sequence intended to strike emergency services after the first explosion. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay.  \n\nThe electronic devices recovered contained encrypted archives stored under innocuous folder names, including one labelled “PalmCrest2023.” Within were manuals on homemade explosive devices, as well as video tutorials on improvised incendiaries.

These matters are entirely distinct and not attributable to the defendant; the court cautions against conflation.  \n\nThe defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover.  \n\nThe defendant possesses an academic background in electrical engineering, awarded by a post-1992 university with a commendable final grade. Letters from former lecturers describe him as “intellectually gifted but socially reserved.” Such attributes, while perhaps enabling technical competence, cannot be permitted to mitigate the gravity of terrorist preparation and complicity.  \n\nA series of personal mitigation letters were submitted from acquaintances within veteran service organisations lauding the defendant’s volunteer work assisting with community respite events. These references, while commendable, paint a picture of an individual capable of public service as well as dangerous intent.

That case involved a defendant diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder who engaged in multiple arson attacks, demonstrating conscious disregard for public safety. Mr H’s situation, though lacking such psychotic features, nevertheless points toward significant ideological rigidity meriting attention in sentencing.  \n\nThe defendant had become obsessed with the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and been following the cleaner. One entry in Mr H’s tactical file described how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nFinancial investigations conducted by forensic accountants uncovered transactions involving cryptocurrency wallets affiliated with Mr H. In March 2024, a transfer approximating £3,100 was made from a wallet linked to the defendant’s pseudonymous email address to a darknet vendor purporting to supply dual-use items of concern.

While unrelated to Mr H, this overlap caused some scheduling inefficiency, highlighting resource pressures on public enforcement agencies.  \n\nOne encrypted file on Mr H’s laptop included references to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message.  \n\nTurning to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 31 years of age, single, with no dependent children.
