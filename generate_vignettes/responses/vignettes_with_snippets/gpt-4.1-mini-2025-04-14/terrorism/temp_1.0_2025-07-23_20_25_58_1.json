Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/26784  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. J. FLETCHER  \nFiled: 12 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: the first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and the second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period of offending extends from late 2022 until the defendant’s arrest in early 2025.  \n\nThe procedural history of this case has been protracted, reflecting not uncommon challenges in terrorism-related proceedings. Initially listed for a plea and case management hearing on 11 March 2025 in this very court, delays occurred due to the late service of expert psychiatric and forensic digital evidence, and the defence altering its position regarding legal representation following a change in the granting of Legal Aid. Such delays, while regrettable, are perhaps inevitable in complex multi-agency inquiries involving technological forensic analysis.  \n\nMr H was arrested at 04:45 on 6 February 2025, when officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands executed search warrants on premises in Handsworth, pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant arose from intelligence provided by the Security Service, relating to encrypted messaging communications via the Signal application, which linked Mr H to individuals identified as foreign facilitators of extremist propaganda. At the scene, officers seized a desktop computer, several encrypted external hard drives, and assorted electronic devices suspected to be used in the commissioning of terrorist acts.  \n\nThe investigation, known internally as Operation Red Cedars, was a multi-agency initiative involving the West Midlands Police Cyber Crime Unit, National Counter Terrorism Policing Headquarters, and the National Cyber Crime Unit. Through lengthy decryption efforts, including international cooperation with partners in the EU, investigators recovered substantial material evidencing the defendant’s involvement in preparatory acts. The technical complexity of accessing this data required expert analysis, often hampered by the use of advanced encryption techniques and anonymising protocols.  \n\nIt must be acknowledged the significant demands on public resources that such inquiries impose. The digital forensic workload in this case alone is reported to have consumed over 1,200 analyst hours, across specialists in cryptography, network traffic analysis, and psychological profiling. Similar constraints are documented nationally, with forces reporting backlogs in digital forensics attributable to rising cyber-dependent offending alongside the increasing technical sophistication employed by suspects.  \n\nFor completeness, and notwithstanding their limited relevance to sentencing, it is noted that the co-defendant in this case, Mr J, was charged with a separate offence of aggravated burglary involving a private dwelling in April 2024, unrelated to the terrorism offence. He remains at large following his failure to appear after being bailed. The court does not include this in its sentencing consideration of Mr H, save to note the separate procedural complexity it injects into case management.  \n\nDelays occurred intermittently through the case. At the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 10 July 2025, Mr H indicated intentions to plead not guilty. Various interlocutory applications were contested, including one seeking disclosure of further intercept evidence, ultimately resolved in the prosecution’s favour on 23 August. An application for an extension of time to provide additional expert psychiatric material was granted by this court on 1 September, thus postponing a final sentencing hearing date.  \n\nThe sentencing court is mindful, in this context, of the far-reaching impact of Legal Aid policy and funding constraints. The defendant’s instructing solicitor withdrew after funding was refused initially, necessitating a new application. The Legal Aid Agency authorised representation only after formal intervention by the local justice committee. Such delays, while extraneous to the defendant’s culpability, bear heavily on the efficient operation of justice and frustrate the expeditious resolution of serious matters.  \n\nIn the hearing today, I acknowledge the work by Defence Counsel, Mr A. R. Powell, who has provided detailed and professional advocacy at every stage. The Crown Prosecution Service is ably represented by Ms Jennifer Markham, Senior Crown Prosecutor, whose submissions were clear, thorough, and informed by up-to-date case law. I pay tribute to the courtroom staff for their dignity and patience on days marked by heavy caseloads.  \n\nIt may be noted that the Crown Court at Birmingham itself has undergone refurbishment over the summer. New digital evidence presentation systems have been installed, enabling enhanced review of multimedia exhibits, although delays in the commissioning of the associated software module led to some presentation difficulties at a recent hearing. While such technical matters are not determinative, they illustrate the wider challenges faced by justice infrastructure.  \n\nTurning now to the substantive matter, the facts of the case are as follows:  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe court has reviewed the voluminous evidence recovered from data extracted from devices seized at the defendant’s address, including encrypted communications, manuals concerning the construction of improvised explosive devices, and databases of target locations. The prosecution has adduced witness statements from members of the local community who noticed the defendant’s increased withdrawal and possession of suspicious items over several months. These statements, corroborated by forensic analysis, form the core of the Crown’s case.  \n\nAssessing the legal framework, the court is guided principally by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Definitive Guidelines 2023. The guidelines emphasise an assessment of culpability levels—low, medium, or high—and the degree of harm or intended harm, alongside relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. Particular relevance attaches to the organised nature of the offending, its premeditation, and the potential scale of harm.  \n\nThe historic development of counter-terrorism legislation is instructive. Since the Terrorism Act 2000, successive legislative measures have expanded and refined offences targeting both acts and preparatory conduct. The 2006 Act introduced sections to curtail preparatory acts, addressing concerns raised in the aftermath of attacks revealed by the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The law now balances the protection of public safety with adherence to the principles of individual liberty and due process.  \n\nPrevious jurisprudence provides a useful prism. The principles in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 set a benchmark for interpreting “terrorist purpose,” whereas R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 elucidated guidelines for sentencers confronted with early intervention cases. Furthermore, R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678 stresses the dual aims of deterrence and public protection in terrorism sentencing. These authorities, while not prescriptive, inform the careful reasoning required in matters of such gravity.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe defendant’s digital footprint reveals a transformation from apolitical online engagement to the consumption and dissemination of radicalised content commencing in mid-2022. Anonymised access to encrypted forums through virtual private networks and the use of pseudonymous accounts facilitated sustained contact with known propagandists. Linguistic forensic analysis conducted by Dr Fiona Sayers, a specialist in extremist discourse, confirms strong thematic parallels with internationally proscribed ideologies.  \n\nThe presence of certain encrypted files bearing the label “BlackSun Archives” indicates knowledge of and possible engagement with material aimed at training individuals in weapons fabrication. This posed significant evidential challenges, as highlighted in Defence submissions, invoking the difficulty of proving mens rea where some material was incomplete or corrupted. The court, however, notes the cumulative nature of the evidence and observes that the quantity and organisation of files surpass a mere casual interest.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nCovert surveillance photographs, timestamped logs, and network trail analysis indicate that Mr H visited a number of sites with known historical association with extremist activity. Some of these trips involved prolonged stops at locations with direct line-of-sight access to vulnerable public areas. Attempts by Defence to reframe these as mere urban exploration, or hobbyist interest, do not satisfy the court given the wider context. Similar conduct was considered suspicions in R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 1148 where exploratory visits were found to be preparatory acts rather than innocent exploration.  \n\nAddendum counsel noted during trial preparation that the defendant’s possession of small quantities of cannabis in a shared property kitchen was raised as extraneous defence mitigation, alongside an unpaid fine for parking contraventions in 2021. Again, such matters are peripheral and of no substantive bearing on terror offending.  \n\nThe court also received reports from community policing units detailing a spike in graffiti on public transport infrastructure in the area. None of this was linked to the defendant or the offence but is noted to emphasise the wider social backdrop within which the investigation unfolded.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nAnalysis of financial transactions revealed transfers of cryptocurrency from wallets linked to Mr H to accounts associated with vendors advertising chemicals and electronic components. While submissions from Defence posit plausible innocent uses for certain items, the intended use in an extremist context renders these explanations unconvincing. Crypto transactions, as this court has noted previously, can be notoriously opaque yet are a preferred conduit for illicit purchasing. Regulatory frameworks continue evolving, but the misuse of these channels remains a significant challenge for counter-terrorism work.  \n\nThe possession of 3-D printing equipment and vacuum-sealed containers, claimed by Defence as part of artistic projects, is of limited mitigating value given the accompanying digital forensic evidence showing design files for improvised detonators and triggering devices. Recent case law, including R v. Walters [2023] EWCA Crim 789, affirms that possession of dual-use equipment coupled with extremist intent justifies serious sentencing consideration.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nTurning to the defendant’s movements, the court has before it evidence of a trip made to the European mainland in late 2023. Records show attendance at a conference which, while nominally focussed on humanitarian issues, also included participants later implicated in extremist activities. Flight itineraries reveal an attempt to travel further to a region of conflict but thwarted by last-minute cancellations. This pattern aligns with behaviour noted in R v. Marouf [2022] EWCA Crim 1142, where travel plans to unstable regions indicated operational intent rather than innocent tourism.  \n\nThis illustrates the international scope of contemporary terrorism threats and the complexities faced by border control and intelligence services in managing such risks.  \n\nThe court is aware of the heavy demands made upon Disclosure Units in terrorism prosecution. An index of over 650 primary exhibits was served, comprising social media intercepts, encrypted message transcripts, expert reports, and correspondence with foreign police partner agencies. The redaction process required extensive liaison to balance open justice principles against national security imperatives. Section 6 Justice and Security Act proceedings were engaged regarding sensitive material.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial analysis undertaken by forensic accountants attached to CT West Midlands revealed transfers of approximately 0.55 Bitcoin, at times worth near £30,000, from accounts attributable to Mr H to unregulated entities marketing laboratory supplies. The use of “mixers” and “tumblers” in cryptocurrency, intended to obfuscate audit trails, further complicated the investigative task. The court notes the growing prominence of such techniques in the financial generic framework of organised crime and terrorism funding networks. Despite civil libertarian arguments in some quarters, unchecked anonymity and decentralisation represent a systemic threat to detection and prosecution efforts.  \n\nIn a procedural aside, it is worth mentioning that unrelated to this proceeding, the Probation Officer attached to this case was subject to separate administrative inquiry following allegations of misconduct in a different MAGPA offender management panel. Such matters, while not impacting sentencing here, exemplify the complex personnel challenges within multi-agency environments.  \n\nSimilarly, the co-defendant’s prior record includes a shoplifting conviction from an incident involving theft of alcohol and toiletries at a supermarket in 2022. The court reiterates that no such offences attach to Mr H and they form no part of the case addressed today.  \n\nThe defendant’s familial situation was outlined in reports tendered by social services. Mr H is single and resides alone in rented accommodation. Letters submitted by neighbours mention his sometimes unpredictable presence and noted mood swings, though do not suggest violence or intimidation. The landlord of the building, serving notices unrelated to the offences before the court, is also unconnected to the defendant’s offending.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nPsychiatric reports from Dr Elaine Marsh, independently instructed, confirm that Mr H is of above average intelligence and exhibits a rigid cognitive style, with tendencies toward absolutist thinking. No formal diagnosis of psychosis or mood disorder was made. The doctor’s risk assessment concludes that without intensive management there remains a high risk of dangerous extremist behaviour persisting post-release. The report recognises partial cooperation but notes some minimising attitudes and ideological fixity.  \n\nThe court has been assisted by probation reports from Community Rehabilitation Company West Midlands that emphasise the overstretched nature of current offender management services. Staffing shortages and high caseloads result in limited capacity for specialist terrorism-related interventions. Nonetheless, cooperation with voluntary organisations providing deradicalisation programmes represents a constructive, albeit challenging, component of supervision planning.  \n\nCounsel for the defence has drawn attention to Mr H’s prior educational achievements, including a degree in electronic engineering, and his earlier employment with a technology firm. Character letters acknowledge voluntary contributions to a local food bank and participation in citizen science projects mapping urban wildlife. While laudable, these activities cannot, and do not, diminish the seriousness of the offences in issue.  \n\nAlso noted were references made by Defence to the defendant’s sister, presently involved in unrelated family court proceedings, and to allegations of harassment against a former partner currently under police investigation. The court does not consider these matters relevant to the assessment of the defendant’s conduct or sentencing.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nIn conclusion, Mr H’s case exemplifies the sophistication and multifaceted nature of modern terrorism offences. The offending was entrenched, sustained, and involved calculated planning, amplified by technological expertise. The deliberate possession of materials, conduct abroad, and digital communication confirm clear intent to prepare for potentially devastating terrorist acts.  \n\nIn mitigation, his absence of previous convictions, education, partial engagement with deradicalisation services, and belated plea—entered on the morning of trial—are noted. However, the credit due for plea is restricted given its lateness and limited demonstrable remorse prior to conviction. The court remains mindful of the need to balance not only punishment but also rehabilitation and public protection. Programs such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) offer promise but are not panaceas. Continuous monitoring, including electronic tagging and stringent licence conditions, will likely be essential components of any release strategy.  \n\nAccordingly, I order the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report that addresses the feasibility of an extended sentence under section 226A Criminal Justice Act 2003, and the application of multi-agency risk management arrangements including MAPPA Category 3 oversight. The report should evaluate the potential for structured psychological intervention, availability of approved premises for resettlement, and ongoing surveillance measures including polygraph testing. Probation are requested to comment on the suitability of GPS exclusion zones and the implementation of internet access restrictions given the digital elements involved.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this 12th day of September 2025, in Court 4 at the Birmingham Crown Court. They have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, with a formal recorded transcript available for dissemination. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 have been certified for this case. Costs are reserved until sentencing.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.

While such technical matters are not determinative, they illustrate the wider challenges faced by justice infrastructure.  \n\nTurning now to the substantive matter, the facts of the case are as follows:  \n\nA recovered bomb-making worksheet in Mr H’s flat described how to improvise a device with 600g of hydrogen peroxide-based hair bleach, three containers of domestic drain cleaner, cold compresses containing ammonium nitrate, metal nuts and ball bearings, annotated with the handwritten phrase: optimum yield = 18 to 22 casualties at 2m radius.  \n\nThe court has reviewed the voluminous evidence recovered from data extracted from devices seized at the defendant’s address, including encrypted communications, manuals concerning the construction of improvised explosive devices, and databases of target locations.

These authorities, while not prescriptive, inform the careful reasoning required in matters of such gravity.  \n\nInvestigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic.  \n\nThe defendant’s digital footprint reveals a transformation from apolitical online engagement to the consumption and dissemination of radicalised content commencing in mid-2022. Anonymised access to encrypted forums through virtual private networks and the use of pseudonymous accounts facilitated sustained contact with known propagandists.

The court, however, notes the cumulative nature of the evidence and observes that the quantity and organisation of files surpass a mere casual interest.  \n\nA recovered file outlined a plan for triggering a second device via drone once police and medics were on site. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay.  \n\nCovert surveillance photographs, timestamped logs, and network trail analysis indicate that Mr H visited a number of sites with known historical association with extremist activity.

Section 6 Justice and Security Act proceedings were engaged regarding sensitive material.  \n\nThe defendant focused on the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton, where he stalked the cleaner. The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nFinancial analysis undertaken by forensic accountants attached to CT West Midlands revealed transfers of approximately 0.55 Bitcoin, at times worth near £30,000, from accounts attributable to Mr H to unregulated entities marketing laboratory supplies.
