Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/20345  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. K. DANVERS  \nFiled: 27 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears before the court today for sentence upon his conviction on two counts: first, engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences span a period commencing in early 2023 through to his arrest in January 2025. The interests of justice require a full and proportionate analysis of the material before the court, mindful throughout of the statutory sentencing regime, the public safety imperative, and the rights of the defendant.  \n\nIt is resolved to open these remarks with an acknowledgement of the contribution of the Crown and defence counsel, and the officers of Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) who facilitated the timely disclosure and listing of evidence necessitated by the complexities of this prosecution. One trusts that the court’s directions have been adhered to with the necessary rigour to ensure procedural fairness and efficient justice. The case itself entered the Crown Court list following committal from the magistrates on 13 March 2025. In the intervening period, the defendant has been remanded under strict bail conditions barring contact with certain individuals and restricted to specified residential addresses pending trial.  \n\nThe court is conscious, too, of the repeated challenges posed by administrative delays in authorising defence experts under Legal Aid frameworks. Indeed, much time was lost earlier this year awaiting confirmation from the Legal Aid Agency that Mr H’s counsel, Mr O’Sullivan, could instruct a forensic psychologist of his choice. Such delays are regrettable and frustrate both the defence’s capacity to prepare and the court’s duty to proceed without undue protraction. It is hoped that reforms underway will address these inefficiencies.  \n\nIn addressing the range of relevant legal authorities, one observes that section 5 offences under the Terrorism Act 2006 carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, reflecting the supreme gravity Parliament ascribes to such conduct. The Sentencing Council’s most recent guidelines, promulgated in 2023, require assessment by reference to the nature of the conduct, level of premeditation, degree of sophistication, and the risk posed to the public. Numerous appellate decisions underpin these principles, such as R v. Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 54 and R v. Al-Majid [2024] EWCA Crim 789, emphasizing the need for sentences to demonstrate both deterrence and deterrence-specific denunciation, balanced against individual circumstances. It is beyond cavil that terrorism cases demand careful judicial balancing: whilst the public interest requires significant custodial sentences, it is equally incumbent upon the courts to consider the prospects for rehabilitation where appropriate.  \n\nTwo preliminary observations bear recording: first, the court has considered written submissions from the South Bristol Resettlement Trust, a charity which helps former prisoners adjust to life outside custody. Their correspondence praises the potential value of “positive social engagement” to counter extremist narratives but prudently stresses the limitations of such interventions absent systemic psychological support. Secondly, the defendant’s handwritten statement to the court, dated 22 October 2025, was received and carefully considered. Whilst containing expressions of regret, the tone was measured rather than contrite; the court notes this with some reservation.  \n\nTurning to the procedural chronology, Mr H was first arrested on 5 January 2025 following execution of warrants at his residential property in Easton. The operation, ‘Op. Hammerfall,’ involved collaboration between CTPSW, digital forensic specialists, and the Special Branch of Avon & Somerset Police. Intelligence gathering over several months had included covert listening devices authorised under section 15 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, and prolonged review of encrypted communications intercepted via judicially approved warrants. At arrest, several devices were seized including multiple hard drives and an encrypted USB stick. Intensive forensic extraction followed.  \n\nThe court is aware that early disclosure was hampered by the volume and sensitivity of material, compounded by the need for national security clearance. This is not unusual in terrorism prosecutions which implicate multi-jurisdictional intelligence sources, some of which remain confidential even to the defence. The court acknowledges the painstaking work carried out under constrained timelines to manage this challenge.  \n\nIt is also relevant to note that a “Prevent” referral had initially been made some eighteen months prior by a university academic concerned by Mr H’s social media activity. The subsequent Channel panel found insufficient evidence to pursue an extended intervention, and the defendant disengaged from advisory support shortly thereafter. It is a theme common to extremism cases that early warning signs are sometimes missed or underestimated. The Channel framework—statutorily grounded in the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015—presents a valuable norm but is not infallible.  \n\nThe normal course for such cases is marked by multiple procedural hearings. The case was adjourned several times for compliance with complex disclosure schedules, including an administrative adjournment in April 2025 motivated by the unavailability of certain specialised digital evidence experts. The jury trial took place in September 2025, lasting four weeks. The defendant steadfastly maintained a not guilty plea throughout, until conviction was recorded following the jury’s unanimous verdict on 14 October 2025.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe facts as proved must be understood in the context of a methodical and technologically sophisticated operation. The encrypted communications, stored files, and observational evidence establish the defendant’s deliberate preparations to facilitate acts capable of causing grievous harm to the public. This was no spontaneous lapse but a measured enterprise.  \n\nThe court is mindful of the significant pressures currently affecting the Probation Service in the South West. Staffing vacancies hover at nearly 22 per cent in key roles, and it is reported that caseloads have increased by 18 per cent since 2023. This systemic strain impacts management of complex cases post-sentence, including those involving terrorist offenders. Of course, the present sentencing must reflect sentencing principles and risk management independently; but failure to note these operational realities would be incomplete.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nAn examination of the defendant’s online footprint reveals a progression from relatively innocuous posts in early 2021 advocating local environmental activism towards more overtly radicalised propaganda by mid-2023. Linguistic experts retained by the prosecution traced the use of phrases and thematic motifs consistent with those propagated by a proscribed organisation designated under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. That evidence was cogent and compelling.  \n\nIt is, of course, tempting to attribute shifts in ideological orientation to social media influences. A prominent public inquiry recently lamented the role of platforms such as TikTok and encrypted messaging services in facilitating radicalisation in marginalised youth. Nonetheless, courtroom evidence must remain tethered to direct proof, and this court has done so diligently. Incidentally, the court notes that a local community policing team reported a significant rise in antisocial behaviour linked to an unrelated “street music” collective in South Bristol during 2023. That phenomenon, whilst of public concern, bears no connection to Mr H’s conduct aside from geographical proximity.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nDigital forensic analysis uncovered a series of encrypted folders named “Blue Butterfly” on Mr H’s laptop. Among these were instructional manuals on improvised explosive devices, components sourcing spreadsheets, and encrypted correspondence with an unidentified overseas contact. The defence suggested that the materials were academic research, yet the jury found that such an explanation was implausible in light of the defendant’s active communications and surveillance records. It must be noted, by way of contrast, that the defendant claimed to have taken part in an online forum dedicated to drone enthusiasts, an interest corroborated by a modest number of Instagram posts featuring quadcopters and camera rigs. Those benign pursuits do not mitigate the more serious conduct.  \n\nThe court also observes, without implication, that part of the defendant’s property was discovered to contain small quantities of home-made elderflower wine, a matter canvassed extensively during trial but plainly irrelevant to sentencing. Similarly, a prior fixed penalty for cycling on a pedestrianised walkway some years earlier was relied upon in mitigation; while illustrating Mr H’s history of minor regulatory breaches, it has no bearing on the matters at hand.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe photographs found on Mr H’s devices included aerial shots of strategic infrastructure locations taken from public vantage points. Defence counsel submitted that these images were consistent with an interest in urban photography. The court notes, however, that these photos were supplemented by detailed annotated notes referencing blast radius estimates and access vulnerabilities, which indicated planning beyond casual hobbyism.  \n\nThe court has also taken account of the noted injunction obtained in 2020 against a tenant in the property adjacent to Mr H's residence following persistent noise complaints. The landlord’s evidence outlined protracted disputes concerning garden maintenance and litter disposal. Such neighbourhood frictions, while unfortunate, remain outside the scope of these sentencing remarks except insofar as they offer context of the defendant’s pattern of local interaction.  \n\nThe court was intrigued to read in the defence mitigation a reference to Mr H’s work as a volunteer library assistant during 2019 and 2020, which reportedly involved organising community events centered on local history. While commendable, the court regards this as peripheral to the seriousness of the offences charged.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nForeign travel records indicate that Mr H made a brief trip to Budapest in May 2024, ostensibly for tourism. However, investigation shows he altered hotel bookings to spend time near districts with known gatherings of extremist sympathizers. Closed-circuit evidence from Budapest’s Kossuth Square shows Mr H engaging briefly with individuals subsequently arrested for offences unrelated to this case but of a serious nature, including possession of indecent images and public order offences. Though the evidence does not link Mr H directly to those offences, it does suggest association which, in a holistic risk assessment, cannot be lightly disregarded.  \n\nIn unrelated matters, the court notes that Mr H’s estranged sister, Ms K., is presently subject to investigation for benefit fraud in a different jurisdiction. No evidence has been adduced to suggest any collusion or facilitation involving the defendant. Similarly, a former co-tenant was arrested and convicted in 2023 for fly-tipping on green belt land several miles from Mr H’s home.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancially, the prosecution’s forensic accountant traced multiple cryptocurrency transactions from wallets attributed to Mr H. Payments were made to vendors purporting to supply chemical reagents and electronic components. While these transactions totalled only a modest sum, they illustrate the defendant’s use of cryptocurrency mixing services designed to obfuscate audit trails—an alignment with known criminal methodologies.  \n\nThe court takes note with concern of the growing sophistication of illicit use of anonymising financial technologies in terrorist financing. The difficulties posed to law enforcement agencies have been identified in recent parliamentary reports, highlighting both the technological challenges and the resource constraints facing investigatory units. It is important to recognise that these trends necessitate enhanced inter-agency collaboration, a process itself beset with administrative burdens.  \n\nAdditionally, the court is aware that during the investigation, covert surveillance units expended considerable time—estimated at over 200 hours—reviewing footage from riverside locations in Bristol suspected of hosting clandestine meetings. Such demand on analysts and officers exemplifies the disproportionate resource cost often entailed in detecting relatively brief activities of concern.    \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nRegarding personal circumstances, Mr H is aged 30, holds an honours degree in mechanical engineering from a university of respectable standing, and was previously employed at a manufacturing company until his abrupt resignation in mid-2023. The employer’s reference characterises him as “meticulous and diligent,” but notes concerns over his increasingly isolated behaviour and reported minor disciplinary issues including breach of IT policy.  \n\nLetters of support submitted by the defence include correspondence from the St. Philip’s Community Garden, praising his voluntary work in conduit repairs and greenhouse maintenance. While such involvement is to be encouraged from a social reintegration perspective, as has been observed, these contributions must be weighed strictly alongside the gravity of the offences. The expectation that those who contribute positively in one sphere are therefore entitled to leniency when breaching fundamental social contracts is misplaced.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nA psychiatric report prepared by Dr Edmund Rowley of the Bristol Centre for Forensic Psychology was submitted on behalf of the defence. The report, detailed and professionally composed, diagnoses no major mental illness but highlights “marked cognitive rigidity, fixation on ideological absolutes, and poor impulse control.” The clinical opinion concludes that Mr H poses a high risk of serious harm if released without intensive, multi-modal intervention, including surveillance and psychological oversight.  \n\nThe defendant’s legal team have indicated intention to pursue enrolment in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), a structured deradicalisation intervention. The court welcomes the availability of rehabilitative schemes but expresses caution grounded in empirical data showing significant attrition rates and variable outcomes among participants. Effective public protection demands that such programmes be viewed as adjuncts rather than substitutes for robust supervision and restrictive sentencing where warranted.  \n\nThis case is a grave reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by frontline services grappling with the complex interface between individual agency and extremist ideology. It is also emblematic of the painstaking work demanded by multi-agency collaboration, where counter-terrorism policing, mental health services, probation, and community bodies must act in concert under challenging operational conditions.  \n\nThe court orders that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared, considering all aspects raised herein, with particular emphasis on the risk assessment and potential for community management. Consideration should be given to the applicability of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, conditioned by electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and mandated psychological programmes where appropriate. The report should be submitted within four weeks to inform the final sentencing hearing set provisionally for 29 November 2025.  \n\nThe proceedings have been conducted openly and with due observance of the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. The court records its thanks to Ms Janet Creighton of the Crown Prosecution Service and Mr Sean O’Sullivan, instructed solicitor and advocate on behalf of the defendant. Appreciation is also extended to the court usher and clerks for maintaining order and decorum throughout these protracted hearings.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 27 October 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. The formal transcript will be lodged accordingly and communicated to the appropriate authorities. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/20345  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. K.
