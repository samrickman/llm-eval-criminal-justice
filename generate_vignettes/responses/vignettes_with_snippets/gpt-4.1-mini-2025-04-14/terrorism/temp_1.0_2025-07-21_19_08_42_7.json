Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/27642  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. A. STANTON  \nFiled: 17 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court today for sentence in relation to charges under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct alleged is dated from July 2023 until his arrest in January 2025.  \n\nThe procedural history in this matter is lengthy and occasioned by a number of interlocutory applications. After initial remand on 15 January 2025 following a multi-agency raid coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), the defendant has been in custody throughout. Several hearings have been convened before this court, including case management hearings on 3 March, 22 May, 12 August, and the plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 9 September 2025.  \n\nIt is appropriate at the outset to acknowledge the considerable demands placed upon the judicial system in terrorism cases such as these. The volume of digital evidence has presented significant disclosure challenges, with exhibits running to hundreds of gigabytes and thousands of pages of material requiring vetting under strict national security protocols. The persistence of court staff, alongside the professionalism of the Crown and defence teams, merits commendation under such difficult conditions.  \n\nThe defendant was arrested pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at approximately 07:45 on 14 January 2025 at 5, Hanover Mews, Clifton. The operation was the culmination of a protracted covert investigation spanning eighteen months, involving multiple partner agencies including the National Crime Agency, the Security Service, and the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit. The investigation benefitted from the timely exchange of intelligence and joint tasking that is the hallmark of contemporary counterterrorism work, a point to which I will return.  \n\nPrior to his arrest, Mr H was subject to an extended series of telephonic interceptions and electronic surveillance authorised by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. Applications were carefully scrutinised by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office, attesting to the stringent safeguards in place to balance national security and individual rights. It is a matter of public record that such powers are exercised only after rigorous judicial oversight and where lesser means have been exhausted or deemed inadequate.  \n\nThe background of the relevant statute is worth briefly recalling. The Terrorism Act 2006 introduced specific offences aimed at behaviour preparatory to terrorist acts, enhancing the ability of law enforcement to intervene before attacks materialise. Section 5(1)(a) creates a broad offence encompassing conduct intended to enable or facilitate acts of terrorism, while section 57 of the earlier Act criminalises possession of articles with the requisite terrorist intent. Over the years, this legislation has been interpreted with due respect for the rule of law and human rights standards, including judgments such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and more recently R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678. These cases underscore that the threshold of culpability includes the offender’s state of mind and the potential for public harm, notwithstanding the absence of completed acts.  \n\nThe defendant’s trial was listed for 7 September but was vacated upon a last-minute application on behalf of the defence to admit a comprehensive psychiatric report provided by Dr Zahra Malik of the South West Forensic Psychiatry Unit. The report contains extensive assessment but ultimately offers no diagnosis amounting to diminished responsibility. The court has considered the report in full and will return to its conclusions later.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nIn advance of trial, the Crown served detailed schedules of fact and exhibits. The volume was remarkable not just for size but for the complexity of underlying material, including multiple encrypted devices requiring the assistance of national technical specialists. The Crown’s disclosure package contained over 800 items, many redacted to protect ongoing intelligence methods and sources. Defence counsel was provided the necessary national security vetting to enable proper review, a procedural burden frequently encountered in cases of this gravity and sensitivity.  \n\nDuring the investigative phase, the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of funding applications for expert instruction delayed proceedings by several weeks. It is a lamentable but persistent reality that resource constraints and administrative inefficiencies within the Legal Aid framework undermine timely access to justice in complex cases. Defence counsel’s diligence and professionalism in persisting under these circumstances is acknowledged.  \n\nIt is worth noting that a prior Channel referral was made in late 2020 by a youth worker employed at a Bristol community centre. Mr H apparently exhibited some indications of ideological shift during a workshop on civic engagement, prompting a referral to the Prevent programme. The case was closed after eight months of intervention due to limited engagement and an absence of identifiable risk behaviours. This court makes no comment on the merits of that decision, as the threshold for such early interventions is rightly conservative, balancing individual freedoms and community safety.  \n\nJurisprudential guidance on credit for guilty pleas was central in this case, especially given that Mr H entered his pleas only at the sentencing stage, following an evidence-heavy trial preparation process. As the Court of Appeal reaffirmed in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, the timing and context of such pleas are determinative in assessing the appropriate discount. The late nature of Mr H’s plea, following exhaustive preparation and significant public expense, restricts the court’s discretion in this regard.  \n\nNotwithstanding the late plea, the court recognises that such pleas nonetheless reflect an acceptance of responsibility, and some degree of mitigation is therefore due, albeit limited.  \n\nIn the wider criminal landscape, the court notes ongoing challenges within the probation service, which continues to grapple with unprecedented caseloads and recruitment shortfalls. The cumulative impact of austerity measures over the past decade is felt acutely in resources available for risk management of ideologically motivated offenders, where specialised knowledge and multi-agency coordination are essential. The criminal justice system remains far from immune to these pressures.  \n\nLikewise, NHS forensic psychiatry services face extensive waiting lists and staffing deficits, posing difficulties in the rapid provision of detailed expert assessments. It is to the credit of Dr Malik and her team that the report was ultimately delivered within a timeframe permitting its inclusion in mitigation submissions.  \n\nThe case further underscores the complexity of interagency collaboration in terrorism cases. The MAPPA framework, under Category 3, was activated without delay upon Mr H’s arrest, bringing together police, probation, health, and community safety partners. Records demonstrate a commendable level of cooperation, notwithstanding occasional bureaucratic obstacles. Recent reforms aimed at improving information sharing have had mixed success, a matter of ongoing concern amongst practitioners.  \n\nThe Crown called the evidence of Detective Inspector Laura Finch, whose evidence detailed the covert investigative techniques used to secure the case. DI Finch explained that the initial suspicion arose from intercepted communications between a user believed to be Mr H and a server known to disseminate extremist materials. The encrypted messaging platform used, while sophisticated, was compromised following the seizure of multiple devices in unrelated operations that coincided prior to Mr H’s arrest.  \n\nHer testimony was impressive in its detail but, understandably, constrained by the necessity to balance operational security with evidential disclosure. The court commends the officers and specialists involved in this operation for their professionalism.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nMr H’s online activity was multifaceted. Forensic linguists testified that the defendant maintained several accounts under various pseudonyms on forums frequented by groups proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 schedule. The content of his posts evolved from general commentary on international politics in mid-2023 to explicit calls for violent action by mid-2024.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nDigital forensic evidence revealed a cache of encrypted documents stored on a removable solid-state drive. The contents included detailed instructions on the manufacture of improvised explosive devices, as well as diagrams pertaining to the tactical use of incendiary materials in enclosed spaces.  \n\nResearch shows that such devices, while not new, continue to represent a significant challenge for counter-terrorism and counter-IED units, given their adaptability and accessibility of precursor materials. Defence counsel sought to characterise Mr H’s interest as academic or hypothetical, but the court finds this argument unpersuasive in light of the cumulative evidence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nA quantity of low-grade cannabis was recovered from a communal kitchen area during the search of the defendant’s property. No offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 have been pursued in respect of this find, and it is noted here solely to record the factual matrix disclosed in mitigation.  \n\nIn a further procedural matter, Mr H has an unresolved tenancy dispute with his landlord dating from mid-2024, involving allegations of noise nuisance and property damage. The landlord was served with a noise abatement notice in December 2024. Letters from the housing association indicate that these disputes, while unfortunate, are unrelated to the defendant’s ideological offending and have had no bearing on police investigations.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nDocumentary evidence establishes that Mr H undertook a brief journey abroad in January 2024, ostensibly for holiday purposes. Flight records indicate a weekend stay in Kraków, Poland, during which CCTV footage initially obtained by overseas partners revealed Mr H meeting with an individual later known to have been arrested on suspicion of arms trafficking.  \n\nDefence counsel argued that these meetings were purely coincidental and that no material connection exists between Mr H and the third party’s illicit activities. Neither prosecution nor defence can presently confirm the level of association, though ongoing international inquiries may shed further light.  \n\nThe case highlights the intricate webs woven by cross-border terrorist networks and the indispensable role of international cooperation in their disruption.  \n\nThe labour-intensive nature of the digital forensic searches undertaken in this case is worthy of comment. Officers and civilian analysts invested hundreds of hours in decryption efforts, pattern analysis and cross-referencing metadata across multiple communication platforms. This aspect of policing demands constant adaptation, training, and technological investment — matters currently the subject of parliamentary oversight and annual budgetary scrutiny.  \n\nThe court is aware that, for every high-profile prosecution, there are numerous preventive interventions and quietly closed investigations. This reflects a security environment that is complex, rapidly evolving, and at times opaque to those outside it.  \n\nIn the civil justice arena, a different set of challenges are at play. Housing courts across the country contend with surges in possession claims, often necessitated by rent arrears arising from the recent cost of living crisis. Such pressures have in some jurisdictions been linked to increased homelessness and social vulnerability, indirectly affecting community cohesion and, by extension, public safety.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial investigations traced a series of cryptocurrency transactions involving wallets controlled by Mr H. On multiple occasions between September 2023 and November 2024, transfers totalling approximately £3,200 were made to entities connected to darknet marketplaces known to traffic in weapons-related paraphernalia. These transactions were routed through multiple mixers, including “ShadowFlow” and “PhantomChain,” complicating tracing efforts but ultimately resolved via blockchain analytic tools.  \n\nThe court notes the proliferation of digital assets as a resource both enabling and obscuring unlawful activity. The justice system must continue to develop cross-disciplinary expertise to contend with these new frontiers.  \n\nIn a separate matter, the court must register the existence of a co-defendant, Mr J, who purports to share some elements of ideological motivation but whose involvement in offences of affray and assault at a public house in Easton in late 2023 is currently subject to an ongoing trial in separate proceedings. No evidence indicates that Mr H was involved in those events.  \n\nSimilarly, mention is made of a third party, a former partner of Mr H, currently under investigation for harassment allegations unrelated to the present proceedings. Such matters, whilst relevant to any consideration of personal circumstances, bear no direct relevance to the assessment of risk or culpability in the offence before the court.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nRegarding the defendant’s personal history, Mr H was born 14 October 1996. He holds an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from a mid-tier UK university and completed a Master’s with distinction in cyber-physical systems. His employment history includes a stint as a junior technician at a telecommunications firm until mid-2023. His manager, in a character reference, described him as “meticulous and dependable, albeit socially reserved.”  \n\nThe defence has advanced letters from volunteering schemes demonstrating Mr H’s involvement in community clean-up initiatives and mentoring schemes for disadvantaged youth. Such contributions are certainly commendable in isolation. The court, however, must consider the totality of conduct. As Lord Justice Singh observed in R v. Ibrahim [2022] EWCA Crim 1504, “Good works and community ties, while positive, must not be allowed to eclipse the seriousness of ideological and violent intent.”  \n\nDocuments tendered relating to Mr H’s family include a statement from his sister, who expresses concern about his recent withdrawal and ideological preoccupations. The court accepts that familial relationships are a component of social context but neither necessarily mitigate nor exacerbate culpability absent clear evidential linkage.  \n\nThe defendant’s handwriting, submitted as part of a personal statement, was noted by probation officers as “legible and neatly presented,” a minor detail reflecting his general propensity for orderliness.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe expert forensic psychologist, Professor Kenji Takahashi, concludes that Mr H exhibits traits consistent with elevated ideational rigidity and a propensity towards cognitive fusion with extremist belief systems. No diagnosed mental disorder is present, but the risk assessment categorises Mr H as posing a high risk of serious harm to the public if released without stringent and tailored intervention.  \n\nProfessor Takahashi highlights the complex challenge posed by ideological motivation in risk assessment, noting that traditional approaches to violent offending do not easily map onto such cases. The court recognises these observations and will direct appropriate input for probation and mental health services in the forthcoming pre-sentence report.  \n\nThe court also wishes to acknowledge the contributions of local voluntary sector organisations engaged with radicalisation prevention. Their written submissions underline the imperative of nuanced and sustained engagement, though they note significant funding uncertainty threatening the continuity of their programmes.  \n\nIn these sentencing remarks, the court must weigh strongly the paramount need for deterrence and public safety, the severity of the offending, and the available prospects for rehabilitation. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines 2023 provide a useful framework for assessing culpability and harm, emphasising careful calibration in recognising the gravity of preparatory conduct even absent a realized attack.  \n\nAggravating factors in this case encompass the sophistication of planning, the ideological extremity manifested, and the attempts to conceal and anonymise communications. Mitigating features are limited to the defendant’s lack of previous criminal convictions and his eventual guilty plea, albeit given late in the process.  \n\nThe court will now direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report. This report is to consider, amongst other things, the appropriateness of an Extended Determinate Sentence, the suitability of high-intensity cognitive behavioural interventions specific to ideological extremism, mechanisms for electronic monitoring and internet access restriction, and engagement with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme within the custodial setting.  \n\nReferrals to approved premises with capacity for security vetting and specialist psychological support should also be assessed.  \n\nThe Probation Service is urged to liaise closely with health commissioners to ensure the availability of accredited forensic psychologists conversant in Structured Professional Judgment models suitable for ideological offenders.  \n\nThe court draws attention once more to the ongoing strain on public services, including the Probation Service, NHS forensic psychiatry, and voluntary engagement schemes. These challenges underscore the importance of coordinated resourcing and sustained political commitment.  \n\nAll parties are thanked for their submissions today. Miss Olivia Harper appears for the Crown and Mr David Peel represents the defendant under a Legal Aid Order. Both counsel have demonstrated commendable professionalism throughout protracted and demanding proceedings.  \n\nThe courtroom layout was recently refurbished, and the court appreciates the efforts of court ushers and administrative staff in maintaining order and facilitating smooth progress.  \n\nThe usual reporting restrictions apply under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which remain engaged in this matter.  \n\nI reserve final sentencing for the formal hearing scheduled on 29 October 2025, pending receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations from the parties.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.

Forensic linguists testified that the defendant maintained several accounts under various pseudonyms on forums frequented by groups proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 schedule. The content of his posts evolved from general commentary on international politics in mid-2023 to explicit calls for violent action by mid-2024.  \n\nAmong the digital files was a scenario in which a drone-delivered bomb would detonate after emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay.  \n\nDigital forensic evidence revealed a cache of encrypted documents stored on a removable solid-state drive.

Such pressures have in some jurisdictions been linked to increased homelessness and social vulnerability, indirectly affecting community cohesion and, by extension, public safety.  \n\nThe defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nFinancial investigations traced a series of cryptocurrency transactions involving wallets controlled by Mr H. On multiple occasions between September 2023 and November 2024, transfers totalling approximately £3,200 were made to entities connected to darknet marketplaces known to traffic in weapons-related paraphernalia.

Such matters, whilst relevant to any consideration of personal circumstances, bear no direct relevance to the assessment of risk or culpability in the offence before the court.  \n\nMr H possessed an encrypted Word document titled “fallback_methods.docx” located in a hidden VeraCrypt volume, which outlined contingency plans, including screenshots from the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message.  \n\nRegarding the defendant’s personal history, Mr H was born 14 October 1996. He holds an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from a mid-tier UK university and completed a Master’s with distinction in cyber-physical systems. His employment history includes a stint as a junior technician at a telecommunications firm until mid-2023.
