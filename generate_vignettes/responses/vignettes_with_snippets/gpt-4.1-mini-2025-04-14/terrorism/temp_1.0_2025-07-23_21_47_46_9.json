Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29534  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. Templeton  \nFiled: 24 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences alleged encompass a timeframe from September 2023 leading up to the defendant’s arrest in April 2025.  \n\nThe defendant’s arrest occurred at 07:45 on 15 April 2025. Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) executed a series of coordinated warrants at a flat in Edgbaston. These were undertaken pursuant to powers granted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following intelligence indicating the defendant was in possession of encrypted communications referencing military-grade explosives manuals. Upon entry, officers seized encrypted digital devices, chemical precursors, and various materials particular to improvised explosive device assembly.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe investigative procedure that led to Mr H’s apprehension was the product of several months’ painstaking surveillance and analysis. The operation, codenamed “PINECONE,” integrated multiple intelligence streams: open source monitoring, financial transaction tracing, and telephone metadata analysis. Crucially, signals intelligence revealed the defendant’s involvement with dark-web forums dedicated to extremist activity. The deployment of these counter-terror capabilities requires extensive inter-agency cooperation, with contributions from the National Crime Agency, Regional Cyber Crime Unit, and military-grade communications intercept teams.  \n\nIt is appropriate to record here that the court is well aware of the increasing administrative burden this multi-agency approach imposes. The growing complexity of interlocking legal frameworks—the interaction between Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, and established criminal procedure—requires officers and prosecutors to exercise extreme caution in balancing operational efficacy with the imperatives of fairness, disclosure obligations, and judicial oversight. Cases such as this charm no easy administrative path.  \n\nIt is noteworthy, though, that this court received correspondence from the Legal Aid Agency indicating delays in the procurement of expert assistance, with initial authorisation for a specialist digital forensic consultant granted only after protracted internal inquiry. Such delays, regrettably, are not uncommon and illustrate the perennial tension between resource constraints and the need for expedient justice. Defence counsel repeatedly pressed for clarification on this matter, and I understand a formal complaint has been lodged. These procedural challenges do no favours — neither to defendants, counsel, nor the broader interests of justice.  \n\nSimilarly, the court acknowledges the ongoing strain upon the regional probation service, as observed in recent submissions by the Probation Chiefs Association. The shortage of qualified offender managers, particularly those trained in the supervision of terrorism-related cases, exacerbates the challenge of managing risk in the community. Resource pressure in essential public agencies is by no means unique to this jurisdiction, and it bears witness to the broader societal costs of managing complex offenders.  \n\nThe defendant initially pleaded not guilty at the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 11 August 2025. Subsequently, a jury trial was listed to commence on 7 October 2025, only to be vacated on application of the defence in order to introduce fresh mitigation, comprising character references, and letters from local community organisations including the Birmingham City Foodbank and the Edgbaston Volunteer Network. Those organisations highlighted Mr H’s intermittent volunteer activity, an assertion that will be considered in due course.  \n\nMr H ultimately entered guilty pleas to both counts at the omnibus hearing on 22 September 2025. These pleas came after the Crown served a detailed schedule of evidence, including intercepted communications and forensic reports. As the learned counsel for the defence conceded, the stage at which the pleas were offered limits the credit available under the Sentencing Council’s guidelines. This court reiterates the established principle that early pleas serve the interests of all parties. Late pleas, no matter how sincere, cannot command equivalent mitigation.  \n\nThe law concerning plea credit was restated in the Court of Appeal decision in R v. Flowers [2024] EWCA Crim 2123, where it was held that reductions for guilty pleas are “not to be reduced to a purely numerical exercise; timing and factual context matter.” In that case, the appellant was convicted of aggravated assault with a machete on a public street; although he eventually pleaded guilty, the plea occurred after extensive trial preparation had been expended, thus the court affirmed the judge’s restriction of credit to just 10%. Though the Flowers case involved different subject matter, its reasoning has broad application and is instructive for the present sentencing exercise.  \n\nMoreover, consideration is given to the authoritative dicta in R v. O’Connor [2022] EWCA Crim 1789, on the interplay between mental health and sentencing credit, where it was emphasised that psychiatric reports, whilst essential, cannot ordinarily alter the fundamental principle that timely responsibility-taking is a key driver for reduction.  \n\nThe court is obliged also to have regard to the recent judgment of R v. Hatfield [2025] EWCA Crim 466, which clarified the application of extended custodial sentences under the Terrorism Act 2000, stressing the imperative of deterrence and protecting the public from ongoing risk of harm. Hatfield underlines that where offenders demonstrate high levels of sophistication, planning, or access to restricted materials, long sentences are generally to be expected.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nMr H, over the course of the offences, maintained an online presence under various pseudonyms, disseminating material glorifying acts of violence and extremist political manifestos. The Crown’s digital forensic analysis recovered extensive files documenting bomb-making instructions, including segments culled from proscribed publications. Those disseminated materials were in part encrypted within archived containers, labelled innocuously to evade detection, signifying a deliberately covert approach.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nFurther inquiry discovered that the defendant had adapted a commercially available drone, equipping it with compartment modifications and payload mechanisms consistent with surveillance and delivery of hazardous substances. Defence submissions argued that such technical experimentation was a manifestation of “innocuous engineering curiosity.” This court is unable to find that account convincing in the face of the wider evidential context. Intent, the court notes, may be inferred from surrounding circumstances and the totality of conduct, not isolated technical interests.  \n\nThe court is reminded that possession of an article for a terrorist purpose encompasses not only overt acts but preparatory steps that, though not culminating in actual physical harm, are nonetheless capable of contributing materially to risks of violence. The line between curiosity and intent is finely drawn but must be respected in the public interest.  \n\nBy way of ancillary information, it is recorded that during the period concurrent to Mr H’s offending, the Crown Prosecution Service successfully concluded several apparently unrelated prosecutions involving the importation of Class A drugs concealed in parcel freight containers. Those cases, while unrelated substantively, have placed considerable strain upon the Customs and Border Force, adding to the operational pressures faced in this jurisdiction. Such contextual facts, while indirectly illuminating the breadth of public safety challenges, do not bear on the defendant’s culpability and risk assessment here.  \n\nAdditionally, the court heard from a senior fire officer who provided an overview of the impact of politically motivated arson in urban environments under the Fire Services Act 2004. The officer recounted an incident in Oldbury last year where a derelict commercial property was destroyed, an act which resulted in a multi-agency response lasting several days. While this example sheds light on general threats faced by emergency services, it cannot be linked specifically to the defendant.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nRecovered notes demonstrate premeditated steps to procure precursor chemicals, with plans to exploit supply chain vulnerabilities in local hardware outlets. Defence argued these transactions were consistent with gardening or artisanal craft activity, but the court has determined otherwise. The documentation included references to quantities incompatible with benign use.  \n\nThe court has noted the defendant's history of minor regulatory infractions unrelated to terrorism: for example, a 2019 fixed-penalty ticket for driving whilst disqualified, and a complaint regarding noise nuisance issued by a landlord in 2021. Such matters, while recorded, do not influence the gravity of the current offences nor the assessment of harm posed.  \n\nThrough the course of these proceedings, two co-defendants were separately convicted on charges related to firearms possession and public disorder. One remains at large, reportedly under police investigation for further offences including fraud; the other received an extended sentence for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, connected to a pub brawl involving pool cues. None of these facts directly involve Mr H; however, they reflect wider concerns about violence linked to loosely connected networks.  \n\nThe court has also been provided with psychological evaluations. The report from Dr Helena Ormsby, dated 8 September 2025, is comprehensive and professionally prepared. It assesses Mr H as exhibiting elevated traits of cognitive inflexibility, obsessive planning, and ideological absolutism. No formal psychotic or mood disorder was identified. The risk assessment categorises him as posing a significant and enduring hazard to the public absent intensive supervision.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nA notable element of the prosecution case was the defendant’s travel history. Records indicate a trip to Rotterdam in November 2024, ostensibly for a trade fair on sustainable manufacturing. However, surveillance footage obtained at the port revealed encounters with individuals subsequently linked to extremist fundraising activities, including one who was later convicted of money laundering. Defence counsel contended coincidence; the court finds this improbable given contemporaneous encrypted telephone contact.  \n\nThe workload demands on forensic examiners in the Counter Terrorism Policing units are ever-increasing, as illustrated when analyzing the numerous seized devices with state-of-the-art custom encryption. Cases such as R v. Dinan [2018] EWCA Crim 1738 have underscored the necessity for specialist expertise, without which prosecutions struggle to establish evidential foundations convincingly. The strain on digital forensic teams is well documented and acknowledged by this court.  \n\nElsewhere, the court wishes to highlight that the defendant’s community ties, referenced in letters submitted on his behalf, come primarily from volunteer roles with the Edgbaston Seniors Support Group and the local food bank. Those organisations operate under intense funding pressures and cover a wide swathe of individuals with diverse needs. Whilst these acts of apparent civic contribution are commendable, they do not outweigh the seriousness of offending in this case. The court references R v. Haywood [2023] EWCA Crim 2901 for the principle that commendable behaviour in one sphere cannot wholly eclipse criminal intent in another.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial investigations revealed a series of cryptocurrency transactions identified as suspicious by the National Crime Agency. One payment of 1.75 Bitcoin, equivalent to approximately £24,000, was traced from a wallet linked to Mr H’s known online alias to a vendor specialising in dual-use laboratory equipment. The vendor has denied knowledge of any misuse. The court observes that the use of decentralised finance in this context poses considerable challenges for law enforcement and regulatory control. The risk of untraceable funding channels facilitates a spectrum of illicit behaviours extending beyond terrorism.  \n\nThe court further notes the burden placed on prosecutors by the volume of digital disclosure, involving hundreds of terabytes of encrypted data, requiring decryption and review over many months. Defence teams, constrained by capped Legal Aid payments, face formidable obstacles in mounting an adequate response. The issue of funding limits has been the subject of correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency, and the court hopes policymakers will continue to engage constructively with practitioners for sustainable solutions.  \n\nIt is a constant frustration that some public sectors, including police and probation, struggle to recruit and retain staff with the technical expertise required for modern investigative and supervisory roles. The Criminal Justice Board’s 2025 Annual Report speaks to turnover rates exceeding 25% in frontline probation roles, leading to increased caseloads and potentially diminished attention to risk factors. These are systemic challenges beyond any individual’s responsibility but have practical impact on public safety.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 30 years old, university-educated with a degree in materials science. Prior to resignation in August 2023, he was employed as a research technician in an industrial testing laboratory. References from supervisors depict him as “methodical yet introverted,” and note concerns about his withdrawal from workplace social activities over the preceding year. His resignation followed an internal inquiry into unauthorised access to secure workstations.  \n\nThe defendant’s family has lodged character statements, including a letter from his mother describing a difficult childhood marked by instability and frequent relocations. An estranged sibling is currently under investigation for unrelated benefit fraud. Such personal details, while contextually informative, bear no direct connection to the defendant’s culpability in this matter.  \n\nProfessor Martin Keane, forensic psychiatrist, conducted a clinical evaluation focusing on cognitive patterns and risk factors. His report describes the defendant’s “marked black-and-white thinking” and “persistent adherence to dogmatic ideological tenets,” but notably excludes any formal psychiatric diagnosis. The psychiatric assessment underscores the challenge of addressing extremist belief systems which are often impervious to conventional therapeutic interventions.  \n\nReflections on the broader societal context are warranted. The expansion of social media platforms, particularly those favouring encrypted messaging and ephemeral content, has created fertile terrain for radicalisation and recruitment. The court notes with concern the role that easily accessible, coded language and unmoderated discussion groups play in normalising extremist narratives among vulnerable populations. The scale of the problem extends beyond the individual, demanding coordinated policy responses combining education, digital regulation, and community engagement.  \n\nThe defendant’s case must also be viewed through the prism of proportionality. That concept, long discussed in appellate jurisprudence, notably in R v. Sinclair & Others [2017] EWCA Crim 1875, mandates that sentences must be commensurate with the gravity of the individual’s conduct but also informed by mitigating factors and prospects for rehabilitation. While public protection remains paramount, justice demands a balanced approach.  \n\nThe timing of pleas is particularly pertinent here. The defendant’s late admission persisted beyond the conclusion of witness statements and substantive pre-trial argumentation. The defence has submitted a personal statement expressing remorse and articulating regret at earlier denials of responsibility. The court accepts the sincerity of this statement but must weigh it against the overall pattern of conduct and late procedural cooperation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThis prosecution represents a sophisticated and multifaceted response to a challenging offender. The level of planning, encrypted communication, and the possession of material for bomb making justify categorisation within the highest culpability bracket of the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines. Aggravating features include deliberate concealment, exploitation of digital infrastructure, and possession of dual-use technology with clear malicious intent. Concurrently, mitigating aspects include the defendant’s lack of previous convictions and the educational background indicating potential responsiveness to intervention.  \n\nThe court notes the ongoing efforts of MAPPA Category 3 coordination in managing Mr H’s case. The multi-agency risk management plan includes considerations for secure release accommodation, internet access restrictions, and documented psychological supervision. The viability of these measures will feature within the forthcoming pre-sentence report.  \n\nI hereby direct that a detailed pre-sentence report be prepared by the local probation service, emphasising the assessment of risk factors, prospects for rehabilitation, and the appropriateness of custodial versus community-based interventions. The report should detail possibilities for structured disengagement programming and consider the applicability of electronic monitoring and licence conditions given the defendant’s sophisticated level of risk.  \n\nSentencing is reserved pending the receipt of this report and any further representations from counsel. The court expresses its gratitude to the officers, analysts, and advisers whose painstaking work has brought this matter to trial, and to counsel on both sides for their clearly presented submissions. Observations on operational and institutional challenges noted herein should inform ongoing policy discussion, but do not detract from the gravity with which this court regards the offences.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are furnished this day, 24 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. A full transcript has been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right of appeal against any sentence imposed in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, to be lodged within 28 days of sentencing. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29534  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J.

The Crown’s digital forensic analysis recovered extensive files documenting bomb-making instructions, including segments culled from proscribed publications. Those disseminated materials were in part encrypted within archived containers, labelled innocuously to evade detection, signifying a deliberately covert approach.  \n\nInvestigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay.  \n\nFurther inquiry discovered that the defendant had adapted a commercially available drone, equipping it with compartment modifications and payload mechanisms consistent with surveillance and delivery of hazardous substances.

An intercepted file titled Stage 2 detailed how Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nFinancial investigations revealed a series of cryptocurrency transactions identified as suspicious by the National Crime Agency.
