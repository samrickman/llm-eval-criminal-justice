Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/27854  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. Fairfax  \nFiled: 18 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006. Specifically, he has been convicted on two counts of preparing acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct in question unfolded over a period beginning late 2022 and culminating in his arrest on 15 January 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was first taken into custody at 07:13 on that January morning, following the execution of a series of search warrants granted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. These were carried out by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, with support from forensic digital officers and local constabulary units. The warrant authorised search of his residential address in the Moseley district and the seizure of multiple digital devices believed to be key in evidencing the preparatory acts alleged. The court notes the considerable logistical complexity attendant on the operation, which involved coordination between the CT Policing intelligence division and the National Cyber Crime Unit.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThis arrest followed a lengthened period of joint investigative activity, stretching back over twelve months. Intelligence gathering utilised conventional surveillance techniques alongside emerging capabilities such as network traffic analysis, pattern-of-life mapping using anonymised telecommunications data, and advanced cryptanalysis executed by the National Technical Assistance Centre. The court observes here that such a multilateral operation represents a significant commitment of both human and financial resources, underscoring the concern posed by the defendant's activities. It is regrettable that these resources are diverted from a gamut of other pressing operational priorities, including ongoing investigations into organised crime and violent offences affecting the West Midlands and surrounding regions.  \n\nIn the course of pre-trial proceedings, several adjournments resulted from challenges relating to the defendant’s Legal Aid representation. The court reiterates its frustration with the frequent administrative delays surrounding authorisation for expert reports—delays that invariably result in protracted case timetables and place additional burdens on all parties, including victims and court staff alike. Mr H's defence team ultimately secured authorisation to instruct independent forensic psychiatric and cyber-technical experts, though the process involved considerable correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency, marked by delayed responses and intermittent refusals of funding that, on balance, served no useful purpose but to promote procedural delay.  \n\nThe court is conscious of the broader pressures facing the Probation Service and allied agencies tasked with producing pre-sentence reports in terrorism cases. Staffing shortages and increasingly complex risk assessment frameworks have led to considerable backlogs, further compounded by the need to liaison extensively with security services and mental health professionals whose availability is similarly restricted. The institution of Better Case Management (BCM) protocols in Crown Courts over the past five years has sought to mitigate some of these organisational pressures by streamlining case progression and establishing clearer administrative lines. Though imperfect, the system offers a tentative framework for the more coherent handling of cases such as this.  \n\nAn earlier Channel referral in relation to the defendant—initiated in October 2020 by a university advisor due to expressions of extremist sympathies in written coursework—did not yield long-term engagement or formally closed only after six months of intermittent contact. The court accepts that no evidential threshold for further intervention was then met and that the Channel panel’s disability to foresee this trajectory reflects not negligence but the inherent uncertainty in counter-radicalisation work. Those who argue otherwise must contend with the wide variety of ideological expressions and the often opaque indicators of true risk.  \n\nMuch has been said of late pleas in terrorism cases. It is a regrettable and increasing phenomenon among defendants facing such serious charges to defer guilty pleas to the cusp of trial or, as here, moments before the sentence hearing. The Crown is entitled—and indeed obliged—to invite the court to discount credit afforded for such pleas given their limited utility in conserving police and prosecutorial resources or sparing witnesses the rigours of testimony. The Court of Appeal in the leading authorities R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 and R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440 made clear that timing and motivation are critical factors in this assessment. The present case conforms to that pattern of delay and partial disclosure.  \n\nThe court acknowledges the defence's submission that Mr H’s guilty pleas represent some acceptance of responsibility; however, the backdrop of extensive preparation for trial, considerable expert evidence, and numerous witness statements prior to plea tempers this proposition. The sentencing principle of proportionality and the need to foster early cooperation in terrorism proceedings necessarily guide the court to restrict any discount in sentencing accordingly.  \n\nIt must be observed, as an aside of procedural note, that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of defence funding in this case manifested bureaucratic inertia which increasingly undermines the integrity of fair trial rights. The court places on record its appreciation for counsel instructed for the defence—Mr Oswald Chivers, who has argued with professional acumen despite the constraints imposed by underfunding and administrative wrangling. Equally, thanks are due to Ms Harriet Llewellyn of counsel for the Crown, whose submissions were clear, comprehensive, and rooted firmly in the applicable jurisprudence and statutory framework.  \n\nThe defendants’ case suffered a further delay when an interpreter appointment, arranged for a related ancillary hearing set for 4 March 2025, was postponed following a no-show of the assigned linguist. While such occurrences are rare, they continue to reflect the challenges of securing specialist court support services under stretched public sector budgets.  \n\nTurning to matters of evidence, digital forensic examination disclosed an array of encrypted communications, cryptographically hidden logs, and data transfer attempts to overseas servers known to be associated with proscribed groups. The painstaking reconstruction of these artefacts, extending over a period of some eight months, aptly demonstrates the resource-intensive nature of digital counter-terror investigations today. The court acknowledges the outstanding commitment of personnel at the Southern Cyber Crime Unit who undertook detailed device imaging and network packet inspection under complex operational conditions.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe defendant maintained a personal blog, initially featuring benign content related to urban gardening and amateur radio but later increasingly populated by incendiary rhetoric and references to proscribed ideological material. The court notes the painstaking linguistic analysis undertaken by the Office for Security Analysis, which characterised the defendant’s writings as echoing narratives found in the literature of banned groups under schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These findings are hardly surprising given the associate communications recovered and the defendant’s admitted visits to online forums with known extremist leanings.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nExpert evidence disclosed the presence of manuals on explosive device fabrication concealed within encrypted containers named “Project Ironclad.” Defence submissions advanced that some files constituted ‘research’ on historical ordnance for hobbyist re-enactment, yet this is plainly untenable in light of expert testimony confirming the presence of contemporary, fully functional schematics. The court finds that the possession of such material can only serve a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe court is reminded, albeit tangentially, of the longstanding principles addressed in the preamble to the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines (2023) which emphasize that intent and preparation for mass harm must be punished proportionately, balancing public protection with rehabilitation prospects. The defendant, while able to benefit from educational opportunities prior to offending, elected an alternative path in pursuit of ideological extremism.  \n\nThe possession of an illicit blade in a public park, dating to over a year prior and unrelated to the charges of terrorism, was clarified as the act of an acquaintance of the defendant during a separate incident. No physical evidence links Mr H to that possession, which the defence disavowed as irrelevant yet volunteered for completeness.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe Court also had regard to the defendant’s travel history in late 2023 and early 2024. Documented airline data reveals a trip to Brussels ostensibly for business purposes; however, intelligence reports correlated Mr H’s presence with a meeting of individuals later convicted for conspiracies to supply explosives in multiple member states. Defence suggested coincidence, but the court finds such a characterization implausible.  \n\nSeparately, the defendant’s communications history includes numerous contacts with an individual arrested in connection with unrelated cyber-fraud offences in the South East. While co-defendant pleas were entered in that case, the court notes no evidence suggesting Mr H’s involvement. Such linkages exemplify the complex webs investigative authorities must navigate to isolate genuine threat actors amid a tangled milieu of legitimate and illicit actors.  \n\nThe court notes the production of a comprehensive psychiatric report by Dr Samuel Endicott, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who examined Mr H over the course of three sessions undertaken in May 2025. Dr Endicott’s report, thorough and professional in form, diagnoses a personality disorder with traits conducive to inflexibility, zealousness, and unyielding ideological convictions but denies the presence of psychotic illness or diminished responsibility.  \n\nThe report assigns a high risk of serious harm based on identified markers including cognitive rigidity, emotional detachment, and active dissemination of extremist material online. These findings echo prior observations in cases such as R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, where the Court of Appeal upheld the need to balance treatment considerations with public protection imperatives even in the presence of psychiatric pathology.  \n\nThe defendant’s letter to the court, politely written with legible handwriting and formatted neatly, expresses regret that his belief system led him “down a mistaken path.” It acknowledges the harm caused but stops short of a full apology or recognition of the scale of potential consequences.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nNotably, the court was informed of a cryptocurrency transaction totalling £3,200 from an account linked to the defendant towards a now-defunct vendor blacklisted for offering chemical precursors commonly used in explosive manufacture. Such transactions illustrate the expanding challenge posed by digital financial instruments in terrorist financing, a challenge which law enforcement agencies grapple with through initiatives such as Project STRIKE.  \n\nThe court also reviewed surveillance records of a brief nocturnal visit Mr H made in November 2024 to a disused industrial estate on the outskirts of Coventry. This location was identified in a separate investigation involving illegal waste dumping by criminal enterprises. While that investigation remains ongoing and unrelated to the defendant, the coincidence highlights the array of public order challenges faced by local authorities simultaneously.  \n\nCounter-terrorism operations involve cooperation with multiple agencies, including regional fire and rescue units, which bring valuable expertise—especially in incidents involving the threat of explosives or incendiaries. An illustrative example occurred in 2023 when a coordinated response averted extensive harm in a separate incident involving arson at a commercial warehouse in Droitwich. Such background is relevant, albeit indirectly, in that they set the bar for the level of readiness and coordination courts expect in cases involving potential mass harm.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to the defendant’s personal circumstances. Mr H, now 30 years old, holds a degree in applied computer engineering obtained from a Midlands university. His employment history reflects a number of short-term contracts, including a stint as a network systems analyst terminated following concerns over his online activity. Character references from former employers emphasise his technical competence and professionalism but also remark on a noticeable change in demeanour commencing mid-2022.  \n\nLetters of support were submitted by a local environmental conservation group citing Mr H’s volunteer efforts with community clean-up initiatives. While such engagement reflects positively on his capacity for pro-social behaviour, it nevertheless remains peripheral to the gravity of his offending conduct. Indeed, the court notes authority suggesting that civic contributions, while laudable, do not diminish culpability in cases of serious ideological extremism.  \n\nThe court has carefully considered the oral and written submissions of defence counsel, Mr Oswald Chivers, who advanced the proposition that the defendant is amenable to rehabilitation through engagement with structured de-radicalisation and cognitive behavioural programmes. While the court readily supports access to such interventions where effective, it must balance optimism with realism given the historically high attrition rates in this cohort and the demonstrable risk posed absent sustained, intensive monitoring.  \n\nThe Probation Service has indicated that a pre-sentence report will address the viability of extended custodial supervision accompanied by statutory licence conditions encompassing electronic monitoring, internet filtering, and mandatory psychological treatment. This comprehensive strategy is consistent with prevailing best practice frameworks and underscores the importance of multi-agency co-operation across custodial and community phases.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nIn conclusion, the court finds this to be a case exemplifying the utmost seriousness of terrorism preparatory offences. Aggravating features include the sophistication of planning, use of encryption and cryptocurrencies to evade detection, and the readiness to associate with known extremist networks. Mitigation is scant and includes only the absence of previous convictions and late guilty pleas which, as noted, attract limited credit.  \n\nIt is regrettable, but necessary, that a custodial sentence of significant length must be contemplated to reflect the gravity of offending and to deter others. The court will therefore direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report which must include detailed risk assessment, feasibility of high-restriction custodial options, and exploration of suitable rehabilitative pathways including de-radicalisation programmes accredited under the National Counter Terrorism Strategy.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 4 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration in due course.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.

The court finds that the possession of such material can only serve a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism.  \n\nThe defendant was found with notes for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including No More Greys hair bleach and Tesco brand nail varnish remover.  \n\nThe court is reminded, albeit tangentially, of the longstanding principles addressed in the preamble to the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines (2023) which emphasize that intent and preparation for mass harm must be punished proportionately, balancing public protection with rehabilitation prospects.
