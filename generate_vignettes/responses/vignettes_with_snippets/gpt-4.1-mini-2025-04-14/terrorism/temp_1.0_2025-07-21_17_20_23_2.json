Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/26891  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. F. CARRINGTON  \nFiled: 14 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this Court for sentence on charges involving one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending spans a period from March 2023 until his arrest earlier this year in January 2025.  \n\nMr H was arrested on the 10th of January 2025 at his residence in the Ashley Down district of Bristol, following execution of a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The warrant was issued upon receipt of intelligence from the Security Service and corroborated signals intelligence revealing communications between the defendant and known extremist individuals operating overseas. Searches resulted in the seizure of multiple electronic devices, including encrypted mobile telephones and networked storage servers.\n\nPrior to reaching this court, the matter has traversed a procedural course characterised by successive case management hearings, pre-trial applications, disclosure regimes subject to the constraints of national security considerations, and compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules. A plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 22 July 2025, where the defendant initially pleaded not guilty. It was not until the second day of trial on 8 September 2025 that he altered his pleas to guilty on both counts. This delay must be considered when assessing the extent of credit for early admission.\n\nThe Court would observe, to place matters in context, that the increasing complexity and volume of disclosure material in cases involving terrorism-related offences impose notable demands on defence representation. In particular, the Legal Aid Agency’s funding ceiling for preparation in such cases remains a concern for practitioners, often requiring diligent and creative case management to ensure fairness in representation under constrained financial resources.  \n\nThe defence solicitor, Mr Adam Browne of Bristol Criminal Chambers, has navigated these challenges with notable professionalism despite late authorisation for funding specialist independent expert reports — a delay attributable to bureaucratic backlogs within the Legal Aid framework. These delays have added strain not only on counsel but also on Mr H, whose preparation time was truncated as a consequence.\n\nThe Crown has been represented throughout by Ms Fleur Davies KC, whose clear and measured submissions have advanced the prosecution case with rigour but devoid of unnecessary rhetoric. The Court thanks counsel for their diligent and judicious advocacy, an aspect that has greatly assisted the Court in managing the procedural and substantive complexities of this trial.\n\nIt is, regrettably, a familiar feature in modern terrorism litigation that defendants may maintain a position of denial until the evidence against them becomes overwhelming. This trend depletes scarce court and prosecutorial resources and prolongs the anxiety of those adversely affected. It was accordingly a regret that Mr H’s plea was entered as late as it was, affording only a modest discount from sentence in recognition of this belated acceptance of responsibility.\n\nThe Court also acknowledges the impact of these proceedings on victims and the wider community, who have undergone an extended period of uncertainty and fear. The psychological harm consequent upon exposure to even the planning of indiscriminate acts of serious harm cannot be overstated. Agencies providing victim support services have performed admirably under the pressure, persevering in outreach even as cases such as this underscore the ongoing threat posed by ideological extremism.\n\nMr H’s case was the subject of a Channel referral in November 2021 following concerns raised by a university lecturer about the defendant’s assignment content, which included troubling references to violent political extremism. The panel that convened concluded that, while intervention was warranted, the defendant remained on the cusp of radicalisation, and thus offered mentoring and psychological support through the regional Prevent programme. Engagement was intermittent.  \n\nA further multi-agency risk assessment under MAPPA Category 3 jurisdiction was arranged shortly after his arrest, encompassing Probation, Counter Terrorism Policing, and NHS forensic psychiatric services, with the aim of establishing a structured management plan for the period following any custodial sentence.\n\nThe circumstances of Mr H’s employment were considered as part of mitigation submissions. He was employed until April 2023 as a junior systems analyst at a regional IT firm in Bristol, leaving amid disciplinary proceedings related to his repeated unauthorized access to encrypted communication platforms on work devices. His manager’s reference described him as “reserved, efficient, yet increasingly withdrawn,” noting a deteriorating relationship with colleagues in the months prior to his resignation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nIt is important to emphasise the context of the historical development of the relevant statutory provisions applying in this case. The Terrorism Act 2006 was enacted in response to a national imperative to strengthen powers to intervene at the preparatory stages of terrorism risk, closing gaps previously identified in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and subsequent jurisprudence. The legislative intent remains, as articulated in the Act’s preamble, to enhance the capacity of law enforcement and the judiciary alike to protect the public from the scourge of ideological violence.  \n\nThe Court recognises that the application of this legislation must be carefully calibrated to ensure it does not unnecessarily infringe upon civil liberties, a balance repeatedly highlighted in judicial review cases such as R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe digital evidence brought before the Court is of significant volume and complexity. Forensic examination uncovered multiple encrypted data containers, some of which contained files under innocuously named directories purporting “Outdoor Plans” and “Camping Gear Records.” Expert testimony confirmed that these folders functioned as fronts for archives containing bomb-making instructions, tactical reconnaissance photographs, and schematics of targeted locations.\n\nIt is noteworthy that extensive communications were intercepted on encrypted peer-to-peer platforms known for facilitating the exchange of illicit materials among extremist networks. This case highlights the ongoing technological arms race between law enforcement forensic capabilities and deliberate subversion by offenders employing anonymising tools and end-to-end encryption.  \n\nMr H’s usage of such platforms was intensive, frequently engaging in operational security protocols including use of VPNs and ephemeral messaging apps, thereby complicating investigative efforts.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe Court will not overlook the fact that the preparation of digital evidence in such cases can entail vast resource commitments. Specialist analysts often work months to reconstruct fragmented or deleted material, employing techniques which, while commonplace within cybercrime units, nevertheless represent a herculean task given the backlog of cases across the country.\n\nIt was also adjunct to note that the Midsomer South Police’s cyber forensics division, engaged in a parallel investigation of unrelated offences involving co-defendants linked only collaterally to Mr H, reported a spate of ransomware attacks occluding their work. This serves only as an illustration of the operational pressures on contemporary police departments.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe Court is mindful, too, of cases where the legitimacy of the means of evidence gathering has come under scrutiny and at times been challenged in this jurisdiction. Particular care was taken in this case to ensure that all warrants were obtained pursuant to strict statutory requirements and that disclosure was managed appropriately, subject to the safeguards enshrined in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nA large part of the hearing was concerned with the admissibility of intercepted electronic communications. The Court heard detailed argument on the application of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and associated codes of practice, ultimately ruling the evidence admissible.\n\nTo provide some historical note of relevance, per R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, caution is required where evidence arises from covert surveillance, particularly in cases involving ongoing family protections or vulnerability. That decision, albeit materially distinct in facts, serves as a precedent emphasizing the proportionality and legality of surveillance.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nMr H’s personal circumstances were the subject of a comprehensive pre-sentence report prepared by the National Probation Service. The author, Mr John Evans, reflects upon Mr H’s upbringing in a working-class family in Bristol, noting poor educational attainment in earlier years and instances of adolescent behavioural difficulties, including a police referral for disorderly conduct at age 17.\n\nThere is mention within the report of Mr H’s repeated periods of unemployment from 2020 onwards juxtaposed with intermittent vocational retraining attempts, most notably completion of a Level 3 qualification in computer systems management in 2021.\n\nLetters received from the East Bristol Youth Mentoring Project were tendered on behalf of the defendant, portraying him as a cooperative but frequently isolated individual, struggling against a tide of social disengagement. The Court is grateful for such material but cautions that commendation for community participation or contrition does not outweigh the gravity of the offences committed.  \n\nThe defendant’s sister, Ms Helena Morris, submitted a detailed personal statement asserting that her brother had begun to “withdraw from the family and express increasingly radical views” following a period of personal grief in late 2022 after the death of their father. Her statement was given significant but careful consideration.\n\nIn relation to mental health, a report was commissioned from Dr Arjun Bhatt, consultant forensic psychiatrist. Dr Bhatt observes that while Mr H shows evidence of significant cognitive rigidity and a heightened susceptibility to ideological influence, he does not satisfy diagnostic criteria for any major psychiatric disorder. The Court accepts this clinical opinion and notes the associated risks it identifies.\n\nFurthermore, it is regrettable to comment on the stretched capacity of mental health services—particularly forensic liaison and diversion schemes—which often find themselves unable to deliver consistent monitoring or intervention for defendants like Mr H pending sentencing and allocation to appropriate institutions. This shortfall constitutes a systemic vulnerability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nThe Court heard expert evidence concerning financial transactions. Following a tracing exercise by a forensic accountant instructed by the Crown, it was established that Mr H participated in cryptocurrency transfers amounting to several thousand pounds in value over a period coinciding with the preparatory offence conduct.\n\nThe payments were made using privacy-focused virtual currencies and routed through tumbling services designed to mask the origin and destination of funds. These transactions, directed to vendors known for illicit trade in dual-use items, underscore the intersection of technological innovation and criminal adaptability.\n\nThis Court takes the opportunity to reiterate its concern about the difficulties faced by enforcement agencies in keeping pace with novel financial instruments exploited for extremist purposes.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning once again to the defendant’s background, it is relevant to note that the defendant previously held no convictions of any substance. However, family correspondence reveals a history of turbulent domestic relations and episodes of transient homelessness, which resistance to support from social services did little to alleviate.\n\nMr H’s educational achievements, notably a diploma in computer engineering and partial completion of a bachelor’s degree, demonstrate intellectual capacity which renders the subsequent descent into extremist conduct all the more concerning.\n\nSupporting letters from a local community centre detail Mr H’s involvement in volunteer IT training workshops prior to 2023 — an involvement which had waned in the months preceding his arrest.\n\nEqually, there is evidence of a troubled relationship with his housing provider. Mr H was subject to a community noise abatement notice following complaints from neighbours — unrelated to this offending — reflecting a pattern of antisocial behaviour constrained to his residential context.\n\nA detailed probation officer’s assessment describes the resources available post-custody as limited and highlights the long-standing issue of overcrowding within Approved Premises in the Bristol and surrounding areas, which complicates resettlement planning.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe Court has considered the Sentencing Council’s guideline on terrorism offences issued in 2023, which sets out factors relevant to culpability and harm. Mr H’s actions represent a high level of planning and a clear intent to cause indiscriminate serious harm. Aggravating features include the use of encrypted communications to evade detection, the sophistication of his technical skills employed in planning, and the ideological motivation demonstrated.\n\nMitigating features are few, limited primarily to the absence of previous convictions and the educational and vocational achievements noted, as well as some belated cooperation manifested by entry of guilty pleas, albeit late.\n\nThe Court will direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report, with particular attention to risk assessment, the availability of appropriate custodial interventions focusing on disengagement from extremist ideology, and psychological management options.\n\nProbation should also explore possible pathways for post-release supervision incorporating digital monitoring, electronic curfews, and mandatory participation in deradicalisation programmes such as the Structured Professional Judgment (SPJ) framework.\n\nIt is appropriate that this Court emphasises the paramount importance of public protection. The sentencing must reflect the seriousness of the offences, deterrence, and the need to reinforce community safety. At the same time, the Court recognises the value of rehabilitation and the importance of structured, robust intervention frameworks to minimise recidivism.\n\nThe defendant is now advised of the Court’s intention to adjourn sentencing until receipt of the full pre-sentence report. This will allow all parties the opportunity to consider and respond to its findings and to make any further representations.\n\nThis Court records its thanks to counsel for their professional conduct throughout. Particular credit is due to Ms Davies KC for the Crown and Mr Browne for the defence, whose submissions have assisted the Court in navigating a matter of considerable complexity and sensitivity.\n\nIn closing, it is instructive to recall that the criminal justice system operates within the wider social context of escalating digital threats and ideological extremism. Agencies across policing, social services, and health face enchained challenges from resource constraints, technological innovation, and evolving threat profiles. This case exemplifies the necessity of multi-agency cooperation, careful judicial management, and the resolute application of law.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are made this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. These proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in conformity with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Mr H is advised of his right to appeal sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/26891  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. F.
