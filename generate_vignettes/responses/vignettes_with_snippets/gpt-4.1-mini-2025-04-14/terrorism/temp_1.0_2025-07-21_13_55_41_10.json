Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29921  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. CAVENDISH  \nFiled: 16 October 2025  \n\nMr Mr H appears before this court today for sentence following his conviction on two counts relating to terrorism offences under the Terrorism Act 2006. The first count concerns engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts, contrary to section 5(1)(a), while the second count concerns possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is said to span from March 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in late January 2025.\n\nThe matter has proceeded through various procedural stages, including an initial hearing on 7 February 2025, a plea and case management hearing on 3 April 2025, and a trial over five days in September 2025, concluding with the jury returning a unanimous verdict on 8 October 2025. The trial itself was notable for an extensive volume of documentary exhibits and the evidence of cyber forensic experts, counter-terrorism police officers, and specialist psychologists.\n\nAt the outset, it is incumbent upon the court to acknowledge the extraordinary diligence and professionalism exhibited by all parties throughout what has been a complex and resource-intensive prosecution. Oral submissions were presented cogently by counsel on both sides, and the Crown’s case was marked by a meticulous presentation of digital and physical evidence. Defence counsel’s efforts to vindicate their client were diligent and well-informed, notwithstanding the gravity of the charges and the weight of the evidence presented.\n\nThe defendant was initially arrested at 04:45 on 22 January 2025 pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The operation to execute the warrant was conducted by the South West Counter Terrorism Unit in conjunction with the National Cyber Crime Centre (NCCC). Preceding the arrest, the defendant’s encrypted messaging accounts had been subjected to prolonged surveillance and decryption attempts facilitated by the Assistance Centre for Communications Surveillance. The interception data indicated communications with members of a proscribed organisation overseas, including instruction on assembling improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and illicit acquisition of tactical materials.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe investigation, codenamed Operation STONERIDGE, leveraged an array of technical measures that included deep packet inspection, network traffic analysis, and remote extraction of digital artefacts from devices subsequently seized during the arrest. The multi-agency cooperation underpinning Operation STONERIDGE involved liaison with international partners under the auspices of the London Assistance Network, highlighting the transnational dimensions of contemporary terrorist threats.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that the operational resources directed to this case—while reflective of necessary counter-terrorism vigilance—draw heavily upon already stretched budgets within policing and security services. This dynamic underscores recurring challenges highlighted in the last comprehensive report on National Security Funding (Home Office, 2024), which emphasised the growing demand for sophisticated cyber capability amid constrained recruitment.\n\nMeanwhile, the case experienced some procedural adjournments, one occasion being the adjournment of the scheduled sentencing hearing on 24 September 2025 due to outstanding psychiatric reports. Of note, this delay, while regrettable for all concerned, allowed pertinent risk assessments to be undertaken comprehensively, reflecting the court’s commitment to proportionate mitigation where justified. Such reports included a full risk analysis from the Avon and Somerset NHS Forensic Psychiatry Division, led by Dr Mark Henderson MRCPsych.\n\nThe court is mindful of similar cases precedent where psychiatric evaluation has materially influenced sentencing outcomes. In R v. Donnelly [2017] EWCA Crim 1245, the Court of Appeal underscored the importance of nuanced psychiatric input where ideological fixation intersects with mental disorder, albeit affirming that such diagnosis does not necessarily absolve responsibility for acts of terrorism.\n\nThe defendant’s previously unremarkable criminal record offers limited mitigation in the present context. Notably, in 2018, he was cautioned for minor criminal damage to a municipal noticeboard. This offence, while trivial in comparison to present charges, was raised during enquiry into his propensity for risk-taking behaviour. Additionally, a 2016 fixed penalty notice for cycling on a pedestrianised shopping street was also noted in his chronology, with no further incidents of traffic offences recorded. Such minor transgressions, commonplace among young adults, afford only marginal insight into the defendant’s radicalisation trajectory.\n\nExperience has shown, however, that indictments for relatively minor offences among some radicalised individuals can precede or coincide with the emergence of more serious ideological crimes. The court must therefore avoid simplistic dichotomies between youthful misbehaviour and criminal intent when assessing culpability.\n\nTypos in the defendant’s digital communication logs corroborated the emergent profile gleaned from investigators. Among the materials was an apparent interest in amateur astronomy and origami, as documented across various personal social media accounts. These benign hobbies, while not directly related to the offences charged, were adduced during mitigation submissions in an effort to depict Mr H as a multifaceted individual capable of normal societal engagement.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe Crown’s reliance on expert linguistic analysis was central to establishing the defendant’s ideological commitment. This analysis referenced the work of Professor Helena Marques of the University of Bristol’s Centre for Extremism Studies, who identified language patterns in the defendant’s encrypted communications paralleling those in propaganda disseminated by banned organisations. Professor Marques’s methodology, employing both quantitative corpus analysis and qualitative thematic coding, underlines the growing role of digital humanities methodologies in counter-extremism interventions.\n\nFurther, the forensic examination revealed the defendant’s possession of manuals detailing the construction of improvised incendiary devices and tactics for evading digital surveillance. These materials, found stored on encrypted hardware devices concealed in a false compartment of his bedroom wardrobe, included a mixture of open-source literature reprinted by ideological sympathisers abroad.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nDuring trial, extensive veterinary neuropsychological testimony was tendered to assist the jury in understanding the implications of radical ideology upon cognitive processing, though such expertise was ultimately excluded on the basis that it did not meet the threshold for admissibility under the Criminal Evidence Act 2021. Nevertheless, the defendant’s psychological profile, elaborated at length in subsequent case management hearings, reflects elevated levels of cognitive rigidity and a marked tendency towards black-and-white thinking, factors acknowledged by Dr Henderson in his psychiatric evaluation.\n\nIt was advanced on behalf of Mr H that his radicalisation had origins in experiences of social alienation and economic precarity, themes commonly noted among individuals vulnerable to extremist recruitment. While socio-economic marginalisation is neither a sufficient nor necessary cause of terrorism, it remains an important contextual factor that agencies must consider in both prevention and rehabilitation settings.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe notion that online platforms serve as incubators for radical ideology is well-established. The defendant’s substantial digital footprint featured numerous postings on darknet forums dedicated to grievances concerning international conflicts and perceived western policy injustices. Despite the ubiquity of such platforms, involvement with encrypted communication services, and use of layered anonymity software such as Tor and VPNs, represent a significant escalation from casual political commentary to operational planning.\n\nThe court observes, tangentially, that similar digital behavioural patterns were recorded in the investigation of Mr Adam Bentham (R v Bentham [2023] EWCA Crim 1332), who was convicted of multiple offences relating to the dissemination of terrorist material and possession of firearms. While that case shares some superficial commonalities with the present matter, it is noted that the defendant here does not face charges concerning weapons possession, nor was there evidence of co-conspirators directly linked.\n\nAttention is also drawn to the often overlooked operational burden that such digitally enabled investigations impose on law enforcement. The South West Cyber Crime Unit reported a backlog of over 300 live examinations, many involving encrypted devices, illustrating the systemic challenge to timely and efficient case progression.\n\nPre-custody, the defendant lived in a shared flat in Easton, Bristol, which has an established record of community cohesion initiatives, including programs funded by the Home Office’s Building Safe Communities Fund. Residents reported varying degrees of awareness about Mr H’s behaviour, with some neighbours testifying to his reserved demeanour and lack of overt political engagement.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nIn early 2024, Mr H undertook travel to Eastern Europe, ostensibly for academic purposes linked to a university exchange program in renewable energy engineering. Counter-terrorism authorities note, however, that his itinerary also included time in Bratislava and Budapest, locations that have, in recent years, been scrutinised for extremist networking activities. Such foreign travel does not, ipso facto, indicate criminal intent; nonetheless, the combination of travel, concealed communications, and material possession presents a coherent pattern suggestive of preparatory offence.\n\nThe court regrets the necessity of reflecting on the procedural history of this case, which evidences significant delays attributable, in part, to the necessity of consulting a foreign jurisdiction’s courts to secure documents originating from embassy archives. Moreover, legal aid funding was intermittently refused and reinstated, resulting in rescheduling of key hearings. Counsel for the defence, Mr J. Aldridge QC, deserves commendation for adeptly navigating these complexities with steadfast advocacy under challenging circumstances.\n\nOf note, a number of letters of support were submitted by community organisations, including the Bristol Youth Engagement Forum and the Easton Food Bank, neither of which specialises in counter-extremism yet both of which seek to promote social inclusion and engagement with vulnerable persons. These letters emphasise the defendant’s intermittent participation in community gardening projects and literacy workshops, painting a portrait of an individual with threads of social connection amidst isolation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial investigation uncovered cryptocurrency transactions amounting to approximately £3,400 across various wallets associated via metadata to the defendant. These transactions included at least one transfer to a vendor offering dual-use chemicals, capable of application both in legitimate industrial processes and potential explosive manufacture. While possession and transfer of such materials is not inherently unlawful, in the conjoined context of intent and ancillary preparation, they constitute significant aggravating features.\n\nThe court finds it necessary to comment on the rise of cryptocurrency in the financing of illicit activity, as detailed in the Home Office report on Digital Crime in 2025. While cryptocurrency affords beneficial innovation, including financial inclusivity, it equally represents a challenging vector for concealing criminal transactions due to its pseudonymous character and the complexity of tracing coin movement across multiple mixers.\n\nThe defendant’s recorded visits to the Avonmouth docks, though brief and seemingly recreational per CCTV footage from late 2024, were nonetheless the subject of close examination by naval security units. The court observes that historic incidents of smuggling and illicit material transit in this area remain an ongoing concern, necessitating vigilance from authorities.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nRegarding Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is aged 30, with a first-class undergraduate degree and a subsequent master’s level qualification in environmental engineering from a respected regional university. His employment history includes a three-year tenure at a solar panel manufacturing plant prior to his resignation in late 2023. Letters from former supervisors describe his work ethic positively yet note growing absenteeism and disengagement in the months prior to his departure.\n\nThe defendant’s family submitted a joint letter expressing profound regret and surprise at his behaviour, citing strained relations occasioned by his increasing withdrawal and private study habits. Despite these tensions, family members expressed hope for rehabilitation and a return to a positive community role. These observations, while not diminishing accountability, provide some insight into the defendant’s relational environment.\n\nThe court also records appreciation for the efforts of the local Probation Service, which faces severe staffing shortages nationally. Current vacancy estimates for qualified Probation Officers stand at around 20%, exacerbated by budgetary constraints—factors which constitute a regrettable background to the supervision of complex offenders such as Mr H.\n\nThe psychiatric report authored by Dr Henderson highlighted the absence of formal psychotic symptoms but drew attention to a pattern of personality features consistent with rigid ideological adherence and difficulty managing cognitive dissonance. Of particular note was the diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, a not uncommon response to personal and social dislocation. The report assesses a high risk of reoffending without intensive and sustained intervention.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nFinally, counsel for the defence advocated for the consideration of structured desistance interventions, including the De-radicalisation and Rehabilitation Support Programme sponsored by the Ministry of Justice. While such programmes have demonstrable utility for some offenders, challenges persist regarding voluntary engagement, retention rates, and measuring long-term behavioural change. The court instructs that any pre-sentence report consider these factors alongside bespoke risk management proposals.\n\nThe Crown submits that the scale, planning, and preparedness evince a high degree of culpability, advancing the argument for a custodial sentence of significant length consistent with deterrence and public protection principles. The defence contends mitigation grounded in personal circumstances, late guilty pleas, and the potential for rehabilitation.\n\nThe court has considered the Sentencing Council’s Guideline for Terrorism Offences, the relevant statutory provisions, and applicable case law, including R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 411.\n\nIt remains the court’s duty to ensure that the sentence imposed is both just and proportionate, reflecting the seriousness of the crime and the legitimate interests of security and rehabilitation.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 16 October 2025, in Court 2 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed in conformity with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and forthcoming sentence will be communicated to the appropriate registries and authorities.\n\nSentencing is adjourned to permit the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing all issues raised, including psychological risk, amenability to intervention, and community safety considerations.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
