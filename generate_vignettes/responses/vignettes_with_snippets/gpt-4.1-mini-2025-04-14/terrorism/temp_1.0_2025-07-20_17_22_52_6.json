Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/24963  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge A. M. FAIRBANK  \nFiled: 29 September 2025\n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence on multiple counts engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism specified under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, as well as possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct the subject of these charges spans a period from September 2022 until his arrest in March 2025.\n\nIt bears recording at the outset that this court sits within a complex judicial framework in which terrorism offences are triaged and prosecuted with utmost gravity, reflecting the sustained threat to national security and the safety of the public. The Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division, working in concert with specialised units such as Counter Terrorism Policing South West, have marshalled considerable resources both investigative and evidential to bring this prosecution.\n\nThe defendant was arrested early morning on 17 March 2025 pursuant to warrants executed at his residential premises in the Redcliffe area of Bristol. These warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 following an intelligence-led operation incorporating signals interception, human intelligence sources, and covert surveillance. The defendant was found in possession of several electronic devices, including a encrypted mobile telephone and a laptop computer. The devices were subject to prolonged forensic examination by the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), which formed a pivotal evidential strand in the Crown’s case.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe investigation which culminated in the defendant’s arrest was intensive and prolonged, spanning approximately eighteen months. The court is fully apprised of the resource demands placed on the police and ancillary agencies in tackling modern extremist threats. It may be noted, as a matter of procedural interest, that the investigation included the use of advanced decryption technology and specialist linguistic analysis to interpret coded communications. These technologies, though highly effective, require extensive human expertise to apply and interpret. Resource constraints within such units are well-documented, especially given competing demands from organised crime, serious violence, and cyber-enabled fraud investigations.\n\nTurning to the procedural history of this matter, an initial hearing was scheduled on 25 April 2025 but was adjourned due to issues relating to Legal Aid funding for the defendant’s representation. These administrative obstacles are regrettably frequent in cases involving complex digital material and may delay timely case progression. Nonetheless, subsequent hearings proceeded with relative promptness. The plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 18 August 2025. Notwithstanding his initial not guilty pleas, Mr H entered guilty pleas to all counts on the first day of the sentencing hearing.\n\nThe court is mindful of the authorities regarding credit for guilty pleas, particularly in the terrorism context. The dicta in R v. Hobbs [2023] EWCA Crim 341 caution against over-generous reduction when pleas are entered late, especially after significant preparation and evidence disclosure. Such judicial guidance finds practical application in R v. Edgecombe [2024] EWCA Crim 1284, where credit was substantially curtailed due to delayed admission and tactical plea timing, causing additional burdens on the prosecution and victims.\n\nConsideration must accordingly be given to the timing and context of Mr H’s pleas, recognising some concession in mitigation but with limits reflecting these overarching principles. Delayed pleas, entered only after exhaustive evidence presentation and judicial rulings on contested issues, attract markedly less credit than early admissions which spare resources and demonstrate genuine contrition.\n\nIt is useful to situate this case in the background of legislative and sentencing framework evolution. The maximum statutory penalty for the predicate offences under section 5 of the 2006 Act is life imprisonment – a reflection of Parliament’s intent to deter and incapacitate the most dangerous offenders. Furthermore, the Sentencing Council’s guidelines on Terrorism Offences, updated in November 2023, provide an analytical framework evaluating culpability, harm, and aggravating or mitigating factors. The range and complexity of Mr H’s offending conduct place this case firmly at the higher end of the culpability spectrum.\n\nJudicial authorities such as R v. Adeyemi [2021] EWCA Crim 975 and more recently R v. Murray [2024] EWCA Crim 605 underscore the principle that sentences must not only reflect the offence seriousness but also aim to denounce and deter those engaged in ideologically motivated criminal activity. Those judgments confirm that early neutralisation of threat and public protection objectives take precedence over leniency where the degree of planning or participation is substantial.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nAnalysis of the digital materials retrieved from the defendant’s devices reveals a sustained pattern of engagement with proscribed extremist content and communications indicating a regrettable ideological commitment. His online activities included membership in closed forums known for violent exhortation. The sheer volume and technical sophistication of encrypted messaging exchanges required extended analysis by cybercrime specialists, many of whom have provided supporting court statements detailing the forensic processes involved.\n\nIt is appropriate to observe in passing that this evidence was only accessible following effective interagency cooperation and painstaking cross-border liaison, particularly with the authorities of a European state where data storage servers were located. Such bilateral collaboration, though often unheralded, is a cornerstone of contemporary counter-terrorism efforts.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe defendant’s possession of technical documents relating to the manufacture of explosive devices, along with evidence of purchasing precursors and components via dark web marketplaces, points conclusively to preparation rather than mere idle curiosity. Although a substantial weight of material is numerically voluminous, some of the files displayed signs of being only partially accessed or incomplete. The court has considered submissions regarding this, including arguments that partial possession may be less culpable, but established jurisprudence, notably R v. Simons [2020] EWCA Crim 1436, confirms that intent may be inferred from possession when associated conduct and context corroborate preparation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nIn deliberating upon the defendant’s background, it is germane to observe that Mr H has no previous convictions. He was raised in a stable household environment and engaged for several years in part-time employment within the logistics sector. Defence have provided character references highlighting his involvement in amateur radio clubs and attendance at local music festivals. While community engagement of this order generally constitutes a mitigating factor, it must not overshadow the gravity of the conduct now established. The court is similarly acquainted with numerous cases where seemingly ordinary individuals have embraced extreme ideologies, demonstrating the inadequacy of surface indicators alone.\n\nA brief digression is warranted regarding the apparent overburdened state of probation services nationally, exacerbated by funding cuts and recruitment challenges. The strain on offender management and risk assessment staff cannot be underestimated, particularly in complex terrorism cases where multi-agency input is indispensable. It is perhaps unsurprising that the Probation Service report expresses caution regarding post-release supervision, given these institutional difficulties.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe correspondence lodged with the court from various community-based organisations offers glimpses into the defendant’s efforts at sporadic disengagement over the preceding two years. One letter from the Bristol Resilience Project outlines attempts to engage Mr H in cognitive behavioural therapy, psychoeducational interventions, and social support networks aimed at countering radicalisation. These efforts, while commendable for their principled persistence in the face of recalcitrance, were undermined by the defendant’s intermittent cooperation and limited insight into the risks posed by his own conduct.\n\nOf some interest, although tangential, is information about a co-defendant in a related matter who was charged with aggravated burglary at a private residence during a holiday absence. That case, while unrelated to Mr H’s charges, provides an instructive contrast in the challenges of managing multi-accused terrorism-promoting networks and the differing culpabilities therein.\n\nIt should also be recorded that during the investigative phase, a co-accused linked to the same extremist network reportedly assaulted arresting officers with a heavy metal chair following a supermarket affray. Such episodes, whilst collateral to this trial, underscore the volatile milieu within which the present investigation unfolded.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nFinancial investigations recovered cryptocurrency transactions amounting to several thousand pounds linked demonstrably to the defendant’s wallet. These transactions included payments to suppliers offering items capable of dual use in legitimate photography equipment and, as the prosecution submits, improvised explosive device components. The court notes with deep concern the escalation in the use of cryptocurrencies in financing unlawful acts, a point spectrally resonant with the observations in R v. Khalil [2023] EWCA Crim 887 regarding the challenges of tracing and disrupting such monetary flows.\n\nIn a separate but equally demanding operational effort, counter-terrorism surveillance captured footage of Mr H visiting a remote storage facility late at night, where materials consistent with those listed in his encrypted correspondences were observed. The investment of over 120 analyst-hours in stabilising and cross-referencing this footage epitomises the immense human resource commitment terrorism investigations entail, recalling the remarks made by Lord Chief Justice in R v. Weston [2011] EWCA Crim 2109 on the asymmetry between offender expediency and investigative diligence.\n\nThe defendant’s possession of a modest quantity of cannabis resin, recovered during the execution of the search warrant, was explored in the mitigation submissions as evidence of a “relatable youth culture” and purported normality. This court is disinclined to afford solvent any attenuation of the severity of terrorism offending on such grounds.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nTurning to matters of personal character and health, the defendant is 31 years old. His academic record comprises a university diploma in information technology, followed by intermittent employment in warehouse operations. A letter from his former line manager commends his punctuality and technical aptitude but notes a fracturing of workplace relationships coinciding temporally with enhanced scrutiny under Counter Terrorism Policing processes.\n\nAdditional character references from local voluntary sector organisations commend Mr H’s occasional volunteering with elderly home visits. While such benevolent acts are of note, it is the court’s firm position that positive civic contributions should be weighed carefully alongside harmful conduct, not as wholesale exculpatory factors.\n\nPsychiatric assessment supplied by consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Helena Malik diagnosed Mr H with moderate anxiety but no psychosis or personality disorder. Notwithstanding that, the report cautions about Mr H’s demonstrable propensity for rigid ideological reasoning and identifies a sustained high risk of continued extremist involvement absent robust multi-agency supervision. This assessment aligns with contemporary research elucidating the limited efficacy of community-based counter-extremism programmes in certain cases, as discussed in the 2024 Home Office Prevent Strategy Review.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nFinally, the court must address the gravamen of the sentencing exercise. The defendant engaged in a highly organised programme of preparation for acts calculated to cause widespread harm. The sophistication evident in his digital encryption, procurement methods, and operational security elevate his culpability to the highest level envisaged by the Sentencing Council guidelines. Aggravating factors include the intended use of the materials in a location frequented by civilians, the effort to conceal communications, and the continued ideological adherence even after prevent intervention attempts.\n\nThe defendant’s mitigation is limited. There are no previous convictions; educational attainment is unremarkable but present; and the amendment of plea, though late, signifies some acknowledgment of culpability. Given the timing, credit is appropriately restricted to a one-sixth reduction.\n\nThe court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service, with particular attention to viability of extended custodial supervision, potential for cognitive-behavioral programmes tailored to ideological desistance, and the availability of accommodation within high-security approved premises. The report should also address possible licence conditions including curfew, electronic monitoring, and strict exclusion zones to mitigate ongoing risks.\n\nThe court acknowledges liaison between Counter Terrorism Policing, the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), and NHS forensic mental health services regarding post-custodial management. While these agencies operate under considerable resource restriction, their collaboration remains vital.\n\nBefore drawing these remarks to a close, it would be remiss not to express the court’s respect for the professionalism of all involved. Special mention is due to the prosecuting counsel, Ms Eleanor Draper, for her clarity and meticulously prepared submissions, and to Mr Oliver Kemp, instructed by Legal Aid, for his diligent representation despite procedural delays in funding approvals that unfortunately impeded preliminary expert instructions.\n\nThe court also thanks the court administrative staff and security personnel at Bristol Crown Court, whose composure and efficiency materially contribute to the dignity and orderly conduct of proceedings, especially given recent refurbishment of the court facilities which entailed temporary logistical disruption.\n\nThe defendant is reminded of his right to appeal sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of the formal sentence being imposed.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 29 September 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded and the transcript authorised in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence shall be distributed to the appropriate custodial and supervisory authorities.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
