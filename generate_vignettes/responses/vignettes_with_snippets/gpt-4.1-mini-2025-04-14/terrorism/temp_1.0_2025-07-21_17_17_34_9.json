Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/27941  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. E. MORGAN  \nFiled: 15 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on a count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences are said to span the period from March 2023 until his arrest on 12 January 2025.\n\nThe defendant was first arrested at approximately 04:45 hours on the stated date following the execution of a warrant by the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit (CTUWMC). This warrant had been granted under section 43B of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, as amended by the Terrorism Act 2000. The investigation that preceded this arrest was multifaceted and involved cooperation between regional forces, the National Crime Agency, and elements of the Security Service. At the point of arrest, officers seized a desktop computer, a number of encrypted external hard drives, several USB storage devices, and a variety of electronic components including circuit boards and wiring kits.\n\nIt is necessary to place this case within the contemporary ultrastructural context of terrorism investigations, which routinely demand the coordination of digital forensic experts, covert surveillance assets, and multi-agency intelligence sharing. Public agencies face profound challenges in resourcing such operations, made more acute in recent years by the proliferation of sophisticated encryption methods and dark web marketplaces. The strain on resources is an unavoidable feature of the national counter-terrorism programme.\n\nThe trial and plea processes were bookended by numerous procedural hearings, some of which were adjourned due to the late disclosure and the need to instruct expert witnesses. The court records the readiness and professionalism displayed by all legal representatives, including Mr Thomas Pearson QC and Ms Maya Gilbert appearing on behalf of Mr H. The defence made considerable efforts to access legal aid funding for an independent expert psychological assessment, though the court notes with regret that delays in the Legal Aid Agency’s authorisation process occasioned an adjournment of the trial, originally scheduled for early July 2025.\n\nThe court acknowledges the difficult operational environment faced by professionals in the mental health and probation sectors. It is widely reported that the National Probation Service is currently experiencing staffing shortages and elevated caseloads, further complicated by a national shortage of approved premises suitable for individuals convicted of terrorism-related offences. Such systemic pressures demand considerable flexibility and cooperation from practitioners.\n\nThe defendant’s history of association with statutory and community-led Prevent initiatives is well documented in the case materials. The West Midlands Prevent Hub first engaged the defendant in November 2021 following reports of inflammatory online posts. Engagement was intermittent and characterised by an apparent reluctance to engage sincerely with the offered cognitive behavioural interventions, according to correspondence from the team leader dated 3 August 2024. Despite attempts at mentoring and vocational referrals towards engineering apprenticeships, progress was limited.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe investigative phase saw the extensive use of digital surveillance technologies, including network traffic monitoring and mobile device extraction under covert warrant authorisation. Among the tools deployed was the advanced artificial intelligence system “Vanguard” which assists in pattern-of-life analysis. This technology, while groundbreaking in its capacity for identifying suspicious behavioural signatures, remains the subject of ongoing oversight reviews regarding proportionality and data protection compliance. The court commends all agencies for maintaining rigorous protocols in this sensitive domain.\n\nThe defendant’s pre-sentence report has been delayed due to a backlog in the probation service’s screening teams; however, the submitted preliminary risk assessment, commissioned on 1 September 2025 and authored by Ms Fiona Larsson, probation officer, sets out several areas of concern including Mr H’s expressed ideological rigidity and social isolation.\n\nTurning to the legal framework, the sentencing exercise is conducted in accordance with the Terrorism Act 2006 provisions and the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guideline on terrorist offences. The sentencing objectives require a balanced attainment of the punishment’s deterrent effect, the protection of the public, and the rehabilitation potential of the defendant. The court’s discretion is informed by relevant case law including R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which provides guidance on the breadth of the ‘terrorist purpose’ element, and R v. Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 411, emphasising that early disruption of plots does not lessen culpability.\n\nThe Crown relied upon extensive digital forensic analysis, including the decryption of several password-protected archives and the recovery of deleted chat logs from messaging applications known for their ephemeral and encrypted communication protocols. These efforts were hampered by the defendant’s use of virtual private networks and anonymised email services. The technical challenges are compounded by the general under-resourcing of cyber-investigative units nationally.\n\nThe court would be neglectful not to observe the wider societal shifts against which cases such as these take place. Public attitudes towards counter-terrorism law enforcement have hardened in some respects but remain deeply ambivalent in others. This ambivalence is reflected in media portrayals ranging from vilification of suspects prior to conviction, to critiques of alleged overreach and infringement of civil liberties. The justice system must walk a careful path that respects rule of law and human rights in its application of anti-terrorism provisions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nExpert linguistic analysis revealed the defendant maintained several online pseudonymous accounts, via which propaganda materials were posted. The Crown decried these as glorifying acts of violence and promoting extremist narratives common to groups proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The defence submitted, with some ingenuity, that certain posts constituted constitutionally protected expression or satirical commentary. Whilst freedom of expression is robustly protected, the court notes the distinction drawn in R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, which confirms that incitement to violence or support for terrorist acts lies outside of lawful speech.\n\nPrior to his arrest, Mr H had travelled on several occasions within the United Kingdom and Europe. A notable trip in December 2023 took him to Brussels, where records indicate attendance at a public lecture on Middle Eastern geopolitics organised by a civil society organisation. Surveillance evidence also places him briefly near the site of a disrupted conspiracy involving coercive paramilitary actors; though no allegation links him directly to that conspiracy, the proximity raises questions of association or intent.\n\nThe defendant’s education history was canvassed during trial. Mr H holds an Upper Second-Class honours degree in computer science obtained from a Midlands university in 2019. While this achievement underscores his intellectual capability, the court recalls the observations in R v. Griffins [2020] EWCA Crim 555 that such qualifications do not inoculate an individual from culpability in terrorist conduct and may, in unsettling instances, facilitate more sophisticated offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nTechnical analysis of the seized electronic devices uncovered detailed manuals on explosive chemistry, component schematics for improvised detonators, and a spreadsheet listing supplies sourced from various online vendors. Defence submissions suggested that some materials were part of academic research or hobbyist experimentation unrelated to malign intent. The court finds such content, in its totality and context, incompatible with innocent purpose.\n\nIt is important to note, in passing, that unrelated co-defendant J. W., who appeared alongside Mr H during the investigative sequence, faced charges of aggravated burglary with a firearm in the neighbouring Midlandshire jurisdiction. That matter is distinct from the charges before this court and does not bear upon Mr H’s culpability, notwithstanding the overlapping police operations.\n\nHistorical sentencing precedents were further discussed during counsel’s submissions. Of particular interest was R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, where the Court of Appeal considered the interface between mental disorder and terrorism offending. Mallory involved a defendant with schizoaffective disorder who committed arson attacks on residential properties; the court held that psychiatric treatment did not negate the need for custodial containment where the public risk was significant.\n\nIn the present instance, assessments by Dr Samantha Hanley, consultant forensic psychiatrist, indicate that Mr H does not meet criteria for a formal clinical diagnosis but displays personality traits associated with rigidity and moral absolutism. Dr Hanley’s report, dated 30 September 2025, diagnosed “elevated risk propensity combined with limited insight into consequence.” The report appreciates that engagement with deradicalisation programmes would be desirable but has reservations about the defendant’s current openness to such intervention.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThe court places on the record thanks to the staff of Ashbrook Secure Unit, where Mr H underwent a section 47 assessment. The clinical team there provided detailed and methodical observations, contributing to the overall picture needed for sentencing evaluation.\n\nThe defence submitted letters from the defendant’s sister and from a local not-for-profit arts collective, both emphasising his prior community engagement and efforts to distance himself from extremist views in recent months. While such submissions may inform mitigation, the court cautions that community endorsement does not erase the gravity of planning violence.\n\nTurning to the financial dimensions, a forensic accountant engaged by the Counter Terrorism Unit traced cryptocurrency transactions to anonymous wallets linked to online marketplaces known to distribute dual-use components relevant to explosives manufacture. A particular transfer of £4,200 worth of bitcoin was made in August 2024 from an account associated with Mr H’s known aliases to an account flagged by overseas law enforcement agencies. This pattern of transaction is consistent with illicit procurement activity.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe operational challenges of inter-agency coordination emerge vividly in this prosecution. Communication between the local police, the NCA, and the Security Service was maintained through the Multi-Agency Case Management Group, which convened regularly from March 2024 until the conclusion of the investigation. This multi-jurisdictional collaboration, while commendable, underscores the bureaucratic complexity and resource demands inherent in counter-terrorism work.\n\nNotwithstanding the increased deployment of digital evidence gathering techniques, the court acknowledges the limitations faced by investigative teams due to ransomware attacks that delayed critical data extraction by a period of three months. Such cybersecurity assaults represent a new front in the ongoing contest between law enforcement and criminal actors.\n\nThe court cannot overlook the wider social context. The normalisation of extremist rhetoric in certain online subcultures has been noted in recent academic studies commissioned by the Home Office. Such environments foster anonymity and desensitisation, complicating both early identification and intervention.\n\nIn contrast to the gravity of the charges laid against Mr H, lesser offences continue to place unexpected burdens on the criminal justice system. For example, the related matter of fly-tipping on green belt land in the adjacent county of Staffordshire, investigated under Environment Protection Act 1990, diverts policing resources and highlights ecological vulnerability that too often goes unremarked.\n\nFurthermore, cases of graffiti on public transport infrastructure, including the defacement of buses and tramcars in the Birmingham metropolitan area, have seen a steady increase over past years, according to a report by the West Midlands Combined Authority. While no direct connection exists with the defendant, the prevalence of antisocial behaviour remains a backdrop to this matter.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nThe digital forensic examination also unearthed an encrypted ledger purporting to keep detailed logs of planned routes, security protocols, and contingency plans. Defence counsel contested the provenance of these entries but the court finds the expert evidence as cogent and credible and aligns with a coherent study of the genesis of the materials.\n\nAs to procedural fairness, the court notes that the defendant’s Legal Aid counsel has been diligent in raising concerns over disclosure timelines and evidentiary categorisation. However, the court’s view is that the defendant has had a fair and full opportunity to present his case and to challenge the prosecution’s evidence.\n\nIt is regrettable that the staffing pressures at this court have led to several smaller hearings being postponed. Some of these delays reflect the current nationwide shortage of qualified court clerks and interpreters, a phenomenon that has drawn parliamentary attention in recent months.\n\nAttention must be drawn to the issue of sentencing credits. The defendant initially pleaded not guilty at the arraignment hearing on 15 March 2025, before entering a guilty plea at the start of the trial on 28 September 2025 following the presentation of incontrovertible evidence concerning encrypted communications and purchase history. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440 makes clear that late pleas justify only limited allowance owing to the additional costs borne by the court and witnesses.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nRegarding Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 31 years old and of mixed heritage. He attended local state schools before pursuing higher education in computer science, graduating with commendations. Witness statements from former employers highlight his meticulous work ethic, although recent reliance on self-study and remote freelance projects marked a withdrawal from regular employment patterns.\n\nLetters from community groups highlight Mr H’s intermittent participation in environmental clean-up initiatives and contributions to open-source software projects, matters that, while demonstrating capacity for social cooperation, cannot negate his culpability once extremist intent is established.\n\nThe defendant suffers from mild asthma and has disclosed a history of mild social anxiety, for which he has received intermittent counselling through the NHS. The current probation preliminary report notes a tendency to retreat into echo chambers online when stressed.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe court is mindful of the gravity of the offending and the profound implications for public safety. This was a carefully orchestrated plan involving detailed technical knowledge, the procurement of potentially lethal apparatus, and the harboured intention of causing significant mass harm. The appropriate sentence must reflect the seriousness, the need for deterrence, and the protection of the public.\n\nThe mitigating features amount largely to Mr H’s lack of previous convictions, his educational attainment, and his belated acceptance of responsibility demonstrated by his guilty pleas. These factors limit, but do not excuse, the sentence.\n\nThe court requests the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, including detailed psychological assessment, examination of risk management options, and feasibility studies of structured offender management plans post-release. Consideration should also be given to eligibility for specialist desistance programmes and the potential integration of technology-based monitoring such as electronic tagging or internet usage restrictions.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be filed and transmitted to the appropriate authorities.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.
