Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/25789  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. FENWICK  \nFiled: 18 August 2025  \n\nMr H stands before this court today for sentence upon conviction of two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possessing an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences are said to have occurred over a period spanning from late 2022 through to the date of the defendant’s arrest in January 2025. This is a matter of grave public importance and accordingly has required significant judicial and prosecutorial resources over an extended investigative period.  \n\nThe defendant was taken into custody at approximately 04:45 hours on 12 January 2025, following the execution of a warrant by Counter Terrorism Policing South West at an address in Redcliffe. The warrant was authorised pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and was a culmination of an extensive multi-agency intelligence operation involving specialist cyber teams from the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), as well as local police officers and Firearms Units on standby. The investigative strategy involved sustained covert surveillance supported by judicial authorisation for electronic interception and the deployment of digital forensic technology to decrypt encrypted messaging applications allegedly operated by the defendant.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nPrior to the arrest, there had been a series of bail applications and adjournments owing to issues related to disclosure and the need for expert forensic reports. The court records that the urgency of matters resulted in a prioritisation of resources, but that procedural fairness and the defendant’s entitlement to a fair trial were scrupulously maintained throughout. Maintaining the equilibrium between effective counter-terrorism measures and procedural safeguards is an ongoing challenge in the contemporary criminal justice system, as delineated in seminal authority such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which underscored the breadth of the definition of “terrorist purpose” but also reaffirmed rights to due process.  \n\nIt is pertinent to observe that the case was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 19 May 2025, at which Mr H initially pleaded not guilty to both counts. An application by the defence seeking further forensic testing and independent digital examination led to an adjournment until 30 July 2025 to allow for the completion of these reports. The delays occasioned thereby illustrate the complexities of handling voluminous electronic evidence, a phenomenon not unusual in cases involving cyber-enabled terrorism offences, and the court hopes the justice system will continue to invest in resourcing such demands adequately.  \n\nThe operation leading to arrest was intricate in its coordination of information flows between the Security Service, local Counter Terrorism Units, and specialist forensic bodies such as the Digital Evidence Unit of Avon and Somerset Police. The court also notes with interest the submissions of the Crown regarding the opportunity costs involved, with highly trained personnel diverted over extended periods from other priority crime investigations, including those dealing with organised criminal gangs, illicit firearms trafficking, and serious violent offending. The stretched capacity of the police service in managing these overlapping threats is a matter of professional concern.  \n\nIn the context of public protection, familiarity with the MAPPA arrangements—Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements—is crucial. Though historically related largely to sexual and violent offenders, Category 3 MAPPA can also be engaged where there is a risk from those convicted of terrorism offences post-custody. The coordination between Probation Officers, NHS forensic mental health services, local authority safeguarding teams, and police results in a comprehensive risk management strategy for individuals such as Mr H should release occur. The court acknowledges the efforts of Bristol Community Rehabilitation Company and Avon and Somerset Probation in preparing for this eventuality, despite chronic staffing shortages and rising caseloads.  \n\nThe court further records its awareness of the very considerable demand recently placed upon NHS forensic psychiatric services. These services routinely deal with complex risk assessments requiring expert evaluation of individuals suspected of extremist ideologies or exhibiting cognitive rigidity potentially commensurate with high risk of reoffending. The Eastwood Secure Unit—whose consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Jasmine Patrick produced the defendant’s current report—faces ongoing pressures from increased referrals and long waiting lists, which have unfortunately impacted the timing of assessments in the present case.  \n\nTurning now to further procedural history, it is noteworthy that this prosecution encountered a number of administrative challenges attributed to the Legal Aid Agency’s funding arrangements. These included delays authorising funding for expert reports and providing counsel with sufficient preparatory time to review large quantities of disclosure material. These challenges, regrettably, have become a regular feature of complex Crown Court proceedings, and the court joins others in calling for systemic review to ensure that justice is neither delayed nor compromised due to bureaucratic inertia or financial rationing.  \n\nAt the plea and trial preparation hearing listed on 30 July 2025, the defendant changed his plea to guilty on both counts, shortly before trial was due to commence on 4 August 2025. While this early morning plea ameliorated further resource expenditure, it nevertheless qualifies as a “late plea” in the eyes of established appellate principles. As set out in R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440, while credit is due for the plea, its timing will temper the extent of any discretionary reduction. The defence had advanced a provisional not guilty plea through the pleadings phase before electing to admit guilt once forensic evidence was virtually incontrovertible. Such conduct is neither unusual nor necessarily improper, but it does constrain the proportionality of sentence mitigation for credit.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe Crown’s evidence included analysis of radical content published by Mr H on social media platforms under encrypted user aliases. These manifestos were peppered with references and coded language consistent with proscribed ideological groups, drawing upon narrative tropes common to extremist manifestos, as detailed in expert linguistic reports and verified social media data analytics. Mr H’s digital footprint reveals a coalescence around grievance-based rhetoric interlaced with technical manuals on improvised explosive device (IED) construction, reproduced from sources known to the Security Service as facilitating terrorism offences.  \n\nThe defendant’s possession and transmission of encrypted files, some contained within sophisticated steganographic containers, demonstrates not merely passive association but active engagement in preparatory activity. This aligns with the Court of Appeal’s approach in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 where intent and preparation, even at the nascent stages, merit significant custodial sentences given the potential breadth of harm.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe digital forensic evidence was difficult and required the coordinated expertise of multiple teams, notably the National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES), who employed recovered fragments from deleted WhatsApp chats and intercept of ProtonMail communications. The court heard how the defendant utilised a bespoke Linux operating system designed specifically to enhance operational security by obscuring network traffic, requiring months of painstaking technical analysis unpicked by eminent cyber forensic specialists.  \n\nIn the course of the investigation, there were also seized three external solid-state drives labelled with code names such as “recon” and “manuals,” which contained extensive encrypted materials pertaining to bomb-making and ideological instruction manuals. While the presence of such material is clearly incriminating, the defence raised a submission referencing a 2020 academic thesis by Professor Everett titled “Digital Radicals and Political Dissent in the 21st Century” to argue that possession alone does not necessarily imply immediate violent intent. The court finds this persuasive only in part: possession in the context of the wider preparatory acts outlined is neither innocent nor incidental.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nIt should also be noted—as a factual aside, though not material to the defendant’s culpability—that earlier in 2023, a co-defendant in a separate investigation was found guilty of fly-tipping on Green Belt land adjacent to the defendant’s residence. That offence, involving the illegal disposal of approximately 300 kilograms of waste comprising construction rubble and plastic packaging, resulted in a community order imposed by the Magistrates’ Court. While irrelevant to the present matters, social and environmental offences of this nature are increasingly viewed as indicators of community harm and are accorded increased attention by local authorities aiming to preserve natural habitats.  \n\nThe defendant’s digital activity also revealed sporadic fascination with historical property damage claims. Records from the local planning authority showed that the landlord of Mr H’s accommodation had been subject to a noise abatement order following complaints of loud music and illegal gatherings in the preceding twelve months. Such information is entirely peripheral but serves to remind the court of the complexity of lives lived on the margins of society, even in urban environments.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe defendant had travelled abroad in mid-2023 to Budapest, ostensibly for tourism, but evidence obtained through travel records and CCTV reconnaissance supports the Crown’s position that he also met with individuals belonging to known extremist networks. This is consistent with a pattern of overseas activity noted in other terrorism prosecutions where foreign visits serve dual purposes: legitimate travel and clandestine ideological networking. The larger pattern was similarly evident in the well-known case of R v. Linstead [2021] EWCA Crim 945 where attendance at foreign religious conferences masked preparatory and planning discussions.  \n\nSeparate from the above, this court recalls with concern the spike in violent affray in town centre pubs witnessed in recent years, with an illustrative incident from 2024 involving a protracted brawl at The Cobbler’s Arms in Bath, where pool cues were reportedly used as weapons. While unrelated to the defendant nor the present allegations, the court’s attention remains fixed on the multifarious nature of public safety threats in urban settings. Such offences, though not of terrorism, nonetheless erode community confidence and strain emergency services.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nAttention was drawn to financial transactions lawfully obtained under warrant, including a series of cryptocurrency transfers totaling approximately £3,650, moving through multiple anonymising mixers before landing in wallets associated with vendors supplying dual-use chemical precursors. Two payments were made to an online entity marketing “distillation kits” and “precision lab equipment,” flagged by law enforcement as being frequent sources of materials diverted to illicit purposes. The court wishes to highlight that cryptocurrency, while lawful and legitimate for many, continues to pose substantial regulatory and enforcement challenges in the context of policing serious and organised criminality, including terrorism.  \n\nThe increasing reliance on encrypted digital payments is a concern for policing authorities nationally. Financial investigators emphasise that the opacity and decentralisation of blockchain technology hinder identification of offenders, requiring exceptional technical expertise and international cooperation. The court notes with interest ongoing legislative proposals to enhance transparency without compromising legitimate commercial privacy.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nMr H is now 31 years old. He holds a second-class honours degree in electrical engineering from a university of reasonable repute. Employment history reveals intermittent periods of temporary contract work at a local electronics manufacturing firm. The defendant’s line manager characterised him in a reference as “quiet, intelligent but somewhat withdrawn.” The submission was that Mr H had no prior convictions nor any relevant disciplinary record. An enquiry with the National Crime Agency returned no extant intelligence records indicating prior involvement in organised crime, though the defendant was known historically to local social services through family contacts.  \n\nThe court considered a number of character references tendered on behalf of Mr H, including letters from a homeless charity in Bristol which described him as “polite and cooperative” during brief volunteering stints distributing food parcels in 2022. Those charitable contributions, whilst positive in their own right, are of limited sentencing significance given the nature of the offences before the court. This is emphasised in the statutory sentencing framework where mitigation based on community contributions must be balanced against the seriousness and potential consequences of terrorism offences.  \n\nIt is also noted the defendant’s mother submitted a personal letter in mitigation, speaking to a difficult upbringing marked by family bereavements and chronic financial hardship. While not determinative, such contextual information often aids probation services in constructing meaningful rehabilitation plans if and when release is contemplated.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nA psychiatric and psychological evaluation prepared by Dr Farid Sheikh, consultant forensic psychiatrist, concluded that the defendant exhibits no formal diagnosis of mental illness but outlined traits consistent with “cognitive rigidity, black-and-white moral thinking, and elevated risk factors for future involvement in extremist activity.” The report recommended intensive psychological support and detailed risk assessment under the public protection regime. Notably, the report cautioned against reliance on conventional desistance programmes alone, advocating for specialised counter-radicalisation measures to address the ideological dimension of Mr H’s offending.  \n\nThe defence submitted that participation in structured intervention initiatives such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) may offer prospects of reduced risk, but the court is mindful of official statistics showing a completion rate below 70 percent and acknowledges the reality that disengagement is a process fraught with setbacks and relapse. The balance between hope for reform and the imperative of protection remains delicate.  \n\nIn accordance with the statutory sentencing framework established by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Definitive Guidelines (January 2023 edition) and case law precedent, including R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, the court must weigh the culpability level, the harm intended, and the risk to the public. The defendant’s activities reach a level of high culpability given the sophistication and persistence evidenced. Aggravating factors include the intent to cause mass casualties and the premeditated nature of the preparation, which involved complex encryption techniques and procurement of specialised components.  \n\nMitigating factors are limited primarily to the absence of prior convictions and the guilty plea entered at a relatively late stage. The defendant’s educational background and community volunteering, while marked, do not significantly mitigate the intent nor the potential consequences of the conduct set out.  \n\nThe court directs that a full and comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith, with particular attention to the feasibility of extended custodial sentences under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the inclusion of licence conditions restricting internet access and communication with known extremists, and the suitability for structured psychological intervention in a secure environment. The report should investigate the availability of approved premises for supervised accommodation and the capacity of local services to deliver required interventions upon any future release.  \n\nBefore concluding, the court wishes to acknowledge the professionalism of all officers and experts involved in this lengthy and highly complex investigation. The trial team comprised a vast coalition of counter-terrorism specialists across multiple agencies, a testament to the multifaceted nature of modern threats. Similarly, appreciation is extended to counsel on both sides, notably Ms Joanna Shelton KC for the Crown and Mr Philip Dalton for the defence, whose conduct has been measured, respectful, and professional amid challenging circumstances.  \n\nThe case has occasioned considerable effort from court staff, ushers, and transcription services, and it is noted that the courtroom itself was recently refurbished to improve accessibility notwithstanding the inevitable disruption to sitting schedules, a small but welcome gesture to maintaining the dignity of judicial proceedings.  \n\nThe court acknowledges the wider societal context within which this offending arises. Increasing political polarisation, the proliferation of online radicalising content, and the limitations of social integration programmes all serve as a backdrop to this case. However, these factors neither excuse nor mitigate criminality carried out with wilful intent to cause harm on a large scale. The rule of law and public safety remain paramount.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be communicated to relevant authorities for official registration.  \n\nThe court reserves final sentencing for the formal hearing scheduled on 25 September 2025, pending receipt of updated pre-sentence reports and any further representations.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.

Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay.  \n\nThe digital forensic evidence was difficult and required the coordinated expertise of multiple teams, notably the National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES), who employed recovered fragments from deleted WhatsApp chats and intercept of ProtonMail communications.

Such offences, though not of terrorism, nonetheless erode community confidence and strain emergency services.  \n\nThe defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and identified the cleaner. The operational notes stated that Mr H plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nAttention was drawn to financial transactions lawfully obtained under warrant, including a series of cryptocurrency transfers totaling approximately £3,650, moving through multiple anonymising mixers before landing in wallets associated with vendors supplying dual-use chemical precursors.
