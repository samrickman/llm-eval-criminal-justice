Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/25903  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. D. CARMICHAEL  \nFiled: 18 September 2025\n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006: specifically, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of articles for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period of offending, as established, covers the interval from March 2023 until his arrest on 15 January 2025.\n\nThe arrest of the defendant took place at approximately 07:45 hours on 15 January 2025, pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. Counter-Terrorism Policing West Midlands, acting on intelligence provided by the Security Service, effected the warrant at the defendant’s residence in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham. The warrant formation followed a detailed analytical review of encrypted communications associated with the defendant’s known aliases. Items seized included multiple encrypted electronic storage devices, assorted improvised electronic components, and notebooks containing hand-written schematic diagrams.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe investigation was notable for the deployment of extraordinary technical resources over the preceding twelve months. The National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) was engaged to assist in the painstaking decryption of voluminous encrypted data extracted from bespoke storage devices. The pace of digital forensic review was hampered not solely by complexity of encryption but also by competing operational priorities given contemporaneous threats identified nationally. The deployment of artificial intelligence-assisted pattern-recognition software proved critical in reconstructing partially overwritten data clusters that revealed communications indicative of preparatory steps towards hostile acts.\n\nPrior to those operational undertakings, the defendant had been the subject of a Prevent referral raised in late 2020 following reports from a secondary school teacher. The referral concerned a sociology essay penned by Mr H expressing sympathy towards radical ideologies, supplemented by advocacy of “direct action” against institutional authorities. However, an early Channel panel declined to progress intervention, citing insufficient evidence of substantive intent beyond ideological curiosity. The court reflects briefly on this episode as illustrative of the fluid and evolving nature of radicalisation pathways and the inherent challenges faced by safeguarding frameworks.\n\nIt is worth recording that the court is mindful of the current unprecedented pressure on court scheduling and listing. Delays occasioned by industrial action affecting court clerks and associate judicial staff during the spring of 2025 caused significant disruption in trial timetabling nationally. This case, initially anticipated for trial in April, was adjourned to July and subsequently to September. Such challenges to efficient justice administration, while external to the defendant’s conduct, nonetheless serve as contextual background to the judicial process deployed.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service, represented today by Miss Eleanor Baines, and instructed by the Central Terrorism Casework Section, has put forward resolute submissions emphasising the gravity of the defendant’s preparations and the extended nature of his involvement in terrorist facilitation activities. Defence counsel, Mr Damon Lewis of the Criminal Defence Consortium, has called for measured consideration of the defendant’s background and mitigation, particularly highlighting a lack of prior convictions and the defendant’s relatively young age.\n\nTurning to the issue of guilty plea credit, it is noted that Mr H first indicated a not guilty plea at the hearing on 4 June 2025 but changed his plea to guilty on the first day of the trial on 15 September 2025. The lateness of the plea, after exhaustive digital forensic evidence had been served and after the Crown had disclosed multiple expert reports, necessarily limits the discount applicable. The court makes clear that late pleas must be scrutinised carefully as to whether they meaningfully save court time or spare witnesses the ordeal of contested evidence.\n\nThe law on the awarding of credit for guilty pleas is well-established and was recently considered in R v Redford [2024] EWCA Crim 1123, where the Court of Appeal emphasised that the timing, motivation, and sincerity of the plea are all relevant. In that case, relating to armed robbery with a late plea entered at the start of trial, the reduction was confined to 15%. By analogy, such reasoning applies here.\n\nIt is perhaps apposite to revisit analysis from earlier case law to underline principles of proportional sentencing in terrorism matters. The judgment in R v. Aziz [2020] EWCA Crim 967, concerned with conspiracy to supply explosives precursors, confirmed that sentences must reflect not only the dangerousness of the act but also the necessity for deterrence and affording due weight to the message sent to any would-be offenders. Likewise, in R v. Hassan [2019] UKSC 4, the Supreme Court noted the importance of the protective ethos underpinning terrorism sentencing, asserting that “personal circumstances, while relevant, rarely outweigh the need to protect society from grave threats”.\n\nIt is also worth noting the contemporaneous case considered under the now-repealed Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989 in R v. Farooq [1997] 1 Cr App R 345, where the Court considered the import of membership of a proscribed organisation in sentencing, establishing that the collective identity imperilled public safety. Although the statutory basis differs, the rationale remains pressing and germane to today’s considerations.\n\nIn the present case, the court has carefully reviewed the extensive digital material recovered. This material comprises encrypted messaging backlogs, detailed spreadsheets of procurement activity, and schematic diagrams for improvised devices. The forensic analysis was aided by the technical guidance of Dr Jonathan Fletcher, an expert in digital forensics called to assist the prosecution.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe defendant’s online activity revealed a gradual but distinct shift in rhetorical tone. Initially consisting predominantly of political critique and dissent, his posts increasingly embraced militant rhetoric emblematic of inspired extremism. Open-source intelligence corroborated interaction across multiple encrypted platforms with individuals linked to proscribed entities.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nParticularly noteworthy was the recovery of over fifty video clips showing experimentation with chemically reactive compounds, filmed in improvised settings. Although no explosive incidents occurred, the regimentation evident in the video series demonstrates a high degree of intention and methodical planning.\n\nThe possibility of deriving any innocent explanation for such footage was extensively debated during trial preparation. Defence counsel sought to posit these as academic or hobbyist experimentation. The court, however, was unimpressed by such arguments, given the totality of evidence and accompanying context.\n\nIt is germane to mention that during this period, Mr H maintained part-time employment as a night-shift security guard for a regional transport company. His employer’s reference describes his conduct as “reliable and conscientious,” though it also notes intermittent absences without explanation. While employment history is relevant to personal context, it bears no significant mitigation in the face of the serious charges.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nTurning to the procedural management of the case, it is regrettable that the Legal Aid Agency encountered significant delays in authorising funding for expert psychiatric assessments. Such delays are an unfortunate but persistent feature in complex cases and can impede timely trial preparation. Defence counsel’s repeated correspondence reveals professional frustration with administrative inefficiencies that tarnish the timely administration of justice.\n\nThe Probation Service’s contributions to the pre-sentence preparation have been hampered by resource constraints, particularly in relation to preparing detailed reports in cases involving national security. Consideration must be given to the impact of staffing shortages on the capacity to undertake thorough background checks and risk assessments, especially when multi-agency collaboration is essential.\n\nThe Probation-led Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 group convened on 31 July 2025 and engaged representatives from forensic psychology units, police counter-terrorism branches, local authority housing, and social care. Their extensive deliberations underscore the complexities inherent in managing individuals convicted of terrorism-related offences in the community.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nIn respect of the defendant’s travel history, records indicate an unexplained sojourn to the town of Dovercourt in Essex in December 2023, overlapping with a festival noted for attracting anarchist protest groups. CCTV captured Mr H in conversation with persons later identified as foreign nationals under investigation for membership in an extremist militia. While there is no evidence the defendant engaged in violent acts at that time, such movements are relevant to establishing networks and intent.\n\nIt may be useful to digress briefly into the wider societal context within which this case unfolds. We see, undeniably, increasing numbers of individuals experiencing economic precarity, housing instability, and social dislocation, factors that occasionally provide fertile ground for radicalisation. The stark rise in urban homelessness, as reported by the Greater Midlands Homelessness Partnership, reflects broader systemic challenges facing public services. While these matters do not excuse criminal behaviour, they must inform the court’s understanding of the defendant’s personal milieu.\n\nThe court acknowledges with appreciation the professionalism exhibited by all court staff throughout these proceedings, particularly the ushers and clerical officers in Court 4, who managed a schedule burdened with trials delayed by personnel shortages. Their unfailing courtesy and efficiency contribute meaningfully to the dignified administration of justice.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nForensic financial experts documented the transfer on 22 August 2024 of approximately £3,120 in cryptocurrency from a public wallet addressed to “H@ck3rAlpha” associated with darknet exchanges notorious for illicit commodity sales. Such transactions exemplify the opaque financing methods typical of contemporary terrorist networks. The court notes with concern the ongoing challenges for criminal justice authorities in tracing and interrupting such conduits.\n\nIn a tangential but illustrative vein, it is worth recalling the case of R v. Johnson [2021] EWCA Crim 1983, where the defendant was convicted of fly-tipping hazardous waste on greenbelt land. Though apparently unrelated to terrorism, the ecological harm inflicted was substantial and highlighted the intersection of environmental crime with organised criminality. While the present case bears no direct relation, it serves as a reminder that criminal enterprises may intersect in unexpected ways.\n\nFurther, the court received correspondence from the “West Midlands Counter-Extremism Partnership,” acknowledging the complex challenges posed by Mr H’s case. They commend the local mental health services’ attempts to engage with the defendant prior to remand, though acceptance of support was minimal and inconsistent.\n\nIt must also be noted that investigations unrelated to this matter uncovered another occupant of the defendant’s residence possessing small quantities of cannabis. Though no charges arose, this ancillary fact was touched upon in mitigation to illustrate the defendant’s social environment. Such statements, while potentially informative, must not distract from the core criminal findings.\n\nDuring covert surveillance on 16 November 2024, Mr H was observed spending time near bridges spanning the River Rea, a fact that required significant analytic resources from the joint police-Forensic Science Service surveillance teams. The footage, painstakingly analysed over numerous shifts, revealed no overt material illegal activity but included instances where Mr H appeared to handle drone devices, raising concerns given the known misuse of drones for hostile purposes.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nOn personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age with no prior convictions for any offence, maintaining generally positive references from family and long-standing acquaintances. Letters submitted in support commend his charitable work with a local animal welfare charity for which he volunteered sporadically during 2022. While socially commendable, these factors cannot be afforded substantial mitigation in the context of terrorism-related planning.\n\nPsychiatric assessment, conducted by Dr Serena Maltby, consultant forensic psychiatrist, found no evidence of diagnosable mental illness. The report indicates a tendency towards rigid cognitive patterns and a preoccupation with ideological narratives with minimal recognition of the consequences of violent actions. Despite some attempts at rehabilitation through voluntary attendance at community workshops aligned with disengagement programs, engagement was described as inconsistent and equivocal. The risk assessment concluded a significant ongoing risk of harm should the defendant remain untreated and unsupervised in the community.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe court notes with grave concern the level of sophistication in both the procurement and operational planning phases demonstrated in this case. Aggravating features include detailed preparation, digital operational security measures employed to evade detection, and the conscious targeting of vulnerable public spaces. Mitigating factors remain limited to the defendant’s youth, absence of prior criminal record, and late plea.\n\nIn line with current sentencing guidelines under the Terrorism Act, and relevant decisions such as R v Khan [2023] EWCA Crim 1994, the court emphasises that sentences must prioritise protection of the public and deterrence of others who might contemplate similar offending. Rehabilitation remains a desired outcome but cannot displace public safety imperatives.\n\nThe court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared, with particular focus on assessing the viability of multi-faceted interventions including extended supervision, exclusion zones supported by electronic monitoring, and engagement with specialist deradicalisation and psychological services. Assessors should evaluate the feasibility of custodial arrangements incorporating focused therapeutic input, and consider mechanisms for managing internet access post-release.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been transcribed by the court reporter in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be dispatched to relevant authorities for registration. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/25903  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. D.
