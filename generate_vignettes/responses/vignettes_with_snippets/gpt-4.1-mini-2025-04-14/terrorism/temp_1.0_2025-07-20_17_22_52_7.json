Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/34560  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. Davenport  \nFiled: 15 September 2025\n\nMr H stands before this court for sentence on two counts: the first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; the second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The relevant conduct spans a period commencing in March 2023 and concluding with the defendant’s arrest in January 2025.\n\nFrom the outset, it is appropriate to acknowledge the diligent work undertaken by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) in this matter. Their efforts were accompanied by input from the National Cybercrime Unit, and involved exhaustive coordination with the National Crime Agency, as well as local law enforcement entities. The arrest of Mr H at 04:43 on 21 January 2025 resulted from an intelligence-led operation culminating in a search warrant executed at his place of residence in Edgbaston. This warrant had been authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe prosecution and defence teams have both had to navigate a complex evidentiary landscape. The volume of electronically stored information comprised over 2.4 terabytes of encrypted data, which necessitated a prolonged period of forensic analysis. This process was hampered intermittently by compatibility issues with decryption software routinely used by the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC). There were related delays in the service of certain disclosure items, which the court was regularly updated upon. Notably, the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative delays in granting authorisation for expert forensic services added an element of procedural contortion in the early stages of these proceedings.\n\nAside from the principal charges, it is worth noting the wider pressures facing counter-terrorism investigations. Intelligence gathering in this sector frequently intersects with routine policing tasks, including the response to less serious offences. It has been observed that the growing burden of monitoring open-source extremist content online diverts investigative resources from traditional crime control. Conversely, the suppressive effect of multi-agency preventative structures such as Channel and Prevent panels is sometimes compromised by strained capacity.\n\nIn this vein, the court records that, prior to these charges, the defendant had been subject to a referral under the Prevent programme in 2022. This referral, initiated by an academic tutor concerned by the defendant’s increasingly radical online postings, did not proceed beyond the initial panel meeting, principally due to his refusal to engage with offered interventions. The efficacy of such early-stage Prevent referrals remains a topic of ongoing policy debate, but this court is constrained to focus on the facts as they fall for adjudication here and now.\n\nBetween arraignment and trial, the case was subject to several adjournments. One such adjournment was occasioned by a request from the defence to consider supplementary material, including two letters of support from community organisations and a personal statement from a family member. At a procedural hearing convened on 17 June 2025, it was determined that this new material would warrant further consideration post-conviction during mitigation.\n\nThe question of guilty plea is central in sentencing. Mr H steadfastly maintained pleas of not guilty until the opening morning of trial on 11 September 2025, when he entered guilty pleas to both counts. As counsel for the Crown, Ms. Fiona Lambert, rightly observed, the timing of these pleas constrains the discount that the court may reasonably afford. It is well established that credit for a guilty plea reflects not only the plea itself but its timing and the consequent reduction in court time and avoidance of the trauma of a contested hearing.\n\nIn R v. Spender [2021] EWCA Crim 3024, the Court of Appeal underscored the principle that guilty pleas entered at “the eleventh hour” must be conditioned by the reality that they often come after comprehensive trial preparations. That judgment, emerging from a case concerning multiple counts of fraud and money laundering, emphasised the limited attenuative value of post-preparation pleas, even when genuine remorse is professed. The logic of that ruling is readily transposed to terrorism offences, with due recognition of the exceptional nature of such cases.\n\nOther appellate authorities have considered the relationship between timeliness of pleas and sentencing discount. In particular, R v. Haines [2019] EWCA Crim 1287 delineated the importance of early admissions in mitigating the impact on victims and witnesses, as well as preserving valuable judicial resources. Where pleas are deferred until trial, sentencing must reflect this diminished benefit.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe prosecution presented detailed evidence of a blog maintained by Mr H under the pseudonym “Iron Albatross.” Initially a platform for commentary on environmental policy and social justice, the content shifted markedly by early 2024, adopting a tone replete with grievance-laden manifestos calling for violent upheaval. The linguistic pattern matched known propagandist templates employed by proscribed organisations.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nAmong the exhibits was a cache of encrypted digital manuals discovered on an external hard drive concealed within a false wall panel of the defendant’s bedroom. The materials included schematics for improvised explosive devices and tutorials for chemical synthesis, documented with meticulous care. The defence submitted that some files could have been retained for academic interest, referencing Mr H’s background as a chemistry undergraduate. The court rejects this notion as inconsistent with the broader corpus of evidence and the defendant’s pattern of behaviour.\n\nThe detection of a small quantity of cannabis resin on the premises was uncovered during the search. While possessing controlled substances is a criminal offence, that fact stands unrelated to the defendant’s terrorism offending and has not proceeded to charge. Similarly, a 2018 fine for driving without insurance referenced in disclosure bundles is recorded but carries no mitigating or aggravating weight in the court's current deliberations.\n\nThe fact that Mr H had no previous convictions beyond minor traffic infractions distinguishes this case from certain other terrorists previously sentenced by this court. For instance, R v. Munro [2023] EWCA Crim 1509 involved an offender with a lengthy criminal history including aggravated assault and drug trafficking, a background absent here.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThe court examined Mr H’s overseas travel history, highlighting a trip to Berlin in September 2023. The stated purpose was attendance at a conference on political activism; however, intercepts and CCTV footage place Mr H in proximity to individuals later convicted of firearms offences. Defence counsel argued coincidence and noted that the defendant’s holiday photographs supported an innocuous itinerary. The court considers, however, that the totality of evidence undermines this benign interpretation.\n\nIt is of procedural interest that the case management hearing initially scheduled for early July 2025 was vacated owing to the sudden hospitalisation of the defence solicitor. The attendant late application for an adjournment was reluctantly granted so as to preserve fairness. Such tactical delays inevitably impose strains on court calendars already burdened by the cumulated effects of industrial action affecting court staff.\n\nIn passing, the court notes its awareness of the pressures facing probation services tasked with supervising individuals subject to multi-agency management. Current resourcing deficits, as outlined in Ministry of Justice publications, exacerbate the challenge of consistent, proactive case handling. The court trusts that the forthcoming pre-sentence report will reflect these contextual realities in framing recommendations.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nFurther scrutiny revealed that in November 2023 Mr H had purchased components compatible with the assembly of explosive devices, including inert detonators and timer mechanisms. These were procured under false identities online and shipped covertly via parcel services. The Crown refers to this as evidence of sophisticated procurement networks.\n\nConcurrent with these activities, Analysis of social media posts documented a steady intensification of apocalyptic rhetoric and the sharing of content glorifying violent martyrdom. Expert linguists linked these patterns with followers on encrypted forums known for extremism dissemination.\n\nThe court has reviewed a report prepared by Dr Minerva Cullen, a consultant forensic psychiatrist appointed by the defence. Dr Cullen diagnoses Mr H with traits consistent with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder but finds no evidence of psychosis or severe mental illness impairing responsibility. The psychiatric assessment, while detailed, emphasizes the defendant’s capacity for understanding the nature and consequences of his conduct.\n\nThe treatment of such psychiatric findings in sentencing guidance is nuanced. R v. Munyard [2018] EWCA Crim 1234 affirms that the presence of a neurodevelopmental condition does not automatically mitigate culpability where intelligent, purposeful conduct is demonstrated. This is particularly pertinent in the context of ideologically motivated offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nA detailed blockchain forensic report identified multiple cryptocurrency transactions tracing from a private wallet controlled by Mr H to an anonymous vendor specialising in dual-use goods. The transactions, aggregated over six months, amounted to a sum exceeding £4,000. The anonymity afforded by mixers and tumblers complicates enforcement, a point noted recently by the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee in its report on financial crime.\n\nSuch findings underscore the evolving threat paradigm where technology resists conventional police access, necessitating sustained cooperation between law enforcement, financial regulators, and international partners. The enforcement of counter-terrorism legislation must adapt accordingly.\n\nThe court has also received submissions from the Edgbaston Community Support Network, which has engaged with Mr H intermittently over the last eighteen months. Their correspondence stresses the difficult balance between community integration efforts and the imperative of vigilance in the face of radicalisation risks.\n\nA further letter from the Birmingham Probation Trust underscores the staffing shortages currently afflicting the service, with vacancy rates approaching 18 per cent and caseloads exceeding recommended limits. These systemic difficulties, while not excusing individual risk, provide context relevant to the design of post-sentence supervisory conditions.\n\nSurveillance video on 4 December 2024 depicted Mr H at a riverside location walking with an unidentified companion. The exercise of analysis required synchronisation of multiple feeds over protracted hours, highlighting the labour-intensive nature of bespoke operational work in counter-terrorism.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nAddressing the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is a 31-year-old single man, educated to honours degree level in chemical engineering from a Midlands university. Prior to resigning in early 2023—an act precipitated by disciplinary proceedings concerning unauthorised internet use—he had been engaged as a junior technical analyst at an industrial manufacturer.\n\nCharacter references describe him as “introverted but conscientious,” with a tendency to avoid social situations outside close family circles. Despite this, Mr H had been a regular volunteer at a local food bank, an involvement lauded by community workers. Letters from neighbours and former employers speak of punctuality and quiet industriousness.\n\nWhile such factors are humane considerations, it is well established that positive community engagement does not cancel out serious offences. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in R v. Wilkins [2020] EWCA Crim 1570 observed that individuals who demonstrate social acumen may be judged more harshly when they commit crimes of high culpability, given their presumed capacity for moral insight.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Steele, a forensic psychologist who contributed to the pre-sentence report, notes a marked pattern of cognitive inflexibility and black-and-white thinking in Mr H. The report assesses a high risk of serious harm linked to continued adherence to extremist ideology if left unmitigated, necessitating structured intervention post-release.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nIt remains the task of this court to balance the objectives of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. The offending before the court represents a grave breach of the social contract and a taint that extends beyond the immediate facts to the collective security of the community.\n\nMitigating factors include the absence of prior convictions, academic attainment, and the aforementioned late guilty plea. The plea credit, however, must be tempered given the persistent maintenance of innocence through trial preparation phases.\n\nThis court will direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The probation service is instructed to consider the availability and suitability of accredited cognitive behavioural programmes targeting extremist ideology, alongside risk management modalities consistent with Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), Category 3 oversight. The report should also address the feasibility of community licence conditions restricting digital access and mandate ongoing psychiatric support utilising Structured Professional Judgement frameworks.\n\nThanks are due to counsel appearing before this court today: Ms Fiona Lambert for the Crown and Mr Julian Rowe for the defence, both of whom have conducted their cases with professional diligence. The courtroom itself has recently benefited from refurbishment funded through the Ministry of Justice's ongoing capital programme, offering improved facilities for vulnerable witnesses and enhanced hearing accessibility—commendations extend to the court clerks and ushers who maintained order during protracted hearings.\n\nDespite the best efforts of all legal actors, the court once again laments the administrative delays attributable to the Legal Aid Agency’s processing time for expert instructions. It is a persistent and regrettable feature of contemporary criminal proceedings that these bureaucratic obstacles impede the efficient progression of justice.\n\nIn closing, the court reiterates the solemn responsibility borne by institutions engaged in counter-terrorism work. The stakes are uncommonly high, and so too must be the standards applied in adjudication and sentencing.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been transcribed in conformity with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant agencies for enactment.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.
