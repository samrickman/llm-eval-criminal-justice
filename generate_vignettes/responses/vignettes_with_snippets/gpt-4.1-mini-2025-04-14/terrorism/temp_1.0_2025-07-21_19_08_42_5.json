Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29814  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. F. WENDOVER  \nFiled: 17 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, as well as possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct under scrutiny is said to have taken place between March 2023 and February 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was arrested at approximately 04:25 on 19 February 2025, pursuant to a series of search warrants executed by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), operating in conjunction with the National Crime Agency’s Cyber Crime Unit. These warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 following extensive intelligence gathering that linked certain encrypted communications to an individual known only by an encrypted handle, later confirmed to be Mr H. At the point of arrest, law enforcement officers seized multiple electronic devices including a desktop computer, several USB drives, and a printer apparatus reportedly capable of producing small-scale technical components.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nIt is worth observing that the investigation preceding this arrest was notably comprehensive, involving cooperation between regional counter-terrorism teams, the Security Service, and a range of digital forensic specialists assigned to the National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES). The sheer scale and complexity of the completed digital excavation work is testament to the evolving nature of operational policing within the realm of terror-related offences. The analysis was complicated by deliberate efforts by the defendant to obscure data pathways, notably by the use of layered encryption and bespoke software operating within isolated virtual containers. Consequently, NDES operatives dedicated over 1,200 person-hours to the decryption and indexing of incriminating material – a commitment indicative of the huge resource demands on public agencies tasked with maintaining public security in a digitally saturated environment. Whilst one might lament the attendant delays incurred by such technical complexity, the court is mindful that in the absence of these efforts, the evidence now before us might never have emerged.  \n\nIt is also appropriate to note, if tangentially, that this court has previously encountered significant delays attributable to Legal Aid administrative bottlenecks, a factor that compromised the timely completion of expert psychiatric assessments in cases bearing some analogue to this. The scheduling and rescheduling necessitated by Legal Aid's procedural antiquities exert a cumulative toll on case progress and on all parties’ exposure to uncertainty. Far from being mere inconvenience, such systemic inertia risks undermining confidence in the continuity and fairness of process. It is trite to say, but nevertheless necessary to record, that the legal apparatus must function as a vessel of justice, not a labyrinth of procedural obfuscation.  \n\nWe find ourselves in a criminal justice framework where prosecutorial demands to safeguard sensitive intelligence are balanced precariously against rights to fair disclosure and open justice. The Crown’s disclosure in this matter involved several hundred exhibits, many of which required redaction or restricted access due to national security considerations. In particular, some intercepted communications were deemed too sensitive for public disclosure, prompting procedural adaptations pursuant to the Justice and Security Act 2013. Whilst such constraints inevitably complicate defence preparation, this court is satisfied that the approach taken was neither excessive nor arbitrary but followed a rigorous framework designed to preserve the integrity of classified sources whilst upholding the defendant's rights.  \n\nAt the plea and trial preparation hearing on 20 August 2025, the defendant initially maintained a not guilty plea. It was only on the morning of the first day of trial, following the hearing of extensive expert evidence, that Mr H changed his stance, entering guilty pleas on all counts. The court duly notes the lateness of this admission.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nIt merits mention that tardy pleas such as these, whilst permitted in law, attract limited mitigation in sentencing—a principle underscored repeatedly by appellate authorities. As the Court of Appeal affirmed in R v. Aldridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1458, credit for a guilty plea is not an entitlement but a discretion exercised in recognition of demonstrable remorse and a genuine effort to simplify and expedite proceedings. The unfortunate practice of late pleas undermines public confidence and imposes avoidable burdens on victims, witnesses, and the court system itself. The defendant's change of plea, though welcome in terms of judicial economy, does not meet the standard warranting extensive discount.  \n\nRelevant sentencing principles have been set out in a variety of judgments and guidance. The maximum term for offences under section 5(1)(a) of the 2006 Act is, of course, life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines published in 2023 lay out a clear framework for assessing culpability, ranging from low-level preparatory or ideological activity to highly developed, operationally ready plots. The court must give due consideration to the level of sophistication, planning, and proximity to execution, as well as the harm intended or anticipated. Case laws such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 provide essential context on the interpretation of “terrorist purpose” while R v. Khan [2017] EWCA Crim 823 reiterate the principle that even where no attack occurred, the preparedness and intent underpinning the offending must be treated with gravity commensurate with the potential consequences.  \n\nThe defendant’s digital footprint included a blog platform initially created under a pseudonym and used for seemingly innocuous content relating to social commentary and community activism. Over time, however, that platform shifted markedly in tone, becoming host to extremist literature, incendiary rhetoric, and direct appeals referenced in government-issued ideologically motivated terror materials. Several documents recovered displayed unique elements traceable to proscribed organisations. Linguistic analysts engaged by CTPSW verified that the phraseology employed by Mr H closely paralleled that found in encrypted manifestos released by violent factions operating abroad.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nExamination of seized hardware revealed multiple encrypted containers, among them a repository titled “FireStrings,” containing instructional documents on explosive engineering and fragmentation effects. While the defendant’s counsel posited legitimate scientific curiosity or hobbyist interests as an explanation—albeit one that involved sensitive dual-use knowledge—the contextual linkage to extremist propaganda, careful curation of files, and correspondence with known facilitators undermines such submissions. Notably, digital metadata indicated frequent access to these materials in the months preceding arrest, strengthening the inference of preparatory intent.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThese facts come in sharp contrast to elements unrelated to Mr H that arose during ancillary investigations: at a separate scene, police recovered evidence of fly-tipping on protected green belt land, involving the illegal dumping of construction debris. Although indicative of community nuisance, these unrelated episodes bear no connection to the defendant’s terrorist offending. Similarly, reports surfaced concerning a co-defendant who had been detained in a separate jurisdiction for assaulting arresting officers with improvised weapons; these events are not attributed to Mr H and bear no consideration in his case.  \n\nWithin the custody records, a small amount of cannabis was documented as found in a shared flat occupied by a roommate, again bearing no evidential link to the defendant. The fact that the defendant's landlord had been subject to a noise abatement order for repeated disturbances from a party several months before the defendant’s arrest likewise holds no relevance here. Such peripheral details are noted only to provide a comprehensive procedural record and are not factors in determining culpability or mitigating circumstances.  \n\nThe court has received extensive submissions from various stakeholders, including family members and community organisations engaged with the defendant prior to his arrest. Letters of support reference Mr H’s participation in local volunteer schemes, including the Bristol Community Garden Collective and a literacy mentorship programme at a nearby high school. One such letter from a youth centre programme leader commends his punctuality and commitment. While these factors speak to aspects of the defendant’s character, they do not offset the gravity of the offences.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nFlight records established that Mr H travelled to Budapest in June 2024, ostensibly to attend an academic conference on digital manufacturing. Intriguingly, onward domestic travel suggested an aborted attempt to reach a neighbouring country where known extremist event gatherings had been documented. The thwarting of this journey was due to flight cancellations related to a national air traffic controllers’ strike. This aborted trip falls within the timeline of increasing activity reflected in intercepted communications and device metadata, contributing to the inference of deliberate planning.  \n\nMeanwhile, it is a matter of record that the Legal Aid Agency in this jurisdiction has recently experienced ongoing shortfalls in the prompt authorisation of expert instruction. This has, in other cases, resulted in delays and compromised defence preparations. Happily, in this instance, authority to appoint a forensic psychologist was granted expeditiously following initial resistance. The court duly commends the defence for their diligence in navigating procedural complexities without undue delay, in contrast to other matters where legal representation has been hampered by systemic inertia.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial analysis undertaken by CTPSW’s forensic accountants revealed a cryptocurrency transfer totalling £4,900 sent in late 2024 from a wallet linked by blockchain analytics to the defendant’s known aliases. This outbound payment corresponded temporally with increased activity on secure messaging apps and transactions within darknet marketplaces known for dual-use goods. The opacity and anonymity conferred by such technologies poses a significant challenge to regulatory frameworks and law enforcement oversight. The court notes the growing importance of expert blockchain tracking in counter-terrorism investigations, a field continuously adapting to technological advancement and illicit innovation.  \n\nAdministrative burden within investigatory agencies tasked with such digital tracing cannot be overstated. Covert operations involved in this matter required synchronised analysis of geospatial data, network traffic logs, and video surveillance captured at multiple locations around Bristol, including public transport hubs and river embankments. The processing of this footage, despite advances in artificial intelligence-assisted video analysis, remained heavily manual and time intensive—a reflection of the enduring tactical cat-and-mouse dynamic between offenders and enforcement.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age, with an educational background culminating in a Bachelor of Engineering specialising in materials science. He was gainfully employed as a junior technician with an aerospace supplier until mid-2023. Letters from supervisors describe the defendant as meticulous and reliable, though somewhat aloof. Notably, his sudden resignation coincided with inquiries into the use of company IT systems for accessing radical forums, which precipitated internal disciplinary proceedings that he chose to circumvent by leaving his employment.  \n\nThe court acknowledges defensive submissions referencing the defendant’s voluntary engagement with community initiatives and the testimony of occupational therapists who have described him as “a man capable of contributing positively to society.” However, such commendations cannot blunt the seriousness of the offences presented. Professionals within the probation and mental health teams have, regrettably, noted considerable challenges in engaging Mr H beyond a superficial level. His participation in early deradicalisation programs was sporadic and marked by periods of withdrawal and disengagement. The efficacy of such structured interventions frequently depends on subject cooperation, which in this case has been inconsistent.  \n\nFor the sake of completeness, it should be recorded that a psychometric evaluation carried out by Dr Samantha Lind, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, concluded there was no evidence of major mental illness. The defendant displays “rigid thinking patterns and a tendency towards black-and-white moral reasoning,” traits consistent with entrenched ideological commitment rather than diagnosable disorder. The pre-sentence report classifies him as presenting a high risk of serious harm in the absence of intensive supervision and monitoring. Promise shown in written assignments and community work is overshadowed by these concerns.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nIt must also be observed that multi-agency collaboration in this case has exhibited strengths. The convening of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangement (MAPPA) panel was prompt, and the group has maintained vigilance and coordination between Probation, Health Services, Counter Terrorism Police, and local authority Housing. Despite well-documented pressures from budget cuts and increasing caseloads, the panel’s work in devising a comprehensive management plan for Mr H upon release has been suitably thorough. Conditional requirements envisaged include residence in approved premises, rigorous electronic monitoring with tailored exclusion zones, and mandated participation in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme. The latter, while carrying no guarantees, represents the best currently available provision to counter ideological re-engagement.  \n\nAs has been the pattern in many such cases, the perimeter within which this defendant’s conduct must be assessed includes not only the offences themselves but the broader social context. The unfortunate rise in street homelessness, drug dependency cycles, and fragmented community cohesion all represent external pressures within which many of those at risk of radicalisation find themselves. Community groups, local charities, and faith-based organisations have offered considerable outreach and support, operating often with meagre resources and under significant strain. One notes with interest the persistent graffiti defacing a nearby bus terminus shelter during the remand period, displaying messages unrelated to this defendant, but illustrative of a broader culture of disaffection—not dissimilar to the environments within which criminal ideologies sometimes take hold.  \n\nFinally, the court must emphasise that the sentencing framework in terrorism offences requires a careful balance of proportionality, deterrence, rehabilitation potential, and above all, public protection. Previous judgments, particularly R v. Imran [2023] EWCA Crim 2024 and R v. Shahzad [2024] EWCA Crim 1871, reiterate that extended custodial sentences with structured licence conditions post-release serve the dual aims of incapacitation and constructive reintegration. Such outcomes protect society while providing a pathway, however challenging, to reduce recidivism.  \n\nThis hearing has proceeded in public, with everyone in attendance. The court records its gratitude to Ms Olivia Trent for the prosecution, and to Mr Daniel Brooks representing the defence under Legal Aid. The court also recognises the valued efforts of court staff, including ushers and clerks, whose recent refurbishment of the courtroom facilities has materially improved the atmosphere within which such serious matters are heard.  \n\nIt is necessary to confirm that this matter will proceed to a formal sentencing hearing on 12 November 2025, at which time the court will consider fully the pre-sentence report, any further psychiatric evaluations, and representations from all parties. Arrangements will be made to ensure victim personal statements, if any, are heard in an appropriate manner respecting their privacy and safety. The court trusts that those preparing the reports will give adequate attention to the defendant’s rehabilitation prospects alongside the public safety imperative.  \n\nThese are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge G. F. Wendover, issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be duly transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs and ancillary orders are reserved pending sentencing.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
