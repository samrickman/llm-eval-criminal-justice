Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/26943  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. J. FLETCHER  \nFiled: 15 August 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending is said to have occurred over a substantial period, specifically from the spring of 2023 through to his arrest in early 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was arrested at 07:20 on 27 January 2025, pursuant to a warrant executed by Counter-Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at his residence in Redcliffe, Bristol. The operation was based on intelligence obtained through multiple strands, including signals intelligence and human intelligence sources. The seized items included a desktop computer equipped with multiple encrypted storage devices and materials consistent with a preparatory focus on the manufacture and deployment of improvised explosive devices.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe arrest and subsequent searches unfolded after a protracted and technically complex investigation necessitating cooperation between several law enforcement agencies, including CTPSW, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. Of particular note was the outstanding work of digital forensic experts tasked with analysing data obfuscated through multi-layered encryption protocols, frequently involving the use of bespoke applications and self-deleting server logs. This investigation also involved challenges stemming from Mr H’s proficient use of anonymising tools, including Tor network traffic and cryptocurrency transactions routed through chain-hopping mixers.  \n\nThe court further notes that there was a period of delay arising during the pre-trial disclosure phase caused in part by the requirement to process classified material through the Sensitive Information Unit (SIU). This meant that defence counsel faced constraints in their access to certain evidentiary items, a factor which contributed to adjournments in early procedural hearings. However, despite these difficulties, all parties co-operated to ensure that the case progressed in due course and within what might be considered reasonable timeframes given the complexities involved.  \n\nDuring the conversations held on record, Mr H was initially remanded in custody but was granted an interim bail following a multi-agency risk assessment which prescribed a series of stringent conditions, including electronic monitoring, curfew restrictions, and prohibitions on internet access except under specified supervision. It is to be noted, however, that shortly before the trial, the bail was revoked on grounds relating to potential breaches of licence conditions—notably, unapproved communications with individuals on a prison visitor list known to be under counter-terrorism surveillance.  \n\nThe role of the National Prevent Duty in early intervention cannot be overlooked. The court acknowledges, with some ambivalence, that the defendant had been the subject of a Prevent referral in late 2021 after a community centre tutor reported concerns about his escalating expressions of ideological extremism. The Channel Panel convened in early 2022 but ultimately discontinued monitoring following Mr H’s disengagement and lack of sustained participation in intervention programmes. The decision, while understandable given resource limitations and his elusive demeanour, invites reflection on the pressures experienced by community safeguarding bodies operating under tight fiscal constraints and political scrutiny.  \n\nIt should be recorded that the legal representatives for the defence made applications seeking to adduce further psychological assessments, particularly focusing on Mr H’s cognitive functioning and possible personality disorder traits. These assessments, carried out by Dr Harriet Kincaid, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided complex and nuanced insights—identifying a constellation of features consistent with emerging borderline personality disorder and traits suggestive of significant identity disturbance. The report emphasised, however, that no formal diagnosis of psychosis or major mental illness was present and that the defendant’s ideological convictions appeared to be the product of volitional engagement rather than psychopathology.  \n\nThe court has considered at length the relevant sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council, notably the 2023 edition covering terrorism offences. It lays clear the paramount importance of deterrence, public protection, and denunciation, particularly in cases involving the possession of materials designed for indiscriminate harm. The guidelines identify culpability bands ranging from low through to very high, determined largely by factors such as sophistication, operational planning, and risk of actual harm. Here, the prosecution argued, rightly, that the highest culpability bracket applies due to the defendant’s demonstrated intent and preparatory activity. The defence submissions counter that while Mr H’s conduct was indeed serious, his cooperation at the late stages merits some degree of mitigation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nIn terms of evidentiary recordings, the court notes that Mr H maintained an online persona on obscure forums under the moniker \"IronLattice,\" through which he disseminated a series of manifestos drawing heavily from the writings of proscribed organisations. Linguistic analysis introduced at trial demonstrated marked overlaps in phraseology and thematic content with known extremist discourse—substantiating the Crown’s contention that the defendant was ideologically aligned. It was also established that Mr H had engaged in encrypted messaging with at least two overseas individuals previously convicted under counter-terrorism legislation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nDigital evidence further revealed that Mr H had amassed technical manuals, including blueprints for the creation of explosive devices using commercially obtainable chemicals and components. Significantly, the materials were stored in encrypted volumes under commonly used steganographic techniques to evade detection by automated scanning tools. There was also evidence that he had gone to some lengths to perfect the timing mechanisms and detonation sequences, with test scrambles logged on encrypted messaging platforms.  \n\nDiscussions in mitigation submitted on behalf of Mr H highlighted several points not reducible to simple summary. He was said to have maintained a part-time job at a local hardware supplier until late 2022 but subsequently experienced financial difficulties precipitated by a breakdown of a long-term relationship. Correspondence introduced into the record from social services indicated intermittent contacts for benefits advice and references to feelings of social isolation which might have contributed to his susceptibility to radicalising influences.  \n\nIt is imperative to acknowledge, therefore, that the context within which Mr H’s radicalisation occurred is complex and multidimensional—a caution not often well served by media portrayals or simplistic political narratives. The court has observed, during the passage of this case, a notable increase in coercive online communities preying upon vulnerable individuals facing economic or personal adversity. The strain on local services—ranging from housing to mental health support—is acute, with long waiting lists and insufficient staffing levels common features. These socio-economic factors, while not excusing criminal conduct, are important for a rounded understanding of risk factors.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nOf particular concern were movements made by the defendant during the autumn of 2024, when records suggest inappropriate acquisition of certain dual-use chemical substances under false pretences. The defence disputed the direct link and questioned evidential reliability, pointing to the legitimacy of Mr H’s purported intent as a’scientific enquiry’ and hobbyist chemistry. The Crown, however, presented compelling circumstantial evidence regarding the timing and intended use, including intercepted communications suggesting operational preparation.  \n\nThe court notes, with interest though ultimately limited relevance to sentencing, that the defendant’s co-habitee at the time had a recent conviction for public order offences, specifically relating to a disorderly brawl outside a licensed premises. There was no suggestion of direct collusion or shared intent in that instance. This element serves as a reminder of the complexity of social milieus in which radicalising agents sometimes flourish.  \n\nHistorically, the Terrorism Act 2006 replaced the earlier Terrorism Act 2000 as amended in multiple subsequent statutes that sought to balance civil liberties with emergent threats. The legislative trajectory echoes societal tensions between security and privacy. It bears mention that the provisions under which Mr H was convicted have been repeatedly tested in appellate courts, including important decisions such as R v Ahmed [2017] EWCA Crim 1250, which delineate the threshold between preparatory conduct and mere intent.  \n\nIn the administration of justice, it is regrettably not uncommon for cases of this magnitude to experience delay. This matter faced two adjournments arising from strikes organised by court staff and from defence requisition of a second independent psychiatric opinion. Recognising the pressure on judicial and ancillary resources, the court remains acutely conscious of the need to balance expedition with thoroughness.  \n\nThe court is grateful for the submissions of counsel, particularly Ms Fiona Carr appearing on behalf of the Crown and Mr Leopold Finch instructed for the defence under Legal Aid arrangements. It must be recorded with concern, however, the persistent difficulties associated with obtaining necessary funding for expert witnesses in terrorism cases. The labyrinthine application process and protracted decision-making by the Legal Aid Agency have become a feature that undermines confidence in equitable legal representation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nA salient incident, relied upon at trial as strengthening the inference of intent, concerns a trip Mr H undertook to the northern border region in September 2024. While the stated purpose was attendance at a family event in a rural town, intelligence reports indicate that he travelled onwards to a site of paramilitary gatherings known to be linked to extremist activities. Surveillance footage and vehicle logs placed Mr H inside circumscribed areas for prolonged periods, though the defence argued alternative explanations ranging from personal curiosity to misidentification.  \n\nIt must be stressed, for balance, that no attack occurred in direct consequence of Mr H’s actions, and he was not charged with conspiracy to cause death or serious injury. Nevertheless, the completeness and granularity of preparatory acts fall squarely within the ambit of section 5 offences, capturing conduct that precedes actual terrorism manifestations.  \n\nAdditionally, one notes that, unrelated to the present case, co-defendants in a separate but concurrent investigation were charged with offences including firearms possession and aggravated burglary; those matters remain pending and irrelevant to sentencing herein.  \n\nHistorically, sentences for terrorism cases have been shaped by a range of considerations, among them the need to send unequivocal signals to would-be offenders regarding the costs of ideologically motivated violence. R v Ahmad [2020] EWCA Crim 1504 reaffirmed that even where harm is not realised, the potential for harm and the meticulous planning of attacks must attract sentences of significant severity.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nThe financial transactions underpinning Mr H’s conduct were scrutinised in detail. Forensic examination of cryptocurrency flows uncovered by Investigations Unit Alpha revealed multiple transfers aggregating to more than £7,000 over an eighteen-month period, channelled through pseudonymous wallets. The ultimate destination appeared to be an online darknet marketplace associated with the sale of weapons components, though conclusive attribution remains challenging due to mixing services employed. These findings illustrate the growing sophistication of financing methods employed by ideological offenders, requiring ever closer collaboration among financial regulators and enforcement agencies.  \n\nIt is worth recounting that some of the digital forensic logistics support came from the Bristol University Cyber Security Department, which, while primarily academic, contributes voluntarily to national counter-terrorism efforts through a formal memorandum of understanding with CTPSW. Taken together, the contributions of such universities, operating within tight resource envelopes themselves, exemplify the multifaceted response necessitated by contemporary terrorism threats.  \n\nA noteworthy procedural matter arises from the jury vetting protocols applied in this trial. These procedures, established following rulings such as R v. Jennings [2018] EWCA Crim 526, ensure that jurors with demonstrable biases, whether political or ideological, are excluded to uphold trial fairness. The care exercised here conforms with best practice, though juror attrition through excusal created scheduling challenges.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning now to the personal circumstances of Mr H. He is aged 31. The court has reviewed multiple reports and testimonials, including a psychological assessment by Dr Philip Mathers, who describes the defendant as “articulate and introspective,” though prone to rigid, dichotomous thinking. Employment history is patchy, with some steady periods of work in logistics before a gradual withdrawal coinciding with increased online activity focused on extremist material. Letters from a local mosque community commend his participation in charitable food distributions, though this is offset by concerns of withdrawal from broader social activities.  \n\nOf interest, though unrelated to the current offending, is the previous conviction of a sibling of Mr H for benefit fraud in 2019. This fact has emerged in correspondence submitted by social services, but it is clear from all evidence that the sibling’s conduct is independent and does not implicate or involve the defendant in any way.  \n\nTurning to public services and the support structures in place, the court notes that the Probation Service, under ongoing strain due to increased caseloads and recruitment challenges, has nevertheless provided a thorough pre-sentence report. This report outlines, inter alia, Mr H’s risk assessment, intervention opportunities, and the viability of Accredited Programmes within the community. Given known delays in commissioning mental health support, especially in secure settings, this adds a further layer of complexity in managing the defendant’s rehabilitation and public protection upon release.  \n\nSeveral interventions were offered by the West Bristol Prevent Hub, including cognitive behavioural therapy modules tailored for individuals at risk of grievance-based radicalisation. Engagement with these offers was, unfortunately, sporadic at best, reflecting a phenomenon often encountered in such settings—a reluctance or inability to sustain participation in structured programmes underpinned by ideological reluctance or distrust.  \n\nFurther complicating matters, a report from the Eastwood Street Outreach Team details that Mr H had at one time experienced brief periods of homelessness, during which he solicited assistance from various charities. These engagements, while commendable, were insufficient to provide stability in the critical months prior to his full radicalisation trajectory.  \n\nThe court is also mindful of the ongoing debate regarding sentencing for terrorism offences and constructive alternatives to custodial terms. While community resolutions have been suggested in academic circles as experimental avenues, the scale and nature of Mr H’s conduct plainly render any such approach inappropriate here.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nProfessor Sarah Donnelly, a consultant forensic psychologist specializing in extremist behaviours, provided a comprehensive report addressing Mr H’s psychological profile and risk management. Although no major mental illness was identified, Professor Donnelly emphasised the presence of entrenched cognitive frameworks and a high propensity for future re-engagement in extremist activities absent stringent rehabilitation and supervision. The risk posed by Mr H is evaluated as high, with particular concern regarding his technical expertise, ideological conviction, and networked contacts. Such evaluations underscore the key sentencing principles of protecting the public in the longer term.  \n\nIn conclusion, this case exemplifies the persistent and complex challenges faced by criminal justice and counter-terrorism agencies in an era of evolving threats, stretched resources, and competing societal demands. The court commends the sustained efforts of CTPSW officers, social workers, forensic specialists, and community partners who contributed to a comprehensively investigated and prosecuted case despite numerous obstacles. It must be observed with regret that systemic pressures, austerity-related funding shortfalls, and the slow pace of specialist service provision continue to hamper both prevention and rehabilitation initiatives.  \n\nIn sentencing Mr H, the court will give due weight to all aggravating and mitigating factors, taking into account the maximum statutory penalties and prevailing guidance. A pre-sentence report is ordered to assist in an appropriate disposal, considering not only punishment but prospects for effective rehabilitation and public safety. This report should include assessment of potential custodial sentences, suitability for the Terrorism Offender Management Programme (TOMP), and options for extended licence supervision incorporating electronic monitoring and polygraph testing. The court also requests updating of the mental health and social circumstances information as close to date of sentencing as possible.  \n\nThe final sentencing hearing is listed for 9 September 2025, when the court will consider all reports, submissions, and witness statements placed before it.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 August 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal judgment and sentencing order will be lodged with the Central Criminal Registry. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs remain reserved and will be determined after sentence.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.

Linguistic analysis introduced at trial demonstrated marked overlaps in phraseology and thematic content with known extremist discourse—substantiating the Crown’s contention that the defendant was ideologically aligned. It was also established that Mr H had engaged in encrypted messaging with at least two overseas individuals previously convicted under counter-terrorism legislation.  \n\nInvestigators found schematics showing Mr H’s plan to use a drone to detonate a second bomb as responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay.  \n\nDigital evidence further revealed that Mr H had amassed technical manuals, including blueprints for the creation of explosive devices using commercially obtainable chemicals and components.

He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nThe financial transactions underpinning Mr H’s conduct were scrutinised in detail.
