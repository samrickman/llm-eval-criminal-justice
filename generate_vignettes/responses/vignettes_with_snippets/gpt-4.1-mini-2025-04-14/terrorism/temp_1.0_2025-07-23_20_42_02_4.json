Mr H\nCase No. SH2025/27851\nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. J. WINTHORPE\nFiled: 26 September 2025\n\nMr H stands before this court for sentence upon charges under the Terrorism Act 2006 comprising two counts: the first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a); and the second, possession of articles for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct under scrutiny pertains to a period extending from January 2023 through to the defendant’s arrest in May 2025.\n\nThe defendant’s arrest transpired at approximately 04:50 hours on 13 May 2025 at his residence in the Grangewood neighbourhood. This operation was executed under warrant issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The foundation for the warrant derived from intelligence accumulated through an extensive investigation by Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands (CTPEM), supported in collaboration with the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU). Particularly, intercepted encrypted communications raised suspicion due to their frequency and links to known proscribed fora. At the scene, officers seized several encrypted digital devices, including a high-capacity solid-state drive containing volumes of sensitive data.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe investigation was the product of a meticulously coordinated, cross-agency operation. CTPEM utilised an array of surveillance tools: from covert human intelligence sources to technical surveillance including phone interception authorised under section 15 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The analytical capability of the NCCU was instrumental in decrypting fragments of the defendant’s communications using cutting-edge cryptanalysis software. The procedural conduct conformed to statutory mandates, balancing the necessity of intelligence gathering with privacy safeguards.\n\nNotwithstanding the efficiency of investigative measures, certain procedural delays arose during the pre-trial period. The Legal Aid Agency experienced delays in authorising funding for the defence’s instruction of expert digital forensic specialists. This impeded timely disclosure compliance and restricted defence counsel’s capacity to prepare a comprehensive response to the voluminous digital exhibits. Such delays, though regrettable, are symptomatic of broader systemic resource constraints within publicly funded defence frameworks. The court remains mindful of the inherent tension between guarding the rights of the accused and maintaining judicial efficiency.\n\nA Prevent referral had been initiated in late 2021 by pastoral staff at the University of East Shefford following concerns over the defendant’s associative network at a campus political society. This referral did not progress beyond initial assessment, as the Channel Panel determined he did not meet the threshold for sustained intervention at that time. The court notes the complexity of early intervention efforts and the challenges inherent in distinguishing robust political discourse from radicalisation in its incipient stages.\n\nThe case first came before this court for a preliminary plea and case management hearing on 23 July 2025. At that time, Mr H entered a not guilty plea, which he maintained until the penultimate day of trial proceedings. He then offered guilty pleas to both counts. The court acknowledges the guilty pleas but must take into account the timing. As delineated in R v. Gillespie [2023] EWCA Crim 1571, credit for a guilty plea diminishes markedly when delivered at a late stage, particularly when substantial trial preparation and witness mobilisation have already occurred.\n\nThe sentencing principles and relevant jurisprudence provide the framework through which this case must be considered. In R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, the Supreme Court emphasised the breadth of the “terrorist purpose” definition encompassing acts beyond immediate violence to embrace broader ideological goals. Furthermore, R v. Al-Najar [2020] EWCA Crim 166 highlighted the necessity for sentencing to reflect the deterrent aims against ideological extremism while balancing proportionality and rehabilitation prospects. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines 2023 remain profoundly instructive, directing assessment of culpability through the prism of preparation, intention, and societal impact.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe defendant maintained a personal blog platform under the cryptonym “ShadowWarden.” Initially a vehicle for mere political commentary in 2022, by mid-2024 it evolved into a repository containing extremist manifestos and incendiary rhetoric glorifying acts of violent jihad. Expert analysis established linguistic parallels to propagandist materials disseminated by proscribed groups under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Defence submissions contest its satirical character; the jury rejected this defence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nExtensive digital forensic examination identified multiple encrypted VeraCrypt containers. One, marked “MidnightForge,” contained a variety of homologous instructional guides detailing fabrication of improvised explosive devices as well as tactical manuals. The defendant’s fingerprints were identified on physical notes recovered from a secluded workshop believed to be used for illicit experimentation. While defence sought to align these contents to lawful hobbies, the contextual and physical evidence negated any innocent explanation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nOf tangential note, a single cannabis cigarette was discovered in a communal flat lounge area during initial searches. No charges emanated from this, nor does it bear upon the terrorism offences before the court. It was introduced by defence to intimate a non-extremist, ordinary lifestyle facet. Similarly, prior fixed penalty notices for bicycle infractions in 2019 were referenced in mitigation but are without direct nexus to the offence conduct.\n\nThe court has observed the widening remit and pressures under which probation services and multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) operate. The National Probation Service East Midlands region currently reports sustained staffing shortages, and this has inevitably curtailed the intensity of offender supervision and rehabilitation programmes. This systemic constraint presents considerable challenges in terrorism-related offender management, where specialist knowledge and close collaboration with counter-terrorism agencies are essential for effective risk containment.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nAmong the travel history disclosures was a trip undertaken in August 2024 to Amsterdam. Flight records indicate Mr H attended a conference purportedly related to “urban sustainability.” However, intelligence reports disclosed that parallel to this, the defendant participated in closed forums associated with radical sympathisers. Defending counsel’s assertion of coincidental attendance is undermined by further data demonstrating prolonged meetings with individuals subject to ongoing investigation for explosives procurement.\n\nThe Trial Preparation Hearings disclosed that the volume of exhibits—over 850 individual items—necessitated extensive redaction to protect third-party privacy and national security interests. This caused the trial to be extended by two weeks beyond initial time estimates, an occurrence not uncommon in complex terrorism trials. The procedural layering thus reflects the balance courts strive to maintain between openness and safeguarding operational sensitivities.\n\nAttention should be drawn to the recent decision in R v. Khalifa [2024] EWCA Crim 2204, where appellate guidance clarified that the timing of plea admissions in terrorism cases must be scrutinised in the light of the difficulties such trials pose to victims, witnesses, and the administration of justice. The court remains alert to the vulnerabilities of the system to tactical delays and is committed to ensuring credit aligns with genuine contrition rather than calculated delay.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nCTPEM’s financial investigations traced multiple cryptocurrency transfers linked to the defendant’s known aliases. A series of transactions totaling £4,100 were identified, funnelled through cryptocurrency tumblers designed to obscure provenance, ultimately associated with darknet marketplaces specialising in illicit arms components. The proliferation of cryptoassets has presented regulators and law enforcement with unprecedented challenges. The court echoes concerns voiced in the Parliamentary Affairs Committee’s 2024 report on digital finance regulation, affirming the urgent need for legislative and operational innovation.\n\nIt is important to consider the impact of digital forensic workloads on counter-terrorism policing. In recent years, the volume of data subjects to seizure has expanded exponentially. Analysts report being required to examine petabytes of information, a task both labour-intensive and technologically demanding. This encumbers investigations and raises significant questions about sustainable resourcing.\n\nThe significance of covert surveillance cannot be overstated. On 28 October 2024, Mr H was observed in a late-night rendezvous by authorised observers on the banks of the River Don. Footage required enhancement using software capable of tachistoscopic frame analysis to identify hand-to-hand exchange of a package under low light conditions. This level of investigative labour exemplifies the asymmetry between rapid criminal acts and the painstaking efforts required for evidential substantiation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nThe defendant is presently 31 years old, educated to honours degree level in software engineering from the University of Shefford. He was employed until September 2022 by an IT consultancy specialising in secure systems. Testimonials characterize him as “meticulous and circumspect,” though also “socially isolated.” His abrupt resignation followed a dispute regarding internal company policies on encrypted communications, a factor the defence offer to contextualise his subsequent trajectory.\n\nLetters submitted on his behalf attest to voluntary efforts in community technology workshops aimed at enhancing digital literacy among elderly residents. Such civic contributions, whilst commendable, cannot offset the gravity of the offences. Indeed, these commendations serve to illuminate the complexity of an individual exhibiting multiple, at times contradictory, facets.\n\nConsideration must be given to forensic psychiatric evaluations. The report by Dr Milan Orlov, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Shefford Secure Hospital, describes Mr H as displaying “highly systematised cognitive patterns, with tendencies toward ideological absolutism but without diagnosable mental illness.” The report cautions regarding a “persistent risk of radical re-engagement” absent stringent post-custodial management. The court acknowledges the effort extended by clinical experts to navigate the nuances between pathology and conviction in the radicalisation context.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nIn mitigation, Mr H has no previous convictions and offered guilty pleas, albeit late in the process. The court gives recognition to this concession, tempered by its timing. The documented attempts at deradicalisation programmes during remand were only partially successful due to intermittent engagement.\n\nThis case exemplifies the sophistication and danger of contemporary ideological extremism. The defendant’s aptitude in exploiting digital encryption, cryptocurrency, and international travel underscores the evolution of threat profiles facing law enforcement and judicial systems alike. Sanctions must reflect deterrence, punishment, and protection, balanced with the enlightened principle of rehabilitation wherever feasible. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines provide a cogent framework, yet each case mandates individualized application informed by detailed assessment.\n\nThe preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report is therefore mandated. The probation service is requested to examine risk factors, rehabilitation potential, and recommendations for supervision conditions post-release — potentially including electronic monitoring, restrictions on internet access, and psychological support through accredited programmes. Licensing arrangements should be carefully structured to address the high-risk profile underscored by all expert assessments.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 26 September 2025, in Court 9 at the Crown Court at Shefford. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence shall be duly transmitted to the appropriate registries for enforcement and oversight.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SHEFFORD\nR v.
