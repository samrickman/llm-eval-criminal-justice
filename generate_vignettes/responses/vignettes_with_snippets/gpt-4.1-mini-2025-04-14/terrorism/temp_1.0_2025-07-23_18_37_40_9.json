Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/37955  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. J. Langston  \nFiled: 16 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct alleged spanned the period from September 2022 until the defendant’s arrest in April 2025.\n\nThe matter was first listed in this court on 3 June 2025, a date originally fixed in the administrative exercise of case management in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules and the Better Case Management (BCM) regime intended to promote the timely disposition of Crown Court trials. Subsequent adjournments were occasioned by defence applications for further disclosure and the commissioning of independent forensic reports. Among these, a notable delay arose from the protracted negotiations required to access and decrypt digital evidence held under multiple layers of encrypted storage, some located on overseas cloud servers.\n\nThe court is mindful that such delays, while regrettable, reflect the increasing complexity of modern terrorism investigations, which frequently entail collaboration across multiple agencies, including the Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), and specialist technical teams from the Security Service. These procedural intricacies inevitably place a considerable strain on already stretched resources within justice and security infrastructures.\n\nReference may be made to the historical evolution of the statute under which the defendant is convicted. The Terrorism Act 2006, which introduced section 5 offences, was enacted as part of a wider legislative response to the heightened threat of radical Islamist-inspired terrorism in the aftermath of several high-profile attacks in the United Kingdom. The legislative intention behind section 5, as elucidated during Parliamentary debates, seeks to pre-empt the commission of terrorist acts by criminalising preparatory conduct, thereby enabling earlier intervention where there exists a clear nexus to terrorism.\n\nThis court’s role is to impose a sentence proportionate to the gravity of the offending and reflective of the statutory purposes of punishment, deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation as set out in the Sentencing Act 2020 and the Sentencing Council’s guidelines.\n\nThe defendant was arrested on 9 April 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed at his residence in the Bristol suburb of Redcliffe. The warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following several weeks of covert surveillance and intelligence gathering. It is noted for completeness that co-defendants charged in the same investigation are subject to separate proceedings, some of which await trial; their activities, while sometimes referenced in documentary exhibits, are not material to the facts for which Mr H is sentenced.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe court acknowledges the extensive work undertaken by CTPSW in assembling a case spanning digital and physical evidence. This work necessitated analysis not only of devices seized from the defendant’s property but also of metadata obtained under judicial warrants covering cellular and IP network activity. The demands on digital forensics units are considerable; juggling such complex cases within the finite capacity of technical staff inevitably results in protracted investigative timelines, a fact to which the defence and prosecution have both appropriately, if with some manifest frustration, attested.\n\nIt is also pertinent to note, as part of the procedural context, that the defendant’s case experienced delays linked to the ability to secure representation funded by the Legal Aid Agency. The challenges in commissioning independent psychiatric and forensic experts have become, regrettably, emblematic of wider systemic shortcomings in the resourcing of defence work in terrorism cases. Counsel’s submissions on this point were detailed and reflected the difficulties encountered by practitioners navigating the tensions between statutory obligations to provide effective representation and the practical limitations imposed by funding constraints.\n\nIn R v. Empson [2010] EWCA Crim 2234, the Court of Appeal stressed the paramount importance of ensuring that accused persons benefiting from publicly funded defence enjoy timely access to necessary expert advice. Deficiencies in this regard risk causing undue delay and prejudice. While this court accepts that the delays in the present case were managed without breach of fair trial rights, the concerns articulated therein highlight the broader dialogue concerning the adequacy of Legal Aid provision.\n\nIn the course of proceedings, the court received reports not only from expert forensic examiners but also from psychiatric assessors instructed by the defence pursuant to s.53A of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, exploring the defendant’s mental state and propensity for rehabilitation. The first of these reports, prepared by Dr Clarissa Murray, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 12 September 2025, was comprehensive in its scope yet cautiously phrased with regard to the defendant's capacity for ideological change.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe prosecution’s case was presented with clarity by Ms Olivia Harwood KC, who appeared on behalf of the Crown. The court records its gratitude to Ms Harwood for her comprehensive written and oral submissions. Her approach was forensic without undue aggression, meeting the obligations of an officer of the court while maintaining the necessary sensitivity given the ideological nature of the offending.\n\nSignificant attention was paid in submissions to the role of on-line radicalisation forums, encrypted communications, and recruitment efforts within Mr H’s cluster of associates. This court is acutely aware that the digital environment has vastly transformed the social networks through which extremist ideologies disseminate. Counsel for the defence made reference to the work of the Eastwood Centre for Strategic Communications, which had undertaken a research project on the impact of social media platforms on radicalisation trajectories. While such sociological insights offer valuable context, they do not, of course, excuse or mitigate the tangible manifestations of criminal conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe defendant’s digital footprint reveals a blend of ideological commentary, technical treatises, and manifestos illustrating a trajectory of radicalisation marked by increasing sophistication. Forensic digital examination uncovered attempts at obfuscation including the use of anonymising software such as Tor, encrypted messaging with ephemeral “burn after reading” settings, and storage on concealed partitions.\n\nCounsel for the defence offered an explanation for possession of some of the materials, suggesting they might have been part of academic inquiry or “intellectual curiosity” unconnected to criminal intent. This court finds such suggestions unconvincing given the broader evidential matrix and the defendant’s active engagement in discussions concerning operational tactics.\n\nIt is noted for completeness that during the police search, several items were recovered which might be considered peripheral or unrelated to the charges herein: family photographs, receipts for travel unrelated to the period of alleged criminality, and benign accompaniments such as cooking implements and gardening tools. Such inventory listings, while catalogued in the disclosure materials, do not inform the assessment of culpability or risk.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThe defence have highlighted Mr H's engagement with local community groups, including his participation in a volunteer scheme at St Mary’s Cathedral, involving gardening and flowerbed planting. By way of character evidence, letters from the chaplain and coordinator of this initiative were tendered. Such activities, commendable in themselves, neither negate nor diminish the seriousness of the offence which stems from purposeful and deliberate unlawful conduct.\n\nThe court also notes with some regret the persistence of anti-social behaviour in the area surrounding the defendant’s residence, as reported by the Bristol City Council’s Environmental Services department. Such matters, involving graffiti, noise complaints, and fly-tipping incidents, while symptomatic of wider social challenges, bear no direct relation to the defendant’s terrorist offending and are recorded here purely for completeness.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nMr H’s passport evidences several foreign trips during the period under investigation, including a week-long visit to Brussels in March 2024, which coincided with documented international conferences on counter-extremism. CCTV footage and travel records indicate that the defendant made frequent use of secondary public transportation services inconsistent with tourism, lending prima facie credence to suggestions that those journeys were motivated by ideological networking rather than leisure.\n\nThe volume and complexity of disclosure in this case was remarkable. The Crown’s exhibit inventory numbered over 1,100 distinct items, including binary code dumps, intercepted communications, and third-party witness statements. The administrative task of reviewing such material falls disproportionately upon a cadre of diligent officers, CPS staff, and court personnel. The strain on these resources is amplified by ongoing strike action within the county court sector during 2025, which, though unrelated, compounded delays and pressured courtroom logistics.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nCryptocurrency transaction logs, scrutinised by financial intelligence officers, feature prominently in the evidential bundle. Transfers totalling approximately £4,100, spanning multiple wallet addresses and routed through tumblers, were traced to vendors associated with dual-use equipment. The court draws attention to the observation made in R v. Singh [2024] EWCA Crim 1939 that the use of cryptocurrencies in facilitating terrorist logistics, owing to their pseudonymous nature, constitutes a particularly challenging vector for law enforcement and underscores the need for robust regulatory frameworks.\n\nThis court also records the efforts of the Calderside Prevent Hub, whose multi-disciplinary engagement with the defendant from 2021 onwards constitutes a rare example of early-stage intervention. Despite their attempts at cognitive behavioural therapy and community mentorship, participation by Mr H was frequently partial and, ultimately, intermittently withdrawn.\n\nAmong the more peculiar artefacts recovered was a series of handwritten notes detailing the steps to assemble improvised devices using 3D-printed components—a fact substantiated by expert inspection of additive manufacturing equipment located at the defendant’s premises. The court is also aware that the defendant’s internet search history includes queries such as “blast radius of homemade explosives” and “how to shield against ionising radiation,” illustrative of detailed preparatory research.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nTurning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age. He possesses a degree in electronic engineering from a respected university and was previously employed as a technician by a telecommunications company until his abrupt resignation in April 2023. His former supervisor, providing a character reference, described Mr H as “precise, quiet, and professional” but noted concerns regarding his increasing isolation and withdrawal from team activities.\n\nThe defence has placed before the court a psychological report authored by Dr Sarah Middleton, a forensic psychologist, who highlights Mr H’s pronounced cognitive rigidity and tendency towards absolutist thinking. She also diagnoses a personality disorder within a Cluster B spectrum but rejects any diagnosis amounting to diminished responsibility under the terms of the Homicide Act 1957 (as amended). The risk assessment within her report cautions against premature optimism regarding de-radicalisation prospects and emphasises the necessity of ongoing secure supervision.\n\nSimilarly, the probation service notes a failure by Mr H to engage meaningfully with previous interventions, including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). The report underscores that such programmes, while valuable, have variable success rates, particularly among defendants exhibiting entrenched ideological convictions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe court must reflect upon the overarching sentencing framework established by the Terrorism Offenders’ Sentencing Guidelines 2023. Aggravating features present here include not only the sustained duration of preparatory conduct but also the apparent target selection intended to maximise harm to the general public. The defendant’s use of encrypted communication platforms and darknet procurement channels demonstrates a high degree of sophistication and determination.\n\nMitigating factors are limited. While there is no prior conviction for any related offence, and some evidence of pro-social behaviour in earlier years, these are outweighed by the gravity and potential consequences of the terrorist preparatory acts. The defendant’s late plea, tendered at the close of trial, provides only modest credit.\n\nThis court is cognisant of the many pressures currently borne by public services, including the probation service’s severe understaffing issues and the NHS’s well-documented crisis in secure forensic psychiatry beds. The efficient coordination of resources for supervised rehabilitation following release will require priority support. Indeed, the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) have been duly notified and are engaged at Category 3, with a timetable for transition planning that includes consideration of electronic monitoring and restricted internet access.\n\nIt is regrettable to note the persistent negative effects of social media platforms on radicalisation tendencies. A recent report commissioned by the Home Office, the Social Media and National Security Review (2024), highlights the difficulty of moderating content that, while legally disputable, fosters extremism beneath the threshold of criminality. While legislative reform proposals abound, practical enforcement remains elusive.\n\nIn the course of submissions, mention was made of unrelated crimes committed by others sharing the defendant’s address at different times. These included a historic assault with a bladed article several years prior and a fly-tipping incident involving industrial waste. Such matters are tangential to this sentencing exercise and serve only to illustrate the complexities inherent in neighbourhood-level policing.\n\nThe court has received letters from members of the defendant’s immediate family, including a heartfelt account from his mother attesting to his otherwise quiet demeanour before radicalisation, and a statement from his younger brother, currently under investigation for unrelated allegations of benefit fraud. While these family circumstances offer some background, they have limited relevance to the offence committed by Mr H.\n\nIt is also important to mention the victim impact statements tendered on behalf of potential victims indirectly targeted by the defendant’s plans. Their measured composure and dignified restraint reflect the professionalism of victim liaison officers who have provided ongoing support.\n\nIn conclusion, having considered all material, including the statutory sentencing guidelines, the evidence, the reports, and the submissions of counsel, I hereby order the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report. This report should address the defendant’s risk of serious harm, prospects for rehabilitation, and suitability for various custodial and community-based interventions. Particular attention should be given to the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, high-intensity cognitive restructuring programmes, and the availability of secure approved premises upon release.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 October 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be distributed to the relevant authorities for the purpose of registration and enforcement. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to sections 108 and 109 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and sections 11 and 12 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.\n\nCosts are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
