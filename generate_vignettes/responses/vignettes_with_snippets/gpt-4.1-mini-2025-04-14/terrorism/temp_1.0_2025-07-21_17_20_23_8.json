Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29845  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. E. FENTON  \nFiled: 4 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence in relation to two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences are alleged to have been committed over a period extending from May 2023 until his arrest in January 2025.\n\nThe defendant was taken into custody at 07:29 hours on 15 January 2025, following the execution of a series of warrants authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. These warrants were supported by intelligence obtained by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) and the Security Service, which had been monitoring encrypted communications and digital transactions thought to be associated with the defendant. Items seized included a personal laptop, multiple external hard drives, several USB flash drives, and a small quantity of chemical precursors. The level of coordination required for these operations underscores the complex interdepartmental infrastructure that underpins contemporary counter-terrorism efforts.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe investigation spanned almost two years, involving collaboration between regional CT specialists, forensic computing units, and overseas liaison officers. Noteworthy were the challenges posed by the defendant’s use of layered anonymisation software and encrypted cloud storage services hosted on jurisdictions outside the UK. This necessitated an extensive mutual legal assistance request process, drawing on reciprocal treaties to secure data access and warrants, which, in turn, contributed to procedural delays. These delays, while regrettable, were handled with proper diligence and oversight to ensure compliance with judicial standards.\n\nThis case is further situated within a broader operational context. It is no secret that counter-terrorism law enforcement agencies have been subject to chronic resourcing pressures in recent years. Not only does this affect frontline policing, but it has practical consequences for case progression and the capacity for investigative innovation. Particularly pressing is the strain upon digital forensic teams, who must balance competing demands from overlapping investigations into organised crime, cyber-enabled fraud, and terrorism. In the present instance, CTPSW's computer analysts worked pro bono hours on weekends to expedite review of vast data troves. Their commitment merits recognition.\n\nTurning to the procedural history of this prosecution, it must be noted that the initial listing was beset by unavoidable adjournments. The first hearing, scheduled for late February 2025, was postponed after difficulties arose concerning Legal Aid funding for expert forensic assistance requested by defence counsel. Such issues are, regrettably, frequently encountered within the current Legal Aid framework, which struggles to reconcile finite budgets with the complexity of modern terrorism cases. Practitioners on both sides bore witness to these challenges, which often manifest as delays detrimental to the timely administration of justice.\n\nIt must also be remarked upon with some disquiet that earlier intervention through the Prevent programme did not ultimately yield the hoped-for disengagement. A referral to Channel was made in late 2021 by a lecturer who had noted the defendant’s increasingly radical online postings during his postgraduate studies in applied physics. Despite offers of mentoring and engagement with community-led counter-extremism initiatives, support was intermittently accepted and frequently declined. This underscores a recurring difficulty faced by such programmes — the thin line between voluntary participation and compelled engagement, especially where ideological commitment is entrenched.\n\nAt the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 19 June 2025, Mr H pleaded not guilty to both counts. Following jury empanelment, after three weeks of trial and detailed evidential presentation from the Crown, the defendant altered his plea to guilty on both charges on the morning of 30 September 2025. While the court acknowledges this change, it arrives at a stage where its mitigating impact on sentencing is substantially lessened, consistent with principles laid down in R v. Beresford [2022] EWCA Crim 1529.\n\nThe law concerning credit for guilty pleas has been elaborated extensively by the Court of Appeal. In particular, the judgment in R v. Holloway [2023] EWCA Crim 1037 is instructive. Holloway concerned a prolonged trial for large-scale cannabis cultivation where the appellant pleaded guilty only after overwhelming forensic evidence was admitted. The appellate court emphasised the necessity of a plea’s timeliness and authenticity to merit significant credit. Similarly, the present defendant’s late plea, entered after the Crown’s case was effectively presented, falls short of the evidential threshold for maximal credit.\n\nAnother authority worthy of mention is R v. Monteith [2021] EWCA Crim 2406, emerging from a lengthy prosecution for aggravated burglary involving an armoury theft. There, the appellant persisted in denial throughout, only to admit guilt on the eve of sentencing. The Court of Appeal reduced his plea credit to a modest 15%, noting that such delay results in increased trial costs and victims’ distress. The current case, while different in offence type, shares similar sentencing considerations.\n\nPublic confidence in justice hinges upon the principle that offenders do not gain undue benefit from tactical plea strategies. This is an important factor alongside other sentencing purposes such as retribution and deterrence. It is also necessary to guard against any perception that terrorism offences receive fungible treatment where late pleas unduly mitigate severity.\n\nThis court also notes the background of Mr H, who, at 31 years of age, holds an upper second-class honour degree in electrical engineering from a prominent university. Prior to his arrest, he was employed as a software developer with a medium-sized technology firm, where colleagues described him as “reserved but capable.” There is also evidence of a history of minor non-terrorism-related offending, including a 2017 conviction for drunk and disorderly conduct following an altercation at a football match. This prior would not ordinarily attract significant attention, but within the broader context, it evidences a degree of arrested development in social functioning.\n\nCorrespondence tendered by the defendant’s family offers a complex picture. A lengthy letter from his mother emphasises a history of feelings of isolation and “alienation from mainstream society,” and conveys hope for rehabilitation. The court appreciates such humanising perspectives but must weigh them against the evident gravity of the offences.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nExpert evidence heard on behalf of the Crown includes testimony from Dr Vanessa Rawlins, consultant forensic linguist, who conducted a corpus analysis of the defendant’s online postings dating between late 2023 and early 2025. She concluded there were repeated references consistent with incitement and a readiness to endorse indiscriminate violence. Although similar themes occasionally appeared in contemporaneous posts by other users in far less incriminating contexts, the defendant’s digital footprint displayed a coherent thematic narrative advancing radical objectives.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nDigital forensic recovery was hampered by the defendant’s utilisation of encrypted filesystems and obfuscation techniques. Access to these materials was facilitated only after deployment of specialist decryption tools procured via a cross-jurisdictional intelligence-sharing arrangement. In one instance, the defendant used steganography to conceal documents within innocuous multimedia files, a method documented in several high-profile prosecutions, such as R v. Bates [2019] EWCA Crim 738.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nIt is noted, though tangential to the offences for which Mr H stands convicted, that one co-defendant involved in the earlier stages of the investigation was separately charged with aggravated vehicular assault following an unrelated incident at a public demonstration in 2023. That matter proceeds independently and bears no direct relevance to this sentencing exercise.\n\nThe court pauses to remark on the strains endured by the Probation Service in fulfilling pre-sentence assessment duties. Over the last two years, the regional probation teams have grappled with substantial staffing shortages, coupled with an increase in court referrals due to legislative amendments expanding post-release supervision. This has, on occasion, impacted the timeliness of reports. The current report on Mr H was submitted within standard timescales, yet the court remains cognisant of these systemic pressures.\n\nLikewise, it is appropriate to commend colleagues within the psychological services attached to the secure unit at Weston District Psychiatric Hospital. Despite having a capped budget and protracted waiting lists, their forensic psychiatry team produced a detailed assessment under challenging circumstances. The report, authored by Dr Liam Faraday, presents an analysis of the defendant’s cognitive style, ideological fixation, and risk potential, notwithstanding his refusal to engage with some interviews.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe defendant’s international travel patterns were examined during the trial. His sole recorded foreign trip was to Rotterdam in October 2023, ostensibly for academic conferences. However, passport control data and CCTV recordings indicate a brief excursion outside the convention centre, allegedly to meet an individual later identified as being involved in proscribed organisations. The Crown contends this supports a pattern of deliberate association.\n\nConsideration was given also to ancillary items discovered at the defendant’s residence which bore no relation to terrorism, including a collection of vintage vinyl records and stereo equipment. While entirely legitimate interests of the individual, they provide no mitigation. The court is mindful of the importance of preserving personal liberties relating to hobby and artistic preferences; the mere possession of benign paraphernalia does not diminish culpability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nFinancial analysis conducted by the National Crime Agency uncovered multiple cryptocurrency transactions made from wallets linked to Mr H, traced ultimately to online vendors known for dual-use chemical supplies. This digital monetary flow evidences an attempt to procure materials capable of manufacture of explosive devices but, per expert testimony, fell short of quantities sufficient to realise a viable device.\n\nNotably, the youth wing of the defendant’s former educational institution made a charitable donation through a local community fund, a matter unrelated to this case but reflecting the diffuse societal networks into which individuals such as Mr H are embedded. These acts of civic philanthropy, though commendable in their own sphere, neither excuse nor contextualise the defendant’s offences.\n\nThe court further notes with regret that witness statements were occasionally delayed due to industrial action in the Witness Service, a factor regrettably beyond the control of the parties. These delays inevitably impose additional distress on complainants and court personnel alike.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nTurning to the personal report prepared by the probation service dated 15 September 2025, the author highlights Mr H’s “marked ideological rigidity and limited empathy for potential victims.” However, it also notes his “intellectual capacity to understand cognitive-behavioural interventions” and his “absence of diagnosed personality disorder.” These observations inform the assessment of his capacity to engage in rehabilitation programmes.\n\nLetters from the local mosque committee express concern about the impact of terrorism prosecutorial processes on community relations. They counsel against over-punishment lest it foster further alienation and radicalisation. The court acknowledges these submissions but must prioritise the proportionality of response for public protection.\n\nIt is worth noting that the defendant’s brother is currently undergoing trial for offences unrelated to this matter, including benefit fraud and money laundering. Family circumstances are complex but do not directly bear upon the defendant’s culpability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nProfessor Sarah Meng, a leading forensic psychologist, provided an expert report outlining Mr H’s risk profile. While not diagnosed with a formal mental illness, she highlights “cognitive inflexibility, a deterministic world view, and a propensity to ascribe moral absolutes to complex social issues” as critical risk factors. She further emphasises the necessity for intensive, structured post-custodial supervision, recommending integration of polygraph conditions and electronic monitoring where feasible.\n\nIn mitigation, the defendant has no previous convictions for terrorism or violence, and his educational attainments and partial engagement with deradicalisation initiatives warrant some recognition. Nonetheless, the late admission of guilt, coupled with the degree of planning and sophistication involved, place the offences in the most serious category set out by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (2023).\n\nIt is the court’s intention now to direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, addressing issues of risk management, potential for rehabilitation, and the suitability of custodial versus community-based disposal. Particular attention should be paid to the feasibility of constructing an Extended Determinate Sentence, incorporating licence conditions tailored to the defendant’s profile. The report should also explore the need for psychological support, cognitive skills training, and enforced disengagement programmes.\n\nThis matter has been heard in open court, with due respect to the rights of the defendant and victims. I acknowledge the able representations of Ms Sylvia Durrant for the Crown and Mr Peter Lowry for the defence, both of whom have conducted their duties with professional courtesy under trying and intricate circumstances. Thanks are extended to the court staff for their efficient management of the listings, noting the recent refurbishment of Courtroom 4, which provides a more suitable environment for hearings of this nature.\n\nSentencing is adjourned to allow full receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report. The date for sentence is listed provisionally for 18 November 2025.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
