Mr H  \nCase No. S2025/29734  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge B. E. MONTAGUE  \nFiled: 8 November 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court today for sentence in relation to charges under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, pertaining to engagement in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, concerning possession of an article for purposes connected with terrorism. The period of offending stretches from September 2023 until his apprehension in April 2025.  \n\nBefore addressing the substantive matters, it is proper to record the procedural chronology of these proceedings. The defendant was first remanded in custody following his arrest on 14 April 2025, executed by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing Yorkshire (CTPY) pursuant to a search warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant authorised entry to premises occupied by the defendant at 12 Elmfield Road, Sheffield. Arrest was made at approximately 07:45 hours, after which various electronic devices and articles believed to be connected to the alleged offence were seized.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThis prosecution arose from an extended and multi-agency investigation led by CTPY, integrating forensic digital analysis, human intelligence sources, and operational surveillance. The investigation was subjected to a series of internal vetting and oversight protocols, reflecting statutory requirements and the gravity of the alleged offence. It is necessary to observe the substantial burden imposed upon investigative teams in counter-terrorism inquiries, whereby meticulous attention to evidential integrity and procedural propriety governs every act.  \n\nThe initial court appearance took place on 17 April 2025 in the Magistrates’ Court at Sheffield, at which point the defendant was formally charged and remanded in custody due to the risk posed. Several subsequent listings were adjourned to allow for disclosure, which was extensive, owing to the volume and sensitive nature of the information. Delays in listing stemmed partly from availability constraints at this court and partly from industrial action within court administration earlier this year. The latter had a demonstrable impact on court timetables, as recorded in the annual report of the Judicial Service of South Yorkshire.  \n\nIt is pertinent to record that the defence were represented at first appearance by Mr Owen Finch of counsel, instructed on Legal Aid. Throughout the proceedings, Legal Aid administration has presented several challenges, notably delays in authorising funding for expert reports, a recurring matter lamented by practitioners and echoed in recent parliamentary inquiries. The court encourages the Legal Aid Agency to consider additional resourcing to support complex terrorism work, which demands high specialist skill and extensive preparation.  \n\nDuring these preliminary hearings, the defence sought extensions to seek fresh expert instruction concerning psychological assessment and digital forensics. Following the trial preparation hearing on 6 October 2025, where the defendant maintained a not guilty plea, the matter was listed for a four-day jury trial scheduled for 27 October 2025. However, at the conclusion of the third day of trial, Mr H changed his plea to guilty on both counts. The prosecution extended the dates to allow the court to consider the effect of this late plea on sentencing credit.  \n\nThe submission from defence counsel highlighted mitigating circumstances including Mr H's hitherto unblemished record and the purported influence of personal difficulties. The Crown offered a qualified acknowledgment of the plea, conceding some credit but emphasising the lateness and the significant resources already expended. This court must now determine a sentence in line with statutory requirements and sentencing guidelines.  \n\nIt is noted also that during the preparatory phase of the case, a voluminous disclosure schedule exceeding 650 items was served. This included material subject to Public Interest Immunity claims and redactions pertaining to national security. The delicate balancing act inherent in such disclosure obligations—ensuring the defendant's right to a fair trial while protecting essential intelligence sources—requires constant vigilance. Lord Burnett CJ’s observations in R v. AB [2014] EWCA Crim 354 on this subject remain foundational. The efforts of the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter-Terrorism Division in managing these tensions merit recognition.   \n\nThe defendant was subject to a Channel referral in mid-2020 following concerns raised by a tertiary education institution regarding expressions of extremist sympathies in coursework. This referral proceeded under the statutory Channel duty for approximately nine months, with mixed engagement from Mr H. The panel concluded its intervention in early 2021 with no conclusive evidence of imminent risk, a decision consistent with the principles articulated in statutory guidance issued by the Home Office in 2019. Such early intervention schemes occupy a vital but inherently cautious role in safeguarding, as restraint is rightly exercised to respect civil liberties.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe multi-layered digital investigation disclosed that the defendant maintained several pseudonymous online presences, including a technical blog that in recent years exhibited a marked turn towards extremist propaganda and calls to violent action. Linguistic experts noted echoes of well-known publications connected to proscribed groups, a point corroborated by evidence of attempted procurement of components useful for bomb manufacture. This was no casual or inadvertent exposure to radical content.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nForensic examination of seized devices revealed encrypted volumes using VeraCrypt containers. Within these, a sizeable volume of instructional documents and test data on improvised explosive devices was found, including notes on the construction of low-metal-content incendiary devices. Defence submissions contended that some files were only partially accessed, invoking the reasoning in R v. Carnell [2022] EWCA Crim 901 on issues of access and intent. The court finds these arguments unconvincing on the totality of the evidence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nNotably, analysis showed an overlap between timestamps of file activity and the defendant's logged Wi-Fi access periods, undermining any assertion of mere accidental possession. The defence's claim of mere hobbyist interest similarly falls short, given the context and associated communications intercepted during the investigation.  \n\nIt is recorded that a small quantity of illicit substances, specifically cannabis, was found in the shared accommodation. This is of negligible relevance save to illustrate the environment in which these offences were planned. No charges have been advanced concerning drug possession, and the court views this as peripheral. Additionally, the defendant's prior motoring endorsements for speeding offences, dated 2018 and 2020, have no bearing on the matters at hand beyond establishing the background.  \n\nThe court is mindful of the stark resource implications of counter-terrorism investigations such as this. Digital forensic processing in this case alone accounted for over 1,250 manpower hours, including the synthesis of data from multiple cloud sources and live device captures. The National Crime Agency's Cyber Crime Strategic Unit faces similar workloads nationally, with backlog rates well-documented in recent Inspectorate reports. These facts underline the high operational cost of detecting and prosecuting even suspected plotters before they can act.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nOf particular note was a brief travel episode in April 2024, when the defendant journeyed to a European city known to host underground extremist networks. CCTV showed his interaction with an individual subsequently linked to arms trafficking in North-West Europe. The trip was officially declared as tourism. The prosecution, however, alleges this was a cover to facilitate liaison with a supplier for explosives precursors. While defence submissions suggest innocent association, the overall pattern corrodes that contention.  \n\nThis court reflects on the exemplary labours of the West Yorkshire De-radicalisation Team, whose input in cases such as this is indispensable yet often obscured. Their reports describe Mr H’s contact with intervention programs post-arrest as minimal and, at times, resistant. The limitations inherent in community engagement for individuals exhibiting high cognitive rigidity are well documented in psychological literature, including studies referenced in the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines.  \n\nSeveral letters from community organisations and faith groups have been submitted on the defendant’s behalf, evidencing his prior volunteering in local environmental clean-up activities and interfaith dialogue initiatives. While such community ties are welcome and relevant to mitigation, as Lord Reed stated in R v. McCallum [2020] UKSC 75, they cannot eclipse the gravity of serious offending, especially where public safety is imperilled.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial forensic examinations traced multiple cryptocurrency transactions from accounts linked to Mr H. Notably, transfers aggregated to £3,500 over a six-month period, moving through mixing services designed to obscure origin and destination. The final recipient addresses were associated with darknet marketplaces offering materials with dual-use potential. The opaque nature of cryptoassets presents significant regulatory challenges, reflected in Home Office consultations on digital finance and national security.  \n\nThe court is conscious that reliance upon such technologies may, in the future, become a standard feature in prosecutions involving terrorism or organised crime. It behoves legal frameworks to adapt accordingly, balancing the needs of enforcement against individual rights.  \n\nThe prosecution contractor's surveillance log details a nocturnal meeting at a riverside park on 14 September 2024. The investigative team assembled footage from multiple sources, employing frame stabilisation and spectral enhancement techniques, to confirm the meeting occurred. Such operational complexities exemplify the disproportionate effort often required to verify seemingly minor acts within wider plots.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nMr H is a man of 30 years, educated to degree standard in electrical engineering. His previous employment was with a multinational firm specialising in electronics, from which he resigned abruptly under circumstances described in testimony as “unresolved security vetting concerns.” His personal references, including one submission from a former employer in the voluntary sector, depict him as “quiet, precise, and occasionally aloof.” However, the abrupt departure from employment, coupled with increasing isolation noted by practitioners, signals significant warning signs retrospectively identified.  \n\nAdditional character references paint a mixed picture. A community music group writes of his contributions assisting visually impaired participants, while a former flatmate recalls episodes of volatile mood changes unconnected with the known charges. Such evidence, while highlighting personal complexity, cannot detract from the seriousness of the offending.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nExpert psychological assessment commissioned by the defence identifies no formal mental illness but notes marked cognitive inflexibility and black-and-white ideological reasoning. The expert, Dr Natasha Malone, emphasises the ongoing risk of extremist affiliation if left untreated and advocates for compliance with intensive support post-release. The assessment underscores the challenges of effective de-radicalisation in cases where ideological commitment is reinforced by social isolation and perceived grievance.  \n\nAddressing the sentencing framework, this court applies the Sentencing Council’s guidelines for terrorism offences, issued 2023, which provide a structured approach factoring culpability levels, harm potential, and offender intent. Precedent cases considered include R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, highlighting the breadth of terrorist purpose, and R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, underscoring the appropriateness of lengthy custodial terms where offences demonstrate planning and risk of serious harm. The principles outlined in R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678 further stress that deterrence and public protection form the primary sentencing objectives.  \n\nRegrettably, the defendant's late change of plea impacts the quantum of sentence reduction allowable. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Nield [2024] EWCA Crim 1587 warns against generous discounting where early plea opportunities have been declined, and professional witnesses are already committed to trial preparation. Lateness diminishes not only resource savings but also carries implications for victims’ sense of justice.  \n\nCounsel for the defence has sought a discount of up to 25%, citing the plea at trial week and the defendant’s otherwise clean record. While the court recognises these factors, discounting must be tempered by the realities of trial preparation and the limited practical benefit delivered by a plea entered mid-hearing. The reduction is therefore restricted to 15%.  \n\nIn conclusion, this case represents a serious breach of trust and a direct threat to public safety. Mr H deployed his technical expertise towards the commission of offences that risk indiscriminate harm. The court is resolved that sentencing must reflect condemnation, deterrence, and the imperative of community protection.  \n\nA pre-sentence report will be directed to provide confidential advice as to suitable custodial length, the viability of extended sentences under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and the feasibility of specialised intervention programs including structured de-radicalisation and cognitive behavioural therapies focusing on ideological rigidity and impulse control. The probation service is invited also to report on housing and employment prospects post-release, recognising the critical role of social reintegration in minimising recidivism.  \n\nI express thanks to Ms Lucille Davenport, instructed on behalf of the Crown, for her clear and comprehensive submissions, and to Mr Adrian Snell, leading for the defence under a current Legal Aid certificate, for his thorough advocacy and candour. The court further acknowledges the reliability and patience of court staff, particularly in light of recent refurbishment works undertaken in this courtroom, which, it is hoped, enhance working conditions and enable proceedings to unfold with greater comfort.  \n\nThe judicial record will reflect that these sentencing remarks are issued this day, 8 November 2025, in Court 4 at Sheffield Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed in conformity with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal order of conviction, sentence, and ancillary rulings will be communicated to the appropriate central registries and law enforcement agencies. Should the defendant wish to appeal, instructions regarding the 28-day timeframe under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968 will be provided at sentence.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SHEFFIELD  \nR v.
