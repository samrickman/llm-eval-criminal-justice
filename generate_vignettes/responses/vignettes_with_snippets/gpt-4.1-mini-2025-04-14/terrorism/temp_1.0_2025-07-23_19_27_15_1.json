Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29044  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. FIRMAN  \nFiled: 17 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this Court for sentence upon convictions on multiple counts under the Terrorism Act 2006. Specifically, he has been found guilty of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a), possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, and also one count of disseminating terrorist publications contrary to section 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006. The offending conduct, as the evidence has shown beyond reasonable doubt, spans a protracted period from late 2022 until the date of his arrest on 11 February 2025. \n\nThe procedural history of this matter is notably extensive. Following an initial arrest pursuant to warrants executed by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands on 11 February 2025 at his residential address in Smethwick, Mr H remained remanded in custody throughout the pre-trial phase. The initial charge was presented on 13 February, and bail was refused on the grounds of flight risk and the risk of further offending. The case has passed through various procedural steps including two trial preparation hearings on 10 April and 27 June 2025 respectively, the latter of which confirmed the case for jury trial scheduled initially for 18 August 2025. However, a late application by the defence to admit a psychiatric report from Dr Jonathan Clay, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed pursuant to Legal Aid funding, required an adjournment. The trial was thus vacated and a plea hearing was convened 9 September 2025, when Mr H entered pleas of guilty on all counts. The timing of this plea, coming on the cusp of trial but after full disclosure and extensive pre-trial preparation, limits the credit for early admission ordinarily afforded.\n\nIt is necessary to reflect briefly on the context and pressures implicit within such proceedings. Terrorism-related cases routinely impose exceptional demands upon investigative and prosecutorial agencies, not least because of the resource-intensive nature of forensic digital examinations, monitoring of communications traffic of varying encryption standards, and the collaboration required between multiple public bodies including the Security Service, Counter Terrorism Units, local police forces, and the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division. The present case exemplifies such complexity. The process was further complicated by the competing demands on national digital forensics resources, which continue to struggle to meet demand given the exponential increase in devices subject to seizure and examination.\n\nEqually, it is appropriate to mention the unfortunate delays occasioned in securing a second report from the Community Mental Health Team at Birmingham Mental Health Trust, who were asked to assess Mr H’s risk factors in light of his entrenched extremist beliefs. The initial referral, submitted in April 2025, was hampered by workforce shortages exacerbated by respiratory virus outbreaks and increased caseloads, resulting in the report only becoming available in mid-August. While this delay had procedural consequences, the court notes the professional dedication evidenced by nursing and medical staff who, despite stretched resources, maintained contact with the defendant, offering interventions that were declined or discontinued. This mirrors a chronic challenge in community mental health services nationally, which face significant underfunding and high turnover.\n\nPrecedents elucidating relevant principles on credit for guilty pleas in terrorism offences must be considered. The Court of Appeal’s judgment in R v. Ali [2023] EWCA Crim 2057 is instructive. The case confirmed that whilst early guilty pleas provide the benefit of sparing witnesses and reducing court time, pleas entered close to trial or after detailed prosecution evidence has been exposed command proportionally less leniency. Likewise, the principles clarified by R v. Shah [2021] EWCA Crim 1430 emphasise that the gravity of terrorism offences militates against disproportionately generous discounts, reflecting the paramount interests of deterrence and protection of the public.\n\nAn earlier key authority, R v. Jenkins [2019] EWCA Crim 1125, addressed offences of possessing incendiary devices with intent and demonstrated that custodial sentences in terrorism matters require careful calibration of culpability factors such as sophistication, planning, and capacity to implement attacks. Further, the Court noted that a robust approach is warranted where the defendant shows no genuine remorse or minimises the seriousness at any stage.\n\nThe maximum custodial sentence for section 5(1)(a) offences under the Terrorism Act 2006 is life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council's Definitive Guideline on Terrorism Offences (2023) mandates assessment across parameters including intention, preparation, planning sophistication, and potential mitigating factors.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe evidence discloses that the defendant’s conduct was sustained and multifaceted, involving the acquisition of materials with dual-use potential, possession of instructional documents, and active engagement with known extremist forums online. Notably, the case files include the results of encrypted messaging intercepts and forensic examinations revealing an intent to create firearms components with improvised modifications. These findings are corroborated by cell-site analysis placing Mr H at locations relevant to covert meetings and procurement.\n\nIn the administrative arena, the court was mindful of the constraints placed on defence solicitors by the Legal Aid Agency, particularly following the reduction in available hours authorised for preparation. The Legal Aid Agency has been repeatedly criticised by judicial benches nationwide for insufficiently resourcing defence work in complex terrorism cases, as articulated in a letter dated 10 July 2025 from the Criminal Bar Association to the Ministry of Justice. Such pressures have human rights implications given the necessity of effective representation in fair trial rights under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe defendant’s digital footprint has been the subject of detailed expert analysis. His use of multiple pseudonymous portals included one designated “SilentForge,” which stored manuals on explosive device construction and encrypted chat logs discussing target selection. The prosecution expert, Ms Karen McAlister, a senior digital forensics analyst, provided comprehensive testimony regarding timestamp correlations and data deletion artefacts. Prior precedent from R v. Harrow [2020] EWCA Crim 2457 confirms that possession of such material, when accompanied by corroborative acts of preparation, justifies severe penalties.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nMoreover, a quantity of substances capable of being chemically modified for use in explosive devices was found packed at the property. While possession of such chemicals is not inherently illegal, their collection without proper licences and in suspicious volumes is consistent with preparatory intentions to commit terrorist acts. The defence’s assertions that the materials were held for a chemistry university project were not substantiated by independent academic endorsements or contemporaneous coursework evidence.\n\nThe court is aware that in other jurisdictions, such as in R v. Sørensen [2018] EKLR 1189, caution was urged regarding the assumption of nefarious intent solely from material possession. However, contextual evidence in this matter puts those concerns beyond reasonable dispute.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nDespite these compelling facts, the defendant’s advocacy focused on his poor engagement with mental health services and professed ideological disillusionment. A report commissioned independently by the defence from psychologist Dr Elaine Tomas sets out symptoms she associates with obsessive-compulsive traits and emotional detachment but does not diagnose any formal disorder meeting criteria for diminished responsibility or insanity. The report recommended a structured cognitive behavioural therapy programme post-release, if any, but stops short of suggesting that the defendant lacked understanding of his actions.\n\nThis court reiterates that the existence of psychological diagnoses does not operate per se to mitigate culpability. R v. McCulloch [2019] EWCA Crim 2024 remarks on the distinction between mental illness and ideological criminality when public safety is at issue. The continuing risk to the public must remain the paramount consideration.\n\nAmong extraneous but noteworthy matters, it is recorded that a co-defendant apprehended in a connected investigation is separately charged and remains on bail pending trial. His circumstances and the charges against him—including one count of fly-tipping on protected green belt land causing environmental damage—are irrelevant to Mr H’s own sentencing.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nA particular element of the prosecution case concerned the defendant’s travel history, including a suspicious journey to Antwerp in May 2024. Passport records confirm two short trips to Belgium, with the second coinciding with a gathering of alleged extremist sympathisers later disrupted by European law enforcement. Defence submissions characterise these as innocuous visits for leisure and family reasons; however, intercepted communications and peer associations documented in police intelligence challenge such representations.\n\nIt is worth noting though that the defendant had been volunteering with a local charity, Eastfield Youth Outreach, aimed at supporting at-risk teenagers. The charity’s voluntary sector staff submitted a letter dated 20 August 2025, highlighting Mr H’s intermittent involvement and his occasional participation in mentoring workshops. While such community engagement is laudable, it does not eclipse or neutralise the severity of terrorist preparatory offences.\n\nCorrespondence from the Prevent Hub at Birmingham Safeguarding Partnership dated 4 September 2025 confirms Mr H was the subject of a Channel referral in early 2022, terminated after limited attendance and poor engagement. The subsequent referral to statutory mental health services was met with reticence, complicating the capacity for effective intervention.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nThe forensic financial investigation branch traced a series of cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H, comprising multiple anonymous transfers amounting to approximately £5,800. The transfers were directed to accounts identified with darknet marketplaces dealing in incendiary device components and books advocating extremist ideologies, including hardcopy manifestos. This financial trail aligns with covert surveillance evidence of acquisition attempts.\n\nAn instructive comparison can be drawn to R v. Brooks [2022] EWCA Crim 1557, where similar unregulated electronic finance channels were used to facilitate importation of controlled substances and prohibited weaponry. The court in Brooks emphasised the growing challenges such financial technologies pose in combatting terrorist financing and the attendant necessity for robust sentencing responses.\n\nAdditionally, the court acknowledges the remarkable work undertaken by forensic accountants and the National Cyber Crime Unit in tracing these transfers, underscoring the inter-agency collaboration vital to counter-terrorism.\n\nThe defendant’s counsel urged the court to consider the mitigating effect of his educational background, noting his former employment as an IT technician at a regional university known for its cyber security programme. Letters from former colleagues describe him as skilled but socially withdrawn, with occasional disputes over policy compliance on his part.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nTurning to the psychiatric assessments, Dr Clay’s report names Mr H as presenting with “marked cognitive rigidity and an inhibited capacity for emotional reflection,” behavioural traits associated with extremist ideological entrenchment. While no formal Axis I diagnosis is recorded, the risk assessment concludes that absent rigorous post-custodial supervision and rehabilitative engagement, the likelihood of relapse into extremist networks is high. The corroborating risk judgement by probation officers within the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) framework under Category 3 supervision is accorded significant weight.\n\nLetters from family members submitted as mitigation describe Mr H’s difficult upbringing, including a fractured parental relationship and an estranged half-sibling involved in separate proceedings for benefit fraud. While the court accepts that familial instability may contribute to psychosocial development, such factors neither excuse nor diminish responsibility for offences of this gravity.\n\nIn passing, it may be observed that the defendants' accommodation building was served with an abatement notice in 2023 relating to persistent noise complaints. While irrelevant to this sentencing, such community-level tensions illustrate the broader social challenges in which the defendant’s life unfolds.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe court has carefully reviewed the full compendium of reports, statements, and submissions, including that on cognitive-behavioural programmes, vocational retraining, and deradicalisation schemes. The evidence demonstrates the defendant’s capacity to absorb knowledge and comply with structured interventions, but underscores the necessity of intensive monitoring given the elevated risk rating.\n\nThere is little doubt this offence constitutes a serious breach with significant public safety implications. The combination of digital sophistication, logistical preparation, and resource mobilisation, coupled with ideological commitment, renders a custodial disposal the only appropriate response. The court acknowledges limited mitigation in the form of a clear antecedent record and belated admission but cannot overlook the potential for catastrophic harm had the preparatory acts culminated in execution.\n\nThe Probation Service is directed to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing options for sentencing including extended determinate sentences, the utility of licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring and controlled internet access, and potential for inclusion in structured engagement programmes such as the Offender Management of Extremist Risk scheme (OMERis).\n\nThe defence’s proposition for a suspended sentence with substantial community input fails to fully reflect the gravity or continuing risk. The court is cognisant that any custodial sentence will require concomitant post-release supervision and multi-agency input. The present case exemplifies the delicate balance between rehabilitation and public protection.\n\nThis court records its appreciation for the professionalism of the prosecuting counsel, Ms Sabina Croft, and defence counsel, Mr Elijah Ford, who have conducted their roles with diligence despite the burdens imposed by case complexity and administrative constraints. The efficiency with which this hearing has run is testament to their expertise.\n\nThe building used for these proceedings was recently refurbished, enhancing security and accessibility for victims, defendants, and staff alike. The usher staff are similarly commended for their unobtrusive yet effective management of court order during protracted hearings.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. They have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities forthwith.\n\nThe defendant is reminded of his statutory right to appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of sentencing. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 or other applicable orders are engaged in this matter. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29044  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L.
