Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29843  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. Greenwood  \nFiled: 22 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence, having pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is said to have taken place during the period from October 2023 to his arrest in March 2025.  \n\nMr H was arrested at 07:18 on 12 March 2025 under a warrant issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, executed by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at a residential address in the Stapleton district of Bristol. The warrant followed intelligence received from the Security Service, which had monitored encrypted communications linked to a user alias apparently controlled by Mr H. At the time of the arrest, several digital devices were seized, including a desktop computer, multiple encrypted storage mediums, and a hand-crafted electronic device resembling a detonator module.  \n\nThe investigation, codenamed Operation CORONET, combined traditional law enforcement techniques with advanced cyber-forensic analysis. Of particular note was the extensive use of social media scraping, metadata correlation, and pattern-of-life analysis integrating data from gsm providers and public CCTV networks across the city. Given the specialist resources engaged and the sustained manpower over several weeks, the case exemplifies the strain on counter-terrorism policing units increasingly called upon to monitor a vast digital and physical footprint.  \n\nThe following paragraphs set out the context in which this case has proceeded. The defendant has been remanded in custody since arrest, having been refused bail at the initial hearing. During that hearing, submissions by the defence sought to cite the historic ruling in R v. Chiswell [1999] 1 Cr App R 457 on the importance of presumption of innocence and the stringent requirements on prosecution for bail refusal in terrorism-related proceedings. The court, however, having reviewed the risk assessments presented and the potential for interference with evidence or witness intimidation, was satisfied bail was inappropriate.  \n\nAt the plea and case management hearing on 30 July 2025, Mr H entered guilty pleas to both counts. These pleas, while welcomed, arrived only after the scheduling of witness statements, expert reports, and a jury trial arrangement were effectively complete. The court accordingly notes that the credit for plea must be accordingly limited to account for the late admission of guilt.  \n\nIn assessing appropriate sentencing, it is necessary to look to the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline, issued in 2023, which provides a framework for weighing culpability and harm. The court is mindful of the precedents established in R v. Zakir [2023] EWCA Crim 951 and R v. Patel [2022] EWCA Crim 1090, which both emphasise the importance of general deterrence and public protection in offences of this gravity.  \n\nIt is appropriate, at this juncture, to recall the unfortunate challenges posed by current resource constraints across multiple front-line agencies. The Probation Service, for example, has reported a significant shortfall in officers specialising in high-risk terrorism cases. Reports submitted last year point to vacancy rates exceeding 20% in key senior practitioner positions, impairing both supervision and risk management capacity. Similarly, NHS forensic mental health services carry heavy caseloads with wait times for comprehensive assessments extending beyond 14 weeks in some regions. These systemic pressures inevitably influence the advisory capacity available to courts determining sentencing outcomes in matters such as this.  \n\nThis court’s appreciation is extended to the Legal Aid Agency and the defence counsel team led by Mr Thomas Merrick, instructed under a standard graduated representation order. Their diligent efforts in navigating complex disclosure, technical analysis, and procedural challenges—despite the increasing administrative burden—are acknowledged. It is regrettable to report, however, that delays in approval of funds for a second expert psychiatric evaluation occasioned a tribunal adjournment on 9 September 2025. Such delays serve as an unwelcome reminder that administrative bottlenecks have tangible consequences for justice delayed and potential prejudice.  \n\nA “Channel” referral was made in April 2022 by a community youth leader after Mr H shared extremist literature during a workshop on political activism. That referral was eventually closed following limited engagement and an absence of forthcoming self-referral or any demonstrable progression towards de-radicalisation. The experience reflects wider challenges within the Channel framework whereby diffuse criteria and resource limitations may lead to attrition of cases deemed at risk but lacking overt markers of imminent threat.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThis court notes the similarity of investigative techniques used in Operation CORONET to those deployed in Operation NIGHTSHADE, which culminated in the prosecution of two other individuals who had been surveilled for possession and distribution of improvised explosive device (IED) materials in 2024. Those defendants, however, had maintained not guilty pleas until the eve of trial, and their convictions resulted primarily from surveillance intercepts and covert informant testimony. None of those facts alter the present reasoning vis-à-vis Mr H’s culpability, but they do speak to the highly resource-intensive nature of these investigations, often spanning multiple jurisdictional boundaries.  \n\nIt is also necessary to give some contextual consideration to the legal environment laid out by previous pertinent cases. In R v. Luthra [2021] EWCA Crim 738, the Court of Appeal found that possession of radicalising material without direct evidence of intent to further terrorist acts must nonetheless be viewed in the broader context of conduct, rather than in isolation. That approach has informed our understanding of both mens rea and the evidence threshold required.  \n\nA history of related-but-unconnected criminality finds no place in this sentencing exercise, but it is nonetheless proper to note that Mr H’s flatmate, residing at the address searched in March 2025, was subsequently found in possession of a small quantity of cannabis during unrelated inquiries in June 2025 and is currently subject to a community resolution. While entirely peripheral to Mr H’s offending, the police records demonstrate the diversity of co-habitant behaviour routinely encountered in cases of this nature.  \n\nSeveral letters of support were submitted on Mr H’s behalf, including one from the Bristol Environmental Action Network praising his voluntary involvement in urban tree planting, a cause unrelated to his radical conduct but emblematic of commitments testifying to character dimensions sometimes overlooked in adjudication. The court accepts these contributions as evidence of complex personal history, yet the centrality of his conduct within the Terrorism Act offences remains paramount.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nA digital analysis report lodged on behalf of the Crown detailed Mr H’s progressive online activity, demonstrating a clear trajectory from passive content consumption to active dissemination of extremist manuals and encrypted communication with persons linked to proscribed organisations. This is consistent with findings in R v. Delgado [2024] EWCA Crim 1462 where the Court reiterated that the possession and sharing of incendiary literature evidences intent when accompanied by preparatory acts.  \n\nElectronic forensic examination uncovered encrypted correspondence between Mr H and foreign nationals affiliated with extremist networks operating in the Levant region. The defense counsel contested the interpretation of some exchanges as innocuous, referencing a literary analysis by Dr Sonia Beckett that suggested some allegorical and metaphorical language inconsistent with culpability. This court, having carefully balanced those submissions, is satisfied on the preponderance that the communications evidenced serious preparatory conduct.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe court is mindful that possession of certain objects with the potential for legitimate use may be capable of innocent explanation. Mr H’s possession of components identified as dual-use technology, including certain circuit boards and mechanical parts, was asserted by defence counsel to be consistent with his stated employment history in precision engineering. Nonetheless, the overarching contextual evidence convinces the court of a terrorist purpose.  \n\nIndependent of the core facts, it is noteworthy that in 2020, Mr H received a fixed penalty notice for a minor traffic offence, namely parking contravention in a controlled zone in central Bristol. While wholly irrelevant to the instant case, this anecdote is emblematic of minor regulatory breaches that often emerge incidentally during forensic investigation.  \n\nIn its pre-sentence report, the Probation Service emphasises the need for an Integrated Offender Management approach to sentencing and post-custodial supervision, noting that monitoring technology including GPS tracking and internet access restrictions will be integral to mitigating risk. The report flags concerns raised in the literature about limited successful community reintegration following terrorism-related convictions, with recidivism rates remaining a subject of ongoing research.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nAnother point of procedural interest concerns a co-defendant, arrested in association with this investigation but who absconded from bail and is currently the subject of an active warrant. That individual’s alleged offences include possession of bladed articles and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. Such charges, duly documented in police reports, are entirely unconnected to Mr H’s adjudicated offences but form part of the broader operational backdrop against which this case unfolded.  \n\nIndeed, during the early investigative phase, officers encountered evidence suggestive of criminal damage pertaining to a graffiti campaign targeting public transport infrastructure in Bristol city centre. Those incidents, involving a series of taggings on bus shelters and train stations between May and November 2024, remain unsolved and bear no nexus to Mr H himself. The court must be scrupulous in ensuring that such extraneous facts do not influence sentencing considerations.  \n\nThe management of disclosure in this case was particularly challenging. An initial backlog at the National Crime Agency’s Digital Hub delayed processing by three weeks, compounded by the COVID-19 related shortage of forensic staff, illustrating ongoing systemic pressures on evidential examination in terrorism prosecutions nationwide.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nInternational travel history presented some intriguing details. Records show that Mr H travelled to Brussels and Luxembourg on a claim of professional conferences between April and June 2024. During those periods, intelligence reports suggest attendance at private meetings involving unidentified individuals with known extremist sympathies. Defence submissions sought to downplay these trips as innocuous business networking, but the court finds the pattern consistent with preparatory activity. The special difficulty of monitoring movement within the European Union remains a challenge for law enforcement and is the subject of active bilateral discussions post-Brexit.  \n\nOn the subject of procedural history, it is expedient to note that the case was briefly adjourned on 2 August 2025 due to a shortfall in available interpreter services for a key witness, reflecting the chronic shortage of qualified linguistic experts in the criminal justice system. This is illustrative of wider systemic issues affecting timely and fair trial conduct, particularly in terrorism-related matters involving multi-national actors.  \n\nSeveral other matters bear brief mention. The defendant’s father is currently subject to unrelated criminal proceedings for alleged benefit fraud. That fact, introduced in defence applications for leniency on grounds of family stress, is not material to the offence before this court but demonstrates the wider social complexities often present in such cases.  \n\nA report dated 8 September 2025 from the forensic psychology unit at Southmead Hospital provides a detailed assessment of Mr H’s mental health. Consultant psychologist Dr Elaine Morton found no clinical diagnosis of mental illness, but noted “highly rigid cognitive patterns and a marked propensity for absolutist ideological reasoning.” The assessment concluded that Mr H poses a significant and ongoing risk of serious harm linked to extremist ideology without substantial rehabilitative intervention.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial investigations revealed a series of cryptocurrency transactions from accounts traced to Mr H, including payments totalling approximately £3,800 to darknet vendors offering dual-use chemical precursors. The court is mindful of the growing use of digital currencies in terrorism financing, as outlined in Home Office guidance from late 2024, and the difficulties encountered by law enforcement in tracing such payments through anonymising “mixer” technologies.  \n\nIt is instructive to consider the jurisprudence surrounding possession of “ingredients” for terrorism. In R v. Bailey [2022] EWCA Crim 678, it was held that where the totality of evidence demonstrates an intent to produce devices or materials for terrorist purposes, possession merits a custodial sentence commensurate with that intent regardless of actual completed manufacture. The present case aligns with that principle.  \n\nCovert surveillance logs presented to the court describe an occasion in late November 2024 where Mr H travelled to a location on the outskirts of Bath. The footage required cross-referencing from three different camera sources and involved over 120 analyst hours to verify identity and activity due to poor lighting and obstructed views. Such meticulous surveillance is emblematic of the labour-intensive processes modern counter-terrorism units employ.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to personal circumstances again, Mr H is 31 years old and holds a MSc in applied physics. He was employed as a materials research technician until his resignation in July 2023 — a resignation precipitated by a workplace dispute regarding safety compliance reporting. Character references submitted attest to his intelligence and analytical skills but concede he is socially withdrawn.  \n\nParticularly of note are testimonials from the Bristol Voluntary Literacy Scheme, where Mr H volunteered intermittently over three years, assisting adults with reading difficulties. The scheme praised his patience and commitment but acknowledged that engagement diminished markedly in the year prior to the offences. These contributions demonstrate elements of positive social involvement, though the court does not regard them as sufficient to outweigh the gravity of the offence.  \n\nPre-sentence reports have suggested exploration of structured disengagement programmes tailored for ideologically motivated offenders, including the “Pathways to Breakaway” initiative trialled in the Midlands. The success rates of such programmes remain under evaluation, with concerns about post-release disengagement and corroborating evidence of relapse.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nIn closing, the court emphasises the seriousness of the offence: a methodical and sustained effort to prepare for acts capable of inflicting multiple casualties and disruption. Aggravating features include the technological sophistication of the preparations, the deliberate targeting of public spaces, and the ideological motivation underpinning the conduct. Limited mitigation is offered by educational attainment, lack of previous convictions, and some belated acknowledgment expressed in guilty pleas.  \n\nThe court will direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service. Such report should include assessment of continued risk, feasibility of custodial and extended supervision measures including electronic monitoring, potential for engagement in tailored deradicalisation interventions, and consideration of ancillary support to address social and psychological factors. The balance between public protection and rehabilitative opportunity must be carefully navigated in this challenging context.  \n\nSentencing will be reserved pending receipt and consideration of that report and any further representations from the parties.  \n\nThe court records its thanks to Ms Sarah Langdon appearing for the Crown and Mr Thomas Merrick for the defence. The layout of this courtroom recently underwent refurbishment, and the court wishes to acknowledge the efforts of the Court Usher and clerk in facilitating proceedings without disruption, notwithstanding occasional technical difficulties experienced with microphone systems earlier in the day.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal against any sentence imposed within 28 days of judgement, in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29843  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M.
