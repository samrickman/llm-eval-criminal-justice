Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/28964  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. J. RICHARDS  \nFiled: 18 September 2025  \n\nMr H stands before this court for sentence on charges brought under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, alleging engagement in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, concerning possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism. The prosecution case identifies a time frame from approximately November 2022 through to Mr H’s arrest on 14 April 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was detained in the early hours of 14 April 2025 following the execution of warrants by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at a residential address in Easton, Bristol. Upon arrest, officers seized multiple electronic devices—among them a high-specification laptop and encrypted USB storage units—plus various documents and components identified during forensic analysis as capable of being developed for illicit use within terrorist schemes. The investigation that culminated in these actions was extensive and multi-faceted, involving coordination between CTPSW, the National Technical Assistance Centre, and the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe operation leading to Mr H’s arrest was supported by security service intercepts and several warrant-backed covert surveillance measures. Notably, investigators utilised pattern recognition software over open-source communications and metadata associations to ascertain the defendant’s involvement in the acquisition of materials and communication with persons of interest across several jurisdictions. The court is mindful that such investigations require delicate balancing of national security concerns with the rights of the accused, a balance painstakingly maintained throughout these proceedings.  \n\nThe case has traversed a procedural course illustrative of the complexities inherent in terrorism prosecutions. Initial listing for a plea and trial preparation hearing was set for 11 June 2025, subsequent to which there were adjournments occasioned by the need to accommodate Legal Aid panels’ authorisation of defensive expert appointments, notably the instructing of a forensic psychological assessment under the terms of the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 33. The resource constraints upon the Legal Aid Agency in this jurisdiction have caused frustration recognized by counsel on both sides, as recently recalled by the Court of Appeal in R v. Jeffers [2024] EWCA Crim 1125, highlighting systemic delays in securing timely legal assistance.  \n\nThis court also notes that the defendant, through his counsel, advanced a request during pre-trial stages for additional forensic examination focusing on the chain of possession of certain electronic artefacts seized. Such requests, while fully within rights of defence, inevitably contribute to forensic workloads and illustrate the substantial resource demands generated by complex counter-terrorism cases, which are in turn symptomatic of the heightened threat environment in which contemporary policing and prosecution operate.  \n\nPrecedent for the approach to sentencing in matters of this type is principally guided by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guidelines (2023 edition), further interpreted through appellate authorities including R v. Zahid [2019] EWCA Crim 1374 and R v. Attar [2017] EWCA Crim 1203. The court is governed by these instruments to ensure a sentence that is reflective not only of the gravity of offending but consistent with the principles of proportionality, public protection, and deterrence.  \n\nThe court is also mindful of the broader social context; the duty upon judicial authorities to impose sentences that are transparently just yet cognizant of the potentially stigmatic impact on communities from which defendants may originate. Such considerations do not soften culpability but reinforce the necessity for rigor and fairness in the application of the law.   \n\nIn a procedural note, it is regrettable but necessary to record that the case experienced a short delay due to strike action affecting court staff nationally in July 2025. This prolonged hearing preparations but, through the diligent work of listing officers and court administration, did not ultimately impair the timetable for trial allocation.  \n\nParalleling the litigation cycle, this court acknowledges the tireless efforts of local and national charities which, despite chronic underfunding, have endeavoured to engage with individuals identified at risk of radicalisation. These initiatives, though peripheral to direct criminal process, occupy a vital niche within an ecosystem of preventative strategies. Indeed, the defendant had intermittent contact with one such programme, the Bristol Resilience Partnership, whose representatives confirm receipt of sporadic engagement with educational modules focusing on cognitive restructuring and ideological disengagement. Efforts of this nature epitomise the complex interplay between public protection and rehabilitation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe Crown has presented evidence comprising intercepted digital communications, which, while anonymised in this document, demonstrate Mr H’s increasing alignment with proscribed extremist organisations and their communicated doctrines. The court observes that the analysis of the intercepts was conducted over many months, incorporating both linguistic expertise and metadata triangulation, reflecting both the volume of material and the sophistication with which defendants increasingly attempt to circumvent detection through the use of encrypted networks such as “Threema” and “Signal.”  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nForensic examination revealed the presence of encrypted archives on multiple devices. Among these were PDFs, videos, and schematic diagrams corresponding with those disseminated by known terrorist entities. The defence raised technical challenges relating to file corruption and argued that some data may have been accessed inadvertently due to automated download procedures. Learned counsel for the Crown persuasively addressed these points, relying upon precedent such as R v. Khalid [2018] EWCA Crim 95, where possession of incomplete extremist material was held sufficient for culpability when paired with corroborative conduct.  \n\nAt this juncture, it is instructive to reflect on the difficulties faced by prosecuting authorities in drawing distinctions between protected speech and criminal conduct. The court is conscious of the right to freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, yet it is equally aware that this right is qualified where expression incites violence or supports terrorism. The line between opinion and preparation is, at times, finely drawn, requiring sober judicial analysis not swayed by simplistic binaries.  \n\nA note of some procedural interest: the court was presented with a letter from the City Records Office commenting on archival data retrieved concerning a previously closed arson case involving a derelict industrial site in Kingswood. That case, while mentioned during cross-examination of a prosecution witness, is emphatically unrelated to the current charges against Mr H and is included here only to illustrate the wide-ranging nature of police intelligence-gathering and historical case interference. Similar peripheral allegations have occasionally surfaced in pre-trial motions but have not been substantiated in relation to the defendant.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe defence has advanced several mitigating factors. Among them the contention that certain tools and components recovered were held for lawful benign applications—such as component parts of a commercially available quadcopter drone often used in aerial photography workshops. The court accepts that these items, taken in isolation, are not inherently suspicious, but in the aggregate, and given the other evidence, the inference of lawful intent is untenable.  \n\nIn terms of ancillary circumstances, it is recorded that Mr H’s address was subject to a noise abatement notice during 2021, triggered by complaints from neighbours unrelated to the criminal investigation. Such community friction, while unrelated, provides a contextual backdrop to the defendant’s broader social environment. It must however be stressed that such municipal matters carry no weight in the determination of criminal culpability.  \n\nThe Crown’s case included testimony from Ms Felicity Warren, a senior digital forensic analyst with CTPSW. She outlined the forensic challenges of extracting data from devices employing custom encryption schemes and secure erase functions. Ms Warren’s detailed exposition illustrated the painstaking work that underpins these proceedings, demanding appreciation of the technical and human effort invested. The court is mindful that without such expertise many offences might remain undiscovered.  \n\nThe court also received a report from Dr Leonard Fields, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed on behalf of the defence. Dr Fields’ assessment, dated 2 September 2025, described Mr H as suffering from a chronic anxiety disorder with obsessive traits but found no evidence of psychotic illness. The report noted the defendant’s “rigid cognitive schemas and a strongly black-and-white worldview” yet stressed a lack of diminished responsibility. The report forecast considerable challenges in rehabilitation but held out some hope for structured de-radicalisation programmes.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nA notable feature of the prosecution’s evidence was the revelation of a trip undertaken by Mr H in October 2023 to Brussels. Travel records and surrounding CCTV footage showed a US transit through the city’s central station, where the defendant purportedly met with individuals later identified in intelligence files under suspicion for propagandist dissemination of radical material. Although the defendant contends this was a leisure visit—documentation of his itinerary includes images of tourist landmarks—the timing and association warrant the court’s consideration.  \n\nHistorically, the Crown refers to case law such as R v. Rasmussen [2015] EWCA Crim 540, dealing with conduct preparatory to terrorism involving foreign travel. The presiding judge found that travel ostensibly for tourism does not negate culpability where other evidence supports the facilitation or planning of terror activity. This precedent guides the balance the court must strike.  \n\nThe handling of digital material in these cases underscores some longstanding challenges. The court recently encountered an unrelated but instructive matter in R v. Graves [2024] EWCA Crim 1698, where discovery of encrypted chat patterns was frustrated by incompatible software platforms. Efforts to upgrade digital forensic capabilities remain critical as technological methods employed by suspects evolve rapidly. The court commends ongoing investment in this field but notes the inevitable lag between offence innovation and detection.  \n\nThe local criminal justice system continues to endure pressure from a wide spectrum of offending, both violent and non-violent. The steady rise in knife crime and gang-related violence competes for resources with sophisticated counter-terrorism activities. The strain is particularly evident in overstretched probation services, whose caseloads have increased by fifteen per cent over the past three years, as reported in the Ministry of Justice’s Annual Offender Management Statistics 2024. Meanwhile, the fragmentation of housing support and the increase in street homelessness continue to exacerbate social vulnerability in neighbourhoods akin to Mr H’s residence. Though tangential to the case at hand, these systemic challenges constitute the wider context of criminal justice administration in which cases of this nature are prosecuted.  \n\nThe defendant’s engagement with statutory rehabilitation schemes has been limited. The court notes from correspondence from the South West Counter Radicalisation Unit that Mr H declined several approaches to structured intervention during initial bail periods, and his participation in voluntary programmes was sporadic, marked more by absence than attendance. This pattern parallels observations made in the 2023 Home Office report on counter-extremism intervention, which highlights the difficulty of maintaining contact with those ideologically entrenched and resistant to deradicalisation efforts.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial components are frequently integral to such cases. Here a separate investigation identified a transfer of approximately £1,800 worth of cryptocurrency from Mr H’s digital wallet to a darknet marketplace seller specialising in dual-use equipment. The forensic accountancy report detailed blockchain tracing of this transaction via multiple tumblers, underscoring the lengths to which offenders take to conceal illicit financing. While cryptocurrency transactions are legal and legitimate in many respects, their abuse for unlawful ends poses distinct investigative challenges.  \n\nThe court recalls the caution expressed in R v. Bishop [2022] EWCA Crim 978, where reliance on incomplete financial tracing unfavourably affected the prosecution narrative. Contrastingly, here, the evidence is cogent and unchallenged, establishing clear linkage between the defendant and financial facilitation. Such monetary conduits are essential to the operational capacity of terror-related offending and inform the severity of sentence.  \n\nThe investigative picture included footage from covert CCTV capturing movements of Mr H adjacent to a riverside embankment on 8 February 2024. Analysts expended over 120 man-hours processing segmented video records to confirm his identity in low-light conditions—a time investment symptomatic of the resource-intensive nature of modern counter-terrorism surveillance. These recordings depict behaviour including the transfer of nondescript parcels, adding an additional layer of evidentiary complexity. The court echoes concerns regularly voiced about the asymmetry of effort between offenders and law enforcement.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nMr H is now aged 30. His academic record includes a degree in electronics engineering from the University of Bath. Previous employment includes a brief tenure at a regional telecommunications provider, described by his supervisor as “competent yet socially withdrawn.” Character references have been made by former tutors and community group leaders, citing volunteer work in environmental clean-ups and local library assistance. The court balances these positive elements against the gravity of offences, mindful that community engagement, while commendable, cannot eclipse profound breaches of the criminal law.  \n\nThe defendant has a documented history of mental health difficulties involving episodes of anxiety but has never been hospitalised or subject to formal psychiatric detention. The pre-sentence report will be requested to explore this further and consider appropriate custodial mental health provision, should that be the outcome at sentencing.  \n\nLetters from the Bristol Food Aid Network and Easton Youth Mentoring Scheme, submitted on Mr H’s behalf, attest to his sporadic participation in local civic endeavours. These contributions are recognised but, as with other mitigation, must be viewed within the full context. The court is mindful of the remark in R v. Whitmore [2023] EWCA Crim 2045, that “positive social behaviours do not diminish the culpability for planned violence but may inform the individual’s potential for rehabilitation.”  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nProfessor Jason Milner, forensic psychologist, provided an expert report dated 22 August 2025. He records elevated levels of cognitive inflexibility within the defendant's thinking, alongside ideologically rigid frameworks. The assessment concludes that while Mr H does not suffer from severe mental illness, he poses a high risk of public harm without intensive and prolonged intervention. Rehabilitation prospects are cautiously optimistic but contingent on engagement with structured, specialist programmes post-release.  \n\nIt bears emphasis that risk assessments in terrorism cases remain inherently uncertain and must be periodically reviewed. The court welcomes the ongoing multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) oversight applicable to such cases, reflecting the critical importance of inter-agency collaboration in managing high-risk individuals transitioning through the criminal justice system.  \n\nIn closing, the court reiterates the solemn gravity of offences under the Terrorism Act. The planning, facilitation, and promotion of acts intended to sow fear and destabilise society challenge the very foundations of democratic life. Sentences imposed must, therefore, be commensurate with these realities and impose clear deterrents.  \n\nI direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the National Probation Service, to include assessment of risk, suitability for intervention programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, and proposals for supervision frameworks. The report should appraise proposals for custodial restrictions in the event of imprisonment, including electronic monitoring and licence conditions tailored to limit access to extremist material and communications.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities for notation and action.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.

One entry in Mr H’s tactical file described how he plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nFinancial components are frequently integral to such cases.
