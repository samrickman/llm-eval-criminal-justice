Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29704  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. A. FLETCHER  \nFiled: 15 August 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The relevant offences are alleged to have occurred during the period from April 2023 up to Mr H’s arrest on 5 February 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was arrested at 06:45 on the aforesaid date pursuant to warrants executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at his residence in Eastville. The warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 on the basis of classified intelligence indicating that an encrypted application controlled or accessed by Mr H had engaged in the transmission of files linked to extremist propaganda. At the time of arrest, officers seized a desktop computer, multiple external hard drives, and several USB keys, all of which were subsequently subject to forensic examination.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe investigation that culminated in this arrest was characterised by protracted inter-agency cooperation. CTPSW worked closely with the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) and a specialist digital forensics team attached to the National Crime Agency. The digital data recovered required meticulous decryption and reconstruction using bespoke software tools. Due to the heavy workload of the NCCU, which at points during 2024 had a backlog exceeding 12,000 devices awaiting examination, analysis was necessarily slowed. However, the involvement of external academic partners specialising in cryptanalysis helped to alleviate delays to some extent. It should be noted that whilst resource scarcity is an unfortunate reality in the counter-terrorism domain, it does not permit neglect of rigorous evidential scrutiny, as the court fully acknowledges.  \n\nBefore addressing the factual matrix of the offences, it is appropriate to provide some contextual observations on the legal and procedural framework within which the court must operate. The charges brought arise under legislative provisions formulated largely in response to evolving threats of domestic and international terrorism. The Terrorism Act 2006, as amended, extends prior offences and mandates severe penalties reflecting the significant public safety interests at stake.  \n\nIt is regrettably common in such complex prosecutions that matters are protracted, featuring multiple pre-trial hearings and delayed disclosure owing to the sensitive nature of material. This case has been no exception. A preliminary hearing was conducted on 18 March 2025 at which the Crown indicated a not guilty plea by Mr H. Subsequent trial preparation hearings occurred on 25 May and 2 July 2025, during which varying applications were made regarding the admissibility of evidence, in particular intercept communications and expert reporting.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThroughout this process, the court has received extensive submissions on the appropriate level of culpability and potential mitigating factors. Defence counsel argued vigorously that Mr H had no realistic capacity to enact terrorism himself, highlighting the absence of criminal convictions or prior police intelligence and asserting that his interest in extremist materials was largely academic or ideological rather than operational. The Crown, on the other hand, relied on evidence demonstrating a clear progression from passive consumption of extremist content to active preparation and facilitation.  \n\nThe court is conscious, however, of the duty within the Criminal Procedure Rules to ensure fair trial rights and the right to effective representation. It must be recorded that the Legal Aid Agency’s performance in this matter has been inconsistent. There were extended delays in the approval of funding for expert psychological assessments and for digital forensic expertise instructed by the defence. Such delays, whilst understandable in the current under-resourced climate, place additional strain on the timely administration of justice and impose a burden on all parties. The delay interfered with timely disclosure requests and necessitated adjournments, including the vacating of a sentence date initially set for 21 July 2025.  \n\nEmpirical research has increasingly drawn attention to the challenging interface between complex terror investigations and the capacity of public services to respond effectively. The probation service in the South West region, for example, operates under severe staff constraints, with an overstretched caseload per officer volume exceeding 55 active files, considerably above national recommended thresholds. The court duly notes that this disparity strains post-conviction risk management and delivery of rehabilitative interventions.  \n\nThe community rehabilitation sector also faces mounting difficulties. Charitable organisations engaged in counter-extremism efforts—often dependent on volatile funding streams—have reported cases of intimidation, vandalism, and hostile public attitudes during outreach programmes. The persistence of these difficulties compounds the challenge of securing successful disengagement and reducing reoffending risk. Thus, while mitigation and progress towards rehabilitation are to be welcomed, they must be measured against the reality of operational pressures.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nPrior to turning to the core facts of the offending, the court also pauses to acknowledge advances in relevant case law that inform sentencing principles. The Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v. Maskell [2022] EWCA Crim 2145 clarified the interpretation of “engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism,” emphasising the need to consider both objective acts and subjective intent, as well as the proximity of preparatory conduct to potential terrorist execution. This judgment restated the particular gravity attached to offences even where no actual attack occurred, recognising the deliberate and premeditated nature of such conduct.  \n\nMore broadly, sentencing remains directed by the Terrorism Act 2000 and 2006, alongside the Sentencing Council’s guidelines updated in 2023. The overarching purposes of deterrence, rehabilitation where possible, and, above all, protection of the public are paramount. The sentencing court must weigh aggravating factors, including sophistication of planning, dissemination of material, and engagement with proscribed groups, against personal mitigation such as antecedents, mental health status, and demonstrated remorse.  \n\nTurning now more specifically to evidence of the defendant's conduct:  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nMr H’s digital footprint unveiled a cache of encrypted files containing detailed manuals on improvised explosive devices, tactical communication strategies, and ideological treatises advocating violence in furtherance of extremist goals. The defence suggested this was a theoretical exercise or research. However, covert surveillance corroborated contemporaneous acts consistent with hands-on preparations, including attendance at targeted locations with restricted access and testing of small-scale devices in controlled environments.  \n\nIt should be observed that the court takes no comfort in unsubstantiated claims of “academic curiosity” when coupled with access to practical materials and actual test deployments. As established in R v. Larson [2021] EWCA Crim 871, mere possession of such materials, when contextualised by preparatory activity, gives rise to grave concern regarding predisposition and potential future offending.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nEfforts to travel abroad for training or to establish contacts with foreign extremist entities were thwarted by intercepted plans to journey to the Balkan region in late 2024. Travel records, coupled with mobile tracking data, indicate Mr H booked flights via indirect routes to avoid detection, though ultimately the trips were cancelled or redirected following intervention by border security. Such layers of deception and evasive tactics underscore the calculated intent behind his behaviour.  \n\nIt is, meanwhile, pertinent to refer to a related but separate matter concerning the defendant’s co-habitant, who was found in possession of cannabis plants during unrelated warrant execution. No charges related to drug offences have been brought in connection with Mr H, who denies knowledge or involvement. Similarly, the defendant’s brother is currently under investigation for benefit fraud, an issue entirely extraneous to the present proceedings save for the necessity of disclosure in compliance with Criminal Procedure Rule 31.6.  \n\nThe home environment in which the defendant lived was also subject to administrative oversight by the local housing authority due to multiple noise complaints from neighbours unrelated to the current charges. The significance of these complaints lies solely in providing a holistic view of the defendant’s immediate social context and poses no aggravation or diminution of culpability.  \n\nIn discussing the forensic material, it must be noted that among the devices seized were several USB sticks labelled cryptically, one containing what was recorded as “VaccineCodes2023.” Forensic analysis determined these showed no connection to biomedical content but, instead, contained encrypted communications about bomb assembly procedures. The defence’s submission that this was an example of “dual-use technology curiosity” was rejected by the jury, who were expressly directed regarding available inferences from circumstantial evidence.    \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial investigations traced multiple cryptocurrency transactions, amounting to just under £4,800, linked to online wallets associated with Mr H. Transactions were routed through mixers designed to obfuscate audit trails and included purchases from darknet marketplaces offering dual-use materials and components with potential application in explosive device manufacture. While cryptocurrency in its myriad forms serves legitimate purposes for many, it is a matter of public record and law enforcement concern that this medium is extensively exploited by criminals seeking anonymity, as reviewed in the Home Office research paper “Crypto and Crime,” published in 2023.  \n\nThe court notes with approval the thoroughness of the financial intelligence team and acknowledges the challenges faced by public bodies in tracing digital assets and enforcing anti-money laundering regulations. These aspects, while only indirectly connected to the defendant’s day-to-day life, illustrate a wider systemic vulnerability that must be addressed by policymakers.  \n\nDuring the investigatory phase, extensive covert surveillance operations were undertaken to establish patterns of behaviour. Footage captured Mr H undertaking reconnaissance in a public park adjacent to a major railway junction during which he appeared to record timings of passing trains. While such imagery and data acquisition may on the face of it border on urban exploration or hobbyist interest in rail infrastructure, in the context of other preparatory acts, it assumes a far more sinister undertone. The court is reminded of the established principle that acts innocuous in isolation may be signed by a broader offending panorama.  \n\nIt also bears mention that the defendant was observed frequenting certain city-centre locations notorious for past activities of extremist gatherings. This was corroborated by mobile network evidence, which further situates him within known extremist frames. Nevertheless, the court is careful to emphasise that such associations, while relevant to threat assessment, must be understood within the evidence as a whole and not as standalone proof of criminality.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to personal circumstances, Mr H is 28 years of age with a background in electrical engineering. He holds a BSc degree with upper second-class honours, having graduated from a regional university in 2019. Employment history reveals a series of short-term contracts in the renewable energy sector, interspersed with periods of unemployment. A letter provided by a former supervisor describes him as “technically competent but somewhat detached,” with occasional lapses in meeting deadlines.  \n\nThe defendant allegedly resigned from his last role shortly before the commencement of the conduct under scrutiny here, following a disagreement over mandatory background checks related to security clearance. The defence sought to attribute this resignation to workplace bullying, a claim not substantiated in evidence before the court. Such allegations, while serious, have no direct bearing on the current offences and were aired with no corroborating documentation.  \n\nSeveral letters of support have been tendered on Mr H’s behalf, including one from the Bristol Green Spaces Initiative praising voluntary contributions to community gardening projects and another from the Eastville Library outreach programme noting participation in a literacy mentorship scheme for teenagers. These attest to some facets of pro-social engagement. However, as this court has often reiterated, community involvement cannot eclipse the fundamental seriousness of terrorism offences.  \n\nIt is also relevant to mention that the defendant’s handwritten submissions to the court were legible, clear, and evidenced a reflective tone, though they stopped short of full acceptance of responsibility. This partial engagement with the legal process exemplifies a common pattern among ideologically motivated offenders who may express dissatisfaction with the justice system while simultaneously acknowledging adverse consequences.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe psychiatric report submitted by Dr Susan L. Bradford, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, provides a detailed insight into Mr H’s psychological profile. Dr Bradford diagnoses no formal mental illness but notes “cognitive inflexibility coupled with a marked black-and-white mode of thinking.” The report assesses a high risk of serious harm predicated upon entrenched ideological beliefs, technical proficiency, and limited engagement with deradicalization programmes during custody. The report notes that, while there was no evidence of psychosis or mood disorder, the defendant exhibited “heightened affective arousal when discussing perceived grievances against state institutions.”  \n\nDr Bradford recommends intensive psychological interventions combined with Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 supervision on release, given the identified persistent risk. Defence submissions urged the adoption of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) as an appropriate pathway, emphasising its community-based framework and cognitive-behavioural components. The court observes that while such programmes offer promise, completion rates hover below 70%, with a notable minority disengaging in the critical post-release phase. The court must, therefore, approach such proposals cautiously and in the context of robust risk management.  \n\nOutside the immediate realm of this case, the court cannot ignore the wider social and political significance of counter-terrorism work. The balance between ensuring public safety and preserving civil liberties remains delicate. Commentary in academic circles and the press often oscillates between scepticism of legislative overreach and concerns regarding under-policing. In a particularly notable speech in 2024, the Attorney General emphasised that “effective counter-terrorism relies not only on laws but on community resilience, intelligence gathering, and inter-agency cooperation.” While this court is not a forum for political debate, such observations reinforce that sentencing in terrorism cases transcends individual culpability, touching upon collective security and societal values.  \n\nThis matter has seen the most conscientious efforts from prosecution and defence counsel alike. Ms Naomi Fitzgerald QC appeared on behalf of HM Crown Prosecution Service, providing cogent and detailed submissions throughout trial and sentencing preparation. Mr Oliver Dakin, for the defence, represented Mr H with exemplary professionalism amid considerable case complexity and external pressures. The court owes its thanks to both counsel for their efforts.  \n\nIt should also be recorded that the court staff, ushers, and clerks at Bristol Crown Court have contributed materially to the efficient listing and management of this case. The recent refurbishment of Courtroom 4, including upgraded audio-visual facilities intended to facilitate effective presentation of digital evidence, was utilised to good effect in this trial. Despite routine challenges, the hearing proceeded with due decorum and respect.  \n\nBy way of additional and tangential observation, there has been a noted surge in anti-social behaviour and street homelessness within the Bristol city centre over recent years. Local authorities report that the stresses associated with economic downturn and inadequate housing stock contribute to a sense of disorder that may indirectly impact community cohesion. Although such factors are not germane to this case directly, they contextualise the wider environment in which offences of ideological extremism occur and must be considered when evaluating risk and rehabilitation prospects.  \n\nAttention is drawn also to the longstanding issue of the burden placed upon digital forensic teams by the exponential growth of data in modern prosecutions. Analysts report that they are required to sift through terabytes of raw material, much of which may prove tangential or redundant but cannot be disregarded without due process. The resultant workload increase has engendered calls for expanded resourcing and improved technology platforms within policing budgets. The present case exemplifies these demands.  \n\nIn conclusion, having considered the entirety of evidence and submissions and mindful of the crucial statutory and judicial guidance, the court finds that the offending displayed significant sophistication and committed intent. The combination of technical competence, ideological adherence, and preparatory steps place Mr H within the upper tiers of culpability under the current sentencing framework.  \n\nMitigating factors remain limited. While there is some evidence of community engagement and no previous convictions, these are overshadowed by the grave nature of the offences. The guilty pleas entered on 4 August 2025 represent a welcome but tardy acceptance of responsibility. The credit available must be tempered accordingly, consistent with the Court of Appeal’s rulings in R v. Tolson and R v. Nugent.  \n\nThe court hereby directs the preparation of a pre-sentence report. This report shall explore in depth the risk profile presented by Mr H, including a comprehensive assessment of his engagement potential with deradicalization programmes, capacity for compliance with license conditions, and appropriateness for custodial or community-based sentencing options. Consideration should also be given to the utility of electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and structured psychological intervention as part of any release plan.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 August 2025, in Courtroom 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to relevant agencies for registration and notification.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
