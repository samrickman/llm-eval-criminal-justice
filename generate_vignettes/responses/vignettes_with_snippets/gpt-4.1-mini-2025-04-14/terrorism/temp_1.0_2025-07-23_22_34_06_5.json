Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29843  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. J. PEARSON  \nFiled: 17 August 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence upon conviction on multiple counts of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, as well as possession of articles for purposes connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The relevant period of offending extends from late 2022 until the date of his arrest in March 2025.  \n\nThe defendant’s case has traversed several pre-trial hearings and procedural stages, including a plea and case management hearing held on 15 June 2025, followed by a contested trial that spanned five days during July of this year. The trial itself has placed considerable demand upon court resources and procedural time given the volume of digital evidence and classified intelligence material that required careful handling under specialist disclosure protocols. It is of note that substantial portions of evidence were presented in closed material proceedings under section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013, with appropriate judicial oversight to safeguard fairness.  \n\nMr H was first arrested in the early morning of 12 March 2025 at his residence in the Sparkbrook district of Birmingham, pursuant to a search warrant executed under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant was the culmination of a long-running and multi-faceted investigation by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, supported by the Security Service and specialist digital forensic units. The arrest followed a protracted period of covert surveillance, signal intelligence gathering, and analysis of encrypted communications on platforms known for their protection of user anonymity.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe investigative operation, codenamed Operation SANDHURST, employed a layered approach integrating traditional surveillance with advanced data analytics. Analysts tracked Mr H's movements using geolocation metadata, while forensic linguists identified recurring thematic and vocabulary elements in intercepted chats consistent with extremist messaging paradigms. The case also entailed the painstaking reconstruction of deleted files from encrypted devices, a process that took several months due to the sophisticated counter-forensic measures employed by the defendant.  \n\nRegrettably, delays occasioned by competing court listings and unforeseen staffing absences within the Defence Disclosure Unit caused adjournments, including a necessary rescheduling of a contested Newton hearing initially fixed for 9 May 2025. Nonetheless, counsel for both the Crown and Defence have conducted proceedings with commendable professionalism, and the court extends its thanks to Ms Olivia Kendall for the prosecution and to Mr Jeremy Faulkner for the defence representation under a Legal Aid order. The court notes, with disquiet, the ongoing challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency, particularly in authorising funding for expert reports and counsel's instructing solicitors’ preparation time in terrorism matters — challenges which inevitably delay case progression.  \n\nThe defendant’s background is germane to this sentencing exercise. Mr H is 31 years old with no prior convictions, save for a fixed penalty notice for cycling on a pedestrianised zone in 2018. His employment history is intermittent, with periods of activity as a part-time warehouse operative interspersed with episodes of unemployment. He has no known history of significant substance misuse or engagement with mental health services prior to the current investigation. Letters submitted on his behalf from a local community centre and a youth mentoring charity describe him as “quiet and polite,” albeit somewhat withdrawn.  \n\nThe court has carefully considered a comprehensive psychiatric and psychological assessment prepared by Dr Elaine Mercer, forensic psychiatrist, who examined the defendant in May 2025. Dr Mercer’s report, detailed and professionally composed, identifies cognitive rigidity and a marked grievance narrative concerning social and political matters but diagnoses no formal psychiatric illness capable of diminishing responsibility. The risk assessment component of the report emphasises the potential for ideological recidivism absent substantial structured intervention. Dr Mercer advocates for intensive, long-term monitoring and structured desistance programmes should release be considered.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nDuring the investigation and trial, it has emerged that Mr H maintained an online presence via encrypted messaging apps and anonymous forums. Linguistic examination by Crown expert witness Mr David Raines revealed that posts and communications routinely employed coded language and phraseology paralleling that used in internationally proscribed terrorist propaganda, notably those emanating from a known extremist network banned under the Schedule 2 provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000. This, combined with evidence of procurement and assembly of materials capable of explosive manufacture, weighed heavily in the jury’s determination.  \n\nLeading authorities on sentencing in terrorism matters have been considered in depth. The Court’s approach is informed by the guidance of the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guidelines on Terrorism Offences promulgated in 2023, which highlight the need to calibrate sentences according to culpability, harm, and risk. Although no loss of life or injury resulted from the defendant’s actions, the deliberate planning and sophisticated preparation demonstrate a high degree of culpability warranting a severe sanction.  \n\nThe court also reflects on the decision in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which elucidated the broad ambit of “terrorist purpose” in legislation, and R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, in which considerations of sentence length were related to the necessity of deterrence and public protection even in nascent plots averted by law enforcement. These authoritative precedents provide a robust legal framework for determining an appropriate custodial sanction here.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nForensic analysis revealed numerous encrypted documents demonstrating a detailed understanding of chemical processes related to explosives and fragmentation devices. It is of note that some files were stored within concealed encrypted containers labeled innocuous titles such as “HolidayPhotos” to mislead any casual examinations. Defence submissions posited the possibility of innocuous or academic interest, yet the context of acquisition and use is overwhelming. The intended application, derived from both digital messages and material procurement activity, painted a picture consistent with clear criminal intent.  \n\nThe court also acknowledges that there is an emerging trend in these cases for defendants to claim “naïve curiosity” or a “taste for chemistry” when confronted with technical evidence. While intellectual curiosity in one’s youth is common — as acknowledged by a 2019 study from the University of Cambridge on STEM engagement — the law distinguishes between harmless academic interest and deliberate intention to cause harm. The evidential basis here is clear.  \n\nIt is appropriate, at this juncture, to record certain unfortunate procedural inefficiencies that arose during the investigation. Specifically, the late arrival of forensic reports on digital devices delayed disclosure to the Defence. These delays, partly attributed to national forensic laboratories experiencing acute case backlogs and staffing shortages, are symptomatic of the strain borne by criminal justice services in terrorism matters. Notwithstanding, neither the Defence nor the court considers that such delays have prejudiced the defendant’s ability to mount an effective defence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nMr H’s planning extended to attempted visits to external jurisdictions, ostensibly under the guise of “humanitarian volunteering.” Evidence showed bookings for flights to a region with known extremist activity, although the trips were not completed due to cancellations. This factor, while not irrefutable proof of foreign travel with illicit intent, nevertheless forms part of the assessment of risk and intent.  \n\nWhile travel records are not determinative on their own, they are frequently used alongside other intelligence to ascertain a defendant’s purpose. The court recalls the approach in R v. Afzal [2020] EWCA Crim 1542, where planned travel to foreign conflict zones was a significant aggravating factor despite the trips being abandoned due to external circumstances.  \n\nThis court acknowledges that the police and counter-terrorism agencies must operate under considerable operational strain. The balancing of resource allocation between terrorism cases and “volume crime” continues to challenge managerial priorities. Recent figures indicate a 16% rise in street robbery and a 22% increase in anti-social behaviour incidents across the West Midlands in the past year alone. Such trends impose competing demands on investigation teams. Operation SANDHURST’s ability to maintain focus on complex digital investigation amidst this environment is notable.  \n\nAdditional observations arise from the voluntary sector input. The Eastside Community Action Network submitted statements regarding its engagement with Mr H dating from 2021. Their reports emphasize that while outreach was attempted, participation was sporadic and inconsistent, with the defendant frequently disengaging after initial contact. This pattern is characteristic of many individuals engaged in ideological extremism and underscores the limits of voluntary deradicalisation programmes. Such engagement, while vital, is not a panacea, particularly absent compulsion or structured custody-based intervention.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe Crown also introduced evidence relating to financial transactions between the defendant and an overseas wallet tracked by the National Crime Agency’s Financial Intelligence Unit. The transactions, though relatively modest in sum, were allegedly directed toward procurement of dual-use chemical precursors. Cryptocurrency payments, with their inherent complexity and anonymity features, represent significant challenges for enforcement agencies. Recent legislative developments underscore the requirement for stricter controls and enhanced investigatory powers.  \n\nThe court notes the importance of such financial evidence, as iterated in R v. Singh [2024] EWCA Crim 1021, which stressed the weight to be accorded to covert financing conduct in the causation and facilitation of terrorist preparation. The discreet use of anonymised digital currencies to obfuscate funding traces remains a growing concern within national security frameworks.  \n\nIt is perhaps noteworthy, though unrelated, that one of the co-defendants in this case, Mr J, had previously been charged with typical street-level offences including possession of a bladed article in a public park and an affray incident in a local pub. While Mr J’s conduct is not attributable to Mr H, and carries no bearing on his sentencing, the court is mindful of the wider composition and dynamics of this investigation.  \n\nThe administration of justice itself has faced challenges in recent years. The Crown Prosecution Service’s specialist Counter Terrorism Division has suffered resourcing pressures, leading to some turnover at senior levels during the pendency of this case. The court also notes that the probation service faces reduced staffing, impacting report preparation times and post-sentence supervision capacity — a situation documented in the Annual Criminal Justice Survey 2024.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nForensic accountants involved in the inquiry traced a series of transactions amounting to £3,200 across multiple cryptocurrency wallets linked to the defendant’s online accounts. This financial footprint, while not vast, is consistent with targeted procurement activity designed to avoid detection. The court must reflect on the dual-use nature of certain items purchased — chemicals and equipment that can be legitimately owned but which in this context were intended for unlawful manufacture of explosives.  \n\nThe court is aware that terrorism offences often implicate complex financial arrangements, and it must carefully dissect legitimate commerce from covert preparation for harm. Such differentiation depends heavily on contextual evidence, as well as timing and pattern analysis.  \n\nThere is, regrettably, a familiar tale told across justice systems globally of law enforcement adapting to pace with evolving technical tools used by offenders. The rise of decentralised finance and encrypted communications surpasses the capacities of many agencies, creating systemic vulnerabilities. This is not a criticism of operational staff, but a reflection of the technological arms race underpinning modern counter-terrorism efforts.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to more personal matters: Mr H’s educational background includes attendance at a local technical college, where he undertook mechanical engineering studies but did not complete a final qualification. Testimony from former instructors describes him as “reserved” and “methodical,” yet with indications of social withdrawal and an intensification in political discourse during the last two years of enrolment. Employment at a small logistics company ended abruptly in early 2023 following an internal investigation into misuse of work computers to access prohibited websites.  \n\nThe court has also considered a character reference submitted by the defendant’s mother, describing him as “a deeply caring son” and “someone who struggled after the death of his father in 2019.” The complexities of grief and its mental health consequences are not taken lightly but must be weighed against the nature and gravity of offending in this case. Sympathy cannot become a shield for dangerously radicalised conduct.  \n\nSimilarly, the defence submitted letters from a local horticultural club highlighting voluntary work Mr H undertook planting trees in community spaces. Such civic contributions have value, but the court must be careful not to conflate good citizenship in unrelated areas with the commission of serious crime. Character evidence cannot be employed to eclipse accountability.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nProfessor Marcus Fletcher, the consulted forensic psychologist, reports that Mr H exhibits marked “cognitive rigidity,” a “black-and-white” worldview, and a predisposition to uncompromising ideological stances. Although not formally unwell, these traits are associated with entrenched extremist beliefs and pose a challenge to rehabilitation efforts. Professor Fletcher advises that structured interventions requiring lengthy custody-based psychological input are necessary to mitigate future risk.  \n\nThe court accepts that probation-led deradicalisation programmes, such as the Home Office’s Desistance and Disengagement initiative, offer a framework for addressing such risk post-release. Nevertheless, the attrition rates for such schemes are significant; many participants disengage at the first sign of pressure. This reality tempers any expectation that community-based management alone will suffice in high-risk cases. Extended custodial supervision is often required.  \n\nThis court’s role remains to balance the fundamental principles of sentencing—punishment, deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation. The defendant’s conduct, though ultimately interrupted before any physical harm occurred, demonstrates a sustained determination to manufacture tools of indiscriminate violence and to disseminate messaging intended to foment and justify such acts. The court must impose a sentence commensurate with these grave failings.  \n\nThis sentencing hearing has proceeded in open court. I reiterate my gratitude to the legal representatives, expert witnesses, court staff, and all others who have contributed to the conduct of these proceedings under difficult and sometimes constrained conditions. The arrangements in Court 9, recently refurbished with improved digital evidence displays, facilitated a clearer presentation of complex materials. The court usher maintained decorum efficiently.  \n\nThe preparation of a pre-sentence report is now ordered. This report should consider mitigation, rehabilitation prospect, and risk management strategies consistent with statutory obligations and best practice guidelines, including those pertaining to MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements) Category 3 oversight. The probation service is invited to evaluate the feasibility of extended supervision with electronic monitoring, psychological risk assessment, and close liaison with counter-terrorism police.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this 17th day of August 2025, in Court 9 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings are recorded and transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is duly advised of his right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are applied in this instance. Cost directions are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29843  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M.
