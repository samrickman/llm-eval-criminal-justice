Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/25832  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. K. THORNHILL  \nFiled: 18 August 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this Honourable Court for sentence pursuant to convictions on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006. The first count concerns engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a); the second counts possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct spanned a period commencing in late 2022 and culminating in his apprehension in early 2025.  \n\nThis case is situated within the jurisdiction of the Bristol Crown Court, a court established under the Courts Act 1971 and governed by the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. The defendant is 31 years of age and has been remanded in custody since his arrest. Notwithstanding the complexity of the evidence and volume of material presented, the procedural timetable has been managed, where possible, in accordance with the principles of Better Case Management.  \n\nA cautionary note is warranted regarding the challenges faced by justice services in cases of this nature. Counter-terrorism investigations require the coordination of multiple agencies, including local police counter-terrorism units, national security services, forensic analysts, and digital investigators. Resourcing constraints often result in delays, not infrequently exacerbated by the necessity to apply closed material procedures and manage sensitive protective markings. Nevertheless, the various stakeholders engaged in this matter have shown considerable professionalism and diligence throughout.  \n\nMr H was arrested on 10 January 2025 at his residence in Redcliffe following the execution of a warrant authorised by a senior investigating officer under the powers set out in the Terrorism Act. The seizure included digital devices, communication records, and what was described by law enforcement as dual-use equipment with potential application in the manufacture of explosive devices. The underpinning investigation was a multi-month endeavour, involving an extensive data trawl from internet service providers, telecommunication metadata analysis, and covert surveillance. The operational scope included collaboration with the National Cyber Crime Unit, whose technical experts undertook decryption efforts on the defendant’s encrypted communications.  \n\nA brief procedural history is relevant. Following initial hearings in March, matters were adjourned on two occasions to permit the collation of expert reports and the assessment of fitness to plead. Adjournments owing to Legal Aid paperwork delays and the securing of sufficient forensic expertise were regrettable but cannot be construed as attributable to any party. At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 21 May 2025, Mr H maintained pleas of not guilty. It was not until the morning of the sentencing hearing that pleas of guilty were tendered to both counts. As will be explored, that timing significantly impacts the allowable mitigation in credit for plea.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe court is mindful that such late pleas, while accepted, do not carry the same weight of mitigation as those entered at the earliest opportunity. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Dunbar [2024] EWCA Crim 999 serves as a salient authority, underscoring that credit for a guilty plea is discretionary and contextual. It is granted primarily to acknowledge the savings in public resources and the avoidance of witness exposure to trial cross-examination. The timing of the plea remains critical in assessing the quantum of credit, particularly in terrorism cases where investigations are necessarily protracted.  \n\nA perusal of the principles in the Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines 2023 confirms the necessity of a proportionate approach, balancing the interests of justice, public protection, and offender rehabilitation. The guidelines emphasize the paramount importance of deterrence and community reassurance where offences demonstrate ideological conviction and advanced preparation. Notwithstanding this, the case presents the usual variables associated with any sentencing exercise: culpability, harm, aggravating and mitigating factors.  \n\nThe court notes the historical context of the relevant legislation. The Terrorism Act 2006 was enacted in response to the evolving threat landscape, particularly considering the shortcomings unearthed by prior investigations into domestic extremist activities. The Act consolidates provisions aimed at pre-emptively disrupting terrorism, including preparatory acts rather than solely responding to completed offences. This legislative framework is supplemented by extensive jurisprudence, including the seminal case of R v. Anwar [2012] UKSC 15, which delineated the breadth of ‘conduct in preparation’ and the requisite intent.  \n\nConsiderable reference was made at trial to an unrelated matter involving co-defendants who are currently subject to separate proceedings. It is worth remarking that the co-defendant, Mr W, faces charges relating to the unlawful possession of firearms and aggravated assault at a public demonstration in 2023, offences distinct both factually and legally from those for which Mr H stands convicted. While the investigative trajectories intersect at certain junctures, the legal assessment here pertains solely to the conduct of the defendant, unsullied by the actions or status of co-accused, whose files remain under separate judicial consideration.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe Crown’s case relied heavily on a voluminous volume of communications recovered from encrypted messaging applications and cloud storage accounts registered to the defendant’s known online aliases. Expert witness testimony detailed sophisticated encryption protocols and the use of virtual private networks designed to thwart interception. The prosecution presented evidence of extensive research activity concerning explosive formulations, tactical deployment scenarios, and communication with individuals associated with overseas proscribed organisations. The temporal sequence and digital footprints collectively painted a picture of deliberate and sustained radicalisation and operational intent.  \n\nThe court records submissions from the defence emphasising the defendant’s prior mental health history. It is a matter of public record that Mr H engaged with community mental health services intermittently since adolescence, with diagnoses of depressive episodes and anxiety disorders. The psychiatric report commissioned by the defence, authored by Dr Simon Blackwell, consultant forensic psychiatrist, included an assessment of capacity, culpability, and risk. Dr Blackwell concluded that while there was no indication of psychosis or cognitive impairment at the time of offending, the defendant exhibited traits consistent with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and emotional dysregulation.  \n\nReference was also made in mitigation to comparable cases, including R v. Langford [2023] EWCA Crim 1207, where a defendant convicted of similar section 5 offences received a custodial term of eight years with a substantial extended licence period. Distinctions were drawn, however, on grounds of the sophistication of the devices procured and the apparent depth of ideological commitment.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe court further contextualizes these incidents by reference to the prevailing operational pressures on counter-terrorism policing units nationwide. In particular, the extraordinary demands placed on digital forensic teams manifest in extensive backlogs and delays, as documented in the 2024 Home Office review on Digital Policing Capabilities. The protracted timeline for decryption, data recovery, and analysis is not unique to this case and reflects systemic challenges inherent in responding to technologically sophisticated offenders.  \n\nThe defendant’s engagement with statutory multi-agency panels, including the Channel Programme, is also instructive. Records show a referral was made in September 2021 by educational staff regarding concerns about Mr H’s expressed radicalised views, stemming from social media posts and classroom discussions. The referral activated a Channel panel which monitored but eventually discontinued Mr H’s involvement due to apparent disengagement and lack of overt risk markers. The limitations of such preventative frameworks are well documented; while undoubtedly beneficial for many individuals, they do not guarantee intervention prior to offending.  \n\nDuring proceedings, the court heard from a probation officer involved in the preparation of pre-sentence materials, who provided insights into the strain on probation service capacities. Increasing caseloads, coupled with restricted resources, have meant many risk management cases are being supervised with lower face-to-face contact than is ideal. This systemic limitation must be borne in mind when considering future risk and the feasibility of community-based interventions.  \n\nIt is also appropriate to record the contributions of the local Resettlement and Rehabilitation Network, which has developed tailored initiatives aiming to facilitate reintegration for offenders with extremist backgrounds upon release. While the efficacy of these programmes is still subject to ongoing evaluation, their work merits acknowledgement.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe possession count against Mr H pertains to items identified during forensic examination of his residence. These articles, although innocuously described in some submissions as “specialist engineering tools,” have, in expert opinion, potential utility in hazardous incendiary device manufacture. The court recalls the warnings of Lord Diplock in R v. Bellamy [1975] AC 347, although in a different context, regarding how objects capable of innocuous uses may be lawfully proscribed where intent and context converge.  \n\nCharacter references submitted on the defendant’s behalf, including letters from schoolteachers and former employers, describe Mr H as “quiet and withdrawn,” yet with “a keen intellect and technical aptitude.” Such references, while affording a measure of insight into the defendant’s social milieu, do not diminish the gravity of the offences, nor do they mitigate culpability arising from wilful and sustained preparation for acts capable of indiscriminate harm.  \n\nAttention was drawn by the defence to the absence of any prior convictions, emphasising the defendant’s hitherto unblemished criminal record. This is a relevant consideration, though naturally only one of several factors to be balanced when fashioning an appropriate sentence reflecting both punishment and deterrence.  \n\nThe court must nevertheless hasten to note the challenges courts face when confronted with offenders whose lives oscillate between dual identities: the outwardly ordinary yet inwardly ideologically motivated. Such duality complicates assessment but does not excuse conduct. Indeed, as noted in R v. Westwood [2019] EWCA Crim 434, careful sentence calibration must reflect the reality that covert extremism is no less dangerous than overt violence and may in fact heighten the risk of harm by obscuring early detection.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe defendant’s travel history, illuminating potential protracted contact with overseas extremist actors, formed a significant evidential strand. Airline and immigration records indicate trips consistent with stated leisure purposes but coinciding with dates of extremist gatherings or political anniversaries. For instance, a trip to Amsterdam in March 2024 overlapped with the annual “Freedom Convocation,” known to attract various radical factions. Such coincidences, while not dispositive alone, reinforce a pattern identified through intercepts and surveillance.  \n\nThe Court also acknowledges letters from community groups, including the Bristol Interfaith Alliance and the Eastside Youth Collective, who submitted observations regarding the defendant’s sporadic participation in peaceful events and local volunteering activities. These submissions, while commendable in their tone, do not negate or diminish the imperative of ensuring that individuals posing a demonstrable risk to public safety are appropriately restricted and rehabilitated.  \n\nConsideration must be given to the extent to which such community involvement may reflect genuine pro-social intent or tactical posturing. Courts are mindful, as emphasised in R v. Osman [2020] EWCA Crim 1562, that terrorists may adopt multiple facades to evade suspicion. No greater jury can be placed on the benignity of overt conduct where covert intent is substantiated.  \n\nSeparately, the court refers to a 2023 case in the Midlands Circuit, R v. Patel, involving aggravated burglary with a history of drug offences, as a comparative touchstone. Although materially dissimilar in charge, the case attracted attention for the sentencing court's evaluation of rehabilitative potential vis-à-vis offences involving weapons possession, a juxtaposition relevant when considering risk management options here.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nThe financial patterns uncovered through forensic accounting exercises reveal transactions suggestive of cryptocurrency utilization to obscure payments for materials and services. Of note, a transaction totalling £1,850 was traced to a vendor specialising in chemical precursors. The blurred lines in cryptocurrency exchange monitoring present a modern challenge, encapsulated in the recent review by the National Crime Agency on ‘Cryptocurrency and Illicit Finance.’ This report details the mechanisms by which offenders adapt to regulatory loopholes, complicating enforcement efforts.  \n\nThe Court also remarks upon the painstaking efforts by digital specialists to confirm a nocturnal visit by Mr H to an industrial estate warehouse on 17 October 2024. Multiple camera angles, time-code synchronisation, and facial recognition software were employed. The meticulousness required to corroborate a ten-minute presence highlights the disproportionate effort required for modern law enforcement when targeting sophisticated offenders.  \n\nIn the realm of relevant legal precedent, the court recalls R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, though pertaining to arson and mental health, for its exposition on balancing therapeutic need and public safety. While the circumstances and offences differ materially, its emphasis on calibrated judicial discretion remains salient, particularly when mental health considerations intersect with serious offending.  \n\nThe defendant’s mental health reports indicate no formal diagnosis of psychosis but reflect emotional rigidity and a propensity for ‘black-and-white’ thinking, a finding consistent with academic literature on pathways to radicalisation. Expert interventions will be vital if rehabilitation is to succeed, but such programmes must be approached with circumspection.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to personal details, Mr H was educated to degree level in computer science. Former employers have described the defendant as “reliable but socially withdrawn,” with specific reference to his proficiency in cryptographic systems. Employment ceased in mid-2023 amid undisclosed discord relating to compliance questions on data security policies.  \n\nLetters from support organisations, such as the Bristol Centre for Mental Wellbeing, confirm intermittent engagement with therapeutic services prior to arrest. There is a notable absence of sustained contact with family, who reside abroad, compounding the risk factors associated with social isolation.  \n\nThe court is mindful of comparable cases in which defendants leading ostensibly unremarkable lives engaged in covert extremist conduct. As Lord Justice Clarke observed in R v. Yusif [2021] EWCA Crim 843, “The surface may appear calm, but beneath lurks a tempest demanding our vigilance.”  \n\nMitigating factors in Mr H’s case are restricted to absence of criminal antecedents, the defendant’s educational attainment, and belated admission of guilt. While these aspects are not negligible, they pale against the backdrop of the substantive threat posed. Equally, the late pleas limit the credit afforded, for reasons previously articulated.  \n\nA pre-sentence report commissioned by the Probation Service is imminent. It will address Mr H’s risk profile, potential for rehabilitation, and the suitability of custodial versus community-based interventions. The report is to include assessment of participation in specialist desistance programmes and the feasibility of ongoing multi-agency monitoring post-release.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nFollowing consultation with medical and psychological experts, the court has noted the moderate risk of serious harm that the defendant poses to the public, the likelihood of re-engagement in extremist ideology absent robust intervention, and the strategic sophistication underpinning his criminal conduct. The risk evaluation underscores the necessity of stringent custodial conditions and comprehensive post-custody supervision.  \n\nBefore concluding, the court acknowledges the enduring strains borne by public services dealing with both the criminal and mental health consequences of terrorism. Delays in psychiatric assessments due to scarce forensic psychiatric resources, probation officer shortages, and the emerging challenges posed by digital subterfuge complicate risk management efforts. These systemic stresses are not unique to this jurisdiction but reflect national patterns requiring policy attention beyond the courtroom.  \n\nThe court is also conscious of the ongoing debate regarding sentencing policy in terrorism cases, particularly balancing effective deterrence with the principles of proportionality and individualised justice. It remains the function of the judiciary to implement these imperatives consistently and firmly.  \n\nI record my thanks to Ms Fiona Tregell, representing the Crown, for her precise and measured submissions during these proceedings. Likewise, Mr Asim Selby, Counsel for the defence, merits commendation for professional and diligent advocacy despite the constraints imposed by Legal Aid authorisations and the sheer volume of evidential material. The Court also appreciates the diligent work of court staff and ushers, whose recent refurbishment of Court 2 has provided an improved environment conducive to the orderly administration of justice.  \n\nIn conclusion, this court will await the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. Such report should include up-to-date psychiatric evaluations, probation risk assessments, and any further representations from the defendant’s legal team or relevant supporting agencies. The sentencing hearing is adjourned accordingly.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.

The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nThe financial patterns uncovered through forensic accounting exercises reveal transactions suggestive of cryptocurrency utilization to obscure payments for materials and services.
