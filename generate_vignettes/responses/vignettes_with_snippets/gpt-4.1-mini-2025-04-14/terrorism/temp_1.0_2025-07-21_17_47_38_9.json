Mr H  \nCase No. S2025/27654  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. P. READING  \nFiled: 18 October 2025  \n\nMr H, whose full name I have previously recorded at earlier hearings, appears before this court for sentence on multiple counts under the Terrorism Act 2006. The charges brought against him concern engagement in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), as well as possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct spans an extended period from late 2022 through to his arrest in April of this year.  \n\nThe background to the present proceedings is illustrative of the complexities and strains inherent in modern counter-terrorism investigative and prosecutorial work. Mr H was apprehended at 04:47 on 9 April 2025 at his home address in Eastleigh, Hampshire, pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The police operation, spearheaded by Counter Terrorism Unit South East (CTUSE), followed extensive covert surveillance and digital forensic analysis. At the time of his arrest, officers seized multiple electronic devices, including laptops, encrypted mobile phones, and encrypted storage media, as well as various materials suspected to be related to bomb-making.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nOver the course of the investigation, which had been ongoing for some sixteen months, CTUSE coordinated closely with the National Cyber Fusion Unit (NCFU), which provided highly specialised cyber intelligence expertise. The challenges encountered in decrypting and analysing Mr H’s electronic communications were formidable: he made use of end-to-end encryption applications, employed ephemeral messaging protocols, and adopted digital operational security techniques informed by well-known extremist manuals. These features necessitated considerable resources and technological investment from police and intelligence agencies, highlighting the unique demands of such investigations.  \n\nDelays in progress were inevitable. For example, the disclosure schedule in this matter ran to over 1,200 exhibits, many of which contained heavily redacted material to comply with national security considerations and to protect ongoing operations. The defence team encountered periodic challenges in accessing this material, reflecting the broader systemic tension between open justice and sensitive classified information. The court notes with some regret these procedural obstacles, which are intrinsic to such cases but impose burdens upon all involved.  \n\nThe defendant was initially granted conditional bail in December 2024 after his first appearance at Southampton Magistrates’ Court, subject to stringent requirements, including electronic monitoring and revocation of internet access save for approved portals. These conditions reflected concerns regarding the risk of further extremist activity or dissemination of material. However, these bail conditions were revoked following breaches identified through covert surveillance, leading to remand in custody in February 2025. Such compliance failures are relevant in the overall assessment of Mr H’s attitude and risk profile.  \n\nMr H’s defence was conducted with the assistance of Mr Imran Qureshi of counsel, instructed via the Legal Aid Agency. The court records its appreciation for the sterling efforts of Mr Qureshi and his junior, Ms Eleanor Beckett, whose advocacy demonstrated professionalism under sometimes difficult circumstances. The court must, however, register its frustration with the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative delays, which notably postponed the initial psychiatric assessment until late May 2025 despite early requests. These delays inevitably complicated scheduling and preparation, reflecting systemic underfunding in critical areas of public defence.  \n\nA so-called Prevent referral was made on behalf of Mr H in early 2020 after he submitted an essay for a local Sixth Form College containing passages sympathetic to violent extremists. That referral was handled by the Southampton Prevent Hub, which attempted to engage Mr H in tailored deradicalisation programmes. According to correspondence the court has reviewed, his engagement was sporadic and ultimately limited. This serves as a wider reminder of the challenges faced by Prevent teams amid fluctuating participation and resource constraints.  \n\nIt is, regrettably, an increasing feature of this jurisdiction that defendants charged with terrorism offences often delay their guilty pleas until the eve of trial or at sentencing hearings. Mr H followed this familiar pattern, offering not guilty pleas at his initial court appearances and finally entering guilty pleas to the principal charges only at the sentencing hearing. The court has taken account of this in assessing the available credit for plea.   \n\nThe law affords a measure of leniency where a guilty plea is entered sufficiently early to save the court’s time and to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of trial. As noted in R v Milligan [2018] EWCA Crim 1938, credit for a guilty plea is not automatic but depends on the timing and circumstances of the admission. In R v. Martyn [2021] EWCA Crim 1249, the Court further emphasised that pleas entered after exhaustive preparation and close to trial attract significantly less credit. That principle is plainly engaged in this case.  \n\nA further illustration of the effect of delayed plea can be seen in the case of R v. Lambert [2022] EWCA Crim 1057, which concerned a defendant convicted of affray following a pub brawl involving pool cues and other improvised weapons. Despite compelling CCTV evidence, Mr Lambert maintained his innocence until a late plea, leading to a modest credit of 10 per cent only. While Mr H’s offences obviously bear a different and more grave character, the proportionality of plea credit is governed by similar reasoning.  \n\nThe court's task must be grounded also in the framework provided by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guidelines (2023), which demand careful consideration of the level of culpability, operational sophistication, and potential harm. As Lord Justice Hughes observed in R v. Qureshi [2024] EWCA Crim 731, sentencing courts must balance community protection with proportionality, taking into account the complex realities of ideological crime that often straddle the boundary between thought and action.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe evidence demonstrates that Mr H operated a series of online platforms emanating from an encrypted account under the sobriquet “SteelAnvil.” Analysis revealed that these platforms evolved from relatively innocuous mechanical hobbyist content into increasingly strident ideological treatises, replete with coded references to extremist doctrine proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Linguistic experts testified that these postings exhibited distinctive markers consistent with known extremist communication patterns, a finding which the defence did not contest fully.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nTechnicians recovering data from a concealed partition on one of Mr H's seized drives uncovered multiple encrypted folders titled “Joints and Shrapnel.” Some of the files contained what appeared to be detailed experimental results of fragmentation dispersal tests using gelatine simulants, conducted in the defendant’s suburban workshop. Though some files were corrupt or incomplete, their content was plainly of concern and indicative of preparation for potentially violent acts.  \n\nThe court was mindful that possession of incomplete instructions for explosives manufacture has been addressed in the appellate decision of R v. Salim [2020] EWCA Crim 814, which confirmed that even partial materials support intent findings where contextual evidence aligns. The defence sought to argue that the defendant’s interests were confined to mechanical hobbyism and engineering innovation, but the court finds such claims unpersuasive given the totality of the evidence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe defence also emphasised a series of seemingly innocuous personal artefacts — notably, several hand-crafted wooden chess sets found at the defendant’s residence, some with dust accumulation indicating prolonged absence of use, and a minor unpaid local parking fine from 2019. While such details serve to humanise the defendant, they are of no substantive mitigating value and do not detract from the grave context in which the prosecution case has been proven.  \n\nIt would be remiss not to mention, in passing, that the Social Services Department had received a complaint in 2023 regarding a neighbour’s allegations of noise disturbances at the house, attributed to late-night drone operation. This unrelated investigation was promptly closed with no further action. Such peripheral matters, while distracting to some degree, fall outside the scope of this court’s concern.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe Crown placed particular emphasis on Mr H’s trip in October 2024 to Brussels, ostensibly on “heritage tourism.” Yet, records from border control and telecommunications data reveal that upon arrival, Mr H proceeded to a district known for hosting extremist networking events. CCTV footage recorded his interaction with an identified individual, later arrested in association with an ammonium nitrate importation conspiracy in the Benelux region. The defence attempted to suggest coincidence, but the pattern of encrypted communications and concurrent planning negates any innocent interpretation.  \n\nIn the course of preparing this matter, the court has reviewed extensive documentary material drawn from various law-enforcement agencies, including sensitive intelligence reports and complex digital forensic exports. While the vast quantity of data is, to some, overwhelming or arcane, it is necessary to understand that such exhaustive inquiry is the hallmark of contemporary anti-terrorism efforts. It is neither frivolous nor disproportionate, but a function of the seriousness with which the authorities approach the protection of public safety.  \n\nTurning briefly to other matters, one notes the ongoing challenges faced by the Hampshire Probation Service, which is operating at approximately 78% staff capacity, dealing with a caseload that has grown by 15% in the past year alone. This constraint has measurable implications for sentence planning and post-release supervision, particularly for individuals convicted of high-risk ideologically motivated crime. The proposed pre-sentence report must reflect these realities candidly and guide the court’s sentencing discretion accordingly.  \n\nThe forensic accountant who gave evidence confirmed that Mr H engaged in multiple cryptocurrency transactions totalling approximately £3,200 over a six-month period prior to arrest. One transfer was traced to an online vendor dealing in chemical precursors, who operates a network designed to evade regulatory scrutiny via tumbling services. The intersection of cryptocurrency and criminal enterprise is well-documented, with appellate courts frequently noting such activity as aggravating where linked to terrorism (see R v. Greer [2023] EWCA Crim 1197).  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nSurveillance logs maintained by the National Tactical Teams describe in detail a midnight meeting Mr H attended at a secluded riverside location on the River Test bank in August 2024. The painstaking cross-referencing of multiple camera angles, supported by acoustic analysis, consumed over 150 investigator hours but confirmed identity and interaction with a known extremist facilitator. Such operations typify the resource-intensive nature of contemporary counterterrorism policing — a matter that should temper expectations concerning rapid case conclusions or simplistic narratives of justice.  \n\nIt should also be noted that the court received a well-considered letter from the Eastleigh Residents’ Association, expressing concern about the impact of prolonged investigations on community cohesion and requesting enhanced transparency about surveillance activity in residential areas. While transparency is of undoubted democratic importance, the court must balance this against the need for operational confidentiality to ensure effective public protection.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nWith respect to personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old, holds a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours, and formerly worked as a junior technician in an aerospace assembly facility until his resignation in early 2023 following an internal investigation into unauthorised computer access. A character reference furnished by a former employer describes him as “meticulous and quiet,” but notably “evasive when questioned about outside interests.” Contributions from community groups, including a local model engineering club, commend his voluntary participation in workshops but acknowledge no significant recent engagement.  \n\nThe forensic psychologist commissioned by the defence, Dr Samantha Linton, provides an extensive assessment, concluding that while Mr H does not meet criteria for any formal psychiatric diagnosis, he exhibits “marked cognitive rigidity and a tendency to adopt absolutist viewpoints.” Dr Linton further outlines concerns regarding his sustained identification with extremist ideology and warns of a high likelihood of reoffending absent substantial intervention. The pre-sentence report is tasked with evaluating the efficacy and availability of specialist disengagement programmes such as the Counter Extremism Cognitive Therapy Initiative (CECTI), which, while promising, face limitations regarding uptake and completion rates.  \n\nMitigating factors presented on behalf of the defendant include his lack of prior convictions, some level of cooperation post-arrest, and documented efforts by voluntary sector organisations to sustain engagement. The court is indebted to the Southampton Council for Community Safety and the Hampshire Resettlement Network, whose representatives submitted detailed reports outlining challenges in providing prison-leaver support amidst ongoing resource limitations and rising demand.   \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nIt is evident that the present offending is of considerable gravity and demonstrated planning, informed by sophisticated technical knowledge and ideological commitment. The aggravating features underscore the necessity of a custodial sentence that prioritises deterrence, public protection, and the prevention of future harm. Conversely, mitigation remains limited and simplifies to the defendant’s personal background and delayed admission of guilt.  \n\nThe court is mindful of the delicate balance struck in sentencing decisions relating to terrorism. While rehabilitation and reintegration are noble aims, the protections of society and the prevention of indiscriminate violence must occupy paramount importance. Sentencing must send a clear message that such conduct will attract the strongest possible judicial response consistent with the law.  \n\nIt is accordingly directed that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared by the Probation Service. This report should address, inter alia, the feasibility of sentencing frameworks such as an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the applicability of High-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Programmes tailored to extremist offenders, proximity monitoring technologies, and the potential for multi-agency engagement frameworks including MAPPA level 3 oversight. Special attention should be given to accommodation options post-release and the availability of professionals trained in Structured Professional Judgement tools for ideological risk evaluation.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are pronounced this 18th day of October 2025 in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Southampton. They have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, under the supervision of the court clerk Ms Fiona Turner. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be duly transmitted to the appropriate authorities for registration and publication as appropriate.  \n\nThe defendant is reminded of his right to appeal the sentence imposed within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHAMPTON  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. S2025/27654  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. P.
