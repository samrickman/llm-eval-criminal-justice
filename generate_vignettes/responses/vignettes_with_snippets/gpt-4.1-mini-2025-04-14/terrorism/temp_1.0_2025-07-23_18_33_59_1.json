Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/24963  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. K. Danvers  \nFiled: 14 October 2025\n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence upon being convicted of charges relating to conduct preparatory to acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct covers a period commencing in early 2023, concluding with his arrest in February 2025.\n\nThis court is mindful that these proceedings occur within the wider framework of the United Kingdom’s counter-terrorism legislation, designed to balance freedoms with the imperative of public safety. The Terrorism Act 2006, under which the defendant is to be sentenced, was conceived as a response to evolving threats originally identified in the early 21st century, and has since been subject to numerous amendments reflecting changing modes of extremism and technological innovation.\n\nMr H was first detained at approximately 04:45 on 5 February 2025, following execution of a search warrant at 82 Cartersfield Road, Birmingham, by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTP-WM). The warrant was issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, based upon intelligence from the Security Service indicating that Mr H’s encrypted communications had engaged with content associated with proscribed organisations. At the point of arrest, a quantity of digital media devices and assorted electronic tools were seized.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe investigation leading to the arrest was characterised by significant multi-agency collaboration, spanning over 15 months. A combination of physical surveillance, advanced network analytics, and human intelligence inputs informed the enquiry, underscoring the complexities inherent in modern security work. The National Crime Agency (NCA) digital forensics unit contributed extensive analysis, requiring decryption efforts compounded by the defendant’s use of multiple anonymising proxies and sharded data storage.\n\nIt is necessary here to remark upon the substantial administrative hurdles faced during the early stages of this investigation. Two applications for extensions of bail under section 47 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 were made due to delays in inter-agency disclosure arrangements, including the absorption of classified intelligence materials and ongoing security vetting. These procedural delays, while regrettable, were mitigated by the fact they did not impact the continuity of evidence presentation nor erode the defendant’s rights as guaranteed under the Criminal Procedure Rules.\n\nHistorically, the court notes that Mr H’s case surfaced within a jurisdiction grappling with competing demands. The West Midlands region has witnessed growing resource pressures on law enforcement and mental health services alike, rendering swift, yet thorough, responses to terrorism allegations operationally challenging. The local probation service has publicly reported shortages in qualified public protection officers, situating this case within an environment of stretched public safety capacity.\n\nPrior to arrest, a Prevent referral was made in October 2021 by a university lecturer who reported concerns regarding Mr H’s repeated attendance at online forums disseminating extremist ideology. The Channel panel convened accordingly but discontinued the referral after Mr H demonstrated engagement in academic study and social activities inconsistent with a heightened risk profile. Such decisions of early disengagement, while based upon limited information, illuminate the inherent difficulties of predictive intervention in extremism.\n\nA plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 17 September 2025. At that hearing, Mr H entered a not guilty plea to all charges. The trial proceeded over the course of four weeks, culminating in conviction following the unanimous verdict of the jury delivered on 25 September 2025. The court acknowledges the diligence and clarity of evidence presented by the Crown, led by Ms Fiona Granger QC, as well as the measured advocacy on behalf of the defence by Mr Derek Simons.\n\nIt is pertinent to observe a growing trend in these proceedings towards late guilty pleas, a phenomenon scrutinised in several appellate decisions. The late change of plea often occurs only once preparatory hearings and jury briefings have been completed, necessitating reassessment of credit granted for admission of guilt. For instance, in R v Gribble [2023] EWCA Crim 1345, the Court of Appeal emphasised that credit for pleas entered only at the final trial stage should be markedly limited, especially where earlier opportunities to admit culpability were available. This principle ensures fairness for victims, witnesses, and the administration of justice.\n\nFurther, as stated in R v Carlisle [2024] EWCA Crim 2027, the appropriateness of plea discounts depends not only on timing but manifest sincerity and demonstrable awareness of the consequences. The judicious exercise of that discretion remains central to sentencing assessments.\n\nThis court is also mindful of precedents touching upon complex forensic digital evidence, such as R v Hennings [2021] EWCA Crim 899 where prolonged decryption and authentication efforts similarly complicated prosecutions involving encrypted material. The parallels are instructive in understanding the resource demands placed upon judicial systems and supporting agencies.\n\nThe relevant sentencing framework derives from the Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline 2023, emphasising the need to adequately capture the culpability, harm, and motivational backdrop characteristic of ideological offending. The courts are instructed to distinguish between mere possession of extremist material and active preparation for terrorism, with significant emphasis placed on intent, planning sophistication, and degree of organisation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe Crown’s evidence revealed that Mr H maintained an online persona under the pseudonym “IronCipher,” which hosted a series of videos and manifestos advocating for acts of violence within the United Kingdom. These were intercepted through lawful hacking techniques and corroborated by open-source intelligence. Linguistic and stylistic analysis, considered expert testimony, confirmed alignment with narratives propagated by groups proscribed under Schedule 2 of the 2000 Act.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nA comprehensive forensic examination identified multiple encrypted archives, some stored in cloud environments outside domestic jurisdiction, possessed with evident intent to circumvent lawful scrutiny. This included documented instructions for the manufacture of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), frozen in draft development stages. The defence unsuccessfully attempted to argue that these were part of an academic interest unrelated to actual deployment—a submission rejected by the jury.\n\nTo contextualise, it is worth noting that some of the defendant’s encrypted materials were discovered alongside a collection of digital scrapbooking files and photographic edits relating to wildlife surveillance. While such artefacts may depict a less incriminating pastime, they offer little mitigation given the weight of incriminating preparatory materials. This juxtaposition exemplifies the complexity of digital footprints in contemporary investigations.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThe court is mindful of the presence of minor drug-related artefacts found incidentally during search, specifically a small quantity of cannabis residue noted in the kitchen premises where Mr H resided. Those findings were peripheral and did not form any part of the charges brought before this court, nor do they affect the culpability in the terrorism context. Similar circumstantial evidence involving a 2018 fine for unauthorised parking was adduced by the defence in mitigation, emphasising Mr H’s record of generally compliant conduct within the community.\n\nPublic policy considerations must recognise that such non-terrorism related infractions, while relevant to holistic assessment, are not to deflect from or diminish the gravity of offences of the present nature.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe Crown disclosed evidence of a trip Mr H took to Rotterdam in November 2023. Flight and border control documentation showed that while ostensibly on a cultural trip, surveillance footage captured him entering premises later linked to extremist training activities. The defence submitted that this was purely coincidental, and no proof of active participation beyond presence was demonstrated, yet the jury accepted the Crown’s contention of purposeful intent.\n\nThis case generated substantial volumes of evidentiary material in excess of 640 exhibits, including intercepted communications, experimental devices, and financial transaction records. The repeated need for manual redaction, compliance with data protection regulations, and liaison with overseas jurisdictions significantly prolonged the disclosure schedule.\n\nStaff shortages within the Crown Prosecution Service, particularly in counter-terrorism units, have been widely reported. This has led to growing durations between charging decisions and trials in complex terrorism cases, a systemic strain feeding into delays felt keenly by victims, defendants, and the courts alike.\n\nThe administrative efforts required to manage multi-agency cooperation—between police, intelligence services, probation, and mental health providers—must not be underestimated. The mechanisms for information sharing remain imperfect, often hampered by legacy IT infrastructure and legal ambiguities particularly surrounding the handling of ‘special category’ data.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nOf pronounced concern was a forensic accounting report tracing a series of cryptocurrency transactions originating from wallets linked to Mr H’s online identifiers. Several payments, cumulatively amounting to approximately £4,500, were made via tumbling services designed to obscure funds used to purchase dual-use technologies capable of being repurposed for weapon manufacture.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies offer legitimate economic utility and financial autonomy, the court recognises the increasing challenge they pose in concealment of illicit activity—this instance typifies their utilisation as a vector for terrorist financing. The decision to sanction prolonged investigation of these flows accords with recommendations emanating from the Home Affairs Committee’s 2024 report on digital financing of extremism.\n\nReview of closed-circuit television evidence showed Mr H making a late evening visit to an industrial estate on 13 January 2025, coinciding with the receipt of an unmarked parcel subsequently examined and found to contain electronic components potentially useful in explosive assembly. The forensic complexity of authenticating delivery chains under such circumstances involves exhaustive cross-checking of parcel movements, delivery personnel statements, and GPS data—a process liable to consume hundreds of operative hours.\n\nThe court acknowledges the expertise and dedication of the CTP-WM digital and financial investigative teams in managing such voluminous data under intense public and political scrutiny. Their professionalism merits recognition.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nTurning now to Mr H’s personal profile, he is a 31-year-old former university researcher specialising in materials engineering. Academic references speak of a “precise intellect” coupled with a “reserved and solitary disposition.” His employment history was punctuated by a period of voluntary unemployment preceding increased online engagement with extremist groups.\n\nLetters submitted from a faith-based community organisation described his involvement in interfaith dialogues and fundraising efforts, though these appeared to have ceased in early 2023, coincident with emerging signs of his ideological drift. The court notes the complexity of these intersecting public and private facets.\n\nIt is worth remarking on the state of local mental health services, which, according to NHS Trust reports, continue to suffer from prolonged waiting times and staff shortages, particularly within forensic psychiatry teams. The timely assessment and treatment of individuals presenting with ideological fixation is thereby impeded, compounding the challenges of risk management.\n\nProfessor David Ellison, a consultant forensic psychologist, prepared a comprehensive report on Mr H. The assessment found no evidence of formal mental illness but identified marked cognitive inflexibility and black-and-white moral reasoning indicative of entrenched radicalisation. The risk assessment concluded that the defendant poses a high risk of serious harm to the public in the absence of intensive intervention.\n\nThis diagnosis aligns with similar expert reports in recent terrorism cases, such as R v Sinclair [2024] EWCA Crim 1937, where the Court of Appeal noted the difficulty of disentangling ideological conviction from bona fide psychopathology.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe mitigating factors in the defendant’s favour include absence of previous criminal convictions and partial cooperation since conviction. It must be emphasised, however, that the cooperation has been limited and belated, with ongoing concerns regarding sincerity and acceptance of responsibility.\n\nThe court adopts the sentencing approach laid out in the Definitive Guidelines, stressing the weight of public protection and deterrence in terrorism cases. The offences are to be viewed with utmost gravity, reflecting their potential to disrupt communal peace and inflict indiscriminate harm.\n\nIn directing the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, this court invites the probation service to examine the suitability of programmes addressing radicalised thinking patterns, such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), alongside intensive risk management strategies, including electronic monitoring and licence conditions restricting travel and communication.\n\nConsideration should also be given to the availability of approved premises with security protocols appropriate to terrorism offenders, as well as ongoing psychiatric support accessible upon release.\n\nThe court extends its appreciation to all agencies engaged in this matter, notwithstanding systemic resource constraints, acknowledging in particular the contributions of the West Midlands Forensic Mental Health Team and the National Counter Terrorism Headquarters.\n\nThe defendant is reminded of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. The record of proceedings has been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 4 at Birmingham Crown Court.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.
