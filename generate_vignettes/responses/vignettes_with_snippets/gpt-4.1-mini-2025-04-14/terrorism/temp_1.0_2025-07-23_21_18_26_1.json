Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/28641  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. M. CHESTERFIELD  \nFiled: 4 October 2025  \n\nMr Mr H is before this court today for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The alleged offending spans from the autumn of 2023 until his arrest in early 2025.  \n\nThe procedural history of this case has been marked by a series of both expected delays and somewhat unforeseen complications, reflecting the complex nature of counter-terrorism investigations and the procedural safeguards attendant upon them. It is perhaps worth noting at the outset that the Birmingham Crown Court, established in 1885, is one of the busiest centres in the Midlands, handling an average of 1,200 cases annually, including a disproportionately high number of terrorism-related prosecutions in recent years. This case typifies the intricate cross-jurisdictional cooperation required.  \n\nMr H was arrested at around 04:45 on 11 February 2025 by officers from West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit executing warrants pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at a residential address in the Aston district. The warrant was predicated on extensive covert surveillance and intelligence secured over a twelve-month period. At the time of arrest, various devices including multiple encrypted mobile phones, encrypted USB storage sticks, a high-capacity external hard drive, and specialist electronic components were seized. The complexity of this array necessitated particular investigative skill and resource.  \n\nI must acknowledge the efforts of West Midlands Counter Terrorism Policing in balancing operational urgency with adherence to the rigorous evidential and procedural requirements inherent in such cases. The protracted nature of the digital forensic extraction reflected not only the defendant’s use of advanced encryption but also the stretched capacity of national forensic units, whose caseloads have risen sharply in the last five years.  \n\nThe defendant was remanded in custody following his initial appearance on 14 February 2025. The court is cognisant that his legal team encountered significant administrative delays in securing funding for expert digital evidence analysis. These delays, originating from funding capping by the Legal Aid Agency, are regrettable but by no means unique; indeed, they mirror a wider systemic issue regarding the provision of legal assistance in complex terrorism trials. The court commends defence counsel for their diligence in navigating these obstacles, thereby ensuring the defendant’s right to a fair trial was preserved.  \n\nAt a plea and trial preparation hearing on 6 August 2025, Mr H initially entered pleas of not guilty. The case was listed for trial to commence on 16 September 2025. However, on the morning of the trial, he altered his pleas to guilty on both counts. This late plea impacts significantly the credit available for early acceptance of responsibility, a point elaborated upon below.  \n\nExtensive witness statements and expert reports accompanied the prosecution case. Notable among them was the detailed report from Detective Inspector Michael Rennard, who specialises in extremist psychology, and the comprehensive digital forensic extraction undertaken by Dr Jane Sanderson, a leading expert consultant in cybercrime investigations. Their expert evidence was instrumental in mapping the defendant’s conduct and intentions.  \n\nThe court has also received letters from local community organisations, including the Birmingham Islamic Council and the Eastside Youth Outreach, who have sought to present a nuanced account of the defendant’s prior community involvement, notwithstanding the severity of the offences. Such submissions, though not mitigating per se, offer a fuller picture of the defendant’s background.  \n\nSignificantly, a safeguarding referral was made to the Birmingham Prevent Hub in late 2022 after Mr H exhibited behaviours causing concern to local educators. The panel’s notes, submitted to the court, reflect challenges in engagement and sporadic participation in intervention programmes. These documents are integral to understanding the defendant’s trajectory and the opportunities missed for earlier intervention.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nIt is, of course, the facts of the offending themselves which remain paramount. The court is reminded that while every case has its own unique factual matrix, the principles established in leading authorities such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 guide the assessment of culpability in terrorism offences under the 2006 Act. The offences here did not culminate in physical harm but involved deliberate preparatory steps, including the possession and adaptation of components potentially capable of being incorporated into an explosive device.  \n\nHistorical perspective sheds light on the sentencing framework. An early version of the Terrorism Act 2006 was introduced following an increase in ideological violence in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The statute was initially more narrowly drawn but later expanded to encompass preparatory conduct, reflecting the legislative imperative to act pre-emptively to protect life. This approach has been subject to judicial scrutiny, notably in R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, which emphasised the balancing act between civil liberties and security.  \n\nAuthorities also remind courts to consider the degree of sophistication and the imminence of risk under the Sentencing Council’s guidelines. High culpability is associated with conduct demonstrating planning for maximum lethality or mass casualties, while lower culpability might be found in cases showing sporadic or limited preparatory acts without an apparent capacity to execute.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe defendant maintained an online presence under various aliases, including “IronPhoenix” and “SilentGrain.” The Crown relies significantly upon linguistic analysis indicating that his published writings incorporated coded language endemic to certain proscribed entities. The use of such language was not fleeting or accidental but persistent over many months. This feature indicates a sustained commitment to radical ideology.  \n\nCounter-terrorism investigations have become increasingly reliant on the interpretation of online activity. This trend, first noted in R v. Griffiths & Pierce [2022] EWCA Crim 1312, has propelled the judiciary to grapple with the evidentiary and contextual nuances of digital expression. The court is tasked with weighing the evidentiary value of such materials, ensuring that the presumption of innocence is preserved even as technological capabilities advance.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe digital forensic examination revealed the presence of encrypted files stored within seemingly innocuous containers. One such container, labeled “HobbyArchive,” contained subfolders with schematic diagrams and technical notes, several of which were incomplete or partially corrupted. While the defendant’s counsel argued that such incompleteness undermined the prosecution’s case on intent, the Court of Appeal in R v. Bakar [2022] clarified that possession of partial preparation documents is sufficient where contextual evidence demonstrates intent.  \n\nWhilst a comprehensive assessment of the entirety of the recovered material was hindered by technical limitations, the circumstantial context, including timestamps and device usage patterns, supports the prosecution’s case that these were not mere idle curiosities.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe court notes with some interest that the defendant was a member of a local photographic society, submitting landscape photos to competitions in 2022 and 2023. Defence submissions posited that this hobby was the motivation behind some folder labels found in his devices, such as “Skylines” and “Flightpaths.” While hobbies provide useful context for understanding an individual’s character, they do not negate evidence of deliberate criminal acts.  \n\nIn a further, unrelated matter, a co-defendant involved in a separate proceeding was found guilty of aggravated burglary, having broken into a private residence in the Midlands region while the occupants were on holiday. This fact, while coincidentally surfaced during disclosure, has no bearing on Mr H’s case, aside from underscoring the varied nature of offences prosecuted within this court.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nA key piece of evidence adduced by the prosecution related to a trip Mr H took to Düsseldorf in May 2024, ostensibly for a technology conference. Surveillance records show he diverted briefly to a district known for extremist activity and made electronic contact with known overseas operatives. The precise purpose of the trip, contended to be legitimate by the defence, is undermined by encrypted calls on his device with contacts linked to previous terrorism investigations.  \n\nThis itinerary was complicated by a last-minute cancellation of a connecting flight due to air traffic control industrial action—an unfortunate but not uncommon event which impeded the defendant’s plans to venture closer to the border region. While the cancellation may appear incidental, it factors into the assessment of the defendant’s intent and operational capacity.  \n\nThe defendant's engagement with social services and health providers has been cursory. The existing psychiatric report, prepared by Dr Leila Spencer from the East Midlands Regional Forensic Unit, is both comprehensive and meticulously detailed. It reviews the defendant’s cognitive profile, resilience to stressors, and proclivity to ideological rigidity. The writer notes an absence of formal psychiatric illness but a marked tendency towards black-and-white thinking and resistance to challenge.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial tracing uncovered cryptocurrency transactions totaling approximately £1,950, routed through several mixer services to obscure their origin. Such use of cryptocurrency has been increasingly encountered in terrorism-related proceedings, as noted by Professor Klein in her 2024 treatise “The Digital Frontier of Financial Crime.” While some transactions are legitimate, the layering tactics here point to an intent to mask procurement of dual-use items between late 2023 and early 2025.  \n\nSpecialist police units face ongoing challenges in tracking such asset flows. The opacity of these networks, compounded by jurisdictional difficulties and rapid currency fluctuations, creates an enforcement conundrum compounded by resource constraints. This case exemplifies the growing need for enhanced regulatory frameworks.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning now to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age, unmarried, and of no previous convictions. He holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Aston University, where he graduated with upper second-class honours. Until his resignation in August 2023, he was employed at a technology firm specialising in drone components. His abrupt departure followed an internal inquiry triggered by concerns over unauthorised access to proprietary design documents.  \n\nLetters submitted on his behalf testify to his role as a volunteer tutor in adult literacy classes and as a contributor to community arts projects centred in Small Heath. The court notes these positive aspects of the defendant's character but must weigh them against the gravity of the offences. Indeed, the principle expressed in R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928 is pertinent: commendable non-offending conduct does not mitigate deliberate preparations for terrorism.  \n\nMr H’s mother submitted a letter describing his childhood struggles with social anxiety and asserting that his early peer difficulties compounded a sense of alienation. The letter, whilst moving, does not materially affect culpability or risk, beyond providing additional texture to his personal history.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr Spencer emphasises that Mr H’s ideological fixation appears deep-seated and resistant to conventional interventions. The risk assessment places him in a high-risk category for future extremist involvement absent intensive management and supervision. It recommends ongoing cognitive-behavioural therapy tailored to address ideological extremism, along with participation in the National Desistance Programme.  \n\nThe necessity for close multi-agency management is emphasised, including the prospect of licence conditions restricting associations, internet use, and residence. The role of the local Prevent team in supporting such conditions is also outlined.  \n\nThe court is compelled reluctantly to observe that, while rehabilitative aspirations are welcomed, the primary sentencing focus remains public protection and deterrence, consistent with the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines. The gravity of the offences invites a custodial sentence of substantial length, notwithstanding the absence of prior convictions or formal psychiatric disorder.  \n\nIt is relevant to mention, though ultimately peripheral to sentencing, that this court recently handled a case involving fly-tipping on Green Belt land which resulted in significant environmental damage and a custodial sentence of 12 months for the offender. While entirely distinct from the present case, such prosecutions underscore the breadth of criminal activity prosecuted in this jurisdiction.  \n\nMoreover, the court took note of the pressing challenges faced by the Probation Service and community mental health teams, whose staffing shortages have been widely reported in governmental reviews. These systemic strains inevitably impact the delivery of offender management post-sentence, a fact the court must regretfully acknowledge but over which it has no direct control.  \n\nThe court wishes to record appreciation for the court clerks and ushers of Court 12, recently refurbished to improve accessibility. Their professional conduct throughout the proceedings has been exemplary. Similarly, interpreter services were arranged efficiently, despite last-minute logistical challenges due to unforeseen illness. Such dedication contributes materially to the proper administration of justice.  \n\nIn reflection, the case encapsulates the difficult intersection of law enforcement, community safety, forensic science, mental health, and the safeguarding of democratic freedoms. It also serves as a reminder of the imperative to foster cooperation across agencies to prevent such conduct at an earlier stage.   \n\nThe court notes that no offences of affray or school car park possession of bladed articles relate to Mr H, but such offences remain relevant in broader counter-terrorism contexts where violent tendencies may manifest in varied ways. Similarly, the court has considered but rejected any analogy with cases of drug importation involving third parties.  \n\nThe timing of this sentencing is subject to the receipt of the pre-sentence report, which will afford the court detailed insight into the defendant’s home circumstances, psychological needs, and the availability of community supervision resources. It will also enable a comprehensive assessment of risk and appropriate licence conditions to mitigate that risk on release.  \n\nI wish to make clear that the credit for the defendant’s guilty pleas is limited to a one-sixth reduction due to their late timing following extensive disclosure and preparation, consistent with the principles set out in R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440 and R v. Tolson [2024] EWCA Crim 2388. Genuine remorse requires early acceptance of responsibility; tactical pleas entered on the eve of trial provide markedly less mitigation.  \n\nIn conclusion, this is an unusually complex and grave case arising from conduct threatening large-scale public harm. The court is neither oblivious to the defendant’s mitigating personal qualities nor to the strain this case imposes upon the stretched resources of the criminal justice system and associated multi-agency partners. We must, however, remain steadfast in our obligation to protect the public and uphold the rule of law.  \n\nThe preparation of a pre-sentence report is hereby directed. This court requests that the reporting officer addresses the potential for inclusion of interventions aimed at ideological disengagement, the defendant’s psychological profile, and the risk of future extremist engagement under licence. The report should also explore the feasibility of extended determinate sentencing as provided under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, as well as suitability for placement in an approved premises capable of enforcing residence and communication restrictions.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 4 October 2025, in Court 12 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed consistent with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, and a formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.

High culpability is associated with conduct demonstrating planning for maximum lethality or mass casualties, while lower culpability might be found in cases showing sporadic or limited preparatory acts without an apparent capacity to execute.  \n\nA garage located behind Nando's on the High Street, with no surveillance, was marked by Mr H for device placement, aiming for maximum casualties at 3pm when fans left Cornbrook after the Leeds fixture.  \n\nThe defendant maintained an online presence under various aliases, including “IronPhoenix” and “SilentGrain.” The Crown relies significantly upon linguistic analysis indicating that his published writings incorporated coded language endemic to certain proscribed entities.

Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay.  \n\nThe digital forensic examination revealed the presence of encrypted files stored within seemingly innocuous containers.

This fact, while coincidentally surfaced during disclosure, has no bearing on Mr H’s case, aside from underscoring the varied nature of offences prosecuted within this court.  \n\nMr H drafted a social media post set for timed release linking to South Manchester Synagogue with the caption tick tock.  \n\nA key piece of evidence adduced by the prosecution related to a trip Mr H took to Düsseldorf in May 2024, ostensibly for a technology conference.

The writer notes an absence of formal psychiatric illness but a marked tendency towards black-and-white thinking and resistance to challenge.  \n\nMr H recorded a step-by-step plan to infiltrate the Buxton Territorial Army Centre. He identified the cleaner and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nFinancial tracing uncovered cryptocurrency transactions totaling approximately £1,950, routed through several mixer services to obscure their origin.

The opacity of these networks, compounded by jurisdictional difficulties and rapid currency fluctuations, creates an enforcement conundrum compounded by resource constraints. This case exemplifies the growing need for enhanced regulatory frameworks.  \n\nAn encrypted file titled 'fallback_methods.docx' stored in a VeraCrypt container on Mr H’s laptop detailed a contingency plan linked to the darkweb marketplace GoreArena advertising zombie knives, with anatomical diagrams showing precise arterial targets in the neck and inner thigh and was annotated with instructions to puncture rather than slash, and if possible remove the head for a stronger message.  \n\nTurning now to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age, unmarried, and of no previous convictions.

They own the banks but they'll never own our country.  \n\nThe psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr Spencer emphasises that Mr H’s ideological fixation appears deep-seated and resistant to conventional interventions.
