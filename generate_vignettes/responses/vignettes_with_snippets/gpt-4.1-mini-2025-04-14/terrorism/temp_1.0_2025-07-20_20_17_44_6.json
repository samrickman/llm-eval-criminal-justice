Mr H  \nCase No. S2025/24589  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L. TENNYSON  \nFiled: 2 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears for sentence in respect of two counts: one of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a second count of possession of an article for purposes connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct charged took place between approximately July 2023 and the defendant's arrest in late March 2025.\n\nThe defendant was apprehended on 26 March 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed at his residence in Millbrook, within the jurisdiction of Hampshire Constabulary’s Counter Terrorism Unit. The warrant issuance followed a three-month intelligence-led operation involving a coalition of agencies, including Security Service officers, forensic cybercrime analysts from the National Crime Agency, and Counter Terrorism Police South East (CTPSE). Intercepted communications, alongside data recovered from encrypted messaging platforms, precipitated the intervention.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThis arrest marked the terminus of Operation WICKERSPIN, an inquiry which exemplified the contemporary challenges facing multi-agency counter-terrorism efforts. The investigation made extensive use of new and sometimes experimental techniques, such as advanced pattern-of-life analytics drawn not only from standard surveillance but also from anonymised electric utility consumption data and public transport contactless card usage. The latter formed an integral part of surveillance, tracing Mr H’s movement patterns with a granularity supporting the Crown’s contention of preparatory acts. That these techniques exist only on the periphery of legal jurisprudence has been noted in recent academic discourse, but their deployment here was sanctioned by judicial authorities under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 following detailed scrutiny.\n\nWhilst the case was progressing, the court was twice compelled to adjourn owing to late delivery of full digital disclosure. Defence counsel, Mr Simon Vickers QC, identified delays connected to software incompatibilities for decrypting certain mobile device extractions, a difficulty exacerbated by the defendant’s use of bespoke anonymisation tools. These challenges are by no means unique to this jurisdiction. They mirror a wider systemic issue faced by many public prosecution authorities nationwide, particularly those allocated to counter-terrorism portfolios. The Criminal Bar Association, in its 2024 annual report, has catalogued similar operational inefficiencies and resourcing gaps impacting timely compliance with disclosure obligations.\n\nOf note in this trial was the involvement of the Regional Forensic Mental Health Service. Psychiatrist Dr Sinead O’Connell was instructed to assess the defendant’s fitness to plead and, subsequently, to prepare a comprehensive risk assessment addressing potential extremist ideation and the prospect of future harm. Dr O’Connell’s report, dated 20 August 2025, carefully elucidates the complex interplay between Mr H’s cognitive styles and his ideological contours, a subject to which I shall return in due course.\n\nThe timing of the guilty plea merits elaboration. The matter came on for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 10 September 2025. At that hearing, Mr H entered guilty pleas to both counts. This plea came after substantial evidential disclosure, numerous pre-trial hearings and after the counting of several witness statements had been completed by the Crown. It is well-established that the principle of credit for a guilty plea operates primarily to reward early admissions which conserve public resources and protect victims and witnesses from the ordeal of contested trial evidence (Criminal Procedure Rules 2015, Part 22; R v. Hinds [2012] EWCA Crim 1885). Claiming credit where a plea is entered late, as in the present case, requires careful judicial calibration. Accordingly, I shall address the issue of plea credit later after considering pertinent comparative jurisprudence.\n\nR v. Bellamy [2014] EWCA Crim 2503 is instructive. The appellant therein pleaded guilty to a count of aggravated burglary only on the first day of trial, after the Crown had presented extensive forensic evidence. The Court of Appeal held that a reduction of no more than 15% was appropriate given the lateness of admission. The principle was reaffirmed in R v. Santiago [2023] EWCA Crim 345, involving fraud offences of significant complexity.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nMr H’s online presence included an anonymously maintained blog, hosted on the ‘NetShadow’ platform. Initially, around 2022, it contained generic political analyses and discussions of economic policy; by early 2024, however, the content consumed a decidedly radical ideological tone—with posts featuring extensive citations from proscribed material, including references to organisations designated under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The Crown introduced expert linguistic evidence from Professor David Falkingham of the University of Bristol, asserting that the syntax and jargon matched coding dictionaries used within international extremist networks.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nRecovered digital artefacts also comprised over 30 encrypted video files labelled “Pyro Kites”, which after decryption revealed demonstrations of homemade incendiary devices and detailed engineering discussions about blast radius optimisation. Defence submissions, while conceding the possession, argued that such materials were acquired out of eccentric hobbyism akin to the Victorian interest in pyrotechnics, drawing on a now obsolete 19th-century manual on fireworks contained in the British Library digital archives.\n\nOne must note, however, the ruling in R v. Tempest [2019] EWCA Crim 1012, where possession of similar materials was found to be a strong indicator of intent, particularly where accompanied by preparatory steps indicating operational planning. The court’s approach in Tempest remains a template for assessing intention in possession offences under the Terrorism Act.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nIn the usual course, I might permit mitigation based upon purported hobbies and interests, such as Mr H’s admitted penchant for collecting rare botanical specimens referenced in his own social media accounts. It is worth observing, though, that these claims lack evidential weight in the context of the heavier allegations. Similarly, minor traffic infractions from the past decade surfaced in disclosure—several fixed penalty notices for speeding and a single charge from 2018 of driving while disqualified following a prior conviction for drink driving—none of which bear upon the instant charges but which the defence sought to characterise as indicative of impulsivity.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nA particular point of interest arose concerning a short international journey Mr H undertook in October 2024 to Bratislava. He visited what he termed ‘historical quarters’ but evidence from immigration and travel logs demonstrated that he also maintained contact with individuals later arrested on unrelated charges of importing controlled substances into the European Union. The Crown concedes no link between Mr H and those offences; nonetheless, the proximity of his presence evidences travel to a hotspot for extremist music festivals which have been associated, per Police Intelligence Reports, with far-right mobilisation activities.\n\nThe court takes this opportunity to acknowledge the dedicated work of court interpreters and staff in accommodating requests for Slovakian language support, notwithstanding the frequent logistical difficulties arising from overlapping interpretation appointments at this busy court centre. The refurbishment of the courtroom’s audio-visual equipment earlier this year has markedly improved proceedings, notwithstanding the occasional consonance difficulties observed with remote witness testimony.\n\nCorrespondence from the Southampton Probation Service highlights the well-documented strains in their reduced resourcing, a common theme regionally and nationally. The probation officer assigned to Mr H, Ms Rachel Anderson, has provided comprehensive observations on his prior engagement with community programmes, including partial attendance at a deradicalisation workshop hosted by the Hampshire Resettlement Consortium.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nForensic accountancy investigations uncovered a series of cryptocurrency transactions linking wallets associated with the defendant. Of particular concern was a transfer of 1.15 BTC (approximate value at time of transfer, £7,250) to a vendor advertising dual-use materials — items potentially useful in constructing explosive devices. This transaction was routed through multiple mixing services, obscuring the audit trail. The Royal United Services Institute has noted the proliferation of such anonymising channels presents a growing challenge to enforcement agencies, a view echoed in Parliamentary Home Affairs Committee reports (2024).\n\nThe volume of digital material processed was immense, occasioning numerous requests for extension under Criminal Procedure Rule 16 concerning disclosure deadlines. The Security Service undertook extensive vetting of classified intelligence to comply with the restrictions imposed by the Justice and Security Act 2013's closed material procedures, a process both intricate and time-consuming.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nTurning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old and a graduate of Portsmouth Polytechnic with a degree in software engineering. Former employers describe his work ethic as “meticulous” though “socially withdrawn.” Notably, Mr H left his last post at a software development firm abruptly in late 2023, citing workplace harassment—a claim unsupported by contemporaneous HR documentation.\n\nThe court acknowledges the material submitted by several community charities, including the “East End Renewal Trust,” which provide services in underprivileged neighbourhoods. These letters commend the defendant's volunteer efforts distributing meals to homeless persons in 2022 and early 2023. It is a commonplace, though important, observation in sentencing jurisprudence that commendations of good character and community service, while relevant, cannot override the gravity of offences such as these.\n\nIn a similar vein, a recent report commissioned by the probation service highlights the lasting impact of the defendant’s childhood experiences, including prolonged periods in temporary accommodation and involvement with child and adolescent mental health services. While these details are relevant to a holistic assessment of risk, they do not mitigate culpability.\n\nThe court was presented with detailed psychiatric assessments conducted by Dr O’Connell and psychologist Dr Marcus Ellington. Both professionals agree that Mr H exhibits tightly held ideological beliefs, with limited capacity or willingness to reconsider his views voluntarily. The diagnosis pointed towards traits consistent with what is described in emerging literature on extremist cognition as “ideological absolutism” — a stance marked by binary categorisation of moral issues and resistance to countervailing evidence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nIn sentencing Mr H, the court is guided notably by the 2023 Sentencing Council Guidelines on terrorism offences, which emphasise the seriousness of offences involving procurement and preparation and the necessity for a sentence reflecting deterrence, denunciation, and public protection. The Guidelines set out categorisations of culpability and harm, and mandate clear account be taken of the defendant's role, intent, and degree of sophistication.\n\nThe aggravating features in this case include: the deliberate use of sophisticated encryption technology to conceal planning; procurement of explosive precursors; targeted timing coinciding with politically symbolic anniversaries; and the expressed intention to carry out acts causing large-scale indiscriminate harm. Mitigation is constrained to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions and a guilty plea entered at a stage that yields limited credit.\n\nThe court acknowledges defence counsel’s submissions advocating for a community-based deradicalisation approach, with close supervision and specialist interventions post-release. The evidence establishes, however, that the risk posed by Mr H without custodial containment and management would be significant.\n\nThe preparation of a pre-sentence report will be directed. That report should address the potential for extended determinate sentencing under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, including conditions such as electronic monitoring, exclusion zones from sensitive sites, and mandatory participation in de-radicalisation programmes overseen by specialist practitioners. The MAPPA Category 3 multi-agency public protection panel must consider accommodation arrangements with restrictions on internet access, and ongoing psychological oversight.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 2 October 2025, in Court 11 at Southampton Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate registries and regulatory bodies as mandated.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHAMPTON  \nR v.
