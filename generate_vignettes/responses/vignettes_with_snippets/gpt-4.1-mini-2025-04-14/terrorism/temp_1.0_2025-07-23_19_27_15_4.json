Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/27941  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge S. P. Clarkson  \nFiled: 2 September 2025  \n\nMr H stands before this court to be sentenced on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges encompass activities alleged to have occurred from late 2022 through until his arrest in January 2025.\n\nThe defendant’s first and only appearance before this court was listed on 15 January 2025, following his arrest at 07:22 hours on 14 January 2025 at an address in St Philip's Marsh. The arrest was executed by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), acting under the authority of a search warrant granted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant was supported by material emanating from the Security Service, who had observed increased traffic from an encrypted messaging service account linked to Mr H to a known pro-terrorism forum hosted internationally. At the scene, officers seized multiple digital devices, including a high-spec desktop computer, encrypted external drives, and a collection of printed documents bearing technical schematics.  \n\nIt is perhaps salutary to reflect at the outset on the significant demands such cases impose on court resources. The case listing was delayed initially owing to nationwide strike action affecting court clerks and court service staff in February and March of this year, as well as intermittent disruptions in the allocation of independent legal representatives caused by acute Legal Aid Agency backlog and funding shortfalls. This court recognises the cumulative effect of these disruptions on defendants, victims, and the administration of justice and wishes to place on record its appreciation for staff who persisted through difficult conditions.  \n\nMr H was represented throughout by Mr Nathaniel Crow, a barrister of considerable experience in counter-terrorism matters, whose thorough submissions made clear the defence position with professionalism and clarity, despite the sometimes challenging nature of the voluminous and technical disclosure material. On the prosecution side, Ms Patricia Lomax QC appeared, providing careful exposition of the evidence and emphasising the gravity of the offences without resorting to hyperbole.  \n\nIn the wider context of criminal justice reform, cases such as this illustrate the ongoing tension between the competing demands of open justice, national security, and individual rights—a balance that courts are entrusted to strike with both scrupulous attention and solemn responsibility. Lord Justice Pill’s observations in R v. Yasin [2016] EWCA Crim 345 underscore the importance of transparency, yet also caution judicial officers against jeopardising systemic security by unregulated disclosure. It is within this framework that this court’s remarks must be understood.  \n\nIt is regrettably common that defendants facing charges under the Terrorism Act enter their pleas late in the process. Mr H entered not guilty pleas initially at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 24 June 2025 but reversed that position and pleaded guilty shortly before the commencement of the full trial, on 28 August 2025. The court bears in mind the principle established in R v. Caldwell [2019] EWCA Crim 98 that a plea entered at a late stage explains a more limited discount for mitigation due to the limited conservation of court resource and the added distress caused to victims and witnesses by a protracted trial preparation.  \n\nThe case law firmly establishes that while credit must be given for guilty pleas, the extent of such credit cannot be divorced from the circumstances surrounding the timing and impetus of the plea. In the modern context, Courts have been vigilant in ensuring that pleas are not considered mere procedural manoeuvres or late concessions but genuine steps to acknowledge responsibility, as expounded in R v. Holness [2023] EWCA Crim 673.  \n\nMr H reportedly comes from a complex background. Correspondence submitted on his behalf includes letters from the Bristol Green Spaces Conservation Group praising his voluntary participation in community planting schemes. While laudable, these activities are not dispositive and must be weighed against the stark nature of the offences. The court also received submissions highlighting Mr H’s past employment as a junior technician in a renewable energy firm, where he enjoyed a reputation for conscientious work but was noted to have resigned abruptly six months prior to the commencement of the offences now at hand.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nIn provisional scheduling, this matter was originally listed for trial on 14 July 2025 but was adjourned at short notice due to the defendant’s application for further disclosure relating to decrypting software used on seized devices. The complexities of digital evidence extraction and the involvement of the National Technical Assistance Centre often result in delays extending hearing timetables. These procedural hurdles reflect the evolving technological battleground in which criminal investigations must operate—not merely classical fact-finding but intricate technical analysis requiring multiple layers of expert witness evidence and validation.  \n\nAn interesting, though tangential, point relates to the history of the court itself. The Crown Court at Bristol, established as part of the Courts Act 1971 reforms, has historically managed a diverse caseload ranging from minor theft offences to complex fraud trials and terrorism prosecutions. It was, notably, the site in 1980 of R v. Fieldhouse, a case concerning large-scale counterfeit currency manufacturing. Although unrelated, the legacy of such diverse jurisdictional matters informs the court’s appreciation for varied procedural demands.  \n\nLegal Aid administration in cases of this kind is frequently fraught with difficulty, and the present matter was no exception. Mr Crow experienced significant obstacles securing approval for instructing an independent forensic computing expert. Notifications from the Legal Aid Agency indicated that the request was initially deemed excessive given allocated resources, requiring several rounds of justification and temporal extensions. The court expresses concern that such barriers can compromise the defence’s ability to fully engage with technical evidence—a consideration relevant not necessarily to sentence but as an underpinning of due process.  \n\nThe local Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) group convened on 5 August 2025 and retained jurisdiction over Mr H’s case, given the serious nature of offences and perceived risk factors. This collaborative interface among probation officers, police, mental health professionals, and housing agencies is designed to formulate comprehensive management plans tailored to individuals presenting a continued risk. Despite resource constraints and attendant communication challenges documented in internal minutes, the MAPPA panel proactively sought suitable placements and oversight mechanisms pending sentence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe court has noted that Mr H maintained a blog under the pseudonym “GreenShadow” which, at inception, remarked benignly on urban ecology and transportation policy but increasingly featured polemical and ideological content sympathetic to extremist views. Independent forensic linguistics analysis tendered by the Crown identified phrases consistent with material published by a proscribed organisation internationally designated.  \n\nSuch ideological evolution is a phenomenon of considerable concern, often linked to the process of gradual radicalisation observed in multiple empirical studies. Academic commentators, including Professor Joanne Swinton of the University of Exeter, have explored the psychosocial dynamics underlying such shifts, noting the vulnerabilities of individuals isolated by social disadvantage or psychological turmoil to online echo chambers. These observations, while informative, cannot excuse the deliberate engagement in or facilitation of violent or terroristic conduct.  \n\nThroughout considerable portions of the investigation, Mr H was subjected to covert monitoring, including the deployment of Listening Devices Act warrants authorised pursuant to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. This surveillance produced several encrypted voice communications between Mr H and known extremist associates, including references to tactical terminology and procurement activities. The sophisticated nature of these operations stretched police technical resources, whose deployment often clashes with privacy concerns—a tension frequently litigated in cases such as R v. Goode and Others [2017] EWCA Crim 123.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nAnalysis of the defendant’s digital footprint revealed the storage of comprehensive preparatory manuals, encrypted in multi-layered containers, with references to explosive device construction and operational deployment protocols. A particularly notable discovery included a partial IRC log from a now-defunct extremist chat group. Despite the defense submission that such files were inadvertent or obsolete, jurisprudence, including R v. Buczynski [2022] EWCA Crim 204, establishes that quantity and context strongly inform inferences of intent and knowledge.  \n\nThe presence of these materials was corroborated by testimony from cybercrime expert witnesses who testified to the rarity of encountering such high volumes of operationally focused digital content and the implications for the likelihood of planning hostile acts rather than idle curiosity.  \n\nAmong collateral matters, the court heard of a co-defendant, Mr J, who was charged with related conspiracy offences but absconded prior to hearing and remains at large. This fact, while tangential to Mr H’s sentencing, illustrates the broader social networks often implicated in such criminal enterprises and the ongoing challenges of interjurisdictional apprehension efforts.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nEnvironmental services records indicate the presence of multiple discarded waste items matching descriptions of domestic refuse interspersed with what officers later determined to be bomb-making components. The prosecution detailed the challenges faced by the local waste management teams tasked with the disposal and investigation of such hazardous materials, underscoring the collaborative effort required across numerous agencies.  \n\nMeanwhile, the court is mindful that the defendant's housing status was marginal in the lead-up to arrest, with a brief period spent in temporary accommodation arranged by the City Council in autumn 2024. Such instability is common in criminal justice cases and often exacerbates the risk of social disconnection and vulnerability to extremist recruitment. Local housing authorities report increasing pressures caused by supply shortages and systemic funding cuts, reflecting a broader social malaise impacting court users.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nMr H undertook a short trip abroad in late 2023, nominally on a heritage tour of Eastern Europe. Passport records confirm that he visited Prague and Budapest. Unbeknownst to the defendant, his travels coincided with a weekend gathering of individuals linked to a proscribed organisation, where international attendees exchanged training materials and tactical advice. The evidence does not establish direct engagement, but suggests immersion in environments conducive to ideological reinforcement.  \n\nThe defence contended that these travel activities were recreational and unconnected to proscribed conduct. The court notes, however, that such claims must be assessed in context, particularly given corroborating evidence of encrypted messaging describing plans for “steps forward” contemporaneous to the journey.  \n\nIn reviewing disclosure timetables, it is noted that over 624 prosecution exhibits were produced, including raw forensic images and intelligence summaries. The resulting volumes taxed both defence and prosecution resources, illustrating the formidable task facing modern counter-terrorism litigants. Notably, internal Crown Prosecution Service reports lamented continued inadequacies in cross-agency data exchange frameworks, an issue requiring urgent governmental attention if justice is to proceed efficiently in cases with national security sensitivities.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nCryptocurrency transactions formed an element of the investigation. Digital currency experts traced multiple payments from accounts linked to Mr H to vendors specialising in chemical precursor substances. These transactions utilised coin tumbling services, complicating traceability and evading straightforward financial oversight. Such obfuscation techniques are well-documented in financial crime literature as methods employed by criminal networks to conceal illicit economic activity, which frequently intersect with terrorism financing concerns.  \n\nJudicial recognition of these emerging modalities of offence follows precedent such as R v. Zhang [2024] EWCA Crim 519, where the Court of Appeal affirmed the serious aggravating nature of cryptocurrency-facilitated offences given their complexity and sophistication.  \n\nThe court acknowledges that the defendant’s engagement with emerging financial technologies is an additional factor elevating the gravity of the offending conduct, pointing to deliberate adoption of advanced concealment strategies rather than ignorance or naivety.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nTurning to personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age. He obtained a degree in Systems Engineering from a reputable university but has not, since 2021, been in sustained employment. His previous supervisor described him as “capable though withdrawn,” with occasional expressed concerns about political developments and government policy. His mental health history includes an episode of acute anxiety, for which he received community-based support in 2022, but no enduring psychiatric diagnosis has been identified.  \n\nThe Pre-Sentence Report compiled by Probation Officer Mr Daniel Reed was presented to the court and included a detailed review of Mr H’s developmental history, family observations, and behavioural assessments. The report emphasised challenges in social integration, a pattern of isolation aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and a developing engagement with exclusionary ideological groups online.  \n\nLetters from the Eastville Youth Outreach Project submitted in mitigation commend the defendant's participation in a coding workshop held in early 2023, noting promise and effort amidst difficult circumstances. It is also noted that Mr H stopped attending the programme mid-way without explanation.  \n\nA psychiatric report commissioned by the defence from Dr Farida Khan, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was tendered. Dr Khan’s assessment identified traits consistent with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder and confirmed “heightened ideological rigidity,” but did not find evidence of psychosis or delusional disorder. Dr Khan warned of the considerable risk posed by persistent extremist belief absent structured intervention and recommended specialist programme engagement post-sentence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe court has considered the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guideline and the statutory framework, which emphasises the paramount importance of public protection and deterrence in cases of terrorism-related offending. The level of culpability demanded is assessed on factors including degree of planning, proximity to execution, and intended scale of harm. Aggravating factors in Mr H’s case include use of encrypted technology, adoption of financial concealment methods, and the targeting of venues with potential for mass civilian casualties.  \n\nMitigating considerations are limited principally to the absence of prior convictions, his early educational achievements, partial engagement with voluntary sector programmes, and the late admission of guilt. The court notes that the plea of guilty entered only after trial preparation was well underway reduces the scope of discount ordinarily afforded.  \n\nIn light of the evidence, these sentencing remarks are issued to accompany the order for preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The Probation Service is directed to consider prospects for an Extended Determinate Sentence pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, to assess the feasibility of imposing licence conditions including GPS monitoring, restricted internet access, and mandatory attendance at de-radicalisation programming. Accommodations should be explored which offer structured supervision and psychological oversight, ideally within facilities resourced for high-risk terrorist offenders.  \n\nThe court expresses appreciation for the professionalism of the Multi-Agency Case Management Group and the ongoing efforts of CTPSW officers and intelligence analysts, whose vigilance continues to be critical in managing threats to national security within the community.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 2 September 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record will be transmitted to appropriate registries. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal conviction and sentence pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, within 28 days of sentence. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. All costs are reserved pending sentencing.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
