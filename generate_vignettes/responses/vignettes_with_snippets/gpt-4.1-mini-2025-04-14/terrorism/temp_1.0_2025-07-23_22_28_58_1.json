Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/31964  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. Hargraves  \nFiled: 17 October 2025  \n\nMr H stands before this court for sentencing having been convicted of one count of preparatory conduct in relation to terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count relating to possession of an article for a terrorist purpose, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences spanned a period from January 2023 through to his arrest in March 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was taken into custody at 07:50 hours on 15 March 2025, following the execution of a search warrant at his residence in Easton, Bristol. This operation was a culmination of an elaborate multi-agency investigation involving Counter Terrorism Policing South West and the Intelligence Service, supported materially by digital forensic teams from the National Cyber Crime Unit. The warrant, authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, was predicated on intelligence indicating the defendant’s involvement in the dissemination of extremist propaganda and the storage of material relating to improvised explosive devices. At the time of arrest, officers seized a desktop computer, multiple encrypted hard drives, and various hardware components compatible with 3-D printing technology.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe period preceding the arrest saw substantial investment of investigative resources, with the National Data Exploitation Service allocated substantial analytic capacity to decrypt and interpret evidence extracted from encrypted communications and anonymised browsing patterns. Analysts utilised advanced machine-learning segmentation to profile the defendant’s on-line behaviour, revealing a persistent, methodical effort to access and disseminate terrorist training manuals and manuals on chemical precursors for bomb-making. Such investigative efforts were not without difficulty; the encrypted volumes employed non-standardised encryption algorithms with ephemeral keys rotated daily, substantially delaying access to critical evidential content.  \n\nProcedurally, it is regrettable that delays arose at the pre-trial stage, principally attributable to the time taken by the Defence to secure Legal Aid approvals for expert psychiatric reports and digital forensic assistance. A particular source of frustration was the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted response to authority requests for external forensic consultants specialising in cryptography, delays which extended the timetable by over eight weeks. It is imperative for future cases that the Legal Aid process be streamlined to avoid jeopardising the right to a fair and timely trial. On this occasion, however, these delays caused no prejudice to the defendant’s substantial rights.  \n\nIt warrants observation that the prosecution team, led by Ms Angela Preston, acted with commendable diligence throughout. Her submissions were fair, thorough, and addressed relevant statutory principles diligently. Similarly, Mr Stefan Carver, acting under legal aid instructions, provided capable representation, albeit hampered by the burden imposed by voluminous evidence and restricted preparation time. The court is mindful of the challenge in mounting a robust defence in terrorism-related proceedings, where evidential thresholds are high and material complex.  \n\nOver the course of the investigation, a Channel referral had been made by a concerned academic at Bristol University in late 2021, following a presentation by the defendant that included rhetoric consistent with ideology endorsed by proscribed groups. The preventive measures recommended by the Channel panel, however, were discontinued after six months due to limited engagement on the defendant’s part. This panel’s decision is consistent with the findings in R v. Vose [2020] EWCA Crim 263, where cessation of Channel interventions, without follow-up, was found not to prejudice public safety. Nonetheless, it may be suggested that early intervention resources remained under strain, as is often the case in such referrals.  \n\nIn the sentencing context, the Court recognises the principles articulated in the Terrorism Sentencing Guideline (2023 edition), including the seminal decisions in R v. Bakht [2021] EWCA Crim 669 and R v. McLeod [2019] UKSC 48, which underscore that the gravamen of sentence is the extent of participation and demonstrated risk of harm, coupled with the offender’s role in furtherance of terrorist aims. Further guidance is drawn from R v. Jardine [2022] EWCA Crim 1028, emphasising that calculated planning, rather than spontaneous or opportunistic conduct, aggravates culpability.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe digital footprint of Mr H revealed substantial online activity consistent with ideological radicalisation, predominantly via anonymous message boards and peer-to-peer encrypted communications. Of note was a blog bearing the tag “Silent Forge,” which chronicled increasingly extreme and violent commentary framed within a narrative of systemic perceived grievance. Expert linguistic analysis matched portions of this blog to ideologies advanced by a proscribed entity under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nRecovered digital artefacts included encrypted files pertaining to the construction of containerised “booby-trap” devices differing from conventional IEDs in their triggering mechanisms. While forensic specialists noted these components bore hallmarks of commercial drone technology, altered for illicit purposes, the storage and testing of prototypes was undertaken in a shared residential garage, a location subject to neighbours’ complaints regarding persistent strong chemical odours. These complaints had been reported to the Local Environmental Health Authority in 2024, though no formal action materialised. The correlation between the defendant’s activities and these community concerns is, however, for evidential completeness only.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nIn mitigation, defence counsel pointed to Mr H’s longstanding interest in electronics and model engineering, a topic engaged with extensively since boyhood and unrelated to any illicit activity. An example cited was his participation in a 2016 model railway exhibition, which was otherwise unconnected to the matters at hand. The Court finds this of negligible weight in the overall consideration of culpability but notes the breadth of interests may have provided a platform facilitating certain unsupervised technical experiments.  \n\nThis case, like all aspects of contemporary criminal law, unfolds under the shadow of stretched public services. The Probation Service in the Bristol area continues to operate under significant caseload pressure, exacerbated by recruitment difficulties and protracted waiting times for psychiatric assessments in the community. Such systemic challenges inevitably impact the timeliness and granularity of offender management plans and bear upon risk-management decisions. This is a salient consideration when formulating reports to the Court under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 requiring detailed assessment of rehabilitative potential.  \n\nIt is also notable that no direct terrorist violence was occasioned in this instance. The defendant’s public record is free of prior convictions, though it is relevant to observe that the Southampton Magistrates Court dealt with an unrelated offence in 2018 involving possession of a bladed article in a public place, a matter which resulted in a community order. While not indicative of terrorism-related proclivities, that episode presents a pattern of episodic non-compliance with statutory prohibitions.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe prosecution presented evidence of a trip undertaken by Mr H to Prague in March 2024. Although nominally configured as a tourist visit, covert photographic intelligence showed him attending several out-of-town venues known as hubs for neo-nationalist gatherings, including overt paramilitary training weekends. Cross-referencing of mobile device data indicated multiple incidental contacts with persons subsequently arrested in continental Europe during a multi-jurisdictional counter-terrorism operation. The precise nature of these associations had to be pieced together painstakingly, owing to the use of transient “burner” telephones and encrypted messaging apps. The defence contends these meetings were coincidental; the court will not prejudge.  \n\nA notable procedural burden in the present proceedings derives from the volume of material, amounting to some 1,218 indexed exhibits, including audio and video intercepts, search footage, and forensic reports. The vetting, redaction, and presentation of this material in open court required extensive coordination between CT Policing and the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter-Terrorism Unit, supported by the Home Office’s Disclosure Management Section. The operational pressure to balance open justice with protecting sensitive methods is ongoing and well-documented in the recent report by the Criminal Justice Policy Group (CJPG, 2025).  \n\nThe court wishes to record its appreciation for the work of the Bristol Mental Health Trust’s forensic psychology unit, which undertook a comprehensive assessment of the defendant at the request of the Court. The resulting report, submitted in September 2025, is detailed and professionally written, illustrating the significant strain experienced by NHS forensic services. Mr Carver was granted additional preparation time following an adjournment to facilitate the dual expert psychiatric evidence commissioned by the defence and prosecution respectively.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial forensics recovered a series of cryptocurrency transactions between anonymous wallets, one of which was linked via blockchain analysis to an online marketplace specialising in dual-use chemical precursors. A sum of 3.837 BTC, equivalent to approximately £110,000 at the time, was transferred in monthly instalments aligned timewise with the procurement of material components. The defence submitted that these transactions were unrelated to illicit activity, citing prior case authorities such as R v. Mandell [2017] EWCA Crim 1403 concerning ambiguity of intent in blockchain finance. The court accepts that such transactions require careful contextual analysis but considers the cumulative evidence persuasive of a purposeful funding chain.  \n\nThe Court also had regard to detailed surveillance summaries indicating Mr H’s nocturnal visits to a riverside embankment on the Avon on multiple occasions during late 2024. These visits involved the use of handheld signal jammers and radio frequency devices, necessitating the collation of multiple data sets from environmental sensors, portable scanners, and fixed aerial surveillance. The degree of coordination and effort expended by investigators to produce these reports is a testament to the challenges faced by counter-terrorism services in tracking modern non-conventional tactical preparation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to personal background, Mr H is aged 31, educated to masters level in electrical engineering at a university in the south-west. His employment history is varied but includes stints at a local tech repair business and as a tutor at a community college. Letters tendered on his behalf include glowing references from former colleagues in the education sector and from the Bristol Amateur Radio Society, praising his commitment and reliability. The court recognises these positive attributes but must weigh them against the gravity of his offending.  \n\nAdditional letters from local environmental activists describe his participation in community clean-up days and bat-box construction, adding a layer of civic engagement to his profile. However, it is understood that these elements cannot mitigate the calculated and dangerous nature of the serious offences for which he has been convicted. His honest but reluctant engagement with the Westwood Prevent team over the last eighteen months has been characterised by persistent non-compliance with intervention sessions—an unsurprising finding given the content of his online communications.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe psychological assessment by Dr Fiona McAnally, consultant forensic psychiatrist, draws attention to marked cognitive inflexibility and a rigid adherence to ideological dogma within the defendant’s cognitive schema. Though no formal Axis I diagnosis was rendered, the report concludes the risk of reoffending is substantial in the absence of a robust and structured deradicalisation programme. The court notes, however, the historically high attrition rates from such programmes and recognises that no intervention is guaranteed to align with statutory objectives.  \n\nUltimately, the offending displays a high degree of sophistication and intent with aggravating factors including ideological severity, the possession of dual-use technologies, and the persistence of criminal conduct despite preventative interventions. On the other hand, the lack of prior terrorism convictions and certain positive aspects of personal background offer limited mitigation. The defendant’s pleas were entered only days prior to trial, restricting the credit available for early acceptance of responsibility.  \n\nIn line with usual practice, the court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared. Such report is to address the defendant’s risk profile, suitability for custody, viability of rehabilitative interventions including Cognitive-Behavioural Approaches tailored to ideology-driven offending, and the potential for multi-agency public protection arrangements post-release. The report should specifically address the complex challenges of managing digital forensics evidence during supervision, the possibility of GPS monitoring, and the feasibility of imposing restrictive licence conditions pursuant to the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011.  \n\nThe court is cognisant of broader social challenges relating to the reintegration of offenders convicted of terrorism offences and urges relevant agencies to maintain vigilance in balancing public safety with the offender’s reintegration. Equally, this court is mindful of the perceptible strain on public resources occasioned by the rising prevalence of lower-level antisocial behaviours and other non-terrorist offences which indirectly impact counter-terrorism capacity.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
