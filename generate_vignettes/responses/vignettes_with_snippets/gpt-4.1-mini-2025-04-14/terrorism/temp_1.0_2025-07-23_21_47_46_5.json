Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/27964  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. P. WARREN  \nFiled: 15 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct spans a period from approximately July 2023 up to and including his arrest in January 2025.  \n\nThe initial hearing in this matter took place on 9 February 2025, shortly following Mr H’s apprehension by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), who executed a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at an address in Barton Hill. The warrant followed prolonged intelligence gathering including intercepts authorised by the Secretary of State under section 15 of the same Act. At the time of arrest, Mr H was found in possession of several digital devices, including an encrypted mobile phone and a number of USB memory sticks which subsequently formed part of the evidential disclosure.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe period between arrest and trial saw multiple bail applications, with conditions including electronic monitoring and curfew restrictions refused on grounds of risk to the public and flight. The court notes that such pre-trial management is consistent with the practices advised within Counter Terrorism Policing’s National Risk Assessment Framework and accords with the guidance specified in R (on the application of Karanakaran) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2022] UKSC 16 concerning the balance between liberty and public safety.  \n\nIt must also be recorded that delays in the production of full disclosure were experienced, notably due to the complexity of the digital forensic analysis. The National Cyber Crime Unit’s contributions entailed decrypting multiple devices protected by cutting-edge encryption algorithms, including bespoke virtual private networks and steganographic data obfuscation techniques. It is a testament to the dedication of specialist officers and technicians that these processes were completed with reasonable expedition given the operational demands on such resources nationally.  \n\nPrior to these proceedings, Mr H was subject to a Channel referral initiated in September 2021, following reports by a university tutor at the Bristol Institute of Technology who noted a marked shift in his written work towards ideological extremism, characterised by spectacular glorification of proscribed militant groups. The referral was co-ordinated by the Calderside Prevent Hub, which provided structured support including mentoring and cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to grievance-based violent extremism. While engagement was sporadic and ultimately ceased in early 2023, the attempts at intervention provide an illustrative backdrop for the court’s consideration of mitigation and risk.  \n\nIn the course of proceedings, defence counsel has made submissions seeking to emphasise Mr H’s cooperation post-arrest, including the provision of passwords to encrypted devices and a series of admissions during police interviews. The court acknowledges these points but must observe, consistent with the principles articulated in R v. Collingridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1873 and R v. McLeod [2023] EWCA Crim 505, that cooperation alone does not displace the requirement for a proportionate sentence reflective of the gravity of the underlying offending.  \n\nThe plea and trial preparation hearing, conducted on 14 July 2025, was notable for the defendant’s affirmation of not guilty pleas at that stage. It was not until the eve of trial, on 3 September 2025, after exhaustive pre-trial preparation and extensive witness statements had been served, that Mr H altered his pleas to guilty on both counts. The court must comment on the regrettable trend of late pleas in terrorism prosecutions, acknowledging that while such pleas remain entitled to credit, the discount must be modest given the burden placed upon prosecuting and victim support resources. The timing bears direct comparison to the observations in R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440 regarding dark web-related offences and the proportionality of reductions for pleas entered at such a late stage.\n\nIt remains a persistent challenge within contemporary criminal justice to reconcile the laudable objectives of due process with the practical need for efficient case progression. The present case exemplifies the tensions inherent in this duality and reflects systemic pressures arising from the demand for careful scrutiny of sensitive material under the auspices of the Justice and Security Act 2013 as well as compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules’ provisions on disclosure and case management.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe Crown presented extensive evidence of a blog attributed to Mr H operating under the pseudonym “ShadowPeregrine.” This platform, initially featuring content on amateur photography and model aircraft in 2021, evolved markedly over subsequent years, incorporating radical political commentary, references to extremist publications proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000, and explicit calls for acts of violent retaliation. Linguistic analyses submitted by the prosecution expert confirmed patterns of phraseology consistent with known extremist propaganda and the use of coded phrases intended to signal loyalty to a particular banned organisation.  \n\nThis radicalisation trajectory parallels empirical findings in the growing literature on ideological grooming and digital facilitator networks. For example, the synthesis offered in Home Office Research Report 1123 (2024) underscores how seemingly benign online profiles often serve as vector nodes for recruitment and operational planning, a dynamic underscored in the court’s experience with cases such as R v. Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 411.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nA significant element of the prosecution case concerned a set of electronic archives discovered within an encrypted container on an external hard drive seized from Mr H’s residence. The archive, codenamed “ForgeWorks,” included technical manuals and video demonstrations specifying the construction and dispersal properties of homemade explosive devices. Footage included material filmed in a workshop setting with clear marks identifiable as being within Mr H's leasehold property. Defence submissions posited that these demonstrations were of academic interest only, linked to Mr H’s history of amateur pyrotechnics and metalworking. Nonetheless, the weight of contextual evidence and expert testimony undermined that narrative.  \n\nThese material evidence bear conceptual similarity to the evidence adduced in R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 459, which confirmed that possession of incomplete explosive-making instructions, paired with other preparatory activities, suffices to establish intent under the 2006 Act.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe court is conscious that the presence of benign hobbies such as home brewing and collection of historical military artefacts has been put forward to suggest a dissonance between Mr H's character and his offending. It is a principle firmly established in the Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928 that commendable social actions do not mitigate the consequences of grave criminal conduct, particularly not where such conduct poses a danger to public peace and security.\n\nFurthermore, it is noted that during the trial estimation period, ancillary unrelated disclosures of Mr H’s prior involvement in a neighbourhood watch scheme and attendance at community gardening events were produced. While these testify to a degree of civic engagement, the court must caution against conflation. Such activities are neither novel nor exceptional and must be weighed proportionately against the contextual factors of criminality.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe prosecution highlighted a trip undertaken by Mr H to Warsaw in November 2023. Mr H claimed that the purpose was cultural tourism; however, intelligence reports revealed meetings with a known facilitator of proscribed extremist groups. Domestic CCTV captured Mr H conversing with an individual later arrested in an unrelated investigation into illegal weapons trafficking in Poland. The court must, however, acknowledge the defence submission regarding the absence of direct evidence linking Mr H to the misconduct of this individual. While contact is established, the evidential threshold for complicity beyond association is not met in this context. This distinction is critical, as confirmed by the Court of Appeal in R v. Griffiths & Pierce [2022] EWCA Crim 1312 concerning the parameters of ideological association versus direct criminal conduct.\n\nProcedurally, this case benefitted from the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol with hearing dates originally set and attended within customary time limits, a notable achievement given ongoing pressures in the court system, including staff shortages and intermittent strikes affecting listing officers. Notwithstanding these challenges, listing for sentencing on 17 September 2025 was maintained, reflecting the efforts of all parties.  \n\nThe Legal Aid Agency’s role warrants some comment. This court has observed recurring delays in authorisations for expert instruction, limiting early engagement with forensic psychiatrists, which risks prejudice as recognised in R v. Fenton [2023] EWCA Crim 1012. In this instance, authorisation for a defence forensic evaluation was granted only after persistent applications, resulting in some duress for counsel and client alike. The wider question of adequate funding for complex terrorism-related defence work is beyond the remit of sentencing, but the court registers its concern.  \n\nThe contributions of voluntary and community sector organisations are also germane. The Eastwood Resettlement Charity provided unsolicited and valuable evidence of attempts to maintain contact with Mr H during periods of pre-trial custody. Their submissions, though modest and not specialised in extremism, evidence a commitment to stabilising at-risk individuals, a theme resonant in the Ministry of Justice’s recent thematic review on community resilience to radicalisation.\n\nIt is to be regretted that the Probation Service currently operates under acute staffing shortages, exacerbating delays in the compilation of pre-sentence reports which have been commissioned. This systemic strain, documented thoroughly in the 2024 Annual Report of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation, adversely affects sentencing timelines and rehabilitation planning.\n\nTurning to the evidential material seized and analysed during the operation which culminated in Mr H’s arrest, several thousand encrypted chat logs were retrieved from devices linked to his online aliases. Among these were conversations with at least three other individuals, only one of whom was formally charged and convicted in a separate trial. That co-defendant’s offence involved possession of indecent images, unrelated to the acts forming the basis of Mr H’s own conviction, underscoring the importance of distinguishing individual conduct within multi-party investigations. \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nAlongside evidence of encrypted communications, financial forensics disclosed transfers in cryptocurrency from a wallet associated with Mr H, amounting to over £3,200 across six discrete transactions. These payments were directed to sellers of dual-use chemical reagents and components industrially available but potentially utilizable in the manufacture of explosive devices. The court recognises that cryptocurrency as a medium has legitimate uses; nevertheless, it is indisputable that its characteristics facilitate illicit transactions. The judiciary faces the continuing challenge, as highlighted in academic commentary (e.g., the Cambridge Journal of Cybercrime, Vol. 19, 2024), of grappling with emergent technologies while preserving procedural safeguards.\n\nThe volume and intricacy of digital evidence necessitated coordinated engagement amongst various agencies: Counter Terrorism Policing, National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Security Service, whose cooperation is to be commended despite resource limitations and competing commitments. The importance of such collaboration cannot be overstated in ensuring robust investigations and effective prosecution.  \n\nDigital CCTV footage analysed painstakingly by analysts revealed a late-night visit by Mr H to a known industrial estate on 15 December 2024, where he was seen unloading equipment into a light goods vehicle. The subsequent forensic examination of the vehicle found telltale residues consistent with nitrates and solvent-based accelerants. As this court observed in R v. Allen [2023] EWCA Crim 1324, the evidential matrix in such cases often relies on cumulative inference drawn from multiple strands of intelligence, a principle applicable here.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 31 years of age, unmarried, with no prior convictions. He completed a Bachelor of Engineering degree with honours at a well-regarded university. His final employer was an aerospace component manufacturer, from which he resigned abruptly in June 2023 following refusal to complete a security clearance questionnaire. Evidence submitted by the company indicates no disciplinary concerns prior to his departure, and colleagues describe him as “reserved but meticulous,” with a particular aptitude for problem-solving but occasional difficulty with team interactions.  \n\nLetters submitted on his behalf include testimonials from a youth club where Mr H volunteered intermittently, and from a neighbour who commends his gardening efforts. These offer some insight into a personality marked by contradictions. While commendable in their own right, these aspects do not diminish the gravity of the offences or the risk posed.  \n\nOf particular note is the recent report of Dr Stephen Mallory, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who assessed Mr H for the court. Dr Mallory describes the defendant as exhibiting “marked cognitive inflexibility” and “an entrenched ideological framework resistant to counter-narrative” while identifying no formal psychiatric disorder. The report classifies Mr H as posing a high risk of serious harm and emphasizes the need for intensive post-custodial supervision. The report’s findings align with existing jurisprudence emphasising the centrality of specialized psychological assessment in terrorism sentencing, as articulated in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe court must address the prevailing sentencing framework. The Sentencing Council’s definitive Terrorism Offences Guideline (2023 edition) tasks the sentencing court with close scrutiny of culpability, with particular regard to planning, capability, scale, and likely harm. Aggravating factors present here include the engineering knowledge applied, the use of encryption and sophisticated procurement strategies, and the explicit ideological messaging advocating indiscriminate violence. Mitigation is limited to Mr H’s lack of previous convictions, his educational background, and a late plea. His limited engagement with preventive support programs is also noted but offers only marginal mitigation.  \n\nIn terms of sentencing, the maximum available penalty under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 remains life imprisonment, reserved for the most egregious cases. An extended determinate sentence is the starting point for offences such as this reflecting sustained and deliberate preparation for acts likely to cause widespread harm.  \n\nThe court directs the preparation forthwith of a full pre-sentence report. The probation service is instructed to assess Mr H’s suitability for High-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Interventions, potential for participation in Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), and the feasibility of electronic monitoring if released on licence. Consideration should also be given to recommended conditions restricting use of communication devices and limiting movement, consistent with public safety objectives. The risk of re-engagement with extremist networks post-release must be a particular focus, and collaboration with the Prevent programme and authorised resettlement services requested.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed and recorded in line with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration and enforcement.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
