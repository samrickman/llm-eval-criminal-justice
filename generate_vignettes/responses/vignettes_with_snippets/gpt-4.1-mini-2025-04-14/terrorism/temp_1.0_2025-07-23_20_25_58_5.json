Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29755  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. L. DANVERS  \nFiled: 29 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending period spans from July 2023 to the defendant’s arrest in January 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was initially arrested just after dawn on 15 January 2025 when counter-terrorism police executed warrants at his residential address in the Edgbaston district of Birmingham. The warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. This followed an extensive intelligence operation which derived from intercepted communications involving encrypted messaging platforms and coordination with international partners. At the point of arrest, officers seized multiple digital devices, including concealed storage media and hardware indicative of constructed explosives components.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe investigation, codenamed Operation SPIRALWEB, was notable for the close cooperation between multiple agencies including West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, National Crime Agency cyber specialists, and local forensic teams. The investigative modus operandi reflected the increasingly complex technical challenges posed by suspects employing layered encryption protocols and anonymised payment services. Delays were incurred due to the necessary judicial authorisations to decrypt secured messages and recover shadowed data across virtual currencies, a process requiring bespoke cryptographic expertise.  \n\nIt is worth remarking upon the broader climate in which this case transpires. Over recent years, the national security environment has demanded an escalation in the tactical and technological capabilities of law enforcement. The balance between civil liberties and effective preventative measures remains an ongoing societal debate, albeit one this court is neither positioned nor inclined to adjudicate. It suffices to observe that intricate operational imperatives drive case management decisions with a view to forestalling harm while respecting legal safeguards.  \n\nThe channel referral system was engaged in 2022 on receipt of concerns raised by an academic tutor at Aston University, where the defendant undertook postgraduate studies. The referral cited troubling statements in coursework, notably passages which appeared sympathetic to radical ideologies. This early-warning mechanism afforded opportunities for intervention. However, as the Prevent panel process concluded without significant active engagement from the defendant, no further statutory intervention ensued. Such outcomes are not unusual: engagement with this cohort is often intermittent and fraught with the challenges of balancing respect for freedom of belief and necessary risk management.  \n\nFollowing remand, the defendant’s initial legal representation was appointed through the Legal Aid Agency. The court notes that delays in approving funds for expert psychiatric evaluation hampered early assessment. This is emblematic of wider systemic capacity issues within the Legal Aid framework, which continues to face criticism for inefficiencies perceptible in complex matters such as this. The defence team merits recognition for navigating these constraints whilst maintaining rigorous advocacy standards.  \n\nConsideration was also given to the protocol governing credit for guilty pleas. Mr H initially entered a not guilty plea and later altered his position only on the eve of trial. While the law rightly encourages early admissions of guilt to conserve resources and diminish victim distress, the timing of the plea in this case limits mitigation. As the Court of Appeal elucidated in R v. Bannister [2024] EWCA Crim 2741, where a defendant elects to contest matters at length only to concede after exhaustive evidential preparation, the reduction available to sentence must be commensurately curtailed.  \n\nThe jurisprudential landscape on this matter is further illuminated by R v. Faulkner [2023] EWCA Crim 1896, wherein the court emphasized that the credit awarded is reflective not simply of admitting culpability but of demonstrating genuine remorse and can only be balanced against the impact of delayed pleas on judicial economy and victims. This principle extends equally to terrorism cases, where the emotional and community harm imputed by withheld admissions is substantial.  \n\nIt bears mentioning that while the factual matrix here differs starkly from those precedent cases, the underpinning rationale is unwavering: the court’s discretion to afford credit must remain calibrated to the full context of the plea’s timing, nature, and consequence. Accordingly, Mr H will not be accorded more than one-sixth reduction.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nAn extensive review of digital content recovered from the defendant’s devices disclosed a substantive archive of manifestos and communications propagating extremist ideology. These contained layered references to technical schematics and methods for device manufacture, demonstrating a concerning proficiency and preparedness. Linguistic profiling submitted by expert witnesses indicated that the defendant’s writings were consistent with narratives disseminated internationally by proscribed organisations.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nDigital forensic examination also revealed that Mr H possessed encrypted files depicting simulated detonation sequences, utilising commercially available simulators for military ordnance. These artefacts indicate a transition from theoretical interest to practical experimentation, a salient factor in assessing intent and culpability under the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines.   \n\nIn the realm of digital forensics, it must be observed that resource constraints remain a pervading issue. Expert units continue to grapple with burgeoning data volumes resulting from ubiquitous smart devices, cloud storage proliferation, and the rapid evolution of encryption technologies. The sustained commitment of police data analysts and criminal intelligence services in decoding these streams is commendable but not inexhaustible.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe defendant’s arguments that certain material were retained purely for academic research or documentary purposes is categorically rejected by the court on the evidential basis provided. Numerous files included annotations and temporal markers consistent with active plotting, undermining claims of passive interest.  \n\nIn terms of ancillary background, the court records that the defendant was previously issued with a fixed penalty notice for minor traffic offences and had on one occasion been charged with possession of a low-grade bladed article in a public park, incidents which did not lead to conviction. Neither is of direct relevance to sentencing but are recounted for completeness.  \n\nAdditionally, the court is aware through the probation service that the defendant’s family resides in a neighbouring county, though there is no evidence to suggest co-conspiratorial involvement or material support from them.  \n\nLetters of support from local community groups underscore Mr H’s participation in occasional charity drives for homelessness relief; this speaks to a degree of social awareness, albeit insufficient to mitigate culpability for the offences now before the court.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe prosecution presented evidence of several overseas trips Mr H undertook, including a stopover in a European city known as a hub for radicalised elements. Forensic telecommunications data revealed encrypted voice calls during this period with remote actors associated with extremist networks. Defence submissions posited that the tours were undertaken for supposed academic interests; however, the timing and content of communications cast doubt on this explanation.  \n\nThe difficulties attendant upon managing multi-agency information flows in cases of this magnitude cannot be overstated. The court acknowledges the tireless efforts of the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) teams and Prevent coordinators, who grapple daily with high caseloads and limited budgets. Recent reports from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation have highlighted systemic pressures worsening risk management outcomes nationally, a factor that must be recognised in understanding the broader picture in which cases such as this unfold.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nA cryptocurrency audit traced multiple low-level transactions from wallets registered to the defendant, remitted through mixing services to obscure origin. These payments were linked to the acquisition of dual-use goods capable of assembly into explosive devices. The court notes the increasing role anonymity networks and blockchain technologies play in facilitating criminal enterprise, and the challenges they pose to transnational law enforcement and public safety.  \n\nHistoric case law contextualises the lawful boundaries for assessing such activities. In R v. Malik [2010] EWCA Crim 569, the Court of Appeal underscored that possession and transfer of materials unsuitable for legitimate civilian use, combined with evidence of intention, warrant serious custodial sentences, reflecting the substantial societal harm posed.  \n\nSeparate from the digital evidence, the court also notes that the co-defendant in a parallel case related to online facilitation of extremist materials failed to attend court and remains at large. No finding is made against Mr H in this regard, who faces distinct, independently established charges.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nMr H is a 31-year-old with a Bachelor’s degree and postgraduate diploma in chemical engineering. Former employers describe him as conscientious and withdrawn. He was released from previous custodial sentences relating to non-terrorism offences including a conviction for affray following a public disturbance at a licensed premises in 2018. While unrelated, those prior convictions form part of the overall pattern of behaviour considered by probation.  \n\nPre-sentence psychiatric evaluation, conducted by Dr J. Mahmood, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Midlands Secure Hospital, offers a comprehensive summary of Mr H’s mental state. The report concludes that while Mr H does not suffer from a major mental illness, he displays traits of rigid cognitive style and ideologically driven rationalisations which heighten risk. The risk assessment tool employed by the hospital classified him as “high risk of serious harm,” particularly due to likelihood of recidivism absent intensive intervention.  \n\nLetters from civil society organisations have been received, including from the Birmingham Interfaith Council, urging caution in sentencing to avoid alienation of minority communities. The court respects these concerns but reiterates that the paramount consideration remains public protection under the rule of law.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThis offending, involving sophisticated planning, technical knowledge, and clear ideological motivation, falls at the upper spectrum of culpability according to the Sentencing Council’s terrorism guidelines. The defendant’s belated guilty plea tempers, but does not substantially mitigate, the seriousness of the offences.  \n\nThe court will require a detailed pre-sentence report to consider appropriate sentencing options, including the potential suitability of an extended sentence, conditions of licence including electronic monitoring, and whether placement within a specialised resettlement setting would aid risk management. The report should also examine suitability for participation in deradicalisation programmes offered by certified providers and the availability of ongoing psychological supervision.  \n\nThe court is mindful of the pressures faced by probation and community mental health services in resource allocation, as recently noted in operational command audits. Such constraints must not impede the coordinated deployment of interventions essential to reducing future risk.  \n\nThe custodial element of the sentence must reflect the dual aims of punishment and community protection while affording structured prospects of rehabilitation aligned with public safety imperatives.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 29 September 2025, in Court 12 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.
