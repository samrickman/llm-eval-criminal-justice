Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29842  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. MORTIMER  \nFiled: 4 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court having been convicted following a jury trial on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is alleged to have occurred over a protracted period extending from late 2022 until the date of his arrest in January 2025.\n\nBefore outlining the salient features of the case, it is appropriate to set forth the procedural history. Mr H was first remanded to custody following his arrest on 31 January 2025 pursuant to warrants issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. That arrest culminated a drawn-out investigatory operation, designated as Operation GRAVITON, conducted by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The investigation utilised a range of intelligence-gathering techniques, including covert human intelligence sources, electronic surveillance authorised under Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 protocols, and meticulous digital forensics. These efforts, complex in nature and resource-intensive, consumed an estimated 4,600 officer hours before culmination.\n\nThe court recognises the often unheralded contribution of investigative personnel confronting the challenging task of detecting and dismantling terrorist plots in an era of rapid technological change and encrypted communication platforms. The operational demands placed upon these teams are considerable, with officers routinely expected to maintain vigilance across multiple threats and weapons modalities. The balance between thorough investigation and timely intervention remains delicate; delay can allow a plotting individual to progress towards execution, whilst premature action risks aborting the collection of convincing evidence.\n\nThe case came before the court for trial on 12 June 2025. Mr H elected to exercise his right to challenge the charges, and a jury eventually returned verdicts of guilty on both counts on 23 July 2025 following a five-day hearing. A plea and trial preparation hearing had been listed on 15 May 2025, where the defendant had indicated a not guilty plea.\n\nDuring the evidentiary phase, the court was presented with extensive digital material, expert analysis of extremist content, and records of surveillance operations. This matter attracted attention for the sophistication of the encrypted communications and the defendant’s evident technical proficiency, factors relevant to the assessment of culpability and risk.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe court wishes to acknowledge the excellent work of the National Cyber Crime Unit, whose analytical involvement was indispensable, particularly in decrypting complex multi-layered messaging networks. Their work complements traditional police efforts in confronting a growing incidence of digital-enabled extremism, an area under constant evolution requiring adaptive investigation strategies.\n\nIt is, of course, necessary to consider the wider statutory and jurisprudential context within which sentencing is to take place. The Terrorism Act 2006, as amended and clarified through successive case law, establishes both maximum penalties and sentencing principles rooted in public protection, deterrence, and appropriate denunciation. The sentencing framework emphasises a graded approach to culpability, stressing the significance of the defendant’s role, the intended scale of harm, and the extent of planning and preparation.\n\nHistoric judgments provide useful precedent. In R v. Jamil [2015] EWCA Crim 675, the Court of Appeal underscored the seriousness of pre-attack preparation, noting that sentences must reflect not merely the absence or presence of actual attack consummation, but the dangerousness of the preparatory acts themselves. The principles articulated there resonate here.\n\nIt is relevant to ponder the evolution of Court protocols relating to terrorism cases. The Better Case Management (BCM) initiative, implemented nationally over the past decade, aims to streamline the pre-trial phase, reduce delays, and ensure judicial resources are allocated efficiently. In this instance, case management hearings were conducted on 27 March and 29 April 2025. Regrettably, limited delays arose due to late endorsement by the Legal Aid Agency, which affected the appointment of a cybersecurity expert retained by the defence, reflecting systemic challenges in resourcing appropriate representation.\n\nThe court records its disappointment with the administrative burden imposed by successive procedural adjournments—although the majority were necessitated by legitimate disclosure concerns and defence preparation demands. Nonetheless, the increased caseload on Crown Courts and the diminishing availability of expert witnesses compound difficulties in delivering prompt justice.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe defendant’s ideological trajectory can be traced through material recovered from encrypted devices. The court has received expert linguistic analysis conducted by Dr Fiona MacLeod, a specialist in online radicalisation patterns. Dr MacLeod’s report, dated 8 July 2025, examined blog posts authored by Mr H under the username “CrimsonFalcon.” Early entries reference personal grievances and socio-political observations that transform subsequently into endorsed narratives aligned with a proscribed organisation, classified under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000.\n\nThese findings are supported by intercepted communications discovered on devices seized from the defendant’s residence. Additionally, manual drafting notes found amid legal textbooks reveal detailed bomb-making calculations, correlating with those published by foreign extremist groups, albeit adapted to local conditions.\n\nNotably, the court was informed of an earlier “Channel” referral concerning Mr H, made in September 2019 by a school headteacher who reported concerns regarding the defendant’s overt fascination with apocalyptic literature and extremism. The referral was closed following initial brief intervention. This information highlights the difficulties inherent in early detection and intervention, and the limitations that educators and safeguarding bodies frequently confront.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nA considerable volume of digital evidence was tendered to the jury, including encrypted files stored within a concealed VeraCrypt container titled “Library.” The defence introduced argumentations concerning the legitimacy of Mr H’s interest in pyrochemical experiments, citing benign hobbies such as model rocketry and remote-controlled aircraft construction. While these pursuits fall within the spectrum of lawful avocation, the court is guided by the principle that context is paramount — lawful activity undertaken for innocent ends cannot be considered to mitigate possession or study where other evidence demonstrates intent to employ knowledge lethally.\n\nFurthermore, the court made particular note of the manner in which a selection of digital files exhibited circumvention of digital rights management protocols, evincing advanced technical knowledge inconsistent with mere curiosity. These factors elevate the level of sophistication and intentionality.\n\nThe importance of detailed forensic analysis in this regard cannot be overstated. The National Digital Forensics Centre, while under considerable workload pressure with a backlog extending months in many cases, diligently compiled reports that were integral to authenticating evidence integrity. It is a testament to the dedication of these professionals that such extensive materials were assembled for disclosure as early as March 2025.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nArguably tangential but illustrative, the court records that a member of the wider investigative team, Detective Constable Laura Meade, contributed supplemental observations regarding Mr H’s social media presence. Ms Meade’s statement noted the defendant’s habit of posting photographs of his region’s landscape and architectural heritage—activities that, while innocent in isolation, became concerning in light of accompanying captions referencing “battle-hardened borders” and “defenders of the sanctum.” Such coded language, examined under expert linguistic scrutiny, presented an interpretive challenge but ultimately aligned with the prosecution’s theory.\n\nIt is regrettable that such nuanced material can be exploited to convey destructive ideologies camouflaged beneath seemingly benign content. The judiciary must remain vigilant against attempts to mask nefarious objectives behind cultural or local pride.\n\nIn noting the absence of charges relating to minor cannabis possession detected at the address, the court emphasises that such findings, while indicative of lifestyle choices, have no bearing on the defendant’s culpability under terrorism legislation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe court draws attention to an overseas trip undertaken by Mr H in August 2023, ostensibly for purposes of academic conference attendance. Travel manifests and immigration data reveal a complex itinerary, including attendance at events in regions hosting contentious political activities. Surveillance records from the South Coast Border Force further noted an attempt by Mr H to obscure the true purpose of the journey by providing misleading information at passport control. Although no evidence arose linking his compatriots to acts of criminality, the pattern of travel demands consideration as an aggravating factor, shedding light on the defendant’s increasing immersion in extremist milieu.\n\nThe procedural difficulties encountered surrounding disclosure in this case merit explicit mention. The volume of material—comprising some 1,234 classified digital exhibits and over 4,500 pages of transcribed communications—required exhaustive and iterative vetting to comply with national security constraints and the Criminal Procedure Rules. Counsel for the defence was appropriately granted access under stringent conditions.\n\nIt is acknowledged that this process significantly prolonged the pre-trial phase but was necessary to balance open justice with the imperative to safeguard sensitive intelligence. Judicial guidance on these matters was informed by the deliberations in R v. AFT and BHR [2016] EWCA Crim 948, which stressed that fairness demands timely and adequate disclosure consistent with operational security.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nFinancial investigations disclosed a cryptocurrency transaction involving a value equivalent to £1,850, sourced from an exchange account linked to Mr H. The funds were transferred to an account associated with encrypted communications providers known to be used in operational tradecraft by extremist elements. This finding underscores the increasing role of sophisticated financial tools in funding or facilitating terrorist activities. The court is cognisant of the growing concern regarding anonymous or pseudonymous financial instruments and endorses calls for greater regulatory clarity, mindful of privacy rights.\n\nA particularly taxing resource issue involves the limitations imposed by specialist expert availability. The defence originally sought to rely on psychological assessment of Mr H’s cognitive and ideological profile. However, repeated delays transpired due to insufficient appraisal capacity within the NHS forensic psychiatry sector. Professor Richard Talbot, a leading consultant forensic psychologist, finally completed his report in late August 2025, providing invaluable insights into the defendant’s personality traits and risk factors.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nMr H, aged 31, holds a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and previously worked as a systems analyst for a regional telecommunications firm. His line manager characterised him as “intensely focused and socially reserved,” but expressed concerns over abrupt disengagement from team projects coinciding with his deepening ideological fixation.\n\nLetters of support from several community groups were submitted on behalf of Mr H, including from the Easton Allotment Society highlighting his volunteer efforts in local urban agriculture, and from the St. Mary’s Foodbank, affirming his assistance during periodical distribution events. Such community engagement is noted with approbation, yet remains insufficient to counterbalance the gravity of the present offences.\n\nIn a similar vein, representations were tendered by Mr H’s sister, Ms Farah Ahmed, who attested to his complex mental health history, including episodes of severe anxiety and depressive illness. While such conditions invite compassion, they do not excuse criminal conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nProfessor Talbot’s forensic evaluation diagnoses Mr H as presenting with rigid cognitive styles and pronounced black-and-white moral reasoning. The report detects no formal psychotic disorder but classifies him as high risk for violent extremism, with a likelihood of recidivism absent intensive intervention.\n\nVarious mitigating factors were advanced by the defence, including Mr H’s lack of prior convictions and partial admission of guilt during the trial. Mitigation submissions advocated for comprehensive rehabilitative programming, referencing the Positive Change Framework and the government's Prevent Strategy, as effective mechanisms to reduce ideological risk. The court acknowledges the importance of such programmes but remains mindful of their limitations and the necessity of cautious risk assessment.\n\nIt is also relevant to note the burden currently experienced by probation services nationwide. Staff vacancies, funding shortfalls, and increasing caseloads render multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) difficult to deliver with optimal efficacy. Notwithstanding these pressures, the MAPPA Category 3 panel engaged in this case has demonstrated commendable diligence in planning for the defendant’s potential release.\n\nThe court also takes this opportunity to record its recognition of voluntary sector bodies operating in challenging environments, including the Bristol Community Rehabilitation Organisation, which has contributed reports on Mr H’s cooperation post-arrest.\n\nFinally, it is appropriate briefly to acknowledge several unrelated incidents referenced by the defence during mitigation. These include the arrest of a co-defendant on charges of fly-tipping on green belt land, and a peripheral investigation involving a relative’s alleged benefit fraud. Neither bears upon Mr H’s culpability or risk profile and are mentioned only for completeness.\n\nIn conclusion, the court finds this to be a serious and concerning case involving high culpability, elaborate preparation, and a manifest intent to engage in conduct that, if completed, could have resulted in catastrophic harm. The pre-sentence report prepared by the probation service will be vital in informing a suitable and proportionate sentence, addressing both public protection and rehabilitation prospects.\n\nSentencing will be adjourned pending receipt of that report. The court expresses gratitude to counsel for their thorough written and oral submissions, including Ms Charlotte Gibbs for the Crown and Mr Peter Callow for the defence, whose professional conduct throughout the proceedings has been exemplary.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 4 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal conviction and sentence within 28 days under the relevant statutory provisions. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29842  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J.
