Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/32654  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge A. M. KENDALL  \nFiled: 18 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court having been convicted on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: first, engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts contrary to section 5(1)(a), and second, possession of an article for a purpose connected to terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct in question spanned a period from late 2022 until his arrest in April 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was detained at 04:30 on 14 April 2025 under warrants executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West at a residential address in Easton, Bristol. The warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 on the basis of intelligence provided by the Security Service and corroborated by intercepted encrypted communications flagged in early 2025. At the time of arrest, several digital devices, including encrypted smartphones and portable external drives, were seized.  \n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe ensuing investigation was complex and multi-layered, incorporating open-source intelligence, digital forensics, and human intelligence operations. This required coordination between the Counter Terrorism Unit, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the West England Regional Intelligence Unit. The forensic examination demanded extensive time due to the defendant’s use of obfuscation techniques including anonymising networks, use of custom encryption keys, and compartmentalised data storage. It is regrettable, though perhaps unsurprising, that due to the volume of digital exhibits – numbering over 1,400 individual files and exceeding 2 terabytes in aggregate – the National Digital Exploitation Service required upwards of four months to complete a full decryption and indexing report. This delay was exacerbated by the scarcity of trained specialists across the UK and confirmed the often hidden burden borne by investigators.  \n\nIt must be said the litigation has not escaped procedural complication. The court records with some displeasure the repeated adjournments arising from late service of defence evidence and Legal Aid funding disputes for expert reports. The latter issue, whilst perhaps only peripheral to the defendant, has become endemic in complex Crown Court cases and represents a systemic challenge to the timely administration of justice. The Legal Aid Agency’s processes appear increasingly ill-equipped to balance cost control with access to adequate representation. Defence counsel was forced to seek multiple extensions for funding approval to instruct a clinical forensic psychiatrist, delaying the preparation of mitigation material until two weeks before sentencing.  \n\nThe prosecution's evidence was detailed and multifaceted, including recovered encrypted chat logs correlating with physical movements tracked by mobile triangulation, CCTV footage from various transport hubs in Bristol and Bath, and purchase records from online vendors associated with dual-use chemical precursors. Among these, the digital forensic team identified encrypted communications using PGP and Signal platforms, indicative of planning activities extending beyond domestic borders.  \n\nA Prevent referral was lodged with local authority safeguarding teams in September 2021 following concerns raised by Mr H’s then employer, who noted a sudden and marked withdrawal from workplace social functions and increased online activity referencing extremist content. The Prevent panel, as reported in the 2022 Channel Review, neither escalated the matter to multi-agency risk management nor engaged the defendant beyond an initial assessment. The efficacy of such early interventions, while encouraging in principle, often founders on resource constraints and thresholds of evidence. This court has no mandate to review Prevent policy outcomes but notes its registered role in Mr H’s trajectory.  \n\nEarlier in the proceedings, the court considered the timing of Mr H’s guilty plea. The defendant pleaded not guilty at the first opportunity and maintained that position until evidence disclosure was substantially undisputed. Guilty pleas were entered only on the first day of sentencing, somewhat diminishing the mitigating value of such admissions. In R v. Weathers [2024] EWCA Crim 1802, the Court of Appeal reiterated that the value of a guilty plea must be assessed not only in its admission but also in its timing and effect on case management. Delayed guilty pleas severely restrict the ability to spare victims the stress and the criminal justice system the expenditure of time and resources. This court thus accords limited credit for the plea.  \n\nThe court is obliged to reflect on the jurisprudential authorities relevant to sentencing in terrorism cases. The precursor statute, the Terrorism Act 2006, as amended, provides for maximum life custody in the most serious scenarios. However, sentencing must adhere to the principles set out by the Sentencing Council’s guidelines updated in 2023, which direct that the gravity of the offence be weighed with the culpability and the harm caused or intended. Cases such as R v. Abdulrahman [2019] EWCA Crim 456 and R v. Latif [2021] EWCA Crim 1345 caution against disproportionate sentences that may inadvertently expand the net of criminal liability in loosely defined terrorist-related activities. Nonetheless, where planning and material preparation evidence substantial intent and capacity for harm, sentences must be commensurate with public protection imperatives.  \n\nThe court also notes with interest the legal principles discussed in R v. Manjooran [2020] EWCA Crim 599, where the Court evaluated the evidential threshold for possession of articles connected to terrorism and the necessity of a “purposive link” between the item and potential acts. Counsel for Mr H relied heavily on this authority, arguing that the items seized lacked sufficient nexus to hostile intent. This court, however, finds that given the totality of the evidence, including the defendant’s digital correspondence and travel patterns, a purposive connection is abundantly demonstrated.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nMr H's online presence conveys a progression from ostensibly apolitical content to increasingly politicised statements and content amplification correlating with events of international conflict. Expert testimony from a counter-extremism specialist confirmed that the themes disseminated and the terminology used echo language prevalent in proscribed organisation propaganda materials, particularly concerning indiscriminate violence and martyrdom narratives.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nAmong the electronic evidence, investigators retrieved multiple files stored within hidden partitions, labelled innocuously yet containing schematics and materials science data with known dual-use characteristics. The defence attempted to draw an analogy with academic research on pyrotechnic compounds, submitting that such documents could reflect a benign interest in chemistry rather than malicious intent. This court is unpersuaded, noting the context and the confirmed contemporaneous communications discussing weaponisation.  \n\nSeparately, the court registers the recovery of a quantity of over-the-counter analgesics and various foodstuffs in the defendant’s residence. These culinary and pharmaceutical items are, as counsel acknowledged, irrelevant to the offences before the court, yet their mention underscores the contrast between quotidian existence and the conduct charged. The inclusion in the bundle of an old parking violation from 2017, unrelated to the defendant’s current police record, similarly offers no mitigating insight.  \n\nA notable occurrence during the trials of certain terrorism-related prosecutions is the frequent persistence of unrelated matters that accumulate in the docket. For example, the co-defendant in R v. Cartwright [2023] EWCA Crim 2189 was subject to charges of fly-tipping on green belt land as well as conspiracy, which distracted from the central terrorism issues. This court is conscious that such cross-contaminations are to be treated with caution to avoid conflation of offences.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe court finds no satisfactory explanation for Mr H’s acquisition of high-strength hydrogen peroxide and nitrating agents—materials tightly regulated and commonly associated with industrial processes yet notoriously diverted for illicit manufacture of explosives. The defendant’s claim of legitimate commercial interest is countered by evidence he never engaged with any trade or laboratory that would require such products.  \n\nThough peripheral to the charges here, it is recorded that a co-defendant who was originally charged alongside Mr H absconded prior to trial, leading to a separate warrant and ongoing investigation. This absence necessitated the severance of indictments and increased complexity in evidence presentation. Such procedural entanglement caused a delay in hearing dates, which was regrettable but inevitable given the circumstances.  \n\nThe court also notes the challenges faced by the Probation Service nationally, which are vividly illustrated in the present context. With vacancies and caseloads rising, it has become increasingly difficult to assign dedicated officers to monitor high-risk individuals, including those convicted under the Terrorism Act. The present case highlights the ongoing strain on public resources and the imperative for additional governmental investment if effective rehabilitation and risk management are to be maintained.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nTurning to the defendant’s movements, flight records indicate a visit to Warsaw in May 2024, certified by passport scans submitted by defence counsel to be part of a “heritage trip.” However, intelligence reports place Mr H in proximity to a gathering attended by proscribed groups known for fundraising and recruitment activity, crossing into Polish border regions associated with diaspora extremist networks. CCTV footage and intercepted telephone calls confirm his presence at meetings noted by counter-terrorism officers for their insidious recruitment potential. Defence submissions argue coincidence. The court is unconvinced.  \n\nThis case, like many in current times, generated voluminous disclosure. Over 850 physical exhibits, and hundreds of thousands of digital images and messages, were reviewed. The prosecution team also submitted a request under section 2 of the Justice and Security Act 2013 for closed material proceedings due to the national security sensitivity of some intercept evidence. The court adjourned to consider the public interest immunity claims, exemplifying the legal balancing act between transparency and protection of sources and methods that governs terrorism prosecutions.  \n\nFocusing for a moment on the courtroom environment itself, this hearing has taken place in the recently refurbished Courtroom 5 of Bristol Crown Court. The modern layout, designed to enhance witness protection and digital evidential presentation, is a welcome improvement upon the antiquated timbered interiors of the original build. While this might seem a trivial note, the court appreciates the significance of physical surroundings in facilitating the fair administration of justice.  \n\nThe role of local charities in supporting victims of terrorism cannot be overstated. Following the recent spate of incidents nationally, organisations such as the Bristol Victim Support Collective have expanded remit and capacity. Letters tendered from this group praise the measured and courageous demeanour of family members impacted by the defendant’s conduct. While victim statements have not been formally received in this sentencing, the court will reference them at the appropriate moment to reflect the human cost behind the forensic detail.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial investigation revealed a transfer of £3,800 in bitcoin from a wallet controlled by Mr H to an anonymised account linked to darknet markets known to traffic in explosive components. The forensic accountant called by the Crown detailed the methodical layering and tumbling of these funds through a network of mixers, illustrating the increasingly sophisticated means by which illicit finance evades detection.  \n\nThis court concurs with the views expressed in recent appellate judgments urging closer scrutiny of cryptocurrency usage in crimes of violence, including R v. Lenox [2024] EWCA Crim 1580, which emphasised the novelty of blockchain obfuscation techniques as a complicating factor in both investigation and sentencing proportionality. The defendant’s financial conduct, in this respect, reflects an advanced understanding of these technologies, signaling a heightened level of culpability.  \n\nA separate issue, though not directly bearing on the instant charges, concerns the defendant’s neighbor, a person with prior convictions for benefit fraud. Their irrelevant criminal history, included in ancillary reports, serves only to illustrate the potential conflation of unrelated associations that can occasionally emerge during investigative processes.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nAttention must be given to Mr H’s personal circumstances and character references. At 31 years of age, he holds a master’s degree in electronic engineering and had briefly worked for a regional telecommunications firm until his contract was terminated following an internal security inquiry into unexplained access to restricted IT systems. His supervisor described him as “meticulous but withdrawn,” with signs of increasing ideological fixation noticeable over the final year of employment.  \n\nDefence counsel submitted letters of support from a local community theatre group praising Mr H’s participation in set design and fundraising activities. While such engagement is laudable and indicative of constructive social ties, the court reiterates that positive community involvement cannot be disaggregated from the more serious offences of which he has been convicted. Good citizenship is not absolution where criminal intent and harm co-exist.  \n\nPsychiatric evaluation commissioned after conviction, especially by Dr Sally Bennington, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided a detailed assessment of the defendant’s mental state. Dr Bennington’s considered report found no formal mental illness but noted traits consistent with obsessive-compulsive personality features and a tendency towards cognitive rigidity. The report highlighted that these traits may contribute to the defendant’s susceptibility to ideologically driven absolutism but do not mitigate responsibility.  \n\nThe current assessment categorises Mr H as posing a significant ongoing risk to public safety because of the potential for re-engagement with extremist networks should custodial restrictions be lifted without structured intervention and supervision. The forensic psychologist assigned, Dr Patel, also emphasised the necessity for high-intensity deradicalisation programmes combined with continuous risk assessment, should Mr H be released on licence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe offence conduct demonstrates significant premeditation and technical skill, utilising encrypted communications, covert financial transactions, and procurement of materials to facilitate harm on a mass scale. The timing of activities, some coinciding with public commemorations of previous attacks, suggests an intent to amplify the symbolic resonance of any potential actions. These features place Mr H towards the upper end of the culpability spectrum within the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines.  \n\nMitigating elements are confined to absence of prior convictions, academic achievements, and the belated guilty plea admitted prior to sentencing. While some may argue that educational attainment reflects rehabilitative potential, the court must also weigh this against the deliberate misuse of such knowledge. The balance favours a custodial sentence reflecting both punishment and deterrence.  \n\nThe court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the National Probation Service. The report should explore the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence with supplementary conditions including residence in approved premises, electronic monitoring, restrictions on internet use, and engagement with specialist ideologically-motivated offending programmes. It should also address possibilities for psychological intervention tailored to cognitive inflexibility and radical thought patterns.  \n\nThe court acknowledges the considerable work undertaken by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing South West and affiliated agencies, including the diligence of the National Cyber Crime Unit in decrypting complex datasets. Their efforts, often conducted under intense public scrutiny and operational pressure, merit recognition. Similarly, gratitude is extended to the defence team, led by Mr Samuel Terrell QC and Mr Patrick Muir, for their careful and professional representations despite challenging circumstances.  \n\nThe strain on public sector agencies, including local health trusts responsible for psychiatric assessment and community mental health services, is an ever-present concern. The shortage of forensic psychologists trained in Structured Professional Judgement methods and the lengthy waiting lists for secure psychiatric beds are matters that extend beyond this case but undoubtedly impact the system’s capacity to manage complex terrorism offenders effectively.  \n\nIt is to be hoped that continued inter-agency collaboration, supported by adequate resources, will sustain public confidence in the capacity to respond proportionately and securely to threats posed by offenders such as Mr H.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 8 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been recorded in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal sentencing hearing is adjourned pending receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations deemed necessary.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.

The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nFinancial investigation revealed a transfer of £3,800 in bitcoin from a wallet controlled by Mr H to an anonymised account linked to darknet markets known to traffic in explosive components.
