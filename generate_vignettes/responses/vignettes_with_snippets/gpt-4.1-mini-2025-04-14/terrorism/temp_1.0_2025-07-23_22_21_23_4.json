Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/27541  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F. RICHARDS  \nFiled: 12 August 2025  \n\nMr Mr H stands before this court having been convicted on counts of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The evidence adduced establishes a pattern of activity spanning from late 2022 through to his arrest in early 2025. This court is mindful that the paramount considerations in cases of this nature must invariably balance the protection of the public, the deterrence of future offending, and the prospects for rehabilitation.  \n\nMr H was taken into custody on 10 February 2025 pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The arrest was the culmination of a broad and protracted multi-agency operation, involving Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, the National Crime Agency’s digital forensics division, and covert surveillance units operating under strict oversight from the Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office. The investigation, code-named Operation ARQAD, utilised advanced network traffic analysis alongside intercept warrants targeting encrypted communication platforms of interest to the Security Service.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe gathering of evidence required the deployment of high-technology equipment and significant cross-agency coordination; such efforts are not without their cost or complexity. Owing to the sensitive nature of the intercept material, much of the prosecuting evidence was subject to closed material procedures as prescribed by section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013. It is regrettable that such procedures, though necessary in certain instances, create obstructions to full transparency, placing further pressure on defence teams and the court alike.  \n\nIt should be noted with some concern that delays in listing this matter were occasioned by resource constraints within the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division. A hearing initially set for April 2025 was adjourned to allow for the completion of forensic examinations of embedded media recovered from several encrypted devices. These examinations were carried out under considerable workload pressures, as similarly evidenced by backlogs reported in several forensic laboratories around the Midlands region. Such systemic issues underscore the practical challenges faced by law enforcement in responding promptly to digital-enabled extremism.  \n\nIn an adjacent matter, Mr Parker, a co-defendant in an unrelated arms trafficking case arising outside of this jurisdiction, was apprehended after an altercation involving a threatened public disturbance with several pool cues following an affray at a licensed premises in nearby Coventry. While this incident possesses no direct bearing on the conduct of Mr H, its inclusion here serves as a stark reminder of the diverse landscape confronting law enforcement and the fragmentary nature of criminal enterprise often intertwined with ideological violence.  \n\nPrior to the commencement of this prosecution, the defendant was referred to the regional Prevent hub in August 2021 after concerns were raised by local educational authorities regarding his online engagement with individuals known for espousing radical views. The Channel panel, overseeing the referral, ultimately discontinued involvement when early intervention efforts yielded minimal engagement from Mr H. An observational report from the Prevent caseworker highlighted a mixture of sporadic attendance and an apparent unwillingness to accept critical feedback, a pattern not uncommon in cases assessed at this early stage.  \n\nThe court acknowledges as a matter of record the detailed, professionally composed psychiatric evaluation submitted by Dr Juliet Crane, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Dudley Secure Unit. Her report, dated 4 August 2025, characterises Mr H as displaying traits consistent with rigid ideological adherence but identifies no formal diagnostic mental illness. The commentary includes extensive observations on the impact of social isolation and cognitive inflexibility in reinforcing extremist thought patterns. However, Dr Crane warns that such profiles, while clinically valuable, remain incomplete predictors of risk without continual behavioural assessment in custodial settings.  \n\nDuring pre-trial proceedings, the court was engaged in discussions relating to legal aid representation for the defendant. Mr H’s instruction of counsel, Mr Benjamin Walton, was initially delayed by administrative difficulties occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency’s procedural bottlenecks. Notably, the defence encountered complications in securing approval for independent expert reports, a situation reflective of broader funding and resource challenges affecting legal aid provision nationally. These issues, while extraneous to culpability, bear directly on the fair and timely administration of justice.  \n\nIt is apposite to remark upon the evolving geometry of counterterrorism litigation within the legal landscape. Historical cases such as R v. Al-Muhajirun [2012] EWCA Crim 1768, which emphasised the necessity for proportionate sentencing where evidence of direct terrorist intent is equivocal, stand in contrast to more recent decisions reaffirming stern custodial measures for preparatory conduct. Such judicial developments underline the importance of an informed and contextual approach to sentencing that calibrates to the quality of evidence, the degree of planning, and the realistic risk of harm posed by the offender.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nEvidence presented at trial included material from an encrypted archive, metaphorically titled “MindForge,” discovered on a hidden partition of Mr H’s laptop. This cache contained a series of documents and video files with detailed analyses of explosive device construction, acquired dual-use chemicals, and mapped potential targets within urban settings. Prosecution experts testified to the level of sophistication displayed and the lengths to which the defendant took to avoid detection, employing multiple layers of encryption and data obfuscation.  \n\nIt is also brought to attention that during the investigation a small quantity of cannabis was found in a compartment of Mr H’s bedroom, though no charges were pursued for this. The defence has referenced this as indicative of an otherwise unremarkable youth and typical recreational experimentation. The court is bound to observe, however, that such presence neither mitigates nor aggravates the terror-related offending with which the defendant is charged.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe court heard expert evidence from Dr Faisal Qureshi, a linguist specialising in extremist discourse, who analysed the textual style of a blog maintained by Mr H under the pen name “IronVeil.” The content evolved over the course of two years from initially vague socio-political musings into increasingly radical and inflammatory posts, targeting government institutions and advocating for violent resistance. Dr Qureshi’s analysis was presented without objection, offering a compelling insight into Mr H’s evolving mindset and the thematic consistencies with known terror propaganda.  \n\nIt is worth noting that Mr H’s defence suggested the contents of “IronVeil” be interpreted as satirical or ironic, referencing jurisprudence such as R v. Ironwood [2019] EWCA Crim 1210, where context and intent were pivotal in establishing culpability. However, it is the firm view of this court that the statements at issue lack the nuance or self-reflective distance such pleas require and instead mirror ideological extremism in its more dogmatic form.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nDuring a search of the defendant’s residence, officers recovered various electronic components and what appeared to be a modified drone frame. The defence contended these were part of a legitimate hobby centred upon robotics and recreational drone flying. While the court acknowledges the legitimate pursuit of technology-related hobbies is both commonplace and, in many circles, laudable, the context here is markedly different. The modifications identified were consistent with expert testimony describing adaptations relevant to remote delivery or surveillance in operational contexts.  \n\nThis court also heard that Mr H had, on occasion, attended local community chess clubs and participated in charity fundraising walks. While civic involvement is generally a positive indication of social integration, such details must not distract from the gravity of the offences for which the defendant has been convicted.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe Crown’s case included evidence that in late 2023, Mr H travelled to Amsterdam ostensibly for a cultural exchange visit. Immigration and customs data, however, indicate that he made contact with individuals later linked to a weapons trafficking network. These contacts engaged in encrypted communications that coincided temporally with Mr H’s stay in the city. Defence submissions suggested these associations were coincidental or purely social; nevertheless, the court finds the weight of evidence inconsistent with a benign explanation.  \n\nThe court also records unrelated facts which, while peripheral, bear testament to the demanding circumstances under which court schedules are arranged. For instance, a computer system failure earlier this year resulted in the cancellation of all trials listed in Court 6 over a 48-hour period, causing substantial disruption not only to this matter but to over sixty others across the Midlands Crown Court cluster. Such events, while regrettable, fall outside the operational purview of the bench but highlight the fragmentation within justice system infrastructure.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nA forensic review of Mr H’s financial transactions revealed a series of cryptocurrency transfers totalling approximately £4,150 over a six-month period, dispersed among various anonymous wallets. The pattern of these payments aligns with offerings advertised on the dark web for procurement of specialty chemical precursors. The defence contested the direct linkage of these transactions to any illicit purpose; yet, when viewed in aggregate with other evidential threads, the inference of fundraising for terrorist-related activity is compelling. This court is acutely aware of the challenge posed by emerging financial technologies in both legitimate commerce and illicit enterprise. The regulatory frameworks remain evolving, with law enforcement lagging behind in real-time enforcement capacity.  \n\nIn unrelated criminal law development, the recent case of R v. Fane [2025] EWCA Crim 631, concerning a burglary involving the forcible entry into a residential flat during a family holiday, has delineated the limits of sentencing discretion where victims’ vulnerability is heightened. While it shares no factual or temporal connection with Mr H’s case, references to such decisions are commonplace in practice to illustrate the breadth of considerations that courts must balance, despite their inapplicability here.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is now 31 years of age, with university qualifications in electrical engineering. Prior to his resignation in September 2023, he was employed by a regional telecommunications firm, where colleagues described him as “introverted yet meticulous.” A sudden departure from employment followed queries raised during mandatory security vetting in line with company policy for roles deemed sensitive. The employer’s letter, tendered by the defence, indicated that Mr H’s resignation was without disciplinary sanction but noted concerns about his engagement with extremist websites.  \n\nThe defendant has supplied references from a local allotment association praising his commitment to communal gardening and environmental sustainability. Charitable organisations involved have noted his limited volunteering but expressed reservations about his social withdrawal and failure to participate fully in group activities. These fragments, while reflective of certain facets of his character, cannot detract from the seriousness of the offence or the risk posed.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe report prepared by Dr Martin Espinosa, consultant forensic psychologist, characterises Mr H’s mindset as displaying rigid, absolutist thinking and an entrenched ideological fixation. No formal psychiatric disorder was diagnosed. Dr Espinosa highlights the substantial risk of recidivism absent intensive and sustained engagement in structured de-radicalisation programming, which remains experimental in nature and subject to high rates of attrition.  \n\nThe court is also mindful of the cautious positions taken by community organisations in Birmingham’s west end, which have submitted carefully worded observations warning against social marginalisation of minority groups in the wake of such prosecutions. While the concerns are understandable, sentencing must prioritise public protection and the integrity of the criminal justice system. Leniency of the kind urged would undermine deterrence and risk emboldening similarly predisposed individuals.  \n\nIt is recognised that the sentencing framework in terrorism cases must acknowledge the wide spectrum of offending—from ideologically expressive but impractical conduct to sophisticated plots geared to mass harm. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines emphasise the need to impose sentences proportionate to culpability and harm risk, ensuring that the court’s punishment reflects the defendant’s pivotal role in the preparation and facilitation of terrorist acts.  \n\nMitigation is limited. The defendant has no previous convictions but has engaged only late in acknowledging guilt. The guilty plea was entered after substantial prosecution preparation and is therefore entitled to limited discount. The defendant’s prior employment and educational attainments, alongside some minimal community engagement, offer little comfort where the offence carries such grave potential for damage.  \n\nThe court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, with particular focus on risk assessment and management. The Probation Service should consider the applicability of specialist rehabilitation programmes developed for ideological offenders, in addition to standard cognitive-behavioural interventions. The report should address viable custodial options including Extended Determinate Sentencing provisions, as well as proposals for post-release active supervision, electronic monitoring, and licence conditions restricting internet access and association. The input of psychologists accredited in Structured Professional Judgement methodologies must be sought.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued on 12 August 2025 in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court, heard before His Honour Judge L. F. Richards. A verbatim transcript has been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal adjudication of sentence will follow receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further submissions. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the relevant statutory provisions. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 section 49 are applicable. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/27541  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F.
