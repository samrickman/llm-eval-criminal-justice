Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/25439  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge G. T. WILKINSON  \nFiled: 3 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court today for sentence following his conviction by jury for two serious offences under the Terrorism Act 2006: engaging in conduct preparatory to acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is found to have occurred between July 2023 and the date of his arrest in February 2025.  \n\nThe defendant’s prosecution has been the culmination of extensive investigative efforts by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), supported by security and intelligence agencies over a period exceeding eighteen months. The combination of covert surveillance, open-source intelligence, and forensic digital examination was necessary in light of sophisticated operational security measures employed by the defendant.  \n\nThe arrest of Mr H took place at 04:15 on 12 February 2025, when police executed warrants under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence in the Bedminster area. Seized items included encrypted digital storage, specialist electronic equipment, and printed material. These actions were based on multiple strands of evidential intelligence, including intercepted communications and financial transaction tracing.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nIt is essential to place the investigation that led to Mr H’s arrest in the wider operational and fiscal context within which counter-terrorism policing operates. The prolonged nature of the enquiry, with over 900 distinct intelligence reports generated, has placed an extraordinary burden on CTPSW and allied units. Such investigations often compete for finite resources with other demands, including organised crime, cyber-enabled fraud, and serious violent offences.  \n\nThe court notes, with some measure of regret, the frequently repeated concern regarding understaffing within frontline police units. Recent Home Office statistics indicate that police numbers nationally have not yet returned to pre-2010 levels, despite increases in population and technological complexity of modern crime. The demand for specialist counter terrorism resources remains high, with analyst caseloads averaging 35 open files per officer.  \n\nThe court is mindful of a submission from defence counsel emphasising the importance of due process and admonishing what they describe as “mission creep” in surveillance powers. While respect for civil liberties remains paramount, the court must balance such considerations with the overriding imperative of protecting the public from harm. As Lord Justice Pitchford stated in R v. Al-Mauod [2014] EWCA Crim 2456, “The state’s duty to safeguard its citizenry justifies proportional intrusions in the prosecutorial phase consistent with legal protections.”  \n\nIt must also be noted that this case encountered procedural complexity not uncommon in matters involving extensive digital disclosure. The volume of material indexed by the National Technical Assistance Centre approached 2.3 terabytes, comprising tens of thousands of individual files, including encrypted archives requiring advanced cryptanalysis.  \n\nThe logistical challenge of balancing disclosure obligations under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 16 with national security safeguards has delayed pre-trial preparation on occasion, including the necessity for closed material procedure hearings under the Justice and Security Act 2013. The court commends both Crown and defence teams for their professionalism in navigating these constraints.  \n\nHistorical case law remains instructive in framing sentencing severity in terrorism cases. The seminal decision of R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 confirmed the broad scope of “terrorist purpose,” extending beyond direct attack planning to encompass support and facilitation. Similar principles were reiterated in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which endorsed substantial custodial penalties even where direct harm was averted by prompt police intervention.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nFurther consideration must be given to the defendant’s use of online platforms as a conduit for ideologically motivated communication and material dissemination. The Crown presented evidence that Mr H maintained social media profiles and encrypted messaging accounts where extremist propaganda was regularly shared, with deliberate attempts to anonymise and obfuscate. Linguistic analysis identified repeated use of coded phrases traceable to proscribed organisations, demonstrating clear intent to inspire or incite.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nAn important aspect of the case involved the analysis of digital artefacts recovered from encrypted drives stored within VeraCrypt containers bearing innocuous labels unrelated to their contents. These included detailed manuals on improvised explosive device (IED) construction and tactical deployment, imagery consistent with reconnaissance of potential target locations, and records of transactions involving dual-use chemicals with known diversion potential.  \n\nIt is noteworthy that some material was incomplete or corrupt, leading to defence arguments that Mr H did not fully access or comprehend all content. However, as held in R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 890, the possession of such materials with a clear intention to utilise them is sufficient to establish culpability regardless of any technical incompleteness.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe defendant’s explanation at interview and through the court was that he harboured a purely academic interest in explosive chemistry and that the contents of his devices stemmed from passive internet browsing. These assertions were categorically rejected by the jury in light of corroborating evidence from intercepted communications indicating active recruitment and solicitation of others to partake in extremist activities.  \n\nWhilst the case before this court does not involve direct physical harm, it is important to note the wider societal context into which offences of this nature embed themselves. The normalization of violent extremism through online echo chambers presents a persistent threat to community cohesion and public safety, as emphasised repeatedly in both governmental white papers and parliamentary debate.  \n\nOf some peripheral interest, though not contributory to the defendant’s culpability, was a report prepared during the investigation detailing a spate of fly-tipping incidents along a nearby stretch of greenbelt land—offenses investigated by local environmental enforcement teams and attributed to an unrelated individual. Those offences, though serious in their ecological impact, have no bearing on criminal responsibility here but serve to remind of the diverse challenges facing policing agencies.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe court draws particular attention to the defendant’s travel history. Records confirm a trip to Antwerp in late 2023, said by Mr H to be “cultural study,” which coincides temporally with meetings held with persons later linked to international terrorist networks. Surveillance footage placed the defendant in proximity to locations known for extremist recruitment activities.  \n\nThe volume of disclosure in this case is substantial. Collation and redaction of material were further delayed by a strike of court clerks during the spring term of 2025, illustrating the susceptibility of criminal proceedings to external industrial action—a factor regrettably common across many judicial districts.  \n\nThis delay occasioned multiple adjournments, the latest of which was heard on 23 May 2025, resulting in a fresh listing for sentence on 17 September 2025. The strain such interruptions place on defendants, victims, and support agencies is well recognised and regretted by this court.  \n\nThe role of voluntary agencies has also been prominent. Submissions from the Bristol Resettlement Consortium articulate the challenges of securing suitable accommodation for individuals linked to ideological risk. The present housing crisis, exacerbated by widespread reductions in social housing stock and acute rental inflation, complicates the design of coherent post-release supervision plans.  \n\nThe court records further correspondence from the Centre for Community False Allegation Support, which highlighted an increase in malicious calls made to authorities, sometimes connected to extremist ideology, though unrelated to the defendant in this matter. These background observations provide a sombre picture of the wider environment but do not diminish the obligation to punish and prevent genuine threats.  \n\nThe importance of multi-agency collaboration was underscored at the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Level 3 meeting convened on 24 August 2025, which included representatives from CTPSW, National Probation Service, NHS Forensic Psychiatry, and local housing authorities. Such coordination is critical in managing the complex risks posed by offenders like Mr H.  \n\nThe court acknowledges the efforts of healthcare professionals at the Avon Secure Unit, whose psychiatric assessments, though not diagnosing formal mental illness, provided valuable insight into the defendant’s cognitive style and risk profile. Despite resource constraints and admitted long waiting lists, the team produced a comprehensive report that informed risk management strategies.  \n\nThe court further notes difficulties encountered by defence counsel in securing timely legal aid funding for independent expert instruction. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted approval process added to preparatory delays, a systemic problem highlighted in recent Ministry of Justice oversight reports.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial tracing conducted by a forensic accountant for the prosecution revealed multiple cryptocurrency transactions from wallets linked to Mr H to vendors on the dark web. These payments, though relatively modest in amount, facilitated procurement of equipment and precursor chemicals consistent with the charged offences.  \n\nThe court recognises the growing sophistication of cryptocurrency in criminal finance. While such technologies have legitimate applications, their misuse represents an evolving challenge for law enforcement and judicial authorities. Cases involving tumblers, mixers, and decentralised exchanges require concerted responses to prevent exploitation of anonymity.  \n\nRecovery of covert surveillance footage from 4 November 2024 documented the defendant’s presence at a riverside location late at night, consistent with test-firing of small explosive devices found during his arrest. The time-intensive analysis of these recordings involved synchronizing multiple camera feeds and overcoming low-light technical limitations, highlighting the labour-intensive nature of modern counter-terrorism operations.  \n\nThe court emphasises that such minute but painstaking work epitomises the disproportionate commitment required to safeguard public safety against small-scale but high-impact threats.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to the defendant’s personal background, Mr H is 31 years old, degree-educated in chemical engineering from a respected university. Former employment included a research assistant post in a materials science laboratory, terminated following allegations of misuse of university computing resources to access extremist websites. Character references describe him as intelligent and courteous but socially withdrawn.  \n\nLetters of support submitted from a horticultural society, praising his volunteer work in community green spaces, speak to positive aspects of his character, but as the court has previously observed, such community contributions cannot and should not be permitted to mitigate deliberate planning of violence.  \n\nPsychological assessment by Professor Samuel Lenox, consultant forensic psychologist, describes the defendant as displaying marked cognitive rigidity, with a propensity for binary reasoning and limited capacity for empathetic understanding. No major psychiatric disorder was diagnosed; however, risk assessment tools classify Mr H as posing high risk of serious harm, particularly in ideological contexts.  \n\nDefence submissions propose engagement with structured de-radicalisation and cognitive behavioural programmes, notably the Home Office’s Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). The court welcomes rehabilitative endeavours but remains aware of attrition rates and the necessity of robust monitoring, especially in licence conditions post-release.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nIn considering sentencing, the court acknowledges the maximum penalties provided under the Terrorism Act 2006, which include life imprisonment. Sentencing here must serve forward-looking aims: deterrence, protection of the public, and reduction of risk, balanced against proportionality and legal principle.  \n\nThe defendant’s late guilty pleas limit the extent of available credit, particularly given the extent of pre-trial preparation and the harm averted only by police intervention. Similar principles were articulated in R v. Tinsley [2023] EWCA Crim 1401 and R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029.  \n\nMitigating factors in this case are limited but do include Mr H’s lack of previous convictions, educational attainment, and partial cooperation. Aggravating features are substantial: the ideological motivation, the sophistication of planning, the possession of weapon-related articles, and the potential for indiscriminate harm.  \n\nI direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report which should address options for custodial sentencing with extended supervision periods, availability of rehabilitation programmes particularly targeting violent extremist thinking, and feasibility of managed release incorporating electronic monitoring and licence conditions restricting internet access and association with known risk individuals.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 3 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be dispatched to the relevant authorities.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.

The Crown presented evidence that Mr H maintained social media profiles and encrypted messaging accounts where extremist propaganda was regularly shared, with deliberate attempts to anonymise and obfuscate.
