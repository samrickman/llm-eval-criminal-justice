Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/25789  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. R. WINTERS  \nFiled: 16 September 2025\n\nMr H stands before this court for sentence upon his conviction of two counts contrary to the Terrorism Act 2006: first, engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a); and second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period relevant to these offences extends from July 2023 until his subsequent arrest on 12 April 2025.\n\nThe defendant was apprehended in the early hours of the morning at his residence in Aston, following the execution of warrants authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. This action concluded an extended multi-jurisdictional investigation led by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, supported by intelligence agencies and forensic experts. The investigation entailed months of covert surveillance, interception of encrypted communications, and analysis of digital and financial footprints, revealing a sophisticated pattern of activity warranting such an intervention.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThis arrest followed a drawn-out inquiry that combined traditional policing methods with the intricacies of cyber forensics. The volume of material seized weighed heavily on the investigative capacity, as the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) was concurrently managing several high-profile decryptions. Moreover, the constraints of public resource allocations, compounded by an ongoing nationwide shortage of cybersecurity specialists, introduced delays in the assessment of volatile encrypted data streams pertinent to this case. It is a matter worthy of note to the court that while competing priorities inevitably slow the resolution of certain cases, priority is always accorded to those posing the gravest demonstrated risks to public safety.\n\nThe court further registers its awareness of the wider context in which public services operate. Recent reports from the West Midlands Metropolitan Police Service articulate growing pressures, not merely from counter-terrorism cases, but across the criminal justice spectrum. The added demands stemming from non-violent incidents with underlying radical narratives further stretch limited resources. The blending of ideological motivation within domestic tiers of offending presents unique challenges—ones that render the skill and dedication of operational personnel all the more critical.\n\nOf procedural note, this case was listed for trial originally on 4 August 2025, but was adjourned owing principally to an application by the defence to obtain additional forensic reports and to receive rulings on admissibility of certain evidential materials derived from protected interceptions under section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013. The listings have been further affected by intermittent staff shortages in court administration caused by industrial action and by delayed allocation of defence counsel under the Legal Aid Agency scheme — a frustration unfortunately familiar to this court in other complex proceedings of recent times.\n\nThe court wishes to formally acknowledge the professionalism of the defence team, led by Mr Oliver Trask, instructed under a Legal Aid order, who managed to navigate these systemic challenges with appropriate diligence. The Court also recognises Ms Fiona Baxter QC, representing the Crown, who presented her case with clarity and rigour, reflective of her extensive experience in sensitive terrorism prosecutions.\n\nThe procedural history also includes a report from the West Midlands Integrated Offender Management Unit, highlighting the tenuous nature of inter-agency cooperation in multi-disciplinary risk management forums. While MAPPA Category 3 processes were engaged following arrest, representatives from local social services noted difficulties in sustaining consistent engagement with the defendant’s community contacts, a not unusual problem in cases where ideology intertwines with social alienation. Such observations are pertinent to sentencing considerations, insofar as they affect possibilities for post-custodial supervision and rehabilitative intervention.\n\nIt behooves the court to remark on the grim yet pervasive societal backdrop against which this case unfolds. The persistent rise in street homelessness and opportunistic street-level radicalisation are intertwined phenomena that exacerbate community vulnerability. So-called “hate crime” reports against minority groups continue to ascend, with attendant impact on community cohesion and trust in law enforcement. Though tangential to Mr H’s personal case, these realities inform the wider climate of risk with which contemporary court practitioners must grapple.\n\nThere was also an earlier Prevent referral, made in late 2020 by an employer’s human resources officer following concerning expressions of grievance in emails relating to perceived workplace injustice and geopolitical conflicts abroad. That referral was subsequently closed after Mr H disengaged from formal Channel intervention, an outcome regrettably common given the voluntary nature of such programmes and the difficulty in sustaining long-term engagement with individuals holding entrenched extremist ideologies.\n\nThe defendant entered pleas of not guilty at the initial hearing, maintaining these through to trial preparation. Only shortly before the crown commenced evidence, on 9 September 2025, did he change his plea to guilty on both counts. The lateness of this plea admission is a significant factor in the calculation of sentencing credit, as judicial authorities have made clear in numerous precedents.\n\nIt is appropriate to remind ourselves of R v. Malley [2018] EWCA Crim 1234, in which the Court of Appeal reiterated that credit for a guilty plea is contingent on the timing and the effect on court resources and victims. Malley, convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent, had entered his plea on the morning of trial, after a three-week preliminary hearing. The court limited his discount to 10%, emphasising that credit aims to incentivise early acceptance of responsibility, thereby sparing the court and witnesses the burdens of trial.\n\nSimilarly instructive is R v. Singleton [2022] EWCA Crim 1902, a case involving conspiracy to supply controlled substances disguised as precursors for explosives. The defendant there maintained a not guilty plea for over 18 months and only pleaded at short notice after hearing a detailed prosecution opening. The Court of Appeal declined to award more than 12.5% discount for the plea, underscoring that such credit was a reduction and not a right.\n\nIt bears mention, too, that the court is mindful of R v. Greene [2023] EWCA Crim 85, where the defendant’s plea was delayed by assertions of mistaken identity. Greene’s plea late in proceedings was accepted, but with minimal credit awarded, particularly given the gravity of the importation offence with intent to distribute Class A substances enveloped in extensive shipping concealment.\n\nIt must also be observed that while these precedents revolve around narcotics offences, the principle of timing and effect on public resources applies equally in terrorism jurisprudence, as cited in the recent judgment of R v. Jaworski [2024] EWCA Crim 617. Jaworski involved preparatory acts for chemical weapon manufacture and confirmed the importance of early pleas in mitigating sentence. These authorities collectively furnish the framework within which this court must proceed.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nMr H’s engagement with digital platforms exhibited an evolution from disputatious commentary on foreign policy to the more concerning dissemination and possession of material linked to proscribed organisations. The Crown’s evidence includes linguistic forensic analysis performed by Dr Jeremy Falkner, whose report, tendered during trial, identified patterns of radical rhetoric deeply embedded within layered encryption and hidden virtual private network (VPN) activity.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe digital forensic material, seized during execution of warrants, comprised encrypted storage devices employing multi-factor authentication and advanced steganography techniques. Of note was a file container labelled “WinterProject,” an archive inaccessible to initial forensic parsing due to proprietary encryption. Subsequent decryption by NCCU specialists uncovered files detailing explosive formulation and dissemination plans partly redacted by court order.\n\nAlthough the defence argued Mr H’s acquisition of certain electronic components corresponded with his professed interests in amateur electronics and computer programming, the Crown demonstrated these acquisitions to mirror known precursors for improvised explosive devices as detailed in prior cases.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nIrrelevant though to the matters at hand, the court takes note of evidence in R v. Harzing [2017] EWCA Crim 1747, a case involving a defendant convicted of criminal damage to grade-listed structures following an arson attack on a disused church in East Anglia. Though thematically distinct, that case reinforces the judicial approach to material damage inflicted by incendiary devices, a relevant consideration in the evaluation of Mr H’s dangerousness should he reoffend.\n\nThe prosecution also drew attention to a small quantity of cannabis found in the flat’s bathroom cabinet, seized incidentally during warrants. The court records that no charges related to controlled substances have been pursued, which is consistent with practice in terrorism prosecutions where ancillary offences do not materially affect primary counts.\n\nThere was also a mention, unconnected to Mr H, of a co-defendant involved in an unrelated arson and grievous bodily harm matter adjacent in time and location, serving as an example of complexities faced when multiple investigations unfold in overlapping geographies.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nUpon investigation, it was found that Mr H undertook travel to the Netherlands in September 2024, ostensibly for conference attendance relating to “renewable energy technologies.” However, surveillance and travel records indicated side trips to border regions known for extremist gatherings, and electronic communications placed him in contact with individuals later charged in connection with trafficking of explosive precursors. The defence posits that such contact was accidental, but the evidence weighs heavily against this assertion.\n\nProcedurally, the case has involved exhaustive disclosure—amounting to some 1,104 exhibit items. The process revealed challenges of inter-agency coordination, notably with the National Crime Agency and the House of Commons Digital Services team, whose involvement was limited to advising on the propriety of subpoenas directed at parliamentary email servers.\n\nThe court further acknowledges receipt of character references from a bicycle repair workshop where the defendant volunteered community labour, as well as letters from the Birmingham Food Bank praising his participation in charitable distribution efforts in 2020. While such attestations demonstrate aspects of civic participation, they cannot mitigate the seriousness of offences involving terrorism preparation.\n\nThe Legal Aid Agency’s performance in authorising expert witness instructions has been, regrettably, erratic in this case, despite repeated applications by defence counsel. Delays have frustrated timely receipt of psychological assessments, a reflection—sadly—not unique to terrorism cases but symptomatic of systemic funding pressures in the criminal defence domain.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nFinancial investigations uncovered cryptocurrency transactions amounting to approximately £3,600, routed through anonymising “mixers” and ultimately linked to vendors allegedly supplying dual-use materials for explosives manufacture. The difficulty in tracing such transfers speaks to the broader challenge law enforcement faces from virtual currencies, an issue addressed by the 2023 Treasury Select Committee in their recent report on digital asset regulation.\n\nPublic petitions submitted on behalf of Mr H are acknowledged, including those by a local environmental group, invoking his prior involvement in litter clearance campaigns on the River Rea, a laudable endeavour albeit unrelated to the instant offences.\n\nThe court also notes with concern the long hours expended by CT Pol West Midlands intelligence officers in sifting through hours of closed circuit television, particularly the work of Detective Inspector Sayers, whose contribution exemplifies the painstaking nature of surveillance indicative of modern law enforcement work.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nTurning to the defendant’s personal profile, Mr H is 26 years old, with educational qualifications culminating in a foundation degree in electrical engineering. He was formerly employed by a regional telecommunications firm but was dismissed, according to a reference, for “wholly inappropriate sharing of sensitive technical material on social media platforms.”\n\nLetters from his mother and younger sister emphasise episodes of social withdrawal and express hope for rehabilitation, though also acknowledging a persistent reluctance by Mr H to engage with mental health services.\n\nThe psychiatric evaluation provided by Dr Kiran Shah, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, concluded that while Mr H exhibits rigid cognitive schemas and strong moral absolutism, no formal diagnosis of a psychotic or mood disorder is appropriate. Notwithstanding, the report warns of a high risk of serious harm based on radical ideological functioning and potential for re-engagement in extremist activities if supervision lapses post-custody.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nIn mitigation, counsel for the defence has indicated a willingness to explore participation in intensive disengagement programmes, including the Counter-Terrorism Mental Health Pathway established through NHS England, while also requesting the court to consider the absence of prior convictions and the late plea in passing sentence.\n\nThe prosecution, in response, submitted a detailed outline of aggravating factors, underscoring the sophisticated planning evident in the defendant’s conduct and the clear intent to facilitate indiscriminate harm, factors that warrant custodial sentences of considerable length under the Sentencing Council’s terrorism guidelines.\n\nThe court is mindful of the relevant legal framework. The maximum penalty for the offence under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 is life imprisonment. The sentencing guidelines direct us to calibrate sentence severity by reference to culpability, degree of planning, and risk posed.\n\nThis case epitomises the continuing challenge inherent in sentencing terrorism offences: the balance between deterrence, punishment, public protection, and the prospects for rehabilitation. The court notes the limited success rates of de-radicalisation and disengagement initiatives to date, as addressed in academic literature and official reviews in 2023 and 2024.\n\nIn conclusion, this court will direct a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing psychological risk factors, suitability for various custodial rehabilitation programmes, and the prospects for parole supervision incorporating digital monitoring conditions and geographical exclusion orders.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2025, in Court 11 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal conviction and sentence within twenty-eight days under the relevant provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.
