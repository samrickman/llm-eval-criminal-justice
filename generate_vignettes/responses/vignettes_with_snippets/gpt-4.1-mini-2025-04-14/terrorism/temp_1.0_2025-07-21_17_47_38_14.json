Mr H  \nCase Reference: B2025/27864  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. E. DALTON  \nFiled: 17 August 2025  \n\nMr H stands before this court convicted on two counts: first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The incidents giving rise to these charges occurred between July 2023 and the defendant’s arrest on 15 February 2025.\n\nThe defendant was apprehended in the early hours after the execution of a search warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence in Easton, Bristol. This warrant arose following an extensive Counter Terrorism Policing South West investigation, supported by intelligence gathered from multiple sources including the Security Service and electronic surveillance. At the time of arrest, Mr H was found in possession of a personal encrypted communication device, a laptop containing sophisticated encrypted containers, and several items later identified as dual-use technologies.\n\nIt must be noted that the investigative pathway leading to Mr H’s detention was neither straightforward nor insulated from operational challenges. The inquiry incorporated triangulation of encrypted IP traffic, covert surveillance, and the painstaking decryption of digital artifacts. More than 130 officers and cyber specialists were engaged over an eighteen-month period. The administrative burden on the agencies involved was significant, compounded by inter-agency protocols and the necessity of balancing national security with the rights of the accused. These operational realities underscore the complex work that modern counter-terrorism policing entails.\n\nThe court is acutely aware of, and records with regret, the pressures currently placed upon the Probation Service, which has undergone repeated staffing restructures throughout 2024. These changes have inevitably impacted the availability and continuity of supervision and intervention programmes for offenders subject to MAPPA Category 3 oversight. While such systemic factors bear no direct influence on the defendant’s culpability or punishment, they frame the backdrop against which future risk management must be viewed.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nTurning to procedural matters, the proceedings before this court have been lengthy and, at times, halting. Initial listing was delayed several times owing to the need to secure Security Cleared Defence Counsel and additional delays occasioned by incomplete disclosure from a foreign state agency. These complexities are not uncommon in cases engaging covert intelligence and cross-national collaboration. The court acknowledges the efforts of all parties, including the defence team led by Mr Gregory Alton QC, who have conducted their roles with professionalism despite procedural obstacles.\n\nIt is worth reflecting on the broader context in which these offences occur. Society today confronts a multitude of challenges—from the fracturing of traditional communal bonds, to the intoxications of social media echo chambers that often fuel and entrench extreme beliefs. The defendant’s conduct must be understood within this wider, unsettling landscape, although the law’s concern remains the individual acts and their direct public impact.\n\nThe court also recognises the significant role played by voluntary sector organisations in attempting to engage individuals at risk of radicalisation. In this instance, the Westhill Community Outreach Programme submitted correspondence describing multiple unsuccessful attempts to foster dialogue with Mr H between late 2022 and early 2024. Their detailed notes reveal a cautious but steadfast approach, offering desistance support and vocational training. These front-line initiatives face acute funding shortages and operational stress, which have been further exacerbated by an increasing caseload nationally.\n\nDuring the pre-trial phase, the defendant was detained on remand at Mendip Remand Centre. The institution has reported multiple incidents involving other detainees, including an assault involving a chair and a subsequent lockdown prompted by unauthorised possession of a mobile phone. None of these events involved Mr H, who has remained compliant throughout, yet their existence demonstrates the fraught environment in which his risk is to be assessed post-sentence.\n\nThe list of ancillary offenses uncovered during co-defendant investigations include among others a failed possession of a bladed article charge against Mr T, who was alleged to have brandished a knife in a school car park, and a harassment accusation directed towards a relative of the defendant unrelated to this case. These peripheral matters have been the subject of distinct proceedings and bear no direct relevance to Mr H’s sentence. Indeed, co-defendant Mr K has absconded and remains at large, his case subject to a warrant.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe forensic examination of seized digital devices has been an exercise in meticulous detail, reflecting the sheer volume and complexity of data relevant to this investigation. Among the evidence were virtual volumes concealed within encrypted containers, containing manuals on explosives synthesis, detonator schematics, and communication logs with members of a proscribed group.\n\nThe defendant’s online footprint was characterised by an evolving ideology, initially marked by radical discourse on local political grievances, later shifting towards more explicit advocacy of violent action. Analysis of his social media accounts exhibited a steady increase in alarmist rhetoric, culminating in the sharing of material subject to removal orders by the Home Office’s Counter Extremism Internet Referral Unit (CEIRU).\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe recovery of an article of manufacture designed for explosive use was significant in this matter. Although Mr H argued that the device and associated components had a benign technical purpose related to hobbyist electronics, forensic science corroborated statements indicating its intended use was in preparation for terrorist acts.\n\nHistoric case law affords guidance on the weight to be accorded to possession of dual-use articles. The authoritative judgment in R v. Dwyer [2011] EWCA Crim 456 underscores that the mere possession, combined with corroborative evidence of intent, justifies a severe sentence, particularly where articles can be readily converted for unlawful use. Although Dwyer pertained to a co-conspirator in a gang-related explosives plot, the principles are equally apposite here.\n\nThe defendant’s background merits careful scrutiny. He was educated to degree level in electrical engineering and held employment in an industrial controls firm from 2018 until mid-2023. That departure followed an internal inquiry, reportedly linked to breach of IT security protocols. Reference letters attest to his technical competence but also note periods of withdrawal and increased isolation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nMr H’s previous convictions do not include terrorist-related offences, but records reveal minor offences during school years for petty theft and isolated incidents of public disorder. None, however, involved violence or coercion.\n\nDuring a previously convened case management hearing on 22 May 2025, it was necessary to address defence applications to adduce psychological reports in mitigation. The court granted permission, mindful of the dual role such reports perform: to assist sentencing and to inform risk management plans. The subsequent report by Dr Leonard Connolly, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was thorough and professionally prepared; it offers insight into the defendant’s mental state without providing any basis for diminished responsibility.\n\nDr Connolly’s clinical observations state that Mr H exhibits traits consistent with moderate obsessive-compulsive disorder and pronounced cognitive rigidity. Crucially, Dr Connolly found no evidence of psychotic illness or intellectual disability. The report highlights an entrenched black-and-white interpretive style of thinking, which perpetuates ideological absolutism. It further cautions that engagement with de-radicalisation programmes will require tailored approaches to overcome entrenched resistance.\n\nThe defence drew heavily upon the mitigating value of these assessments, submitting that therapeutic intervention should temper custodial severity. The court accepts the clinical findings but reminds itself that diagnosis does not override the seriousness of the offences.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe defendant’s travel history includes a trip to Istanbul in November 2023, which was ostensibly for academic research on Ottoman architecture. Immigration and transport records confirm a same-day transit to the Gaziantep region near the Turkish-Syrian frontier, an area noted for the presence of various extremist elements. Intelligence suggests this journey represented an opportunity to establish contacts with overseas operatives, though the trip was cut short due to flight cancellations—a fact that may have averted potential escalation.\n\nAn examination of the trial disclosures confirms that the volume of material furnished to all parties exceeded 1,350 primary exhibits, comprising digital forensics, witness statements, and intercepted communications transcripts. The necessity of secret handling under strict security protocols occasioned significant administrative overhead and delayed trial readiness.\n\nIt is regrettable, though unsurprising, that Legal Aid provision for this defence has been hampered by ongoing funding constraints. Such issues, including delayed approvals for expert instructions, have multiplied in recent years, threatening access to justice especially in complex terrorism cases. The court hopes systemic reform will address these challenges.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nFinancial investigations uncovered electronic currency transactions traced to the defendant’s known aliases. A transfer of approximately £3,100 worth of cryptocurrency was identified flowing through tumbling services—a recognized technique to obfuscate origin—and ultimately linked to dark web vendors supplying dual-use chemical kits.\n\nThe intersection of emerging financial technologies and crime represents a fast-evolving frontier. While cryptocurrencies offer legitimate economic benefits, their exploitation by offenders compels continuous adaptation by enforcement agencies. The court encourages legislators and authorities to find an appropriate balance between innovation and security.\n\nThe period of covert surveillance involved high investment of personnel resources. Analysts recounted synthesising over 500 hours of mixed-source footage, integrating traffic camera feeds and environmental sensor data, to validate the defendant’s movements and associations.\n\nSuch operation scale reflects modern policing challenges and the persistent imbalance between the brevity of criminal acts and the length of their investigation and prosecution. The court recognises the arduous nature of this work and the toll it takes on public sector capacity.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nTurning now to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old. His academic record shows considerable aptitude in mechanics and applied physics. He was employed as a control systems engineer before abruptly resigning amid company inquiries related to improper use of secure networks.\n\nLetters submitted by local civic groups, including the Ashton Road Volunteer Gardening Club, commend Mr H’s assistance in communal horticultural projects. While such contributions are laudable in isolation, the court emphasises that they do not offset culpability in matters of grave public risk.\n\nFurther letters from a neighbourhood foodbank detailed his participation in logistics and delivery during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns. These attest to a willingness to serve disadvantaged populations and a capacity for social empathy; yet such attributes exist alongside ideologically driven conduct which must be condemned.\n\nExpert psychological evaluation describes the defendant as exhibiting pronounced “category thinking” and an inflexible intellectual style. This rigidity facilitates the adoption of radical narratives, heightening risk that firmly entrenched extremist views will translate into harmful action.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe totality of the evidence discloses a meticulously planned offence, employing advanced technical knowledge and deliberate obfuscation tactics. The aggravating features include the targeting of a public venue on an anniversary of a previous fatal attack, evidently for symbolic resonance.\n\nMitigation rests primarily with the defendant’s lack of previous violent convictions, his educational background, and the late guilty plea tendered on the morning of trial—factors which, though relevant, are limited in scope.\n\nThis court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service. This report should address the feasibility of imposing licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring, restrictions on Internet use, and engagement with specialised disengagement programmes. Consideration should also be given to proposing accommodation in approved premises with onsite supervision and mental health support.\n\nThe court wishes to acknowledge the sterling work of multi-agency cooperation, particularly the South West Counter Terrorism Unit, the NHS forensic psychiatric services involved, and the local authority’s Public Protection team. That these interconnected services operate effectively despite ongoing austerity measures and rising caseloads is a commendable testament to professional dedication.\n\nI also extend thanks to Ms Jocelyn Hartwell, who appears on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Gregory Alton QC with Mr Peter Shaw as junior for the defence. Both teams have conducted these protracted proceedings with exemplary diligence and decorum in the face of complex evidential and procedural challenges. \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued on this day, 17 August 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol and have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Mr H is reminded of his right to seek leave to appeal sentence within 28 days in accordance with the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved to the administrative court pending final disposition.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
