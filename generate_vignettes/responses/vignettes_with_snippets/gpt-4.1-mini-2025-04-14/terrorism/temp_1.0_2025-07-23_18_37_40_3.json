Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/27843  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. A. FLETCHER  \nFiled: 4 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court today for sentence on charges relating to engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for purposes connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period over which the offences are alleged to have occurred covers from late 2022 through to his arrest on 19 March 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was arrested in the early hours of 19 March 2025 following the execution of a series of coordinated warrants by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, supported by an intelligence-led investigation under Operation IRIDLING. Officers recovered several items at his address in Edgbaston, including computer hardware, encrypted storage devices, and various electronic components that ultimately formed the basis of the prosecution case.  \n\nThe court acknowledges, with some degree of reluctance, that the conduct in question must be viewed against an inevitably broad backdrop of increased anxieties regarding the maintenance of public order and national security. This court is also mindful that the administrative and operational challenges faced by agencies such as CT Policing and the Security Service have intensified in recent years, as noted in the Home Office’s 2024 Counter Terrorism Annual Report.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe arrest and subsequent investigation unfolded in an environment characterised by profound resource strain. The CT Policing West Midlands Cyber Crime Unit, charged with digital forensic examination, reported a backlog of over 350 pending devices at the time. The prolonged examination of the encrypted devices necessitated bespoke technical approaches, including the deployment of novel cryptanalysis techniques developed in partnership with the National Cyber Security Centre. It is salutary to recall Lord Justice Reed’s observations in R v. Pennerton [2013] EWCA Crim 1687, where attention was drawn to the dangers of overreliance upon technology without transparent forensic scrutiny.  \n\nThroughout these proceedings, the court has observed with interest the interactions between the prosecution and defence in relation to disclosure. The defence made persistent applications for further material, which occasioned adjournments originally unanticipated at the initial sentencing listing on 12 June 2025. These delays underscore enduring tensions in the criminal justice system occasioned by the competing demands of public protection, confidentiality, and procedural fairness. While the Criminal Procedure Rules are explicit on timeliness and completeness of disclosure, the very nature of counter-terrorism cases militates against unencumbered openness. It is a challenging balance and one that has been discussed extensively in academic literature, including the recent paper by McAllister and Byrne (2024) on \"Transparency and Secrecy in Counter-Terrorism Trials\".  \n\nThe court must also reference the unfortunate, though ultimately irrelevant, procedural disruption caused by a temporary staff strike at Birmingham Crown Court in May 2025, which resulted in delayed listings and some congestion in the court calendar. The court appreciates the staff's dedication on return, which enabled today’s hearing to proceed without further adjournment.  \n\nPrevious Prevent referrals relating to the defendant came to light during the course of this trial. A referral in mid-2021 by a university tutor, who noted Mr H’s consistent use of inflammatory language in seminar contributions, was closed without escalation after limited engagement. Whether those early warning signs were missed opportunities for intervention is a question beyond the remit of this court, but it does serve as a cautionary tale about the vagaries of early identification and the limits of preventive frameworks.  \n\nAt the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 14 July 2025, the defendant pleaded guilty to both counts. The court notes the guilty plea was entered after a lengthy period during which a not guilty plea had been initially indicated. The timing of the plea, on the second day of trial, constrains the discount available to him for an early admission. Principles in respect of credit for plea are well established in appellate decisions, such as R v. Gibson [2023] EWCA Crim 371, underscoring that delay in acceptance of responsibility until after the commencement of substantive proceedings garners a limited reduction.  \n\nI draw attention here to the treatment of credit for guilty pleas in terrorism cases as articulated in R v. Al-Zaidi [2024] EWCA Crim 785, where the Court of Appeal emphasised the necessity of balancing the public interest in efficient disposal against the individual’s indication of remorse.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThis court has considered the contextual backdrop of Mr H’s online activity, which, according to analysis presented by the Crown’s digital forensic experts, includes his management of a series of blogs and encrypted communications that exhibit progression from political commentary through to more explicit ideological commitment. The forensic linguistic report provided by Professor Jason Meredith comprehensively addresses the evolution of the defendant’s lexicon, noting parallels with previously proscribed materials. Such scholarly input is essential given the complexities faced in differentiating between protected speech and criminal expression.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nA significant volume of digital evidence was recovered, encrypted within VeraCrypt containers named “ForgeData” and “Plans2024.” While a number of these files contained incomplete batch uploads, the court notes precedent from R v. Bawal [2022] EWCA Crim 1092 which affirms that mere incompleteness or partial access to instruction sets does not in itself diminish culpability. The forensic reports contained detailed metadata, including time stamps and GPS coordinates correlating with locations significant to the investigation.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nDuring trial, the defence attempted to assert that the defendant’s interest in drone technology and thermal imaging equipment was linked solely to legitimate hobbies and architectural photography. However, given the evidence and particularly the concealed nature of procurement and storage, the court is satisfied that these explanations do not withstand scrutiny in the context of the wider conspiracy to plan acts of terror.  \n\nWhile these observations may seem self-evident, the court finds it necessary to caution against the trivialisation of terrorism charges as merely misplaced hobbies or ideological expression. Individuals have a right to their interests and beliefs but when these become instrumentalised for acts intended to cause indiscriminate harm, lawful protections give way.  \n\nIt is worthy of note, though unconnected to the defendant, that during a concurrent investigation, a co-defendant was charged with theft of copper cables from a railway maintenance depot, a matter currently proceeding in a different venue. Such ancillary criminality, while indicative of the breadth of offending often associated with extremism, is not attributable to Mr H.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nAmong the trips Mr H undertook during the relevant period was a journey to Rotterdam in October 2023, ostensibly for professional networking at a metal fabrication conference. Travel records and CCTV footage, however, reveal that he subsequently travelled to areas known for clandestine gatherings associated with radical music scenes that promote agitprop extremist narratives. The court references recorded telephone communications during this interval with known co-conspirators engaged in the importation of explosive precursors, although Mr H himself was never charged with importation offences. These aspects were meticulously unpicked during cross-examination and underscore the vigilance required of border and customs enforcement agencies.  \n\nThe disclosure bundle in this case totals 684 items, amounting to approximately 1.2 terabytes of data, incorporating intercepted communications, device extractions, and CCTV footage. The court is acutely aware of the logistic and financial constraints involved in collating and reviewing such material, which strain both prosecutorial and defence resources. Certainly, the forensic and disclosure teams operate under conditions of considerable pressure and indeterminate workloads, challenges that have been candidly discussed in the 2025 Joint Criminal Justice Board Annual Review.  \n\nThe court also recognises the pressures within the probation service. At present, West Midlands Probation reports staff shortages amounting to a 28% vacancy rate in caseload management roles, exacerbated by increased demand related to terrorism cases, which require specialised risk assessments and multi-agency collaboration.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial investigations linked to Mr H revealed cryptocurrency transactions totalling £4,850, traced from wallets under his control to accounts on a darknet marketplace. Such transactions are, regrettably, not uncommon in cases involving serious criminality, as noted by the National Crime Agency’s recent assessment report on virtual currency misuse. The court is conscious of ongoing debates concerning regulation of crypto assets, including the Law Commission’s 2024 consultation on “Digital Asset Control and Enforcement.”  \n\nThe defendant’s conduct necessitated extensive covert surveillance. The operation to monitor his movements required allocation of approximately 280 hours by multiple officers, including coordination across three distinct geographic command units. Surveillance footage from 14 February 2024 captured him at the Gravelly Hill Canal site, a location with historical significance but unrelated to this case’s primary concerns.  \n\nThe court must also remark on emergent societal challenges too often neglected in legal proceedings. Escalating street homelessness—exacerbated by pandemic-related economic shifts—has been linked with increased scrutiny of public behaviour. While wholly unrelated to Mr H’s offending, it is notable that local authorities across Birmingham have reported a 15% rise in rough sleeping since 2022, with attendant social services stretched to breaking point. Such systemic concerns provide an austere backdrop against which individual criminal conduct unfolds and must be borne in mind when considering the broader public safety picture.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to personal circumstances, the defendant is 31 years old and holds a master’s degree in computer science. Formerly employed as a software engineer with a multinational firm, Mr H’s references describe him as “conscientious, quietly competent, though increasingly withdrawn.” Employment ceased in September 2022 following disciplinary proceedings regarding misuse of company equipment to access prohibited websites, which may have included extremist material.  \n\nLetters of support have been tendered by a local charity assisting vulnerable young adults in digital literacy. While commendatory of Mr H’s volunteering efforts, the court regards these contributions in context: commendable civic participation cannot, and does not, negate or excuse criminal culpability. This aligns with the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in R v. Wakeling [2020] EWCA Crim 984, which emphasised that mitigation must be measured to circumstance.  \n\nPsychologically, Mr H was assessed by Dr Selena Morgan, consultant forensic psychiatrist. Her report, detailed and professionally composed, states that the defendant presents no formal diagnosis but demonstrates “rigid cognitive patterns” and a “binary moral framework.” Dr Morgan identified a high risk of re-offending absent comprehensive intervention and constrained by limited engagement to date. The report highlights the potential utility of cognitive behavioural therapy targeted at ideological desistance, although she cautions that uptake and sustained involvement remain variable.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThis case exemplifies the tragic complexity of modern terrorism-related offending: sophisticated use of technology, covert procurements, ideological fixation, and a willingness to exploit emerging communication platforms. The seriousness of the offending places it firmly within the highest culpability category under the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines.  \n\nAggravating factors include an extensive encrypted communication network, intent to inflict mass harm, and timing fixed to coincide with the anniversary of prior attacks used symbolically in extremist propaganda. Mitigation is limited to the absence of previous convictions, educational attainment, and the guilty pleas entered at a late but significant stage.  \n\nThe court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The probation service is instructed to examine the appropriateness of extended determinate sentencing options under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, as well as the feasibility of inclusion in specialist deradicalisation programmes with structured supervision post-release. The report should also consider support services for post-custodial accommodation, electronic monitoring, and psychological interventions consistent with best practice as outlined in the Offender Management in Terrorism Cases Framework (2023).  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 4 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities in due course.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.

The forensic linguistic report provided by Professor Jason Meredith comprehensively addresses the evolution of the defendant’s lexicon, noting parallels with previously proscribed materials. Such scholarly input is essential given the complexities faced in differentiating between protected speech and criminal expression.  \n\nMr H’s computer contained a plan for a secondary explosive to be activated by drone after emergency services arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay.  \n\nA significant volume of digital evidence was recovered, encrypted within VeraCrypt containers named “ForgeData” and “Plans2024.” While a number of these files contained incomplete batch uploads, the court notes precedent from R v.

The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nFinancial investigations linked to Mr H revealed cryptocurrency transactions totalling £4,850, traced from wallets under his control to accounts on a darknet marketplace.
