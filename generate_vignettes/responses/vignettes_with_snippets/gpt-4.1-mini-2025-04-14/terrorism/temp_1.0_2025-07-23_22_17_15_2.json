Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29741  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J. WORTHINGTON  \nFiled: 25 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts: one of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These counts arise from conduct alleged to have occurred between September 2023 and his arrest on 29 January 2025. \n\nThe defendant was initially remanded in custody following his magistrates’ court appearance on 31 January 2025, where he indicated initial pleas of not guilty. The matter was listed for trial in the Crown Court, with a trial preparation hearing occurring on 15 August 2025. On the morning of the trial commenced on 6 October 2025, Mr H entered pleas of guilty to both counts. This late plea is germane to the issue of credit for remorse and will be discussed in due course. \n\nIt is necessary at the outset to acknowledge the extensive efforts of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), whose investigative team undertook a complex and resource-intensive inquiry over an eighteen-month period. The investigation incorporated conventional surveillance techniques alongside cutting-edge cyber forensics, and the deployment of electronic covert assets. That multi-agency operation involved liaison with the National Cyber Crime Unit, the Security Service, and local authority partners. The painstaking nature of the inquiry reflected the dynamic and adaptive modus operandi of the defendant.  \n\nThe court notes some frustration was experienced during the pre-trial phase in relation to administrative delays concerning legal aid authorisations for specialist defence instructions. Mr H’s counsel—on this occasion, Mr Jonathan Brewer, instructed pursuant to a Legal Aid contract—faced protracted correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency before clearance was given to instruct independent digital forensic experts. Though regrettable, this procedural friction did not impinge unduly upon the progress of the case owing to the diligence of all involved.  \n\nBy way of background, it is helpful to record that the capacity of the Legal Aid system has been under severe pressure nationally, with numerous criminal defence practitioners reporting increasingly restrictive caps on investigatory budgets applying in cases demanding scientific expertise. The present case typifies that challenge: cases under the Terrorism Act increasingly require specialist input, yet the statutory framework governing funding lags behind the operational realities encountered by legal teams and defendants alike. The court hopes this matter may usefully inform ongoing consultations.  \n\nThe defendant was arrested at 07:45 on 29 January 2025, pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The executing officers of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands located Mr H at a residential address in Sparkhill, Birmingham. The warrant followed months of covert telephone, email, and social media monitoring, which disclosed encrypted communication patterns characteristic of facilitation networks associated with proscribed groups.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nWhile the focus of the prosecution and this court remains firmly on the charges before us, it is regrettable to note systemic challenges facing investigative agencies. Nationally, it has been reported in recent Parliamentary sessions and elsewhere that police resources—for instance, in violent crime, organised theft, and drug enforcement—are stretched to breaking point. This is particularly acute in urban centres, with some Chief Constables lamenting a collapse in ‘investigative capacity’ due to recruitment shortfalls and attrition. While this is not directly relevant to the defendant’s conduct, it serves as a sobering context.  \n\nThe national counter-terrorism effort is itself subject to competing priorities, intense political scrutiny, and sometimes public scepticism. Courts have sometimes been the venue for contesting the balance between liberty and security. That said, in the current case, all procedures observed compliance with standards laid out in R v. Wray [2014] EWCA Crim 1317, regarding the lawful exercise of surveillance powers, and the necessity for judicial authorisation under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.  \n\nThis district court was established in 1967 as part of a nationwide reform of crown court jurisdictions. It has since presided over numerous serious cases, ranging from organised crime syndicates to high-profile terrorism prosecutions. The present matter demonstrates how, in 2025, the court adapts to shifting threats—embracing, as necessary, hybrid hearing formats using video-link technology whilst maintaining open justice principles.  \n\nThe court also takes this opportunity to acknowledge the professionalism of the court staff—ushers, clerks, and audio-visual technicians—who have ensured smooth hearings, notwithstanding a recent refurbishment of this courtroom, including installation of energy-efficient lighting and sound-proofing installed over the summer recess.  \n\nMr H’s case has been subject to the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) at level 3 since the relevant statutes and Home Office guidance established such oversight mechanisms to manage individuals posing serious risks. The MAPPA level designation reflects the assessed serious risk posed. The court is grateful to Detective Chief Inspector Ruiz of CTPWM, who has provided detailed briefing on the continuing management plans post-release, reflecting an inter-agency approach involving probation, housing, and mental health services.  \n\nThe plea and trial preparation hearing on 15 August 2025 was delayed initially due to a defence application for disclosure of additional metadata from social media platforms. That application was made under section 7 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and was reluctantly granted following legal argument. The delay added some four weeks to the case timetable.  \n\nThe court’s experience in recent years aligns with the findings in R v. Garvey [2021] EWCA Crim 980, which emphasised the importance of timely disclosure to avoid prejudice. Mr H’s defence counsel notably resisted certain evidential items on grounds of relevance and admissibility, invoking the principles in R v. Boswell [2019] EWCA Crim 1432 concerning bad-character evidence. Such objections were partially upheld by the trial judge in pre-trial rulings, streamlining the issues remaining for jury consideration.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe Crown’s evidence included social media posts authored by Mr H under the pseudonym “IroncladFox,” which escalated in ideological fervour from late 2022. Linguistic experts testified that the phraseology and syntax bore a striking similarity to that contained in propaganda materials disseminated by the proscribed Entity Collective, which was banned under the Terrorism Act 2000. This analysis was conducted by Professor Timothy Yates of the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Digital Extremism Studies.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nDigital forensic examination recovered an assortment of encrypted files on the defendant’s confiscated laptop, stored within nested VeraCrypt containers, one labelled “Forge.” Among these files were ostensibly innocuous cooking recipes, but nested within were technical manuals relating to chemical compounds and explosive device assembly. The fact that Mr H employed extensive encryption techniques is consistent with a high level of intent and sophistication.  \n\nDefence submissions posited that the defendant’s interest was purely academic and unconnected to criminal intent, citing his participation in a local crochet group and attendance at a nearby historical reenactment society as evidence of more conventional social engagement. Such benign extracurricular activities, while laudable, do not provide an exculpatory explanation for possession of materials of this nature.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nIt is therefore concluded that the defendant’s possession of the relevant articles and materials was, as the prosecution asserts, for a purpose connected with the commission of an act of terrorism. This conclusion is supported by the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of components—parts sourced from commercial suppliers, including model aircraft motors and pressure sensors—aligned with manuals discovered.  \n\nWhile noting Mr H’s participation in weekly quizzes at the local community centre and his fondness for birdwatching—a detail tendered on his behalf by his mother—such features are peripheral to the offence and have no bearing on culpability. The court is conscious of the human tendency to seek mitigating colour, but mitigation must be proportionate and grounded in relevance.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nFurther, the Crown disclosed evidence regarding the defendant’s travel history. Official records show that in April 2024, Mr H undertook an unremarkable short trip to Berlin, ostensibly for a conference on renewable energy technologies. While the conference was legitimate, travel patterns revealed additional unreported movement in the city, including areas known for hosting extremist sympathiser gatherings. CCTV footage near these locations recorded Mr H in conversation with an individual later arrested in connection with the distribution of improvised explosive components. Defence counsel described these encounters as coincidental and lacking evidential weight. The court considers the pattern troubling given the wider context.  \n\nThe volume of material produced in this prosecution imposed considerable administrative load on all parties. Over 830 exhibits were disclosed, with electronic transcripts and redacted intelligence material monitored by secure custodians. The court commends the Crown for the professionally prepared bundles, which aided judicial consideration.  \n\nThe case also ran in tandem with an unrelated trial of co-defendant Mr R, who was charged with an assault occasioning actual bodily harm at a political demonstration in February 2024. Mr R’s trial was severed and proceeded independently. This procedural separation is not uncommon when co-defendants face distinct factual matrices or where evidential complexities demand it. It should be said that Mr R’s conduct has no bearing on the sentencing of Mr H beyond contextual background.  \n\nAmong other procedural incidents in the court’s registry, one notes that a trial listed for Court 3 in September 2023, involving a defendant charged with affray following a pub brawl involving pool cues, was adjourned twice due to the unavailability of a key witness. The case was eventually listed late October 2023 and resolved with a plea of guilty after five weeks. This observation illustrates the commonality of operational challenges affecting numerous Crown Court centres.  \n\nThe issue of plea timing arises prominently. As noted, Mr H only entered pleas on the first day of trial. The jurisprudence on credit for guilty pleas is clear. In R v. Collingham [2023] EWCA Crim 2440, the Court of Appeal reiterated that early guilty pleas attract substantial discounts, reflecting the benefit to victims, the court, and the public purse. Conversely, late pleas, entered when a successful defence is plainly unsustainable, receive significantly less credit.  \n\nThe distinction is underscored in the decision of R v. Merrow [2022] EWCA Crim 1834, where the Court held that pleas within days of trial commence but prior to evidence may receive some, albeit reduced, credit, while those at the morning of the first trial day typically attract a maximum of one-sixth reduction.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial transactions traced by forensic accountants reveal that Mr H engaged in the transfer of cryptocurrency funds totalling approximately £3,200, associated with procurement of electronic components consistent with the construction of improvised explosive devices. These transactions were routed through multiple mixing services to obfuscate origin, indicating an understanding of concealment techniques. This financial behaviour is entirely consonant with the Crown’s assertion of preparatory conduct.  \n\nThe court laments the increasing burden placed on investigators and forensic experts by the sophistication of criminal financial evasion techniques. Cryptocurrency investigations consume substantial police hours, as officers must develop technical proficiency and collaborate with often-underfunded units in the Financial Conduct Authority and HM Revenue & Customs. The demands on investigative resources highlight the need for sustained public investment.  \n\nThe defendant’s attendance at various co-curricular activities at Shelborne Adult Education Centre—such as pottery classes and the Tai Chi group—is recorded but bears no relevance to the charges. Similarly, mention has been made of a neighbour’s complaint about noise disturbances which was resolved through mediation proceedings organized by the community council in 2022. Such civic matters, however, have no bearing on public safety assessments but reflect the ordinary fabric of community life.  \n\nThe court further notes that the defendant was cited in local charities’ newsletters for contribution to food bank distribution efforts during 2020. That Mr H volunteered his time merits acknowledgment, not for excusing criminality, but for indicating some measure of social connection.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 30 years old and educated to degree level with a first-class in electronic engineering from a Midlands university. His employers have provided character references describing him as “quiet, dependable, and meticulous.” Employment records show a sudden resignation in July 2023, shortly before the inception of the offending conduct at issue. This chronology suggests a potential causal link with the development of extremist beliefs and behaviours.  \n\nPsychological assessment by Dr Leah Mortimer, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at Hollingbrook Secure Unit, documented in a report dated 20 September 2025, diagnoses the defendant as suffering from personality traits characterised by rigidity of thought and impaired social empathy but finds no evidence of formal psychiatric illness such as psychosis or bipolar disorder. The assessment highlights a likelihood of ongoing ideological fixation. Dr Mortimer rates the risk of serious reoffending as high in the absence of rigorous post-custodial management and specialist intervention.  \n\nThe court recognises the defence plea for rehabilitative programming and notes the existence of the regional Deradicalisation and Reintegration Programme (DRRP), which aims to engage offenders in cognitive behavioural therapy and community mentorship. However, it is also necessary to acknowledge the reported recidivism rates within that cohort, which exceed 40% in recent evaluations by the Ministry of Justice.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThis offender’s conduct, involving detailed planning, technological skills, and targeted acquisition of components, places the case at the upper end of the culpability spectrum described in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines 2023. Important aggravating factors include intention to harm the public indiscriminately, sophistication of method, and timing aligned with symbolic dates of extremist significance.  \n\nMitigation is limited. It encompasses Mr H’s previously unblemished record, late plea, and some community engagement prior to radicalisation. The court accepts these but emphasises that they pale against the gravity of the offences committed and the potential consequences had the plan matured.   \n\nIn arriving at sentence, the court must consider all relevant statutory provisions and guidance. The maximum sentence for count one under section 5 of the 2006 Act is life imprisonment, reflecting Parliament’s recognition of the threat posed by such conduct. Count two attracts a maximum custodial sentence of 15 years. The court is mindful of the guidance in R v. Abdel-Mawla [2019] EWCA Crim 1201, which reinforces that sentences for terrorism-related offences should be commensurate with public protection and deterrence imperatives.  \n\nThe court directs preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The Probation Service is instructed to include in its report an assessment of risk factors, suitability for extended sentencing provisions under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and the potential for participation in structured intervention programmes, including cognitive behavioural therapy and supported accommodation. The report should address the likelihood of compliance under licence and strategies to mitigate risk of re-engagement in extremist activities.  \n\nThe defendant is reminded of his entitlement to appeal conviction and sentence within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. The record of proceedings has been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged in this matter.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.

Boswell [2019] EWCA Crim 1432 concerning bad-character evidence. Such objections were partially upheld by the trial judge in pre-trial rulings, streamlining the issues remaining for jury consideration.  \n\nInvestigators found that Mr H had pinpointed a CCTV-free garage behind Nando’s on the High Street near Cornbrook, with plans to leave the device for detonation at 3pm during Leeds fan foot traffic.  \n\nThe Crown’s evidence included social media posts authored by Mr H under the pseudonym “IroncladFox,” which escalated in ideological fervour from late 2022. Linguistic experts testified that the phraseology and syntax bore a striking similarity to that contained in propaganda materials disseminated by the proscribed Entity Collective, which was banned under the Terrorism Act 2000. This analysis was conducted by Professor Timothy Yates of the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Digital Extremism Studies.  \n\nMr H had written instructions for a secondary drone-triggered explosive timed for when emergency responders arrived. Included in the file was a bridge schematic estimating the arrival times for both police and medical responders, alongside a note that read: Second boom = max psychological effect; if no sirens 3 to 5 min delay.  \n\nDigital forensic examination recovered an assortment of encrypted files on the defendant’s confiscated laptop, stored within nested VeraCrypt containers, one labelled “Forge.” Among these files were ostensibly innocuous cooking recipes, but nested within were technical manuals relating to chemical compounds and explosive device assembly. The fact that Mr H employed extensive encryption techniques is consistent with a high level of intent and sophistication.  \n\nDefence submissions posited that the defendant’s interest was purely academic and unconnected to criminal intent, citing his participation in a local crochet group and attendance at a nearby historical reenactment society as evidence of more conventional social engagement. Such benign extracurricular activities, while laudable, do not provide an exculpatory explanation for possession of materials of this nature.  \n\nThe defendant's home contained a list of components for manufacturing TATP, including calculated molar ratios, notes on drying times handwritten in the margins of a disassembled chemistry textbook and a shopping list including Party Girl hair bleach and Lancome nail varnish remover.  \n\nIt is therefore concluded that the defendant’s possession of the relevant articles and materials was, as the prosecution asserts, for a purpose connected with the commission of an act of terrorism.

Among the recovered documents was a scenario in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nFinancial transactions traced by forensic accountants reveal that Mr H engaged in the transfer of cryptocurrency funds totalling approximately £3,200, associated with procurement of electronic components consistent with the construction of improvised explosive devices.
