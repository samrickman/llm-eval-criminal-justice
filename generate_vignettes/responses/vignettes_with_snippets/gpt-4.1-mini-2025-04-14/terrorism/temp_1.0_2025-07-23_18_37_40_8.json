Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29846  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. L. STRATFORD  \nFiled: 17 August 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: one of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of articles for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct in question spans from November 2023 until his arrest in January 2025.\n\nThe defendant was initially detained at approximately 07:45 on 12 January 2025, when the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit (WMCTU) executed multiple search warrants under the authority granted by section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, at an address in Longbridge Road. These warrants were predicated on separate but convergent intelligence streams suggesting the defendant had been engaged in online communications with a proscribed organisation and was thought to be preparing materials compatible with explosive manufacture. During the search, officers seized multiple electronic devices, including encrypted mobile phones, laptops, USB sticks, and a quantity of chemical precursors.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe arrest followed an intensive investigation lasting over nine months. Detective Chief Inspector Louise Penrose, with over fifteen years’ experience in terrorism investigations, coordinated a complex operation that involved partner agencies, including the National Crime Agency's Economic Crime Command and the Cyber Security Incident Response Unit (CSIRU). The investigation incorporated traditional methods such as human intelligence (HUMINT) alongside advanced technical surveillance, including the lawful interception of encrypted messaging platforms employing end-to-end cryptography, signalling the increasing complexity of contemporary counter-terrorism work. This operation was marked by substantial resource demands; the CSIRU reported the forensic analysis alone entailed an estimated 3000 hours of triage, radiographic decryption attempts, and data carving to recover deleted files.\n\nThe court acknowledges that this case represents but one among the increasing number of prosecutions arising from the digital radicalisation landscape, where the duplication and dissemination of extremist content require judicial sensitivity. The dearth of sufficient digital forensic capacity is a well-known challenge across the national security apparatus, a point that has been repeatedly raised in parliamentary committee inquiries and official reviews.\n\nThe procedural history of this matter reflects the strains confronted by the justice system in terrorist prosecutions. Initially listed for a preliminary hearing on 27 March 2025, the case was adjourned to 15 May 2025 for disclosure purposes, complicated by the volume of seized digital evidence, which exceeded 2.7 terabytes. Further delay arose owing to Legal Aid Agency negotiations concerning permissions to instruct a suitably qualified independent expert in cyber forensics. In keeping with the Criminal Procedure Rules and through the efforts of counsel, these matters were resolved by early June, facilitating a plea and trial preparation hearing on 10 July 2025.\n\nThe court notes, with considerable regret, the pervasive administrative challenges encountered by defence representatives mandated in such cases. Legal Aid resource constraints continue to pose significant impediments to timely preparation, augmenting costs and exacerbating anxiety for defendants, counsel, and witnesses alike. Despite these systemic difficulties, the defence team, led by Mr Samuel Keats, displayed commendable professionalism in navigating the complexities of this prosecution.\n\nA prior Prevent referral was made in early 2022 by a college lecturer in Political Philosophy, who raised concerns about Mr H’s expressed views during seminars, notably the extensive citation of materials produced by a proscribed organisation. Although initially accepted and placed under Channel support, the referral was closed after six months owing to the defendant’s disengagement from structured interventions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe court is minded to remind practitioners and observers that while Channel operates as a multiagency safeguarding programme to divert individuals away from violent extremism, it remains limited by its voluntary nature and resourcing. Cases such as that of Mr H illustrate the tragic outcomes when engagement falters.\n\nIt is a regrettable truth that in the present era, the failures of social cohesion, economic precariousness, and digital echo chambers all conspire in the radicalisation process. The defendant’s own trajectory, marked by notable educational achievement in the engineering sector but hindered by increasing isolation from family and community, exemplifies a profile seen in multiple recent cases.\n\nThe factual matrix in this case is intricate and demanding. At trial, the Crown adduced voluminous expert evidence addressing the defendant’s possession and attempted assembly of chemical components capable of being converted into explosive devices, contextualised by encrypted communications with an overseas facilitator. The defence contested aspects of the technical interpretation, but ultimately, Mr H entered pleas of guilty on the morning of this sentencing hearing.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nIn considering appropriate sentencing, it is relevant to observe the early judicial pronouncements shaping contemporary counter-terrorism jurisprudence. The court recalls the guidance of Lord Judge LCJ in R v. Rehman [2005] EWCA Crim 846 where the critical notions of risk to the public and the defendant’s intent were emphasised, principles subsequently reaffirmed in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 concerning the ambit of “terrorist purpose.”\n\nNotwithstanding the forensic complexity of cases such as this, the court remains ever mindful of the foundations of our justice system — openness, fairness, and the solemn obligation to balance community protection with individual rights.\n\nThe prosecution relied heavily on the meticulous digital analysis undertaken by Mr Henry Caldwell, a cyber forensic specialist with the National Digital Forensics Unit (NDFU). Mr Caldwell provided evidence of the defendant’s creation and use of virtual encrypted storage containers on several devices, employed to hide three substantial manuals on bomb-making and radical strategy, files encrypted with advanced algorithms beyond standard commercial utility. Attempts to decipher or access these materials consumed months of technical effort.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nIncidentally, the court notes and discounts completely the unrelated discovery of draft correspondence on one device concerning a pending neighbour dispute in relation to purported noise disturbances. Such domestic disagreements have no bearing upon public safety or ideological intent in this matter.\n\nAdditionally, the court has been referenced to a 2019 fixed penalty notice issued to the defendant for parking contraventions in Coventry’s city centre. While minor infractions such as this are common and addressed through civil enforcement, their inclusion serves no purpose under the circumstances other than to embellish a narrative unrelated to the charges.\n\nEqually irrelevant to the current proceedings, yet often cited in ancillary materials, are unconnected prosecutions in the West Midlands area from the preceding year involving an associate charged with burglary, possession of offensive weapons, and aggravated vehicle theft. None of these offences arise upon the defendant nor bear upon his risk assessment. The phenomenon of conflating co-defendant or third party actions risks obfuscating the judicial task and must be resisted.\n\nTurning back to matters of procedural importance, the defence team requested a psychiatric assessment to evaluate potential mental health considerations relevant to sentencing. This request—supported by a letter from Mr H’s sister, Mrs Rowan H, expressing concern at the defendant’s recent social withdrawal—was met with some delay due to capacity constraints within the Forensic Psychiatric Services in Birmingham. Despite these pressures, a timely evaluation was conducted by Dr Edmund Clarke, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose comprehensive 42-page report provides pertinent insights.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nIn his report, Dr Clarke delineates that while the defendant demonstrates no diagnosable psychotic or mood disorder, there exists a marked tendency towards rigid thought patterns and cognitive inflexibility, with personality traits consistent with obsessive-compulsive features. No formal diagnosis of a personality disorder is proffered. The psychiatrist opines that these personality constitution elements may have contributed to the defendant’s susceptibility to extremist ideological narratives but do not diminish responsibility.\n\nThe court further has before it a probation officer’s initial assessment prepared by Mrs Andrea Rowe, which incorporates contributions from the local housing authority and Community Mental Health Teams. Mrs Rowe comments upon the ongoing challenges confronting probation services within the West Midlands, noting reduced staffing levels and significant caseload growth since 2021, factors which invariably impact case management and rehabilitative resources. She recommends steps towards engagement in structured programmes targeting extremist behaviour patterns coupled with mental well-being support.\n\nThe availability of effective deradicalisation programmes remains an area of urgent practical concern. The court is aware, for example, of the Desistence and Disengagement Programme (DDP), statutorily recommended in cases involving ideological offending, but which nationally faces considerable waiting lists. It is imperative that resourcing improves commensurate with the increasing volume of eligible cases to alleviate recidivism risk. Without such support, sentencing outcomes become all the more critical in deterring future offending.\n\nAs a notable aside, the court records correspondence received from the local community mosque’s Imams’ Council, stressing the anxiety within the community at the diversion of young people towards extremist narratives but also requesting care in public statements to avoid alienation. The balancing act between security and community cohesion is delicate and vital in underpinning long-term counter-terrorism strategy.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nThis case included disclosure of a cryptocurrency transaction, effected through a privacy-focused mixer platform known colloquially as “ShadowSwirl.” As outlined by financial investigators, the traceability of such currency flows remains challenging, though advances in blockchain analytics have incrementally improved detection. The defendant transferred approximately 0.55 Bitcoin (valued then at approximately £4,100) to an anonymous vendor offering dual-use electronics with probable application in the manufacture of improvised explosive devices.\n\nIn assessing the gravity of crypto-enabled financial conduct in terrorism cases, it is necessary to acknowledge the evolving threat landscape. Cryptocurrencies have swiftly become the preferred medium for ideological actors and criminal networks alike, offering a veneer of anonymity, global reach, and resistance to traditional financial controls. While innovation in financial technologies merits encouragement, the criminal exploitation of these systems is unequivocally condemned.\n\nThe court has also been provided with a detailed account of surveillance activities, including a sequence of 18 hours of CCTV footage analysis conducted by the West Midlands Police Intelligence Bureau. These recordings document the defendant visiting a riverside industrial estate on three separate occasions between June and August 2024, where he was observed handling substantial containers labelled as “chemicals.” The meticulous cross-referencing of this physical surveillance with intercepted communications lends considerable weight to the prosecution’s assertion of preparatory acts towards terrorism. The forensic effort to reconcile video augmentation with environmental data analytics truly exemplifies modern investigative diligence.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nIn terms of personal circumstances, Mr H is a 30-year-old male, educated to master's level in applied physics. Until his abrupt resignation in late 2023, he was employed as a materials consultant for a major automotive firm. His line manager, in written testimony, describes the defendant as “highly intelligent, methodical, and dependable,” but acknowledges recent behavioural changes including increased absenteeism and social isolation coinciding with the emergence of extremist views.\n\nFamily support is mixed. The defendant's mother and sister have submitted letters expressing concern and willingness to facilitate rehabilitation. Notably, the defendant's father is absent and reportedly estranged. This fragmented familial backdrop does not excuse offending but contextualises motivational factors.\n\nOf further note are documents provided by the city council’s Housing Services, outlining a homeless application made by Mr H’s ex-roommate in September 2024 following their joint eviction over rent arrears. Such social precarity is acknowledged as a risk factor in radicalisation pathways as identified in Home Office research into vulnerability profiles.\n\nYet while these elements paint a human picture, they bear minimal mitigating weight when weighed against the planning and operational risk documented.\n\nPsychological evaluation, as stated, reveals pronounced ideological rigidity and a highly systematised worldview, with poor capacity for socio-emotional empathy. The consultant forensic psychologist, Dr Louise Thorne, advises high risk of serious harm without direct intervention.\n\nThe court reflects, by way of procedural context, on the somewhat tangential material arising from prior unrelated proceedings involving acquaintances of the defendant. These include the conviction of a co-defendant for affray while employed on a construction site in 2022, a matter which neither relates to the charges herein nor to Mr H personally.\n\nSimilarly, an incident of graffiti vandalism on a local bus shelter attributed to a youth gang loosely connected to the defendant's former social circle was cited in preliminary reports but rightly omitted from trial consideration. Such peripheral information does not meaningfully inform risk or culpability in this matter.\n\nOther procedural allusions include a delay in the transcription of intercepted audio files caused by a mechanical failure of court-appointed recording equipment within the city’s central administration centre. Such delay, while regrettable, does not warrant particular comment save to note the reliance of modern justice on the seamless functioning of technological infrastructure.\n\nDuring the hearing, the court also acknowledged the diligent efforts of the court clerks and ushers, whose professionalism ensures the maintenance of order and procedural regularity, even amidst the complexities of security screening and confidentiality requirements demanded by terrorism proceedings.\n\nThe sentencing framework guiding the court is encapsulated within the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (revised 2023), which establishes a matrix considering the degree of culpability, the nature and scope of the intended harm, and the public interest in deterrence and rehabilitation. The overall statutory maximum sentence for these offences includes life imprisonment.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nIn conclusion, the court has weighed the seriousness of the defendant's actions, the intelligence and sophistication demonstrated, the public protection considerations, and the prospect of rehabilitation with assistance from community and psychiatric services. Mitigating features—namely, the absence of previous convictions and the late plea—are acknowledged but are of limited effect in the face of the gravity of offending.\n\nThe preparation of a pre-sentence report is hereby ordered to assist the court in determining the most appropriate disposal, with particular reference to risk management strategies, the feasibility of specialist deradicalisation interventions, the viability of approved premises accommodation with stringent licence conditions, and the engagement of psychological support services.\n\nThe court notes its appreciation of the contributions made by expert witnesses, the prosecution and defence counsel, and the myriad public servants involved at every stage.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 August 2025, in Court 12 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities for registration and notification.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v.
