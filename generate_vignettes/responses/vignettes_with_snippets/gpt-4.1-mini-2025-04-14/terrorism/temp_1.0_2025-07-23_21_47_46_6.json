Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/24689  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. HARRINGTON  \nFiled: 15 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court today for sentence upon verdicts returned following trial at Bristol Crown Court. The charges concern offences contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, and possession of articles for the purpose of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The temporal scope of the offending is established at the period from May 2023 until his arrest in April 2025.  \n\nThe defendant’s prosecution arises from a lengthy, resource-intensive multi-agency operation that involved Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), the National Crime Agency, and digital forensics support from the Home Office Digital Service. The case highlights contemporary investigative challenges posed by evolving encryption technologies, covert communication methods, and the complex overlay of lawful intelligence gathering and human rights safeguards that underpin prosecutorial efforts in terrorism matters.  \n\nPrior to outlining the factual matrix and legal considerations relevant to sentence, I find it appropriate to acknowledge, for the record, the unstinting efforts of the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division (CPS CTD) and specialist terrorism defence counsel, Mr Oliver Read QC, who appeared on behalf of Mr H pursuant to a Legal Aid representation order. It is regrettable that repeated applications for additional funding to instruct technical experts were met with delay and apparent ambivalence by the Legal Aid Agency. Such bureaucratic hurdles afflict serious and complex cases disproportionately, impeding defence teams’ ability to conduct full and effective instructions. I urge the Ministry of Justice and associated bodies to take heed of these concerns in the interests of procedural fairness and the right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  \n\nAs is now common in such cases following the tragic events of the early 21st century, reliance on open source intelligence, intercepted communications, and digital metadata has become the backbone of substantial investigative endeavour. The defendant’s movements and electronic activity were meticulously tracked and scrutinised, highlighting the necessity of judicial warrants and supervision in authorising intrusive investigatory tools such as bulk mobile telephone data collection and targeted deep-forensic examination of encrypted devices. The proportionality and legality of such measures, though debated in academic and parliamentary forums, must nevertheless be accepted as lawful when authorised by judicial officers and conducted under the strict regime prescribed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and its subsequent amendments.  \n\nReference is made to R v. Terry and Others [2017] EWCA Crim 1234, in which the Court of Appeal emphasised the importance of balancing liberties with national security imperatives, holding that the commission of terrorism offences must attract custodial sentences reflecting the elevated public protection imperative. Though the factual circumstances differ, the sentencing principles articulated remain cardinal.  \n\nThe defendant was initially arrested at 05:46 on 29 April 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed at his address in the Redcliffe district of Bristol. At the time of arrest, authorised officers seized multiple digital storage devices, a 3D printer, and assorted chemical reagents stored in a manner consistent with preparatory research typical of improvised explosive device manufacture. These items were subjected to forensic examination by the Centre for Explosives Detection and Analysis (CEDA), whose detailed reports were entered in evidence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nIt must be understood that the defendant’s apprehension was the culmination of a protracted intelligence-gathering operation extending over 14 months, dubbed Operation NIGHTFALL, involving linguists specialising in extremist rhetoric, behavioural analysts, and cyber specialists tasked with decrypting communications originating from anonymous network relays. The difficulties encountered in penetrating the defendant’s use of multiple layers of anonymising protocols and bespoke encryption software led to extended periods of uncertainty and delay as agents sought lawful means to gather admissible evidence. This process was complicated by the defendant’s use of ephemeral messaging applications purpose-built to resist retention or interception.  \n\nDuring the early months of the investigation, a referral was made under the Prevent strategy by a university lecturer after Mr H submitted a piece of coursework containing citations from extremist manifestos. This referral did not proceed beyond the initial Channel panel due to insufficient evidence of engagement with proscribed organisations or indications of violence. The court accepts this outcome was appropriate at the time; it would be an exercise in retrospective criticism to ascribe blame for the absence of more intrusive intervention given the scarcity of actionable intelligence at that juncture.  \n\nThere exists an important parallel to R v. Fahim [2020] EWCA Crim 1802, where early intervention was deemed insufficient to prevent escalation owing to partial disengagement and intermittent cooperation by the defendant with Prevent programmes. The facts in the instant case share certain characteristics of fragmented engagement.  \n\nFollowing arrest, the defendant was remanded in custody, and proceedings have been subject to multiple listing constraints exacerbated by industrial action affecting the Crown Court judiciary and support staff nationwide. This court has, nevertheless, taken pains to ensure that pre-trial disclosures were managed in compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, and to mitigate unnecessary adjournments. The case management hearing originally scheduled for 15 July 2025 was vacated following a last-minute application to admit new expert psychiatric evidence from the defence. Considerable time was thereafter devoted to agreeing the scope of that report.  \n\nThe defendant entered pleas of not guilty at the initial hearing, maintaining that position throughout the trial, which occupied eight days in September 2025 before a jury returned unanimous verdicts of guilty on all counts. This court notes the absence of any formal withdrawable submission from the defence in mitigation at this stage, heralding a period of preparation for sentence rather than plea promotion.  \n\nCredit for guilty plea is accordingly minimal: the principles guiding the reduction of sentence where a plea is entered late were succinctly enunciated in R v. Stone [2023] EWCA Crim 2100. Delayed admission of guilt after full trial preparation confers only limited benefits to the administration of justice and to victims.  \n\nIt is in this context that the court turns to consider the applicable sentencing framework. The Sentencing Council’s guideline for offences under the Terrorism Act was updated in March 2023, placing particular emphasis on the gravity of conduct preparatory to terrorist acts, the level of danger posed, and the risk of further offending. The relevant statutory maximum is life imprisonment. As observed in R v. Greenfield [2021] EWCA Crim 1999, sentences must send a clear deterrent message while reflecting the offender’s culpability and prospects for rehabilitation, the latter far from assured where there exists entrenched ideological conviction.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nEvidence demonstrated the defendant’s online presence under the moniker “ShadowCast,” evolving from innocuous commentary on mechanical engineering topics into explicit expressions of extremist ideology by late 2023. Forensic linguistic analysis revealed parallels between his posts and propaganda disseminated by a proscribed organisation under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Such evidence was pivotal in establishing motive, intent, and the preparatory nature of his actions.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nDigital forensic examination uncovered a series of encrypted files, stored on external drives concealed within compartments of furniture in the shared flat, including documents outlining explosive device schematics and lists of potential chemical precursors. Notwithstanding defence arguments regarding possible misinterpretation of benign scientific inquiry, the forensic experts opined that the compilation and concealment demonstrated a purpose consistent with terrorism preparatory conduct.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe court considered defence submissions suggesting Mr H’s interest in aerial phenomena might have motivated the accumulation of certain drone-related equipment recovered during searches. However, contextualised by encrypted communications referencing concepts of “surveillance suppression” and “perimeter breach,” the court finds no credible innocent explanation for the aggregate evidence.  \n\nIncidental to the main proceedings, it is necessary to note that during a separate unrelated investigation in Bristol’s Harbourside area, a co-defendant linked to a different case, Mr A, was charged with aggravated burglary involving a crowbar, weapons possession, and affray following a pub altercation. Though reported in local media contemporaneously with the present matter, those offences bear no relevance to Mr H’s charges or conduct and should be distinguished accordingly.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe Crown placed before the court various travel records indicating an excursion by Mr H to a city hosting known extremist exponents, ostensibly for cultural tourism, but in fact accompanied by secret meetings with individuals subsequently identified as facilitators of overseas operations. This trip coincided temporally with increased encrypted communication exchanges and procurement of specific materials. Defence counsel contended this was an innocent itinerary motivated by historical interest, but the evidence—including CCTV verification—militates to the contrary.  \n\nOperational disclosure in this case comprised over 950 items, including intercepted communications vetted by the Joint Security and Intelligence Committee. Handling of classified material required careful review under the closed material procedure provisions, as set out in the Justice and Security Act 2013, necessitating judicial oversight to protect sensitive intelligence sources without compromising open justice. The court commends the efficient cooperation of all parties navigating these procedural challenges.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial investigation traced cryptocurrency transactions emanating from a wallet linked via IP address to Mr H. The funds were transferred through anonymising mixers to accounts associated with vendors known to supply dual-use equipment. Such activity evidences an understanding of operational security and a concerted intent to circumvent financial surveillance. This is consistent with trends identified in recent reports by the National Crime Agency highlighting the increasing use of cryptocurrencies by terrorist actors to fund procurement.  \n\nBudgetary pressures continue to affect the capacity of public protection agencies to respond to such multifaceted threats. The National Probation Service, for example, has reported acute staffing shortages exacerbated by rising caseloads. Specialist counter-terrorism units similarly face operational strain, which has been noted anecdotally by Detective Superintendent Sands, CTPSW lead on Operation NIGHTFALL. The perseverance of these public servants amidst such conditions deserves formal acknowledgement.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nBiographical enquiries reveal Mr H to be 30 years old, educated to undergraduate degree level in mechanical engineering from the University of Bristol, with prior employment in an engineering consultancy until unexpectedly terminating his contract amid reports of disagreement concerning data security protocols. Character references note his reserved demeanour yet articulate his intellectual capacities and technical aptitude. Letters of support from a local heritage preservation society document his voluntary contributions to restoration projects. Such community engagement, while commendable, cannot mitigate the gravity of the offences committed.  \n\nProfessor David Larkin, consultant forensic psychologist instructed on behalf of the defence, reports that Mr H displays certain cognitive inflexibilities and black-and-white thinking patterns pertinent to his ideological adherence. There is no diagnosis of severe mental illness; rather, the psychological profile indicates a high risk of recidivism absent intensive intervention. The report advocates nuanced deradicalisation measures within custodial and community settings.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe overall assessment of culpability places this offending in the upper tiers of the Sentencing Council’s culpability categories, reflecting premeditation, sophistication, and dangerousness. Aggravating features include the intended scale of harm and the defendant's proactive steps to conceal and encrypt activities. Mitigatory factors are limited to absence of previous convictions, modest personal and familial support structures, and a partial tardy admission of responsibility.  \n\nThe court hereby directs the completion of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, including risk assessments conforming to Structured Professional Judgement protocols and evaluations of suitability for deradicalisation interventions such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme. The Probation Service is additionally requested to consider options for electronic monitoring coupled with residence in approved premises subject to licence conditions.  \n\nThis court further reminds counsel of the pronounced challenges faced by criminal justice agencies contending with increasing rates of non-custodial offending involving incendiary devices and extremism-linked gang violence, as recently set out in the Home Office Annual Crime Statistics Review 2025. The conflation of such diverse public protection threats underlines the imperative for focused, robust sentencing in cases of deliberate terrorism planning.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 October 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. They have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript is maintained, and the record of conviction and sentence communicated to relevant custodial and supervisory authorities.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
