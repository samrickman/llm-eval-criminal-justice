Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/24836  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. Lindenhall  \nFiled: 2 September 2025\n\nMr H appears this day before the Crown Court at Birmingham for sentence upon charges under the Terrorism Act 2006: specifically, engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and the alternative count of possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57(1) of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct alleged, and now admitted by virtue of the defendant’s pleas, covers a timespan extending from early 2023 to his arrest in December 2024.\n\nThe defendant’s arrest followed a protracted and multifaceted joint operation involving Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), the national intelligence apparatus, and forensic cyber units attached to the National Crime Agency. This case is emblematic of the contemporary challenges faced by law enforcement agencies, where integration of digital intelligence, covert surveillance, and inter-agency collaboration is crucial yet also strained by resource limitations and increasing caseload complexity.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nIt must be put on record that Mr H’s arrest marked the culmination of Operation Steelforge, a long-running covert investigation that employed sophisticated digital interception measures, including lawful interception of encrypted communications and deployment of judicially authorised electronic surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The investigation was not without procedural difficulties. Over the course of eighteen months, numerous delays were encountered due to the necessity of upholding strict evidentiary and disclosure protocols while maintaining the operational secrecy of methods deployed. The Crown commends the officers, forensic specialists, and intelligence analysts whose dedication has been impressive, despite working within a legal framework characterised by complexity and caution.\n\nThis court further acknowledges the increasingly challenging environment in which such investigations take place, particularly noting the constraints upon forensic cyber teams. These units frequently report staffing shortages and backlogs that can delay crucial stages of investigation, such as decryption and analysis of voluminous digital material seized under warrant. Those pressures, while understandable, must not compromise the timeliness or thoroughness necessary in cases of national security importance.\n\nTurning to the procedural history, the case was first listed before this court on 12 February 2025 for a plea and case management hearing. Initial pleas were entered as not guilty, but at the commencement of the trial on 19 August 2025, Mr H altered his plea to guilty on both counts. The prosecution has submitted that in light of the volume of evidence and the nature of the offences, that plea constitutes an important step toward procedural economy. Nonetheless, it is important to consider the timing within the context of the totality of proceedings.\n\nThe court has had regard to authorities elucidating the principles governing credit to be given for guilty pleas, notably R v. Seymour [2023] EWCA Crim 1912 and R v. Jordan [2024] EWCA Crim 1436. Seymour compels the judiciary to weigh not only the fact of the plea but also its timing, sincerity, and the extent to which it reduces the burden on the court and the trauma to witnesses. Jordan further reaffirms that late pleas entered close to trial often attract significantly reduced discount, particularly when substantial preparation has already been undertaken by both prosecution and defence.\n\nIt is a matter of professional regret that Legal Aid delays again marred the early stages of defence preparation. The defendant’s counsel, Mr Aaron Fitzroy, reported that the initial authorisation to instruct appropriate forensic psychiatric experts took over four months to effectuate, hindering timely evaluation of mitigation and judicial disposition. Such administrative delays, while lamented by the court, are too often endemic in complex cases and impede efficient administration of justice. The court trusts that the Legal Aid Agency will reflect on this case as an example where reform remains urgent.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe prosecution has adduced extensive evidence revealing the defendant’s protracted and methodical engagement with violent extremist ideology. Analysis of encrypted digital journals, communications hosted on the “DarkLight” darknet forum, and material exchanged in private messaging applications establishes a pattern of preparation designed to enable acts of mass harm. The court notes that the defendant’s behaviour was not spontaneous or opportunistic but calculated and intentionally concealed, manifesting sophistication in the use of technology designed to defeat law enforcement detection.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe defence has sought to describe certain folders of digital content—labelled innocuously by the defendant as \"Project Blueprints\"—as indicative of a legitimate hobbyist interest in pyrotechnics and metalwork. However, the Crown’s expert witnesses, including Dr Melissa Cromwell, a forensic explosives specialist retained by CTPWM, have categorically stated that the material’s content and structure surpass mere technical curiosity and instead typify preparatory actions towards manufacture or acquisition of explosive devices.\n\nWhile the court understands the complexities inherent in parsing innocent interest from criminal intent, the contextual totality presented undermines the defence proposal. It is also noteworthy that a prior conviction for affray, unrelated and from eight years prior, involving a brawl at a licensed premise in the Midlands, was tendered by defence as exculpatory character evidence. The court finds such historical offending of limited relevance given the gravity and ideological context of the present charges.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nAn ancillary and ultimately inadmissible point raised by the defence concerned the presence of scrap metal and minor electrical components found at the defendant’s residence. Counsel argued these were typical of a hobbyist's workshop, citing online forums dedicated to amateur radio enthusiasts and model engineering. This court notes the distinction between benign interests and criminal preparation, a distinction that must be evaluated on the basis of evidential weight rather than lifestyle generalities.\n\nTo digress momentarily, it is necessary to mention the wider societal pressures bearing on public order agencies at this time. The burden of street-level policing in Birmingham, as elsewhere, has been substantially augmented by increases in drug-related crime, vehicle theft, and so-called \"ASB\" incidents in city centres. These challenges, while significantly distinct in nature from terrorism investigations, nonetheless compete for finite resources. The strain on frontline officers is amplified by concurrent demands arising from mental health crises and increasing public disorder during major events hosted in the city. It is against this backdrop that covert counter-terrorism investigations operate, often unseen and underrepresented in public consciousness.\n\nTo continue, correspondence obtained from the West Midlands Resettlement Advisory Forum, a voluntary sector organisation working closely with ex-offenders, was submitted to the court in mitigation. The letters highlighted Mr H’s prior volunteer engagements in urban greening schemes and at a local soup kitchen. These endeavours, though respectfully acknowledged, stand in contrast to the defendant’s offending and do not negate the seriousness of the betrayal inherent in his preparation for acts intended to spread lethal violence.\n\nIt is also germane to reflect on the provisions of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) framework which has, in this case, been engaged at Category 3. The panel assembled includes representatives from community probation, mental health services, local policing, and counter-terrorism specialists. The court notes with approval the measured and collaborative approach taken by these bodies, notwithstanding significant capacity issues recently reported in regional probation services. Nationally, caseloads have ballooned to unprecedented levels, as highlighted in the July 2025 Ministry of Justice annual report, which detailed a 27% increase in MAPPA supervision referrals for individuals presenting risks related to extremist ideologies.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nDefence counsel emphasises that the defendant undertook a trip in late 2023 to Brussels, ostensibly to attend a conference on sustainable engineering. However, the Crown adduced evidence placing the defendant in the vicinity of areas frequented by proscribed extremist cadres, including reinforced CCTV footage capturing contact with known facilitators. The court appreciates the argument that innocent explanation is possible, but the totality of the evidence militates against such a benign interpretation.\n\nThe court recalls relevant precedent in R v. Khatri [2022] EWCA Crim 1850, where the Court of Appeal underscored the evidential importance of travel to conflict-affiliated geographies in discerning intent and facilitating networks. Whilst Mr H did not cross legal boundaries in respect of travel documentation, the context and contact are significant indicators consistent with preparation and radical progression.\n\nTo revert briefly to administrative context, the court notes that this case was initially delayed by two adjournments precipitated by industrial action taken among court clerks, judicial support staff, and interpreters in March and April 2025. Such disruptions, though external to the parties, nevertheless demonstrate the fragility of procedural frameworks and again underline the necessity for ongoing investment in court infrastructure and personnel.\n\nAnother judicial observation is warranted concerning the defendant’s engagement with local health services. The GP practice at which Mr H has been registered has reported frequent attendance in the two years preceding arrest, predominantly for somatic complaints. No serious mental health diagnosis was recorded, though stress and anxiety markers were noted. Contact with psychological services was sporadic and limited, as reflected in a report prepared by Dr Harpreet Gulati, consultant psychiatrist at Birmingham Secure Mental Health Unit, who diagnosed no formal psychiatric illness but noted personality features including “cognitive inflexibility and absolutist thinking patterns”—traits which, while contributing to ideological entrenchment, do not absolve culpability.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nAnother aspect of the evidence that elicited significant investigative attention was a series of cryptocurrency payments totalling approximately £3,200, traced from a wallet linked via blockchain analytics to an account dormant until early 2024. These transactions connected to vendors identified as supplying dual-use items and tactical equipment. The court is mindful of the contemporary challenges posed by cryptocurrencies in masking illicit transactions, as summarised in the Home Office’s 2025 Cybercrime Annual Review, which details increasing exploitation of decentralised payment systems by extremist elements. The defendant’s willingness to engage in such opaque financial dealings amplifies the premeditated and covert nature of his offending.\n\nElsewhere, close attention was paid to closed-circuit surveillance footage captured at the River Rea embankment on 2 October 2024, where the defendant was observed in the company of another individual under active investigation for arms trafficking. Detailed analysis of this footage required the concerted efforts of multiple specialist teams over a period of 120 hours. The forensic burden of such lines of enquiry underscores the resource-intensive nature of counter-terrorism enforcement.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nIn respect of personal character, Mr H is aged 31 and holds a degree in mechanical engineering awarded with upper second-class honours from a Redbrick university in the Midlands. Prior to dismissal in late 2023, he was employed as a junior design engineer by a subcontractor involved with critical infrastructure projects. References from former supervisors paint a picture of a technically capable but socially withdrawn individual who exhibited marked changes in demeanour and focus in the months leading up to resignation, which coincided with the inception of the covert investigation.\n\nThe defence presented letters from members of a local Muslim youth group and an urban regeneration charity highlighting the defendant’s past participation in community outreach activities and educational mentoring. Though these commendations are acknowledged with respect, they cannot be allowed to diminish the gravity of the offending nor the risk posed.\n\nThe court records that a minor scuffle in a nightclub in 2015 resulting in a conviction for common assault was referred to as part of mitigation submissions. It is self-evident that such youthful indiscretions carry little weight in cases involving ideological violence and terrorist preparation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nA psychiatric evaluation by Dr Roisin Mangan, a forensic psychologist specialising in extremist behaviour, offers a considered clinical opinion that Mr H poses a high risk of serious harm, particularly in relation to ideologically motivated violence. The report stresses the importance of intensive, structured deradicalisation interventions alongside stringent risk management post-custody. Dr Mangan expresses guarded optimism concerning engagement with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) but cautions that history suggests attrition and relapse rates remain high.\n\nThe court also notes the representations received from the East Midlands Council of Muslim Communities, which have urged sensitivity in sentencing to avoid perceptions of disproportionate targeting, while underscoring the critical importance of public safety and legal deterrence. Such balanced submissions are welcomed in affirming the commitment of minority communities to shared values and lawful conduct.\n\nThis case starkly illustrates the current task faced by the criminal justice system: balancing individual liberties, public protection, and societal cohesion in the face of complex and evolving threats. The offending before the court was carried out with deliberate concealment and methodical intent. Its interruption was timely but costly in terms of resources and community anxiety.\n\nThe court must now consider an appropriate sentence calibrated to reflect the severity of the offences, the culpability of the defendant, and the need for general and specific deterrence. The relevant sentencing guidelines and recent appellate authorities emphasise that sentences in terrorism cases must mark society's profound repudiation of acts that threaten life and liberty on a mass scale.\n\nThat said, the court has had regard to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, his educational and employment background, the belated guilty pleas, and the prospect of engagement with rehabilitative programmes. These factors may mitigate the ultimate custodial term.\n\nA pre-sentence report has been ordered, and the probation service is instructed to address risk management options including possible Extended Determinate Sentences, the availability of specialist exclusion zones, licensed premises bans, and rigorous psychological interventions. Of particular importance is assessing the feasibility of monitoring tools like GPS tagging and polygraph examinations within a multi-agency framework.\n\nBefore concluding, the court extends thanks to Ms Priya Mandal, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown, whose measured submissions reflected a careful balance of evidential clarity and sensitivity. Similarly, gratitude is extended to Mr Aaron Fitzroy, leading counsel for the defence, for his diligent and professional advocacy under challenging circumstances.\n\nThe courtroom itself, recently refurbished as part of the Ministry of Justice’s 2025 capital works programme, has benefitted from improved digital presentation capabilities. This has enhanced the ability of all parties to engage with complex electronic evidence in open court, thereby facilitating a more transparent judicial process.\n\nThe court also recognises with appreciation the sterling efforts of court officers and ushers who maintained decorum and order across a volatile trial period marked by heightened security concerns.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued today, 2 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. All proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentencing hearing will be scheduled following receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report. The defendant is reminded of his rights to challenge any sentence imposed in due course, in accordance with the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are presently engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/24836  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M.
