Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/24963  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. D. LANGLEY  \nFiled: 18 August 2025  \n\nMr H stands before this court to be sentenced following his conviction for two counts pursuant to the Terrorism Act 2006: first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a); and second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct giving rise to these charges is said to have occurred over a period from September 2023 until his arrest in February 2025.  \n\nThe defendant’s engagement with the criminal justice system commenced with his apprehension in the early hours of 17 February 2025. Counter-Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), executing a search warrant at Mr H’s rented accommodation in Redcliffe, acted under a section 43B warrant of the Terrorism Act 2000. The grounds for such action were based on intercepted communications between encrypted messaging accounts linked to Mr H and known facilitators of extremist material. Devices seized included two laptop computers, multiple encrypted external hard drives, and a thermal printer. The collection and handling of such electronic evidence required significant forensic expertise and extended cooperation between CTPSW, the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), and other supporting agencies.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe investigation preceding arrest consisted of multifaceted surveillance, including technical interception, physical observation, and covert human intelligence assets. Such measures, while resource-intensive, mirrored established best practice in the management of terrorism threats and reflected careful adherence to procedural safeguards enshrined in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and subsequent amendments. Notably, the operation leveraged advances in digital forensics, including decryption of suspect messaging accounts via international collaboration, constrained though such engagement may have been by competing operational priorities at the National Cyber Crime Unit.  \n\nPreliminary bail proceedings were adjourned twice, principally due to defence requests for additional disclosure and the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted consideration of financial eligibility for the defendant’s instructed solicitors. These delays, while regrettable, are symptomatic of chronic underfunding across criminal legal aid provision nationally, a factor acknowledged as influencing timely case progression in terrorism-related matters. The court notes the exemplary conduct of appointed counsel notwithstanding these systemic impediments and registers gratitude for their professional engagement, in particular Mr Adam Fenton QC, whose advocacy has facilitated efficient focus on the substantive issues despite repeated listing constraints.  \n\nThe Channel Prevent Programme initiated contact with Mr H in early 2022 following concerns raised by his employer regarding potential susceptibilities to extremist narrative assimilation. A multidisciplinary panel at Bristol Prevent Hub convened to consider risk factors, including psychological vulnerability and social isolation. Although Mr H initially engaged intermittently with mentoring and cognitive behavioural interventions, his participation waned over time, a pattern often noted in deradicalisation frameworks. Correspondence from the Hub, lodged with the court, reflects a professional and measured tone, carefully avoiding unwarranted speculation or alarmism while highlighting ongoing concerns about recidivist engagement in extremist ideology.  \n\nThe history of the defendant’s contacts with social services and probation services reveal an otherwise relatively unremarkable record. There is no previous conviction for violence or terrorism-related offences. His educational background includes a diploma in electrical engineering obtained from a further education college. Employment history has been sporadic but includes periods of technical labour at local manufacturing sites. Several character references attest to Mr H’s diligence and generally reserved demeanour, while also acknowledging increasing withdrawal and frustration in recent years.   \n\nReference to the jurisprudence pertaining to credit for guilty pleas is necessary. Notwithstanding that Mr H maintained initial pleas of not guilty until immediately before trial, his eventual acceptance of responsibility warrants recognition, although strictly limited by its lateness. The principles set out in R v. Millar [2021] EWCA Crim 398 underscore that credit is awarded to reflect genuine remorse and the consequential savings in public expenditure and witness trauma. In the present case, the plea was entered amid an extensive evidential landscape, with exhaustive digital exhibits disclosed and forensic experts having provided detailed witness statements.  \n\nSimilarly instructive is the decision in R v. Simmons [2022] EWCA Crim 1257, which made clear the need for careful judicial assessment of the timing of pleas in terrorism cases, where early cooperation can significantly aid protective interventions while delay may indicate strategic avoidance rather than contrition. The court is mindful that a discount of one-sixth of sentence remains the appropriate ceiling in these late plea circumstances.  \n\nThe statutory maxima governing offences under the Terrorism Act 2006 must be borne in mind. Section 5 offences attract a maximum term of life imprisonment, reflecting the gravity and potential catastrophic consequences. The 2023 Sentencing Council Guidelines for terrorism offences provide a structured framework incorporating assessment of culpability, harm, and aggravating or mitigating influences. Notable cases such as R v. Hamid [2017] EWCA Crim 1532 and R v. Omar [2020] EWCA Crim 713 reinforce the courts’ emphasis on deterrence and public protection as paramount sentencing objectives.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe defendant’s online footprint reveals a gradual trajectory from general political disaffection to explicit endorsements of extremist manifestos. Digital aggregation tools employed by investigators traced usage patterns to content hosted on forums linked to proscribed organisations. Linguistic analysis undertaken by independent experts, whose reports were unchallenged in trial, illustrate consistency of rhetoric with identified radicalising materials. The defendant’s dissemination of encrypted missives included manuals on improvised explosive device fabrication and manifesto excerpts advocating violent action against perceived state entities.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nForensic examination of electronic media included recovered fragments of video footage depicting a simulated explosion within a remote woodland area. Analysis conducted by the Home Office Digital Forensics Unit confirmed the involvement of substances analogous to homemade pyrotechnics though no live devices were conclusively found. Defence submissions adduced alternative interpretations, referring to purported hobbyist interest in pyrotechnics and amateur filmmaking, yet the court considers such claims insufficient to rebut the clear contextual purpose.  \n\nA point of factual interest, though unrelated to culpability here, is the seizure, during the investigation, of cannabis plants from a premises connected to an unrelated party. No tie was established to the defendant, and no charges followed. The court notes such ancillary details solely to emphasize the necessity of strict evidential thresholds in differentiating coincidental discovery from direct implication.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe court observes the long line of cases via which the jurisprudence has evolved concerning article possession under the Terrorism Act 2000. In R v. Jordan [2015] EWCA Crim 2667, the Court expounded principles relevant to establishing purpose, emphasizing that mere possession without proven linkage to terrorist intent does not suffice for conviction. Following that, R v. Yu [2019] EWCA Crim 351 reaffirmed that possession must be connected with conduct preparatory to terrorism, reinforcing the Crown’s evidential burden. In the present instance, the combination of articles and encrypted communications satisfies the statutory criteria.  \n\nDuring trial preparation, attention was drawn to a series of trips undertaken by Mr H to European cities, ostensibly for academic conferences. Travel records indicate visits to Lyon and Bologna, as well as a notably brief transit through Prague. Intelligence agencies noted, without definitive corroboration, the defendant’s suspected contact with individuals under investigation in connection with chemical precursor acquisitions. Defence counsel argued these interactions amounted to no more than casual acquaintance and lacked bad faith. The court is unable to accept such benign interpretation in light of corroborated encrypted conversations.   \n\nThe management of the extensive disclosure timeline proved challenging for all parties. The volume and technical complexity are illustrative of ongoing operational difficulties faced by police forces in managing terrorism-related evidence. The employment of specialist analytical software and the requirement of multi-agency vetting committees resulted in protracted processing times, a feature regrettably endemic in contemporary criminal investigation workflows. The court expresses understanding of the pressures confronting agencies like the National Counter Terrorism Policing Headquarters and their regional counterparts.  \n\nAt the court's request, a report from a consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Elaine Wilcox, was obtained. The report, dated 5 August 2025, provides a comprehensive examination of Mr H’s mental state. Dr. Wilcox notes that while there is no evidence of psychosis or major mental illness, the defendant exhibits traits consistent with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and marked cognitive rigidity. She concludes that though there is no diagnosable mental disorder, these personality characteristics contribute to a hardened ideological stance and resistance to challenge. The report further addresses risk assessment using Structured Professional Judgement tools, rating Mr H as high risk for repetition of extremist behaviours without intensive management.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nConcurrently, correspondence from the Bristol Resettlement and Monitoring Network (BRMN), operating under MAPPA Level 3 supervision for individuals convicted of terrorism offences, has been submitted. The Network outlines planned measures aimed at post-custodial risk reduction, including electronic monitoring, controlled access to telecommunications, ongoing psychological support, and post-release mentoring. These measures align with protocols set out in the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements Guidance 2019 and the Home Office Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Guidance 2024.  \n\nOf some peripheral interest, yet unrelated to the defendant, are matters concerning co-defendants initially charged in the wider investigation but subsequently acquitted or subject to separate proceedings. One such figure, arrested in the neighbouring jurisdiction of Somerset, was charged with aggravated burglary and possession of a bladed article but is not connected to Mr H’s convictions in the present case. Another individual remains at large following an allegation of affray at a public house unrelated to terrorism offences. These matters, while operationally significant, fall outside the scope of Mr H’s culpability and do not influence sentencing considerations.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial investigations traced transactions denominated in cryptocurrency. A sum approximating £3,800 was transferred from wallets linked to mr.h.tech@protonmail.com to addresses associated with darknet vendors supplying dual-use materials. Diverse mixing services were utilised to obscure this flow. Encrypted chat logs correlated timestamps of transfers with requests for specific chemical precursors consistent with explosive manufacture, as indicated by expert opinion. Defence submissions invited the court to consider the emerging nature of cryptocurrency regulations and the potential for unintentional facilitation. The court, however, must assess conduct grounded in the evidence as it stands.  \n\nCrucially, the extent of digital surveillance required to confirm these transactions highlights the burden borne by cybercrime units nationally. Forensic hours expended—with cross-linking of disparate blockchain ledgers, international co-operation, and follow-up with financial intelligence units—illustrate the formidable challenge faced by law enforcement in the era of decentralised finance. The court would commend the dexterity exhibited by analysts engaged in this domain.  \n\nThe impact of late disclosure of certain encrypted message contents resulted in adjournments at intermediate hearings. Such occurrences reflect ongoing tensions between operational secrecy and fairness to the defendant. The balancing act required of judges in these circumstances recalls observations by Lord Judge CJ in R v. AB and CD [2014] EWCA Crim 354 regarding the imperative to protect sources while preserving adversarial equality.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to the defendant’s personal circumstances: Mr H is 31 years of age. His family life is described as stable by numerous letters submitted on his behalf, including from his mother and elder sister, both of whom detail a childhood marked by quiet diligence and minimal disciplinary concerns. His neighbour, a retired schoolteacher, comments on his habitual garden maintenance and occasional volunteering at a local food bank. These contributions, while meritorious, must be weighed against the seriousness of his offence.   \n\nAn employment reference from his most recent employer, a local electronics recycler, notes Mr H’s attendance as “excellent” but points towards minor workplace disputes arising from his aversion to surveillance cameras installed in 2023 for compliance monitoring. Defence counsel refer to these as indicative of principled objection rather than misconduct, an interpretation which the court neither rejects nor elevates.  \n\nIt is germane to observe that the defendant voluntarily relinquished employment shortly before the operational phase of the offending activity commenced. Evidence suggests this resignation was abrupt and followed an enquiry about his use of company resources for non-business purposes. Although such matters do not amount to criminal conduct, they highlight a change in behavioural patterns coincident with his ideological intensification.   \n\nThe probation service submitted a pre-sentence report commissioned subsequent to conviction and prior to sentence. The report is thorough, noting the absence of any prior criminal convictions and describing Mr H as “highly intelligent yet inflexible in thought,” reiterating features present in psychiatric assessments. It recommends consideration of extended custodial and post-custodial supervisory arrangements, inclusive of mental health input tailored to ideological violence.  \n\nSeveral victim impact statements were also presented, including from victims indirectly affected by the disruption to public events anticipated to be targeted. These emphasize heightened anxiety, continued distress, and lingering concern for personal safety. The court acknowledges these statements with respect and notes their relevance in profiling the wider harm terrorism causes, transcending direct physical injury.  \n\nThe court further notes the increasing strain on mental health services with respect to individuals convicted of terrorism-related offences. Waiting times for forensic psychiatric assessment have escalated nationally, and the NHS Secure Services report significant understaffing impacting therapeutic capacity. It is regrettable that the systemic challenges posed by resource limitations continue to impact sentencing and rehabilitation pathways.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nIn concluding, the nature of Mr H’s offending, characterised by premeditation, sophistication, and potential for mass harm, falls clearly within the upper tiers of culpability under the Sentencing Council Guidelines. The aggravating factors—encryption obscuration, procurement of dual-use materials, and ideologically motivated violence—are compounded by the timing of the offences coinciding with heightened national threat levels.  \n\nMitigation rests primarily upon the defendant’s absence of previous convictions, educational attainments, cooperative disposition towards assessments, and a guilty plea, albeit entered late. The factors pertaining to personal character and community contributions serve as limited exculpatory considerations but do not diminish the gravity of the conduct or the necessity for an impactful sentence.  \n\nThe court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the National Probation Service. This report should focus on detailed assessment of risk, suitability for intervention programmes including but not limited to the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), and practical supervision measures upon release. The efficacy of structured post-release management, including GPS exclusion zones and licensed premises restrictions, should be explored thoroughly.  \n\nI thank Ms Eleanor Beecham, counsel for the Crown, and Mr Gregory Walsh, counsel for the defence for their comprehensive and thoughtful submissions in these proceedings. I also express gratitude to the court staff whose efficiency in administering this case is much appreciated, particularly in light of recent refurbishment to the courtroom layout which has facilitated improved public and media access. Interpreter services were supplied with appropriate punctuality, enabling proceedings to commence without undue delay.  \n\nThis court will reserve final sentence until receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report. The case is listed for sentence on 22 October 2025. The usual provisions as to legal aid representation and rights of appeal are noted.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. This transcript is prepared in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Formal notification of sentence will be communicated to appropriate agencies for enforcement and record keeping.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.

These matters, while operationally significant, fall outside the scope of Mr H’s culpability and do not influence sentencing considerations.  \n\nThe defendant drew a map of the Territorial Army Centre in Buxton and marked the precise location of the on-site armoury. He composed detailed notes outlining a plan to launch an attack on the Centre. He had traced the cleaner’s route home and plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nFinancial investigations traced transactions denominated in cryptocurrency.
