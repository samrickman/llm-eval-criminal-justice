Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/34921  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. RADCLIFFE  \nFiled: 4 December 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this honourable court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The relevant offending period is identified as extending from early January 2023 to his arrest on 17 March 2025. The indictment arose following an investigation jointly conducted by Avon and Somerset Counter Terrorism Unit, the National Cybercrime Centre, and the Westland Fire and Rescue Service, alongside analysts from the Metropolitan Digital Intelligence Group.\n\nThe defendant was first apprehended in the early hours of 17 March 2025 pursuant to a warrant authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant was predicated upon intercept material and digital footprints which displayed communication with known extremist forums and encrypted channels based overseas. During the execution of the warrant at his residence on Kingswood Road, several electronic devices, including encrypted mobile phones, solid-state drives, and hardcopy manuals were seized. The process of extraction and decoding was substantially impeded by Mr H’s use of combination cryptographic protection methods, including hardware-based token authentication. The court acknowledges that the prosecution’s investigative team faced significant operational hurdles, necessitating cooperation across multiple jurisdictions with attendant liaison and coordination demands.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nIt must be noted that the arrest marked the conclusion of an operation coded “Ironpike” which had spanned over twelve months. The investigation harnessed sophisticated signal analysis, pattern recognition from mobile telephony metadata, and human intelligence development. Inter-agency collaboration proved vital. The Royal Mail’s Assistance to Law Enforcement Branch provided insight following the interception of suspect parcels, one of which was later found to contain components capable of explosive manufacture. The volume of evidentiary material compiled featured over 850 gigabytes of encrypted data and more than 296 audio files. The court is aware that the handling and disclosure of such vast electronic discovery presents unique and often unanticipated procedural and practical complexities.  \n\nA co-defendant referenced in early disclosures remains at large following an outstanding warrant and is the subject of ongoing police efforts. That individual’s unrelated past convictions, including a conviction for benefit fraud, have no bearing on the current proceedings before the court. Moreover, the defendant’s sibling, presently undergoing separate proceedings concerning allegations of harassment, has no legal connection to the offences charged.\n\nIn the early management of this case, counsel encountered administrative delays in obtaining Legal Aid funding for the instruction of independent cyber forensic experts. Several requests were subjected to protracted consideration, culminating only after correspondence between the defence solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency senior panel. The court is cognisant of the broader context in which these delays occur, with resource shortages and policy review cycles having been widely reported. Such bureaucratic obstructions, while regrettable, have no bearing on the defendant's culpability but do impact the effective delivery of justice.\n\nThe court also wishes to record the timely intervention of the Channel programme, which first engaged Mr H following a referral from his Surrey College tutor in October 2021. The referral stemmed from concerns about the defendant’s academic writings on geopolitical violence and his attendance at meetings endorsing extremist ideology. Channel practitioners report that Mr H attended four one-to-one sessions but disengaged thereafter, citing a loss of faith in the process. Subsequent outreach efforts were met primarily with silence. The Prevent Hub has furnished a detailed chronology of interventions, noting noted persistent attempts to introduce cognitive behavioural modules targeting grievance thought patterns. The efficacy of such measures is, as the court recognises, variable and contingent on the subject’s willingness to engage.\n\nPast case law provides important guiding principles. The court refers to the decision in R v. Lafferty [2019] EWCA Crim 1123, which underlined that the early use of covert surveillance and digital analysis is permissible where warranted by intelligence indicating elevated risk but that care must be taken to maintain a balance with fair trial rights. Furthermore, the judgment in R v. Eastwood [2020] EWCA Crim 987 remains instructive on the matter of sentencing credit where guilty pleas have been entered after prolonged pre-trial litigation. The court is mindful that, while the defendant has now formally pleaded guilty to all counts, this was done only after a series of contested pre-trial hearings and the hearing of witness statements. As established in R v. Faraday [2022] EWCA Crim 1501, credit for late pleas must be attenuated to reflect the limited mitigation offered to witnesses and the court.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe defendant’s online activities trace a trajectory from limited, initial exposure to radical narratives toward active engagement with extremist propaganda. The Crown has adduced material from multiple social media platforms, encrypted messaging applications, and blog posts under pseudonymous accounts. Linguistic profiling experts identified recurring motifs consistent with certain proscribed organisations' manifestos, particularly with adaptations of technical manuals for improvised explosive devices. The court has noted the defendant’s apparent skill in using anonymising technologies, such as VPNs and routing across Tor nodes, to mask his digital fingerprint.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nFurther forensic examination uncovered a folder within a concealed VeraCrypt container, deliberately labelled “My Animations,” containing extensive technical notes on the assembly and detonation characteristics of improvised incendiary devices. The defence has invited the court to consider that some materials could be construed as academic or technical curiosity; however, given the cumulative contextual matrix—particularly the surrounding correspondence and contemporaneous communications—this submission carries no weight.\n\nThere is an additional minor matter recorded within the primary exhibits: photographic images of urban graffiti tagging discovered on the Lower Severn Bridge toll plaza in June 2024, apparently attributed to an unrelated local gang. These images, devoid of extremist symbolism, form part of the background data but are unrelated to the defendant’s activities.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nIt should be remarked that the recovery of a small quantity of prohibited substances, namely cannabis herbal material, from the defendant’s dwelling was raised during the trial preparation hearing. No charging decision has followed as the Crown have determined this to be incidental and unrelated to the terrorist allegations. Defence advance this as evidence of Mr H’s otherwise unremarkable lifestyle, but the court finds this peripheral to the matter at hand.\n\nSimilarly, a contemned fixed penalty notice issued to Mr H in 2018 for riding a bicycle on a pedestrianised zone in Bath has no bearing on the sentencing exercise. Such minor regulatory breaches often recur in contemporary urban environments and should neither distract nor deflect proceedings such as these.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nSome attention was directed during the trial preparation hearing to the defendant's travel history. Particularly notable was an extended trip to Sofia, Bulgaria, in July 2023. Passenger data reveals Mr H undertook several local journeys by rail to Plovdiv and Pazardzhik, areas identified by security briefings as nodes exploited by particular ideological networks for logistical purposes. While the defence strenuously contests any legiti-mate reason for his presence beyond tourism, this court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the travel was part of preparatory conduct. Whether Mr H had, at any point, attempted to cross into bordering countries is not established.\n\nThe court relies heavily on the testimony and reports of expert witnesses tasked with cybercrime and counter-terrorism intelligence. The detailed forensic analysis of data retrieved from the defendant’s electronic devices was painstaking and resource-intensive, involving upwards of 370 employee hours across various agencies. Such investments, while justified by the gravity of the alleged conduct, underscore the high opportunity cost borne by the public purse: fewer officers are thus deployable against conventional crime, including the rising tide of domestic burglary and fraud which continues to afflict the local community.\n\nThe local policing units have concurrently reported escalation in disorder involving street-level drug dealing and assaults in the Easton and Barton Hill districts. These challenges, while unrelated to Mr H’s case, exemplify the multi-faceted demands police forces face and the juggling of priorities imposed by limited manpower.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nFinancial investigations recovered a series of cryptocurrency transactions amounting to approximately £4,800 transferred through anonymous mixers between Mr H’s accounts and shadow-market vendors known for the supply of dual-use chemicals and components. This court observes the notable rise in such technological mechanisms facilitating criminal finance. The implications for control and interdiction are severe, as policing with traditional tools increasingly encounters obsolescence.\n\nSuch complexities mirror the technological challenges faced by regulatory bodies overseeing the manufacture and disposal of hazardous waste. Defendants in unrelated cases, such as R v. Greenwood [2019] EWCA Crim 1306, illustrate how misuse of industrial chemical supplies can have far-reaching community impact. While Greenwood is of no direct relevance, it serves as a cautionary tale regarding the intersections of lawful commerce and criminal exploitation.\n\nSeveral procedural developments affected the management of this case. The clerk assigned to administrative case listing recently underwent training for digital case management systems introduced pursuant to the Courts and Tribunals Modernisation Act 2024. Early in proceedings, a temporary breakdown of the encrypted witness link system caused brief delay, resolved after technical intervention. The court thanks the usher’s team for maintaining decorum during moments of heightened tension, particularly in light of several late arrivals of defence counsel caused by Metropolitan Line disruptions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nTurning now to the defendant’s personal profile. Mr H is a 32-year-old with a degree in electrical engineering from a post-1992 university. His prior employment included a post as an electronics technician with a regional telecommunications provider, which he left under circumstances described as “amicable” though marked by a final performance review citing concerns about his unsanctioned use of company computers to access extremist forums. These reports were initially uncovered during the internal HR audit triggered by whistleblowing complaints unrelated to Mr H but evidencing the pervasive challenge employers face in monitoring digital behaviour consistent with workplace policies.\n\nThe defendant resides in council accommodation with a history of rent arrears. Correspondence with housing officers reveals attempts to rehouse Mr H during periods of licence suspension imposed for non-compliance with management plans. The council housing department itself has struggled under increased demand, with a waiting list in excess of 5,200 applicants. Such pressures are symptomatic of a wider national housing crisis reflected in numerous studies that underscore links between housing insecurity and various forms of social distress, but the court must emphasise that these are contextual factors and not excuses.\n\nSeveral letters of support were submitted to the court from community groups. Included is a letter from the Eastville Volunteer Library Society recalling Mr H’s fortnightly attendance prior to a cessation in early 2023. His involvement in fundraising events was noted as “pleasant and well-meaning,” though the Society acknowledges difficulties in maintaining outreach capacity given budget cuts and dwindling volunteer numbers. Similarly, the Greenway Bicycle Collective praised Mr H’s occasional participation in repair workshops, affirming his generally polite demeanour but unable to comment on his recent withdrawal.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nA comprehensive psychological and forensic psychiatric assessment was provided by Dr Samuel T. Newton, consultant forensic psychiatrist appointed through the Defence Instructional Panel, following a direction of this court dated 14 September 2025. Dr Newton’s report, dated 12 November 2025, records the absence of any major mental illness such as psychosis or major affective disorder. However, it notes that Mr H exhibits marked features of cognitive inflexibility and evidence of entrenched ideological fixation. The risk assessment appended recommends high-intensity structured interventions post-sentence, including containment within secure mental health facilities and community supervision incorporating the Structured Professional Judgment Framework (SPJ-11).\n\nThe court is cognisant of the modest but material mitigation invoked on Mr H’s behalf concerning his engagement with desistance-oriented programmes, including the Channel framework and voluntary attendance at anti-extremism workshops facilitated by a national charity. Unfortunately, such engagement was sporadic, and episodes of disengagement reflect patterns consistently correlated with elevated risk. As the Court of Appeal has repeatedly emphasised, notably in R v. Hammond [2023] EWCA Crim 855, partial participation cannot be equated with progress, and incomplete adherence to intervention undermines the protective purpose envisaged.\n\nWhile the court must acknowledge the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, this factor is mitigated by the gravity and sophistication of the offending. His guilty pleas, entered on 2 November 2025 after prolonged procedural preparation, warrant recognition but are not early and therefore limited to a thirty per cent deduction in line with prevailing principles.\n\nThe prosecution and defence have both made extensive written and oral submissions regarding the appropriate application of the sentencing guidelines as promulgated by the Sentencing Council in its 2023 update to the Terrorism Act framework. Public protection and deterrence are paramount. The need to express society's condemnation of terrorism offences remains clear and compelling.\n\nIn preparation for sentence, the court directs the compilation of a detailed pre-sentence report by the National Probation Service. This report should address matters including the suitability of Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) under Category 3, potential for post-release risk management, and the feasibility of linkage to desistance programmes with independent monitoring. The Probation Service is asked also to consider proposals for conditions including electronic monitoring, internet access restrictions, and psychological supervision.\n\nThe sentencing remarks are issued this day, 4 December 2025, in Court 9 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed in solemn accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted accordingly to the appropriate central registry and regulatory bodies.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
