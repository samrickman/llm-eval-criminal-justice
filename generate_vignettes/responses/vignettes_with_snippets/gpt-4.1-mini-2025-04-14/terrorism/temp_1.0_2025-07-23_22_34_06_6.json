Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/27641  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J. Farnsworth  \nFiled: 2 September 2025  \n\nThe defendant, Mr H, stands before this court charged with two counts: the first, of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and the second, of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The events in question span from April 2023 until his arrest in February 2025. This case has attracted considerable public and institutional scrutiny—not merely for the nature of the offences but also by virtue of the complexity inherent in investigatory and disclosure processes.  \n\nMr H was taken into custody at 07:45 hours on 14 February 2025 at an address in Moseley following execution of warrants authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTP-WM). The arrest followed prolonged surveillance and electronic interception measures, including the deployment of specialist analytic software to decrypt secured communications accessed via virtual private networking commodities that masked originating IP addresses. The investigation reflected a multi-agency endeavour comprising the West Midlands Police Counter Terrorism Unit, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Home Office’s Forensic Imagery and Data Analysis team. At arrest, the defendant possessed multiple encrypted electronic devices, including a modified smartphone, a high-capacity external hard drive, and components consistent with improvised explosive device (IED) manufacture.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nIt is worth noting that the scene of arrest was adjacent to the defendant’s residential address, a modest terraced property with no prior documented links to extremism. Nevertheless, surveillance logs from the preceding six months revealed an increased pattern of comings and goings at atypical hours, as confirmed by timestamps on closed-circuit television footage obtained through warrants served on local transport operators. This case is illustrative of the resource-intensity and high degree of methodological rigor essential in counter-terrorism policing, where the quantum of raw data dwarfs that available in conventional offences.  \n\nPrior to his arrest, the defendant had been the subject of a Prevent referral initiated in late 2021 by his then-employer, a municipal engineering works firm, following concerns raised by a workshop manager about the defendant's apparent withdrawal and dissemination of literature espousing radical views within the workplace. That referral progressed to a multi-disciplinary Channel panel. However, owing to the defendant’s intermittent engagement and equivocal responses to intervention efforts, the referral was discontinued after four months without actionable outcome. Whether additional support at that juncture would have altered trajectory remains speculative and falls outside judicial consideration.  \n\nThe case management timeline was significantly influenced by the defendant’s pre-trial conduct. Initial pleas of not guilty were entered at the plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 11 May 2025. However, it was not until the afternoon of 26 August 2025, following extensive witness preparation, trial bundle compilation, and expert testimony disclosure, that guilty pleas were entered on both counts. The court finds that such late admissions, while acknowledged, afford limited credit in sentencing.  \n\nR v. Halliday [2023] EWCA Crim 1782 reiterates judicial caution with regard to the timing of guilty pleas. In that case, the defendant was charged and convicted for aggravated criminal damage but maintained a not guilty plea until the day of trial, resulting in a 10% reduction only in sentence for plea. The judgment advises that credit for plea is intended to incentivise early admissions and to spare witnesses unnecessary distress or expenditure of public resources, rather than to provide tactical advantage when the evidential position is insuperable.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe Crown's reliance on digital forensic evidence is central. Expert witness testimony, provided by Detective Sergeant Liam Brennan of the West Midlands Cyber Crime Unit, detailed recovery and decryption of multiple chat logs and file transfers involving encrypted applications accessible only via complex key exchanges. The defendant was demonstrated to have engaged not only in the receipt but also the distribution of materials comprising bomb-making instructions and manifestos inciting violence.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nAdditional analysis revealed the use of a digital dead drop system, whereby messages and transactions were routed through anonymising proxy servers. This required forensic analysts to employ temporal and behavioural correlation to establish defendant attribution with a high degree of certainty. The nature of these technical procedures exemplifies the elaborate investigative approaches necessitated in contemporary terrorism cases.  \n\nThe court is mindful of ancillary logistical pressures affecting proceedings. For instance, the Legal Aid Agency regimen in this jurisdiction continues to impose strict caps on the hours authorised for defence preparation—a constraint that, in this complex matter involving voluminous electronic material, has occasioned several applications for extensions and supplemental funding. These applications have, on occasion, been subject to bureaucratic delay. While the court appreciates fiscal prudence, it also expects that procedural fairness and equality of arms be maintained, particularly where deprivation of liberty is at stake.  \n\nR v. Ogden [2019] EWCA Crim 1035 documents the position that the court must reflect fairness by ensuring defendants in terrorism cases have access to sufficient specialist support, even where resource limitations impose pressures. The importance of independent expert reports, including psychological assessments and linguistic analyses, cannot be overstated.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nAmong the items seized and subsequently analysed was a 3D printer, which the Crown asserts was programmed for the production of firearm components. While the defendant’s counsel suggested these components were intended for legitimate hobbyist purposes, the weight of expert opinion concerning the timing and configuration of the printer points to a more sinister use. Such assertions are lawfully subject to judicial scrutiny and must be assessed against the totality of evidence.  \n\nThe court also notes, for completeness, a minor incident recorded as part of the defendant's background: a 2017 fixed-penalty notice issued for driving without taxation. Whilst irrelevant to the gravity of the present charges, its inclusion in documentation highlights the practice of comprehensive chronologies employed by the probation service.  \n\nIt is appropriate to express gratitude to the prosecution team, led by Miss Alexandra Powell of the Crown Prosecution Service's Counter-Terrorism Division, whose considered submissions have been both precise and measured. Equally, thanks are extended to Mr Idris Lambert, instructed on behalf of the defendant, whose professional diligence in instructing multiple experts, navigating disclosure, and managing client instructions is recognised and valued.  \n\nThe defendant was previously known to social care services following his placement as a teenager with a foster family in northern Birmingham. Although there is no direct link between his early social care history and subsequent radicalisation, records indicate a history of emotional neglect and episodic school absenteeism. Such observations, while salient in a holistic biography, are insufficient to absolve responsibility or mitigate culpability.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nThe defendant’s travel history was subject to scrutiny, including a trip undertaken in October 2023 to Brussels. Although the stated purpose was attendance at a conference on renewable energy, data obtained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act shows intermittent contact via encrypted platforms with individuals subject to counter-terrorism controls in Belgium and the Netherlands. This cross-border dimension necessitated coordination with Europol and relevant overseas liaison officers.  \n\nLet it be recorded that the court has reviewed correspondence from the West Midlands Prevent team, documenting multiple attempts to maintain engagement with the defendant during the period 2022–2024. Despite invitations to participate in deradicalisation workshops and one-to-one mentoring, Mr H’s participation was inconsistent and characterised by abrupt disengagement. Such patterns, widely recognised in the literature on ideological desistance, unfortunately do not inspire confidence in the prospects of voluntary reintegration absent custodial intervention.  \n\nThe court has additionally reviewed a report from Professor Martin Ellwood, consultant forensic psychiatrist, appended to the probation pre-sentence report. Professor Ellwood diagnosed no formal psychosis or affective disorder but noted the defendant’s rigidity of thought, elevated hostility towards institutional authority, and demonstrated capacity for strategic deception. Crucially, the report assessed a high risk of recidivism absent robust multi-agency supervision.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nFinancial investigation was a key element in the prosecution case. Cryptocurrency transfers were detected from a wallet registered under an alias connected to Mr H, amounting to approximately £5,400 over 18 months. These transfers corresponded to purchases via darknet marketplaces of dual-use chemicals and specialist equipment. The defendant’s counsel contended the transactions were for academic research purposes; the Crown rejected this, adducing parallel evidence of clandestine communications concerning device construction.  \n\nThe court recognises the increasing challenges posed by financial technology, especially cryptocurrencies, to traditional detection and enforcement models. Lessons from R v. Simmonds [2024] EWCA Crim 567 underscore the need for courts to adapt sentencing practices accordingly, ensuring proportionality while rejecting technical loopholes exploited in the commission of serious offences.  \n\nThe defendant’s behaviour was further scrutinised through closed-circuit television and covert observation. Surveillance footage reviewed by the court depict the defendant visiting a derelict warehouse site late at night on several occasions. The investigative burden to contextualise such activity is endorsed by the court’s awareness of stretched personnel and constraints on covert resource deployment, which for practical reasons dictate reliance on retrospective review rather than real-time response in many instances.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 30 years of age, with a degree in computer science obtained from a regional university. Previous employment included programming positions with two local technology firms, both of which he left within months following episodes of workplace conflict. Letters of character submitted on his behalf attest to his intelligence and occasional creativity but also candidly reference his introversion and difficulty adapting to social environments.  \n\nThe court acknowledges correspondence received from the Birmingham Community Arts Programme, which documents Mr H’s voluntary participation over a six-month period in 2021 in a digital literacy outreach project targeting young people at risk of social exclusion. Such community involvement, whilst commendable, must be weighed against the substantial harm the present offences pose to public confidence and safety.  \n\nIn accordance with prevailing sentencing guidelines and case law, and taking account of mitigating factors such as absence of previous criminal convictions and expression of remorse at a late stage, the court must impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offences and the risk posed to the public.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nProfessor Ellwood’s risk assessment, updated in August 2025, emphasises both the ongoing threat posed by Mr H and the necessity of structured supervision and intervention post-release. The report suggests a combination of custodial sentence with extended licence conditions, including electronic monitoring and engagement with specialist psychological services. Defence submissions that alternative, exclusively community-based measures would suffice are noted but, in the court’s judgment, are insufficient given the nature of the preparation and the evidence substantiating dangerousness.  \n\nThe court is also mindful of the reliance placed upon the report of the probation officer, which discusses the challenges presented by resettlement in the current climate of housing scarcity and suggests that an Approved Premises placement is indicated. It also comments on the current backlog afflicting community mental health teams, which regrettably constrains potential for intensive intervention outside custodial settings. These systemic constraints, while beyond this court’s remit to resolve, punctuate the context in which sentencing decisions are made.  \n\nFinally, it is appropriate to acknowledge those overlooked during proceedings: the local residents who unwittingly live amidst the defendant’s former activities, the civic groups who have sought to engage with him, and the wider public whose safety it is the court’s solemn duty to protect. Their interests rest not only in the imposition of appropriate punishment but also in the prevention of future harm.  \n\nI therefore order the preparation of a pre-sentence report, addressing not only the defendant’s rehabilitative needs but the feasibility of extended supervision measures, appropriate security classification, and access to accredited desistance programmes. The Probation Service is directed to liaise with Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands and relevant mental health providers to assemble a comprehensive risk management plan. This court reserves the question of sentence until receipt and consideration of these materials.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are pronounced today, 2 September 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of sentence. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are applicable. Costs remain reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/27641  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J.
