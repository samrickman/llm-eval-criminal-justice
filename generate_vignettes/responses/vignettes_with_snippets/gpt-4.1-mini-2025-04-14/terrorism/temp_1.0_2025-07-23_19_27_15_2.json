Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/34902  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge S. M. Crowther  \nFiled: 15 November 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct charged covers the period from September 2023 until the defendant's arrest in March 2025.\n\nThe matter has been before this court following a complex investigative process spanning a protracted timeframe and involving numerous agencies. Mr H was initially taken into custody on 19 March 2025 after a coordinated simultaneous raid by Counter Terrorism Policing South West at his known address in Avonmouth. The warrants were executed pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following intelligence obtained through an international liaison channel, involving encrypted communications between the defendant and suspected foreign extremist facilitators. Seized material included encrypted electronic devices, chemical substances later identified as dual-use materials, and a variety of mechanical components capable of conversion into explosive devices.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nThe arrest was a culmination of a multi-jurisdictional operation led by Counter Terrorism Policing South West, which integrated efforts with forensic experts from the National Cyber Crime Unit and the Home Office Centre for Applied Science and Technology. The investigation extended over 14 months, during which the defendant’s activities were subject to covert electronic surveillance, including lawful interception authorised by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office. The disclosure of such materials was staggered over several court hearings, given the sensitive nature of intercepted content and the necessity to balance the duty of open justice with national security interests.\n\nA notable procedural aspect arose following initial remand, where applications were made to delay further proceedings due to specialist forensic analysis of the defendant’s seized digital hardware. Defence applications for independent expert scrutiny were delayed, regrettably, owing to administrative inefficiencies at the Legal Aid Agency, resulting in a postponement of the plea and trial preparation hearing originally scheduled for September 2025. Counsel for the defence, Mr E. L. Hewitt, duly challenged these delays in open court, citing the adverse impact on the defendant’s right to a timely hearing under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court, while sympathising, acknowledged the systemic constraints present within forensic processing capacity nationally.\n\nIt warrants mention that an earlier Prevent referral had been raised in late 2020 by a youth worker at a community centre in Bristol, triggered by Mr H’s distribution of leaflets espousing radical literature. The referral resulted in Channel panel engagement that was discontinued after six months due to perceived lack of sustained risk. That decision must be understood contextually within the evolving guidance and resource availability facing Prevent teams nationally during this period, and no inference as to culpability may be drawn therefrom.\n\nPlea and trial preparation hearings proceeded on 29 October 2025. The defendant persisted in maintaining not guilty pleas until the morning of expiry of the trial period, when he unexpectedly entered guilty pleas to both counts. This late admission of guilt constrains the degree of credit available in sentencing, as was observed in similar cases such as R v. Haywood [2023] EWCA Crim 2681, where last-minute pleas were afforded only limited reductions owing to the stress placed on witnesses and the inefficiencies wrought upon the court system.\n\nIt is an unfortunate commonplace that defendants in complex terrorism matters wait until the evidential noose tightens before conceding guilt. This court is mindful of the guidance in R v. Ainsworth [2021] EWCA Crim 1345, which holds that the timing of a plea is of seminal importance in assessing the extent of sentencing mitigation. Delays in plea flatten the expected saving of court resources and do not sufficiently alleviate the trauma experienced by victims or witnesses.\n\nThis case follows a familiar but onerous procedural trajectory in terrorism prosecutions, which this court approached with the gravity warranted by the subject matter. The enduring pressure on forensic and intelligence units tasked with such investigations is well documented in academic and governmental reports alike, including the Home Office’s “Strategic Review of Counter-Terrorism Resources 2024.” The demands upon digital forensic examiners are compounded not only by volume but by harassment from hostile actors seeking to obfuscate criminal activity through cutting-edge encryption technology.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe defendant maintained at trial a digital platform under an alias which disseminated content that, while ostensibly benign at inception, evolved into a virulent dissemination of extremist propaganda, including manifestos advocating violence against civil infrastructure. The Crown’s case, supported by linguistic analysis conducted by Professor Gillian Meeks, established that the defendant’s writings shared distinctive phraseology with material produced by the proscribed group al-Hurra, notwithstanding defence assertions that the platform was intended as a satirical outlet.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nForensic examination revealed the existence of a hidden volume on Mr H’s primary solid-state drive, employing VeraCrypt encryption utilising a key of substantial complexity. The decrypted contents included schematic diagrams and testing data indicative of improvised explosive device construction, including computational models of blast radius and shrapnel distribution patterns. The defence argued that possession of these materials was consistent with a scholarly interest in materials science, citing acquisition of a university textbook on chemical engineering. The court heard no compelling evidence to support such an innocuous motivation in the context of the defendant’s other conduct.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nAlthough Mr H possessed a valid driver’s licence, unrelated police records disclosed an earlier incident in 2018 involving careless driving and a minor subsequent injury sustained by a pedestrian. This incident, while non-terrorism-related, was referenced during mitigation as illustrative of a regrettable but isolated lapse of judgement in Mr H’s earlier years. There was no suggestion of a pattern of reckless driving or road traffic offences thereafter.\n\nThe court acknowledges the prevailing pressures on public services relevant to this case. The Probation Service’s capacity constraints noted in the West Midlands region, as revealed in the 2024 Inspectorate Report on Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), underscore the demanding environment in which risk is managed post-release. The anticipated supervision plans for Mr H will require meticulous co-ordination to ensure continuity and coherence of care.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nAttention must also be drawn to the defendant’s overseas travel history. Intelligence logs reveal an unfulfilled itinerary to Beirut in late 2024, aborted due to sudden geopolitical instability and subsequent cancellation of flights. This journey was purportedly to attend an academic conference on renewable energy; however, follow-up investigation disclosed encrypted messaging correspondence referencing meetings in southern Lebanon with individuals later identified as supporters of a proscribed organisation. The nexus between legitimate travel and covert engagement is of acute concern in this sector of risk assessment.\n\nThe extensive disclosure schedule prepared in this case included over 600 exhibits, many comprising scanned images of handwritten journals, chemical test results, and intercepted communications. These materials, complex in nature, demanded careful scrutiny by reviewers cleared to handle sensitive intelligence, and compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020 governing sensitive material disclosure was rigorously observed.\n\nA notable feature of this prosecution was the use of covert human intelligence sources (CHIS) deployed in local community settings. Their contributions, detailed in a closed material application, were critical in establishing the defendant’s patterns of association and ideological commitment. While the court cannot elaborate on their identities or precise testimonies, their instrumental role in investigative outcomes merits the fullest acknowledgment of risk incurred.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nThe financial tracing of the defendant’s cryptocurrency transactions disclosed a series of transfers totalling approximately £5,500 to wallets associated with darknet vendors specialising in dual-use electronic components. These payments were conducted via a mixing service, complicating attribution. Forensic accountants assisting the investigation highlighted the challenges presented by cryptocurrency anonymity, reiterating calls for legislative and technological reform in regulatory oversight.\n\nIn a tangential but revealing illustration of resource allocation within modern policing, the review of evidence logs showed that a team of eight digital forensic analysts contributed over 1,200 hours collectively to data extraction and analysis. The costs incurred, both financially and in terms of manpower deployment, underscore the disproportionate burden wielded by relatively low-scale but ideologically motivated offences.\n\nIt is worthy of note that the defendant’s social media activity demonstrated a proclivity to engage with extremist content hosted on foreign platforms, including the Telegram channel “The New Dawn,” which was proscribed nationally in 2023. Communications intercepted showed coordination attempts with other ideologues, though there was no proven substantial link to international terrorist cells.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nThe defendant is 30 years of age, educated to degree level with a background in mechanical engineering. Testimonies from former employers reflect a competent and conscientious worker prior to his abrupt disengagement from the workforce in mid-2023. Letters of support from a local environmental action group, to which Mr H contributed voluntary mechanical repair services, were tendered on his behalf. While these are commendable acts of civic engagement, they do not attenuate the seriousness of the offences for which Mr H has been convicted. Judicial precedent, as encapsulated in R v. Mahmod [2022] EWCA Crim 355, supports the principle that “good character or community service cannot be used as a shield against accountability for grave offences.”\n\nA report from consultant forensic psychologist Dr Jeremy Pond was prepared at the court’s instruction. Dr Pond diagnosed Mr H with no formal psychiatric disorder but noted “rigid absolutist thinking” and a “marked tendency toward ideological extremism.” The risk assessment classified Mr H as presenting a significant ongoing risk of serious harm, especially in relation to terrorist-related offences, absent intensive rehabilitative and supervisory measures.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nThe sentencing exercise must conform strictly to the legislative framework and the guidance promulgated by the Sentencing Council, including the Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (March 2023). The highest weight is accorded to the nature of the defendant’s intent, the preparatory steps undertaken, and the potential scope of harm. Aggravating features include deliberate targeting of mass casualty scenarios and the exploitation of sophisticated technological expertise to facilitate attack planning.\n\nMitigation is limited to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, his educational achievements, and the belated entry of guilty pleas. While such pleas remain entitled to discount under section 144 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the delay significantly restricts its extent.\n\nIn light of the above considerations, the court orders the preparation of a full pre-sentence report by the Probation Service. Particular attention should be devoted to the feasibility and appropriateness of specialist behavioural interventions targeting ideological disengagement, assessment of suitable custodial placements offering high-security risk management, and proposed post-release statutory licence conditions including electronic monitoring and prohibitions on internet usage related to extremist material.\n\nThe court concludes by reiterating the enduring challenge posed by terrorism offences to the justice system, public safety, and social cohesion. It is incumbent upon all agencies involved to maintain vigilant, concerted, and balanced approaches to managing individuals convicted of such offences, balancing rights with responsibilities, rehabilitation with containment.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 November 2025, in Court 9 at Bristol Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal sentencing hearing is scheduled for 5 December 2025, by which time the pre-sentence report will have been furnished to the court. Both parties have been advised of their rights of appeal under sections 108 and 111 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 respectively.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
