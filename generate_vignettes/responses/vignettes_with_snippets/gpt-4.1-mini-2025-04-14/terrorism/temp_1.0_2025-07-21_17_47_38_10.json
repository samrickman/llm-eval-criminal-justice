Mr H  \nCase No. N2025/27643  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. F. CURTIS  \nFiled: 17 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence on charges under sections 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The Crown alleges that the defendant’s activities took place over an extended period from September 2022 until his arrest in late January 2025.\n\nThe initial remand hearing took place on 2 February 2025, at which the defendant was refused bail on the grounds of risk to the public and interference with witnesses. Subsequent hearings were delayed by challenges pertaining to Legal Aid funding authorisations, most notably the grant for expert psychiatric evaluation, which the court understands caused protracted administrative delays in commissioning independent assessment. These delays, while regrettable, did not compromise the thorough disclosure process or the preparation of the defence. \n\nAt the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 15 June 2025, Mr H maintained a not guilty plea. Following the conclusion of the trial on 22 August 2025, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts. The defendant’s initial refusal to accept responsibility delayed proceedings and added to the distress experienced by any victims or witnesses involved. It is well understood that the courts must balance the principle of open justice with the imperative of protecting public safety and victors’ interests.\n\nThe Crown has advanced significant evidence, much of it electronically obtained and subject to complex forensic examination, the detail of which is preserved within the case exhibit schedule. The difficulty posed by the volume and nature of material serves as a reminder of the extraordinary technical challenges facing investigative authorities in the modern era. Those challenges include the containment of encrypted communications, voluminous data processing, and ensuring procedural propriety within the constraints of existing legislation.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nBeyond the particulars of this case, this court is mindful of the historical trajectory of terrorism legislation in the United Kingdom. The Terrorism Act 2006, as enacted following protracted parliamentary debate in the mid-2000s, introduced new offences designed to address evolving threats including preparatory conduct. It amended earlier statutes, notably supplementing the Terrorism Act 2000 provisions, and sought to provide law enforcement with clarified statutory tools to intervene before catastrophic acts could be carried out, balancing civil liberties with national security interests.\n\nThere is jurisdictional authority from R v. Scottish Firearms Trust [2011] EWCA Crim 897, which set out parameters for defining preparatory acts by reference to intention, capability, and proximity to commission. This judgment, while focused on firearms legislation, nevertheless informs the interpretive framework for sections 5 and 57. The approach endorsed is one of careful fact-sensitive analysis to prevent premature criminalisation, yet allowing robust intervention where the evidence so warrants.\n\nThe court further remarks upon the judicial evolution of better case management approaches in terrorism cases, following the Criminal Practice Directions 2015 and subsequent refinements. These procedures are intended to ensure proactive listing and timely exchanges of expert reports, vulnerable witness protocols, and the facilitation of necessary closed-material procedures. The degree of procedural complexity inherent in this case is illustrative, with multiple agencies involved including Counter Terrorism Policing East (CTP-East), the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the East Anglia Forensic Science Hub.\n\nAdditionally, observations might be made concerning the overburdening of forensic digital analysis units nationwide. The National Technical Assistance Centre has openly acknowledged delays reaching six months for device triage, with backlogs compounded by both the volume of devices seized and the growing technical sophistication of encryption and anti-forensic measures. This court applauds the steadfast efforts of dedicated specialists who provide critical evidence despite these systemic pressures.\n\nThe defence, led by Mr Daniel Reeves of counsel, has submitted comprehensive mitigation papers, including character references from Mr H's collegiate rowing club and letters from the Norwich City Community Hub, in which he volunteered prior to 2023. These attest to his previous engagement in local charitable activities but must be cautiously balanced against the seriousness of the offences before the court.\n\nOf note is that Mr H has no previous convictions or formal cautions, a fact that counsel rightly relies upon when arguing for mitigation. Nevertheless, the sophistication of the preparations alleged gives rise to serious concern. The Sentencing Council Terrorism Guidelines 2023 categorise culpability mostly by the degree of planning and the gravity of intended harm, accompanied by an assessment of offender intent and risk of future offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nEvidence adduced included detailed analysis of online platforms used by the defendant, under several pseudonymous accounts, which evolved from postings on general political forums to the sharing of extensively redacted manuals concerning explosive device construction. Linguistic evidence presented by expert witnesses demonstrated patterns consistent with radicalisation trajectories identified in counter-terrorism psychology literature.\n\nWe turn now to the question of related case law on sentencing credit for plea. It is regrettably commonplace in terrorism prosecutions for defendants either to maintain not guilty pleas until trial, or for late change of plea following overwhelming evidence. This strategy, while lawful and often tactically rational, must not be incentivised by undue sentence reductions.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nAs set out above, such late pleas are known to this court to strain the patience of victims and impact public confidence in the justice system. The judgment of R v. Shahzad [2022] EWCA Crim 1342 is instructive: where a plea is entered only late in the proceedings, discount must be proportionate and carefully considered, often no greater than 10 to 15 percent.\n\nThe evidence included retrieval of encrypted archives stored on a wiped external hard drive, cleverly hidden within layers of plausible digital obfuscation, including file-naming conventions designed to mislead casual inspectors. The expertise of forensic cyberanalytic teams was pivotal in untangling the structure and delineating the scope of enumerated materials relevant to the offences.\n\nThe defence sought to argue the possibility of inadvertent possession owing to shared accommodation but failed to satisfy the court that such an excuse was credible in light of the technical complexity of the devices and the focused use patterns identified.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nIt bears emphasizing that possession of similar digital content is not per se unlawful. Indeed, the court recalls the delicate balancing exercise mandated in R v. Fletcher [2017] EWCA Crim 453, where possession was innocent until evidence supported a connection to terrorist purpose. The current case, however, overlays a network of circumstances pointing to a deliberate intention to further extremist objectives.\n\nThe presence among the items of materials relating to chemical compounds and diagrams of incendiary devices, alongside correspondence with individuals linked to proscribed entities, marks this case as exceeding typical passive possession or curiosity.\n\nWhile the case references possession of relatively low quantities of cannabis found in shared premises during search, this factor is not causative or aggravating in respect of the principal terrorism offences. Similarly, an outdated parking fine in 2020 is noted solely to demonstrate the thoroughness of disclosure, without substantive bearing.\n\nIn the present day, the intersection of counter-terrorism and cyber-security presents manifold challenges. The use of virtual private networks, the ephemeral nature of cloud storage, and the spread of encrypted messaging apps with ephemeral message deletion all increase the difficulty for police and intelligence agencies, necessitating increasingly creative investigative approaches.\n\nGeneral concerns regarding street-level antisocial behaviour and rising mild theft offences across Norwich and Norfolk are well documented in local police annual reports but are peripheral to the offence particulars here.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nParticular attention was paid to the defendant’s travel record, including a four-day trip to Amsterdam in October 2023, officially described as tourism. However, intelligence indicated that during this time Mr H attempted to establish meetings via encrypted channels with persons known to hold extremist views abroad. Such contacts were not consummated owing to airline strike action impacting return flights, highlighting the unpredictable interplay between industrial relations and counter-terrorism operations.\n\nThe volume of disclosure material in this case is substantial: over 650 primary exhibits, totalling some 1.2 terabytes of digital data, incorporating chat logs, intercepted emails, and billing records. The work required from Defence was notable, with considerable review needed to ensure compliance with disclosure obligations and to develop a case strategy.\n\nIt must be remarked that the administrative burdens facing the Legal Aid Agency, which have been reported elsewhere in the media and parliamentary inquiries, are manifest in delays affecting the timeliness of defence instructions. This is further exacerbated by the scarcity of qualified digital forensic experts available to civil defence solicitors.\n\nThe process for vetting sensitive material under the Justice and Security Act 2013 was appropriately utilised in this trial, facilitating the disclosure of classified intelligence without jeopardising national security or ongoing operations. The court commends the care taken by all parties in navigating this complex terrain.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nOf particular financial interest is the tracing of cryptocurrency transactions, revealing transfers from wallets controlled by Mr H to vendors regularly associated with supply chains for dual-use items. The court notes with apprehension the twin-edged sword posed by advancements in blockchain technology: whilst offering transparency of ledger entries to forensic authorities, cryptocurrency also offers obfuscation opportunities via mixing services, tumblers, and other privacy-enhancing technologies.\n\nThe defendant’s modus operandi evidenced considerable technical acumen, as demonstrated by the use of ‘burner’ devices and the meticulous deletion of incriminating material across multiple platforms.\n\nIllustratively, a covert surveillance exercise captured Mr H’s brief presence at a riverside location in October 2024, suggestive of reconnaissance, the significance of which was obscured without corroborative evidence. The sheer labour required to analyse such low-resolution footage underscores the substantial resource cost counter-terrorism incurs amid competing priorities, including general crime reductions and public order policing.\n\nThe court is conscious of the unfortunate trend whereby resource-intensive investigations into relatively low-frequency but high-impact threats divert expertise from more widespread community safety challenges, such as rising neighbourhood disputes, vehicle theft, and online fraud.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nTurning now to Mr H’s personal and professional particulars: he is 31 years old, educated to master’s level in materials science. His former employment was with a regional advanced composites firm, where his line manager praised his reliability and technical focus. However, employment ceased in mid-2023 following a review triggered by concerns over unauthorised use of company IT infrastructure to access extremist web material.\n\nCharacter references describe Mr H as “introverted but polite,” with limited social contact beyond immediate family, which includes a younger sibling presently under investigation for unrelated benefit fraud allegations. Such family details, while recorded, have no nexus with the offences or risk posed by the defendant personally.\n\nThe probation service report, commissioned after conviction, was detailed and professionally prepared but recognised limitations due to the defendant’s non-engagement with interview requests.\n\nThe court appreciates the voluntary sector’s efforts, including those of the East Anglia Deradicalisation Project, which offered community mentorship and cognitive behavioural therapy interventions. Engagement, however, was intermittent and largely resisted.\n\nThe defendant’s handwriting in submissions to the court was noted as neat and legible, an inconsequential fact but one reflecting the methodical tendencies confirmed in psychological assessment.\n\nThe modern penal environment’s resource constraints and pressures on mental health provision, including lengthy waits for forensic psychiatric assessment, exacerbate the challenge of managing offenders such as Mr H in the community upon release.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nProfessor Jonathan Langley, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided the principal clinical report, concluding that Mr H shows no formal psychiatric diagnosis but exhibits cognitive rigidity and a proclivity for binary absolutist thinking. The report warns of a high risk of serious public harm if ideological fixation persists unaddressed in the absence of intensive supervision and deterring custodial measures.\n\nThe report supports stringent risk management protocols post-sentence, including consideration of prohibitive licence conditions, GPS monitoring, and mandated programme participation.\n\nThe court is keenly aware of tensions between community cohesion and robust sentencing. The Norwich Multifaith Council submitted observations on behalf of local Muslim and Christian communities, warning against inadvertent stigmatization. The court, while respecting these concerns, must prioritise public safety above all else.\n\nSentencing must be consistent with the principle of proportionality, but also demonstrate unequivocal denunciation of offences threatening national security and public order.\n\nThis case is complicated by the defendant’s clean criminal record and educational attainments, set against a backdrop of sophisticated planning and potential for real harm.\n\nIt occupies a high culpability bracket under the Sentencing Council guidelines, with limited mitigation save for the late pleas and minor civic engagement prior to offending.\n\nThe court orders the compilation of a pre-sentence report to address the potential for specialist interventions, including high-intensity cognitive programmes tailored to ideological disengagement support and an assessment of suitable custodial settings for such treatment.\n\nEngagement with the probation service must incorporate Multi-agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) category 3 oversight, given the assessed ongoing risk.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Norwich. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT NORWICH  \nR v.
