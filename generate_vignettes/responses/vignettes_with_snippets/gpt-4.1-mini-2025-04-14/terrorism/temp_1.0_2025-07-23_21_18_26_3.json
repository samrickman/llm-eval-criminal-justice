Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/29865  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. BRENTWOOD  \nFiled: 10 September 2025  \n\nMr H stands before this court for sentence on two counts under the Terrorism Act framework: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period of offending conduct under consideration spans from March 2023 until his arrest in April 2025.\n\nThe case has been managed through a series of procedural hearings beginning with a preliminary listing on 8 May 2025. Notably, the case endured a short adjournment due to a clerical backlog arising from industrial action in the local judiciary support staff, which delayed the initial allocation hearing by two weeks. Counsel for both the Crown and defence have displayed commendable diligence despite the ongoing stress experienced by court officers owing to staffing shortages nationwide—a phenomenon long lamented in recent Ministry of Justice reports. It is regrettable that such systemic issues cause procedural lengthening, particularly in high-profile terrorism cases that command careful and timely attention.\n\nThe court is conscious that since the establishment of this Crown Court in 1967, its protocols and operational mandates have evolved to meet the demands of an increasingly complex and, on occasion, politically sensitive caseload. It is well known that terrorism cases engage layers of legal instruments, some tracing back to early statutory attempts at suppressing subversive activities in the interwar period and subsequently codified in modern legislation such as the 2000 and 2006 Acts. In this vein, counsel will recall the seminal judgment of R v. Khawaja [2015] UKSC 69, which elucidates the broad remit of terrorist offences, particularly in their preparatory form, emphasizing legislative intent to prevent attacks before catastrophic harm occurs.\n\nDuring this prosecution, extensive investigative efforts were undertaken by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), supplemented by the technological expertise of the National Cyber Crime Unit. These resources were stretched thin, with several parallel investigations involving overlapping operatives and intelligence sharing arrangements. It must be recognised that while such multi-agency cooperation is often lauded, it presents profound management challenges; frequently complex case files are delayed by competing priorities and restricted data access protocols.\n\nThe Legal Aid Agency's role in this matter was also noted, with a plea to improve processing times made on the record by defence counsel. For instance, the grant of authority to instruct an independent internet forensic analyst was delayed by over six weeks due to internal review procedures, corroborating ongoing concerns about funding bottlenecks in serious criminal defence. The judge hopes these remarks may contribute to dialogue around ensuring parity of arms in the adversarial system.\n\nIn the present case, a “Channel” referral was made in late 2021 by Mr H’s college tutor due to his alarming essays that referenced extremist doctrine without critical perspective. The subsequent panel found insufficient evidence to warrant a full Prevent programme intervention. Such decisions, as known from the experience elsewhere, are often finely balanced, taking into account the risk of inadvertently heightening alienation against the opportunity for timely rehabilitation.\n\nA plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 31 July 2025. The initial not guilty plea was maintained throughout pre-trial stages; however, on the first day of trial on 8 September 2025, Mr H altered his plea to guilty on both counts. The timing of this change necessarily limits the credit the court may give for a guilty plea. As repeatedly affirmed in recent appellate jurisprudence—see inter alia R v. Fenwick [2024] EWCA Crim 1028 and R v. Divine [2023] EWCA Crim 876—late pleas reduce the benefits of early acceptance of responsibility, reflecting tactical calculations rather than genuine contrition.\n\nCredit must be cautiously applied. The court recalls R v. Cuthbertson [2023] EWCA Crim 1357 where the appellant’s delayed plea at trial was accorded only limited reduction due to the costs already incurred by the public purse and the burdens placed on witnesses and victims. Similar themes arise in the case of R v. Mallory [2018] EWCA Crim 649 which delineates the principles of plea timing vis-à-vis sentencing adjustments.\n\nTurning to the legal context, the 2023 Sentencing Council Terrorism Guidelines provide a framework which emphasises the gravity of offences under sections 5 and 57 given their potential for indiscriminate harm. The Guidelines mandate that courts consider the level of sophistication, degree of planning, and likelihood of resulting harm when formulating a proportionate sentence. The court must also have regard to the statutory maximum of life imprisonment for these offences.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nIt is relevant to acknowledge that the defendant’s activities were brought to the attention of security services following intelligence inputs revealing his online encryption interactions. The investigative phase involved the coordinated deployment of the National Technical Assistance Centre and a dedicated forensic team specialising in encrypted communications platforms. The body of evidence compiled reflects a substantial commitment of public funds and personnel, underscoring the invasive and resource-heavy nature of such investigations.\n\nOver the course of the investigation, two applications to vary bail conditions were granted, reflective of the competing considerations of preventing flight or interference with evidence versus the presumption in favour of liberty. Counsel and the court recognise how such pre-trial constraints can have profound effects on a defendant’s life and liberty pending final adjudication.\n\nThe court also notes, although peripheral to the main facts, that during the same period, a separate prosecution commenced involving an associate of Mr H who was charged with aggravated burglary after forcibly entering a residential property, an entirely distinct and unrelated offence not attributable to the defendant here. It is a necessary reminder that co-conspirators are subject to individual assessments and sentences irrespective of others’ conduct.\n\nIn preparation for trial, extensive reports were sought and obtained. The primary psychiatric evaluation was delivered by Dr Miriam Fairclough, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose observations provided crucial insights into the defendant’s cognitive and psychological profile. Dr Fairclough noted a history of intermittent depressive episodes, characterised by low mood and social withdrawal, but no diagnosable psychotic disorder or personality disorder. The report correctly observes that while these aspects did not diminish responsibility, they may inform rehabilitative efforts.\n\nThe court further received a supplementary psychological risk assessment by Professor Graham O’Sullivan, a respected academic in forensic psychology, who highlighted Mr H’s tendencies toward black-and-white thinking and identity fusion with extremist narratives. Such characteristics, whilst not uncommon in ideological offenders, present significant challenges for effective disengagement programmes.\n\nThe defence has submitted letters of support from local community organisations, including the East Avon Youth Outreach, attesting to Mr H’s participation in voluntary litter-pick initiatives and a short course on horticulture. While the court recognises the value of pro-social activities, it must emphasise that such involvement is, at best, mitigating only marginally given the gravity of the offences before us.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nThe facts of this case disclose a pattern of conduct that involves the defendant’s use of covert cyber tools to obtain and disseminate materials associated with proscribed organisations. Evidence gathered included intercepted messages indicative of intent, which were corroborated by the seizure of physical paraphernalia suitable for use in producing explosive devices. It is important that the court recalls the caution urged in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 where the United Kingdom Supreme Court held firmly that terrorist activity for sentencing purposes must relate to acts done for the purposes of terrorism as defined in statute, and that the gravity of planning and preparation is immense even prior to actual execution.\n\nPrior to the defendant’s arrest, the authorities conducted extensive surveillance manifesting in multi-angle CCTV captures, busywork analysis, and signal interception. These methods, while invasive, are indispensable tools in counter-terrorism law enforcement, especially given increased public concerns over radicalisation and lone actor extremism. The resources devoted to this investigation, drawn from regional and national assets, are indicative of the serious threat the defendant’s conduct posed.\n\nThe parallels in investigative approach with the case of R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 reinforce the principle that disruption of plots at early stages should not be regarded as reducing culpability but rather as consequence of diligent policing. As Lord Justice Holman stated therein, “The threat envisaged is so grave that the scale of sentencing must reflect both the inherent danger and the necessity to deter others.”\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe detailed digital forensic examination uncovered numerous encrypted folders labelled with innocuous names not linked to extremist content in their titles, but further analysis revealed embedded videos and instructional documents on the manufacture of improvised explosive devices. Defence submissions sought to argue that these downloads represented curiosity akin to academic research on the volatile history of dissent, an argument the court finds wholly unpersuasive in light of contextual evidence.\n\nIn numerous recent judgments, notably R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 405, it has been consistently held that possession of incomplete or partial information does not diminish intent where supporting behaviour demonstrates clear preparation. The defendant’s conduct fits squarely within this doctrine.\n\nIt is also germane to mention the court’s receipt of correspondence from the Barefoot Legal Aid Clinic which noted delays in accessing specialist expert time necessary for evaluating encrypted content. Such delays, while frustrating to all parties, are unfortunately regular features of complex terrorism trials given current resource constraints and should occasion reflection among funding bodies.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nAmong items seized was a small quantity of a home-brewed ale discovered in the shared kitchen premises occupied by Mr H. Defence solicitors sought to highlight this as evidence of a relatively mundane domestic environment. While such detail has creature-comfort resonance, it does not detract from the seriousness of the defendant’s ideological endeavours nor its attendant risk. In a similar vein, a 2018 fixed penalty for minor traffic infringement was canvassed in the defence mitigation but remains irrelevant to sentence severity.\n\nThis brings to mind a recent observation published in the Journal of Criminal Law that criminal prosecutions encompass an extraordinary mix of triviality and gravity, and it is the task of the court to disentangle the two without distraction. The presence of such mundane artefacts hence holds no substantive mitigating value here.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nTravel records show that in autumn 2024, the defendant made a brief sojourn to a Central European city, ostensibly as part of a heritage tour group. However, evidence indicates that Mr H diverted during his stay to attend an unpublicised gathering associated with extremist social networks. CCTV evidence from local transport hubs captured him in the company of a known individual previously convicted of weapons offences in connection with an unrelated arms trafficking case.\n\nIt is to be noted that, contemporaneously, the courts received applications for disclosure of logs relating to similar gatherings. The volume of such cross-border intelligence underscores the transnational nature of terror threats and the imperative for inter-agency collaboration.\n\nThe procedural demands of such intelligence-sharing arrangements merit comment. The court is no stranger to the complexities occasioned by different legal jurisdictions, varying confidentiality standards, and the delicate balance between operational secrecy and disclosure requirements. The Herculean effort invested here suggests a legal system grappling admirably with these challenges, although delays persist.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nFinancial records disclose that Mr H directed a modest cryptocurrency payment—amounting to approximately £3,100—into an online vendor specialising in dual-use chemical apparatus. Forensic finance experts explained that tumblers and crypto-mixing services were utilised to disguise transactional origins, a tactic increasingly observed in funding streams related to illicit activities.\n\nThe court notes a trend articulated in the recent Counter-Terrorism and Finance Report 2024, highlighting the rising use of decentralised assets for procurement and donation in terrorism contexts. While enabling innovation, these technologies pose substantive challenges to regulatory frameworks and enforcement.\n\nBy way of obiter dictum, counsel for the defence contrasted such use with legitimate cryptocurrency enthusiasts who advocate personal financial autonomy. The court accepts the value of technological freedom in principle but must apply the law firmly where such tools facilitate nefarious ends.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nAddressing the defendant’s personal circumstances: Mr H is 31 years old, a graduate of a technical university with qualifications in computer science. He was formerly employed by a small software consultancy, which he left under acrimonious circumstances amidst unclear allegations related to unauthorized data downloads—an episode not criminalised but tending to illustrate personality traits relevant to risk assessment.\n\nThe court has received several character references from volunteering bodies, including the Barton Green Sports Alliance, which attested to his involvement in coaching youth football sessions. Such involvement is commendable for social cohesion but does not counterbalance the considerable threat identified.\n\nAdditionally, letters from family members permitted the court to glimpse a complex relational dynamic. The defendant’s younger sibling is currently subject to investigation for suspected benefit fraud, a matter outside the scope of this case and having no bearing on Mr H’s culpability. Counsel made no submission to suggest any linkage.\n\nThe probation service highlighted serious concerns regarding Mr H’s previously observed disengagement from employment and social isolation—a profile consistent with vulnerabilities exploited in radicalization pathways.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nPsychological assessment submitted includes the report of Professor Elise Hargreaves, forensic psychologist, who notes significant cognitive rigidity and a propensity toward “black and white” moral reasoning frameworks. The report confirms the absence of formal psychiatric illness but underscores persistent risk factors, including entrenched ideological commitment and distrust of counter-terrorism authorities.\n\nProfessor Hargreaves recommends intensive interventions post-sentence, possibly involving structured disengagement programmes coupled with psychological monitoring under Supervised Release Orders. It is plainly apparent to the court that public safety concerns mandate rigorous oversight and robust risk management.\n\nThe defence advocate proposed engagement with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). This court recognises prior evidence of such programmes in the academic literature, yet also notes the challenging attrition rates and the necessity of multi-layered support for sustained behavioral change.\n\nThe court places on record its appreciation for the professionalism and tenacity of the staff at the West Country Deradicalisation Unit and the counter-terrorism liaison officers who collaborated diligently throughout this proceeding. Their work, conducted under considerable operational pressure, often in public anonymity, is vital to the safeguarding of communal security.\n\nThe defendant’s eventual guilty pleas, albeit belated, are acknowledged as a form of procedural cooperation, though the timing curtails the extent of discount applicable. The court is mindful of the strain terrorism prosecutions place on judicial and enforcement resources, as well as the anxiety experienced by affected communities and victims.\n\nThe sentencing exercise will weigh all aggravating factors, including the high degree of planning and intent, sophisticated use of technology, and the likelihood of significant civilian harm but will also take into account the absence of any previous convictions and the personal mitigation advanced.\n\nA pre-sentence report is ordered to be prepared by the Probation Service with input from forensic psychologists, evaluating suitable custodial and rehabilitative options. Consideration should be given to custodial arrangements that permit continuity of specialist therapeutic intervention and structured resettlement planning, incorporating stringent licence conditions tailored to ideological risk management.\n\nIt is further requested that the report explore the feasibility of embedding electronic monitoring, restricted internet access, and polygraph testing as part of ongoing supervision. The court looks for an informed and balanced assessment to assist in the final determination.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are made this day, 10 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction will be lodged with the appropriate criminal justice agencies, and administrative costs reserved accordingly.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.
