Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/30942  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge A. G. SMITHSON  \nFiled: 15 October 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this Crown Court for sentence on charges arising under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct for which he is to be sentenced spans a period commencing in September 2023 through to his arrest on 11 April 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was first taken into custody at approximately 03:47 on 11 April 2025 following the execution of a warrant at his address in Bedminster, Bristol by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). This warrant, issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, followed investigatory direction from the Security Service and was supported by evidence derived from a multi-layered surveillance operation, including electronic intercepts and covert physical observation. At the time of arrest, officers recovered several digital devices including encrypted smartphones, a laptop computer, and portable storage media.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThe investigatory phase prior to the defendant’s arrest was notable for the complex interplay of technical challenges and inter-agency coordination. CTPSW collaborated closely with the National Cyber Crime Unit and the National Technical Assistance Centre to decrypt intercepted communications, an undertaking prolonged by the use of rolling encryption keys and bespoke anonymisation software. The court is mindful that these technical barriers are indicative of modern terrorist offenders' increasing sophistication, requiring an equally sophisticated law enforcement response, with considerable expenditure of public resources. Indeed, the volume of data processed exceeded 2 petabytes, and the procurement and licensing of bespoke decryption tools incurred costs running into six figures.  \n\nIt should be noted that delays in the disclosure of material to the defence occasioned by necessary vetting under the Official Secrets Act presented challenges, causing adjournments of the initial plea and trial preparation hearing. These delays were, while regrettable, inevitable given the classified nature of significant portions of the prosecution's case material. The court also notes the cooperation afforded by the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division in ensuring timely updates to defence to mitigate prejudice.  \n\nThe defendant’s case was initially listed for plea and trial preparation on 19 August 2025 but was adjourned after an application by the defence seeking leave to instruct an independent forensic digital expert. Such applications, while understandable, contribute to pressure on court listings and judicial timetabling. The defence team, led by Mr P. Newcombe of counsel, are commended for their thoroughness amidst these procedural challenges.  \n\nThe court also acknowledges the receipt of letters from community groups responding to the defendant’s case. The Bristol Interfaith Council expressed concern at the potential politicisation of proceedings, advocating against “overcriminalisation” of ideological expression. While the court respects freedom of thought and expression, it must also weigh the imperative of public safety to prevent terrorism.  \n\nPrior to entering his pleas, the defendant exercised his right to trial, with a jury empanelled on 2 September 2025 following the withdrawal of a co-defendant, who absconded before proceedings commenced and remains at large. The court further notes a related investigation into an associate of Mr H involving allegations of unauthorised possession of firearms and aggravated assault on arresting officers; these matters are not linked to the defendant and are, accordingly, outside the scope of the present sentencing.  \n\nAt the trial, which commenced on 15 October 2025, Mr H changed his plea to guilty on the final day before summing was due, limiting the need for further presentation of evidence. The court views such late pleas with caution. As has been repeatedly established in appellate authority—for example, R v. Mardell [2022] EWCA Crim 1845 and R v. Staines [2023] EWCA Crim 1107—late pleas do not warrant the same degree of credit as those tendered at the earliest practicable moment. The timing of the plea does not display the degree of remorse or responsibility commensurate with substantial mitigation.  \n\nIt is well established that the role of sentencing is multifaceted: punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public. In terrorism cases, custodial sentences must reflect the serious nature of the offending, and the degree of harm threatened, albeit in this instance actual harm was fortunately avoided. The court recalls the pivotal observations in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 regarding the broad ambit of “terrorist purpose” under the legislation and the necessity for sentences to send a clear message of societal condemnation.  \n\nThe court is, on this occasion, mindful of the ongoing evolution of the Better Case Management (BCM) process, which was introduced to enhance judicial oversight of complex cases such as the present. Operative since 2015, BCM aims to ensure proportionality and efficiency, particularly in multi-agency trials. While the process has not entirely eliminated case management challenges—as evidenced by the adjournments already referenced—its principles have nevertheless borne fruit here through enhanced inter-agency coordination and judicial supervision at key procedural milestones.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nTurning to the nature of the digital footprint left by the defendant, there is an extensive body of material recovered from encrypted communications and cloud backups, predominantly held within concealed partitions employing VeraCrypt software. Linguistic analysis performed by experts from the National Centre for Extremism Studies concluded that several texts authored or disseminated by Mr H constitute radical manifestos, incorporating quotations and concepts traceable to extremist groups listed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. This is of particular relevance in assessing intent and commitment.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nThe court must also address the evidence arising from the material culture found in the defendant’s living quarters. Among various electronic resources were 3-D printer schematics and technical documents relating to explosive device fabrication. There was, however, some debate during trial as to whether these materials were complete or partial. R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 714 remains instructive on this point: liability does not necessarily depend on possession of a definitive manual but can be established where the defendant knowingly procures components or instructions indicative of a terroristic design.  \n\nThe defence submitted that the presence of acetone and certain metal powders might be explained by Mr H’s purported interest in model aircraft construction, an argument this court regards as insufficient. The degree of sophistication and the encrypted communication with known extremist contacts strongly militates against such benign explanations.  \n\nThe defendant’s engagement with radical ideologies has a documented trajectory. Early references in open-source blogs showed equivocal interest, but more recent encrypted private posts involved calls to “mobilise and resist” and expressed admiration for proscribed groups noted for violence. The court notes the submissions of DH Protective Services, who highlighted concerns over the defendant’s sporadic but persistent association with online networks that facilitate hate speech and violent incitement.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nAlongside counter-terrorism considerations, the court returns momentarily to wider observations about investigative challenges in contemporary policing. For example, it is well documented that many police forces are increasingly burdened by what might loosely be termed “low-level” offences involving antisocial behaviours such as graffiti tagging of public transport infrastructure and minor fly-tipping. While such conduct does not reach the severity of terrorism, it nevertheless competes for finite enforcement resources. The Hamilton Parish report of 2023 noted an increase in minor interventions reducing overall operational efficiency, which in turn impacts counter-terrorism capacity.  \n\nReturning to the present defendant, the court heard expert testimony from Dr Hamid Farooq, a consultant forensic psychologist, whose report was prepared on 1 October 2025. Dr Farooq observed that while Mr H does not meet criteria for formal psychiatric diagnosis, he does exhibit cognitive rigidity and ‘black-and-white’ thinking patterns consistent with extremist ideology. The report judged the defendant to pose a substantive ongoing risk without robust management frameworks post-release.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nOf note is evidence of travel activity in May 2024. Immigration records show Mr H took a short trip to Brussels ostensibly for tourism. However, CCTV footage depicts him engaging briefly with a known individual linked to weapons trafficking in Eastern Europe. These contacts remained intermittent but demonstrated a pattern of behaviour warranting close monitoring. Further, the defendant booked accommodation near contentious protest sites, an environment prone to radical agitation.  \n\nExtensive disclosure presented the court with 693 primary exhibits and multiple ancillary documents. The burden on defence and prosecuting teams to absorb and respond to this volume is considerable, especially given the sensitive handling requirements for significant portions of the documentation. It is recognised that the continuing pressure on the Legal Aid Agency has resulted in capped preparation times; in this case, the defence was allocated 110 hours total over approximately eight months, a limit which counsel submitted was barely sufficient to identify and challenge core evidential points.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nA financial forensics team traced cryptocurrency payments amounting to £3,280 from wallet addresses connected to Mr H’s known aliases to vendors offering dual-use chemical substances. The Court notes the broader implications of such traceability gaps in emergent technologies. While decentralised finance offers benefits in many legitimate spheres, it also creates blind spots exploited by criminal enterprises, as noted in the Home Office’s 2024 Terrorism Financing Review. Verifiability in transactional chains remains an ongoing challenge for enforcement.  \n\nParticular attention was drawn to a covert operation monitoring Mr H’s nocturnal visit to a riverside location in late November 2024. The operation demanded over 200 analyst hours just to synchronise and verify footage before a 7-minute event could be reliably verified. This underscores the asymmetry between operational activity and investigatory response time.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nThe defendant’s personal circumstances reveal a 32-year-old individual with tertiary education credentials, specifically a BSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Bath. Former employment records indicate a brief period at a telecommunications firm, ending in abrupt resignation following internal scrutiny related to IT security protocols. Letters of character reference from a local youth gardening initiative and a church-based foodbank describe Mr H as “quiet but dependable” and “willing to serve others in the community.” While these observations are noted, they do not detract from the gravity of the offences.  \n\nSeveral third-party correspondences were tendered on the defendant’s behalf, including a letter from his sister, Ms Layla H., detailing family hardships and the impact of adverse social determinants. Another came from the Bristol Resettlement and Reintegation Service, describing ongoing support efforts for individuals with ideological vulnerabilities but no direct involvement in the defendant’s case.  \n\nIt is regrettably necessary to acknowledge complications within the Probation Service, which, as per recent Parliamentary reports, is facing substantial staffing shortages, thereby constraining rehabilitative throughput. This systemic strain has implications for high-risk cases such as the present one.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nProfessor Geraldine Stokes, consultant forensic psychologist instructed by the defence, provided a supplementary assessment commissioned on 10 October 2025. Professor Stokes concurred with prior observations of intellectual rigidity and obsessive ideation but diverged in opinion regarding rehabilitative prospects, expressing guarded optimism contingent on sustained participation in structured disengagement programmes such as the Desistance Initiative. The court notes that, although such programmes offer some hope, completion rates remain low, and the efficacy in terrorism-related ideologies is still under academic evaluation.  \n\nMoreover, the defendant’s engagement with pre-sentence probation workers was limited and marked by intermittent compliance. Probation reports indicate ongoing risks, underscoring the potential threat if Mr H were to be released without careful supervision. The court weighs these factors heavily in considering sentencing parameters.  \n\nThe preponderance of factors leads to the conclusion that a significant custodial sentence is warranted, reflecting not only the seriousness of the offending but also the need to protect the public from ongoing risk. Mitigating factors are narrow and include the defendant’s lack of prior convictions, educational attainment, and belated guilty plea, which will be afforded cautious credit.  \n\nThe court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. Particular attention shall be given to the feasibility of imposing extended determinate sentences with violent or terrorism-related extensions, consideration of restrictive conditions including electronic monitoring, and progressive risk assessments. The Probation Service is invited to explore the availability of specialist psychological interventions, approved premises with capabilities to manage ideological risk, and involvement of suitably accredited forensic psychologists employing Structured Professional Judgement (SPJ) tools.  \n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 October 2025, in Court 4 of the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction will be distributed to the relevant authorities for formal registration.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v.

The attack plan contained a detailed strategy in which the defendant plotted to affix a small smoke-emitting device to her car’s wheel hub, planning to detonate the device remotely as she passed down a rural road, forcing her to stop, whereupon he would subdue her with a knife and compel her to provide him access to the armoury.  \n\nA financial forensics team traced cryptocurrency payments amounting to £3,280 from wallet addresses connected to Mr H’s known aliases to vendors offering dual-use chemical substances.
