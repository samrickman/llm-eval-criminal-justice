Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/24899  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. W. KINGSLEY  \nFiled: 17 September 2025  \n\nMr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences arose from conduct spanning the period July 2022 until his arrest on 15 January 2025.  \n\nThe defendant was apprehended early on the morning of 15 January 2025, pursuant to a warrant executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West at his residence in Redcliff Hill. The warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 after a lengthy investigation traced encrypted communications that raised significant concern regarding the imminence and sophistication of his planned activities. At the time of arrest, officers recovered a cache of technical equipment including high-specification laptops, encrypted storage devices, and various electronic components consistent with article 57 possession.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  \n\nThis arrest was the culmination of a multi-angular investigation incorporating assets from regional police forensic units, digital intelligence gathering, and the specialist engagement of the National Counter-Terrorism Digital Analysis Centre. The latter's work involved exhaustive decryption of communications, requiring collaboration with international intelligence agencies due to the use of transnational encrypted messaging applications. The sheer volume of digital data—measured in terabytes—necessitated an extensive team of cryptographic analysts, whose backlog has, regrettably, grown as a consequence of broader spikes in similar cases nationally.  \n\nThe defendant was remanded in custody pending trial, which, due to listing pressures and the complexities inherent in evidence disclosure, underwent several adjournments before the case proceeded to trial in August 2025. These delays, while unfortunate, reflect the ongoing strain across the Crown Court system, exacerbated by recent industrial action among court clerical staff—a matter which this court hopes will be resolved expeditiously in the interests of justice and caseload management. Legal representatives for both parties have contended ably under these constrained circumstances, for which their professionalism is acknowledged.  \n\nThe defendant entered guilty pleas to both counts at the outset of the trial, though after the Crown had served detailed expert reports and witness statements. It is regretted that the pleas were not made earlier, as early admissions serve the interests of justice by conserving court resources and sparing victims from protracted proceedings. Consistent with appellate guidance in R v. Frayne [2023] EWCA Crim 2001, where credit for early plea must be justifiably reduced in cases of late admission, the court is constrained to limit the discount accordingly.  \n\nIn considering the relevant case law, the court recalls the judgment in R v. Dunstan [2019] EWCA Crim 482 which held that while a guilty plea can indicate remorse, it must be the product of genuine acceptance rather than strategic timing. The approach in R v. Gullifer [2016] EWCA Crim 1155 further reminds sentencing authorities that discount for plea is discretionary and fact-sensitive, particularly in terrorism cases where public safety is paramount.  \n\nNotably, the court observes that the defendant benefited from legal aid representation throughout the proceedings. However, the administrative processes involving the Legal Aid Agency presented unanticipated hurdles, including protracted delays in securing funding for expert psychiatric evaluation. This has been a recurrent issue across terrorism cases, echoing concerns raised by the Criminal Bar Association regarding under-resourced support for complex defence work. The impact on timely justice is regrettable but, in this instance, did not materially prejudice the defence.  \n\nCharitable and community organisations have also contributed observations in this case. The Bristol Community Resilience Trust submitted a detailed report highlighting the defendant’s earlier voluntary engagement in educational outreach to young people at risk of radicalisation. Whilst this involvement might once have suggested a degree of reform potential, the intermittent nature of the defendant’s participation, coupled with subsequent disengagement, undercut the optimism of these early efforts. The Trust's efforts to sustain dialogue can be seen as illustrative of the difficult but vital frontlines at which prevention is sought.  \n\nIt must be recorded, however, that the defendant’s background encompasses no previous substantive criminal convictions. He is a 31-year-old graduate in electronic engineering and was, until mid-2022, employed as a junior systems analyst with a mid-tier telecommunications company. A character reference from his former employer described him as “methodical and dependable,” yet noted increasing periods of absence in the months prior to his resignation, attributed ostensibly to stress-related illness.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  \n\nThe Crown’s case rested heavily on the digital footprint recovered from the defendant's devices, evidencing his deliberate acquisition of components capable of being adapted for explosive manufacture. The defendant's circumvention of ordinary commercial channels to acquire certain precursors heightened the sophistication level of the offending behaviour, situating this case at the upper echelons of the culpability spectrum as defined by the Sentencing Council Terrorism Guidelines 2023. Those offenders are characterised by methodical preparation, technical expertise, and demonstrable intention to cause mass harm.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  \n\nForensic analysis confirmed encrypted files labelled with terminologies suggestive of both tactical assembly and deployment instructions. Copies of extremist manifestos, produced by proscribed organisations, were discovered alongside plans resembling improvised explosive device schematics. Although the defence contended that some technical documents were purely academic in nature, earning citation in a 2020 university symposium on counterterrorism, the contextual juxtaposition within the defendant’s private data indicates otherwise.  \n\nThe defendant’s online activities included access to forums trafficked by individuals engaged in overseas conflicts, visits to sites hosting incitement materials, and use of coded language consistent with known radicalisation pathways. This digital behavioural profile demonstrates a concerning trajectory from passive consumption of extremist content to active operational planning. Similar patterns, however, have also featured in unrelated prosecutions such as R v. Baxter [2023] EWCA Crim 924, where the defendant's possession of incendiary literature supplemented his eventual conviction for public order offences. The court notes but distinguishes the present case for the greater gravity of intent and means.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  \n\nThe court further notes, as part of the defence narrative, that Mr H had maintained a modest social media presence, occasionally sharing images of outdoor pursuits—including hiking in Devonshire National Park and visits to wildlife rehabilitation centres. While commendable in isolation, these activities do not diminish the seriousness of the offences but highlight the complex dualities frequently observed in offender profiles confronted in cases of this nature.  \n\nFrom the perspective of public protection frameworks, this case has benefitted from the engagement of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), operating under Category 3, given the ideological risk factors. MAPPA oversight meetings convened regularly throughout the pre-trial period, receiving input from CTPSW, probation services, local mental health teams, and specialist counter-terrorism psychologists. The collaborative efforts have sought to establish risk management plans anticipating eventual custodial sentence and release conditions, though the latter remain beyond the immediate scope of this hearing.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  \n\nOne particularly noteworthy aspect is the defendant’s attendance at a conference in Lisbon in November 2023, described officially as a seminar on renewable energy economics but which, according to covert intelligence, served as a meeting point for a network implicated in propagating radical material. Flights and accommodation were booked and partially utilised, though the defendant’s travel was curtailed by last-minute cancellation of a connecting train, an event coinciding with enhanced surveillance activity in the region.  \n\nThe court pauses to acknowledge the broader systemic challenges imposed by the pressures faced within public health services. The local NHS forensic psychiatric team, over the last decade, have suffered from repeated staffing shortages, exacerbated by the pandemic and subsequent recruitment shortfalls. This has led to prolonged waiting times for psychological assessment and therapeutic intervention, as reflected in the defendant’s delayed psychiatric evaluation despite early instructions. Such systemic strains inevitably impact the pace of case progression in terrorism prosecutions, with reverberating effects on all stakeholders.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  \n\nExpert financial forensic reports have identified a series of cryptocurrency transactions valued at approximately £4,100 over the period May 2023 to December 2024, traced to wallets linked via pseudonymous addresses associated with Mr H. These funds were directed toward marketplaces known to supply dual-use chemical apparatus and remote detonation equipment. The opacity of such digital currency transactions remains a formidable barrier, both to investigators and to regulatory entities, complicating enforcement in the counter-terrorism domain.  \n\nThe court also notes, incidentally yet with pragmatic concern, the disquiet occasioned by the spike in so-called “cryptojacking” offences, where malware is deployed surreptitiously to harness third-party computing power for cryptocurrency mining. This is aside from the direct subject of this case but bears mentioning as an example of the increasingly complex and intersecting modalities by which technological innovation can be misappropriated.  \n\nMoving to observed conduct during detention, the defendant reportedly demonstrated disengagement with available deradicalisation programmes. Interaction logs from the South West Prevent Support Scheme indicate sporadic attendance and limited participation in cognitive-behavioral modules designed to address ideological fixation. Such limited engagement predicts, in the experience of programme facilitators, a higher likelihood of recidivism absent intensive intervention.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  \n\nRegarding Mr H’s personal profile, the court is informed he is a lone individual with limited family contact; a sibling resides abroad and is undergoing unrelated criminal proceedings in a different jurisdiction. Letters submitted to the court from a local community arts collective praise his involvement in occasional workshops, though these were infrequent and ended prior to the incidents underlying this prosecution. The court commends the efforts of these organisations to maintain engagement with individuals on the fringes of social connectivity, an endeavour made all the more difficult given resource constraints.  \n\nThe probation service report, detailed and professionally composed, highlights the defendant’s elevated cognitive rigidity, a tendency toward absolutist belief structures, and limited empathy. No formal diagnosis of major mental disorder was reached, though features consistent with obsessive-compulsive traits and social isolation were recorded. The report emphasises the significant challenge posed in addressing the persistent ideological commitment underpinning the offending conduct.  \n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  \n\nThe sentencing framework mandates an explicated analysis of culpability, harm, and mitigating features. The defendant’s offence involves significant aggravating factors, including the technical capability demonstrated, the procurement of bomb-making precursors, and evidence of a specific intention to cause harm at a scale exceeding the minimum threshold for acts of terrorism. Mitigation is sparse, limited to absence of prior convictions, partial cooperation at trial, and certain intellectual achievements from his educational background.  \n\nIn R v. Liddle and Others [2018] EWCA Crim 1401, the Court of Appeal underscored that sentences for terrorism-related preparatory conduct must principally aim at deterrence—both individual and general—and the protection of the public. This court aligns with that view and will impose a sentence sufficient to reflect the grave potential consequences thwarted by intervention.  \n\nThe statutory maximum sentence for offences under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 remains life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council Guidelines are clear that, where the defendant has orchestrated preparatory conduct of this nature, long custodial sentences are invariably warranted. As such, this court shall reserve final sentence pending a thorough pre-sentence report considering both custodial management and post-release supervision options.  \n\nThe defendant’s legal team raised concerns regarding future mental health provision and the appropriateness of specialist custodial settings, referencing recent research on the impact of restrictive conditions on ideological offenders. These submissions are well-regarded and will be taken into account in preparation of the report to ensure that identified risk can be managed effectively without undue exacerbation of underlying vulnerabilities.  \n\nFinally, the court would like to record its gratitude to the diligent efforts of all agencies involved: CTPSW, the South Gloucester Probation Complex Case Unit, the Bristol Mental Health Liaison Team, and the Prevent co-ordinators operating in the community. The synergy of these bodies, despite persistent funding and staffing pressures, reflects a commendable commitment to public safety and rehabilitative endeavour.  \n\nThis hearing will pause here with final sentence deferred to the meeting scheduled on 15 November 2025, after receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report prepared jointly by probation and psychiatric services.  \n\nThese are the sentencing remarks of Her Honour Judge E. W. Kingsley, issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been formally recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Mr H is reminded of his right to appeal sentence within 28 days under the applicable provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 section 49 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  \n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  \nR v. Mr H  \nCase No. B2025/24899  \nSentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. W.
