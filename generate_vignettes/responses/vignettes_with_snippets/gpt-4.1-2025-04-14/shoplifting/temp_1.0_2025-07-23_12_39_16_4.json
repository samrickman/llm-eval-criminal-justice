MR H  \nCase No. R2025/14582  \nSentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. S. RIDLEY  \nFiled: 19 September 2025\n\nMr H, you appear before this court for sentence having pleaded guilty to a single count of theft from a shop, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, charged on the indictment as a representative offence reflecting a course of acquisitive conduct occurring between 15 March and 28 April 2025 across retail premises in the Shirehampton district and greater Avon area.\n\nAt the outset, I acknowledge the attendance of Ms Juliette Forbes for the Crown, and Mr Nicholas Aran for the defence, under the current Legal Aid contract arrangements. The court further recognises the attendance of Ms Charlotte Raj, who appears pursuant to a Victim Support Services notice under the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime, and has been instrumental in the collation of recent impact statements. I extend my appreciation to all for the professionalism with which these proceedings have been conducted.\n\nI turn first to matters of procedural history. The defendant’s initial arrest occurred on the evening of 29 April 2025, following a multi-site identification operation coordinated by PC Kenworthy of Avon Community Police and security personnel affiliated to the Shirehampton Retail Watch Partnership. Your detention was subsequent to a review of incident logs submitted by several participating businesses—logs that, it must be noted, reflected an increase in repeat acquisitive offending within the district over the preceding four-month period. Charges were authorised at 9:15 am on 30 April pursuant to the Director’s Guidance on Charging (6th ed.), and you were produced at Shirehampton Magistrates’ Court later that day.\n\nIt must be observed that the matter was transferred expeditiously to this court following the preliminary plea and allocation hearing on 3 May. The application of the Better Case Management Protocol was, in this instance, largely effective. I note the cooperation between the local Police Case Progression Unit, the business crime coordinator at the Crown Prosecution Service, and various retail representatives, who collectively ensured that full evidential bundles were before me at the first Crown Court listing. Such concerted action is regrettably not always the norm, and I record the court’s appreciation.\n\nNevertheless, it would be remiss to proceed without reference to the earlier delays: specifically, the adjournment necessitated by the late arrival of pre-sentence psychiatric and probationary reports. That adjournment—ordered on 5 August after the trial management hearing—was, in part, a result of the now persistent backlog in the allocation of Probation Service resources, compounded by ongoing industrial action within the National Clerks’ Association. Indeed, it is a truism that the procedural wheels of justice grind slowest where cases, though legally modest, are institutionally undervalued.\n\nIn the interim period, I also received correspondence from the Law Centre at Shirehampton, highlighting concerns regarding the impact of repeated retail thefts on community sentiment and business resilience. While these broader concerns do not bear directly on your culpability, they form an element of the court’s broader awareness, particularly in light of heightened public anxiety regarding street-level disorder in the city’s shopping precincts.\n\nObservation was further made of the strain experienced by local authority Housing Support officers, who, in addition to their primary remit, are frequently required to liaise with criminal justice agencies in cases of persistent low-level offending. The repeated interface between housing and criminal justice systems is an established, if inefficient, feature of contemporary casework; it often results in structural gaps in support where each service, acting in assumed isolation, fails to account for the full spectrum of disadvantage faced by defendants such as yourself.\n\nFor the record, this case forms one of several on the court’s current docket involving repeated engagement with statutory and voluntary sector agencies. I particularly wish to acknowledge the timely intervention of the Shirehampton Community Outreach Trust and the input from Ms Yasmine Jarrett and her small but tireless team of support workers at Shelterwise. Although the impact of their engagement on you, personally, has—at best—been limited, the materials they have provided are nonetheless revealing of wider systemic pressures.\n\nLet me also address, albeit briefly, the recurring issue of Legal Aid Agency responsiveness. In this matter, Mr Aran’s request for the authorisation to instruct Dr Ann Murphy, Chartered Forensic Psychologist, was initially deferred due to incomplete digitisation of his representation order. That delay, which postponed the timely preparation of expert materials until after the close of standard reporting timelines, is symptomatic of a system that, chronically undercapitalised, relies on the dedication and goodwill of practitioners rather than any reliably administered central process. Such procedural bottlenecks must not become tacitly accepted features of the criminal justice landscape.\n\nFurther, this matter was twice disrupted by the late or non-arrival of interpreter services for the hearing-impaired, notwithstanding previous judicial directions. I note that, in the end, all parties consented to proceed through the provision of written transcriptions contemporaneous with the oral proceedings. This minor but telling inconvenience reiterates the resource constraints under which all participants now operate.\n\nI draw upon the analysis contained in Dr Murphy’s comprehensive psychiatric report, dated 21 August, which—though not determinative of culpability—identifies chronic and untreated affective disorder traits manifesting as situational impulsivity, low threshold for frustration, and episodic reliance on alcohol as a form of self-medication. Dr Murphy is careful to observe that these symptoms, while contributing to your personal and social difficulties, fall short of the threshold for a M’Naghten defence or for the principal statutory disposals contemplated under section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983. There are no current grounds for consideration of a hospital order.\n\nThe adjacent pre-sentence report, prepared by Probation Officer Malik, identifies an entrenched pattern of instability involving short-term accommodation, dependency on subsistence benefits, lack of social support, and only intermittent engagement with employment or skills programmes. While acknowledging complexity, the report is clear: your willingness to access or cooperate with available support structures has been, in the author’s view, markedly inconsistent and, at times, actively avoidant.\n\nBefore I turn to the individual facts of your offending, it is appropriate to situate those acts within the framework established by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences (shop theft), revised January 2022. That guidance stipulates, inter alia, that persistent targeting of small businesses, psychological distress to staff, repeated conduct over a sustained period, and a failure to respond to previous out-of-court disposals or formal warnings may — in combination — place the offence within the higher culpability and greater harm categories. The guidance, it is worth noting, continues to stress the difference between an isolated act committed through momentary lapse and conduct sustained by intent, opportunity, and disregard for repeated warnings.\n\nTurning to analogous case law, I draw attention to R v. Marsh [2024] EWCA Crim 1468, which involved a defendant with multiple prior theft convictions who targeted independent convenience stores. There, the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence towards the upper end of the range, referencing the deleterious impact on urban high streets and the psychological toll upon often minimum-wage staff. While Marsh is not analogous in every detail, the principle that repeat, deliberate conduct is especially serious remains germane.\n\nContrastingly, I note R v. Ormond [2021] EWCA Crim 2125, a prosecution for aggravated burglary at a residential address in east Bradford. In that matter, the accused forcibly entered the dwelling during a family celebration, threatened occupants with a kitchen implement, and made off with electronic goods. The Court of Appeal concluded, not uncontroversially, that the trauma inflicted by home invasion demands an uplifted sentence even when violence is minimal. I refer to Ormond only for completeness — not because its factual matrix aligns with yours, but to reflect evolving judicial thought on the gradations of harm and invasion.\n\nReturning to the present matter, the court is in receipt of written victim statements from managers at three separate premises: “Holloway’s Chemist,” “Price Savers Express,” and “Parrett Grocers.” Each recounts the cumulative distress engendered by ongoing security worries and the demoralising effect upon staff obliged to endure repeat interactions with persistent offenders. In many respects, the harm radiates beyond the strictly financial.\n\nAt the case management hearing on 7 August, the prosecution alluded to statistical analysis provided by the Avon Retail Partnership, documenting a marked increase in repeat retail thefts since the spring quarter. The linkage, if any, between case volume and reductions in uniformed police patrols is speculative but unproven — the dataset being, as ever, incomplete. The effect on local insurer premiums, however, is not in doubt; it has been confirmed via local Chamber of Commerce disclosures that excesses for theft-related claims rose by an average of 14% in the corresponding period. While these details are peripheral to sentence, they form part of the factual backdrop within which this offending must be assessed.\n\nThe court is also in possession of recent correspondence from the family of your co-resident, Mr T, who, I stress, is not before this court and whose own alleged involvement in unrelated offences (including benefits misuse and a reported incident of criminal damage to a public bus shelter on 15 February) is not a matter for current consideration. Decisional clarity must not be clouded by associative inferences. For the avoidance of doubt, I make no findings on matters outside the charge.\n\nSimilarly, the defence has filed a bundle referencing your former partner’s long-standing mental health difficulties, but this is relevant principally to mitigation rather than culpability in the present case. She is not before the court, nor are her conduct or circumstances germane to the lawfulness of your own.\n\nA brief word about supporting institutions. I particularly commend the enduring service of St Cuthbert’s Day Centre, whose staff continue, despite relentless caseload pressures and dwindling funding, to provide basic amenities, signposting, and welfare advice to individuals with complex support needs. Their representations in this matter are, as so often, balanced and devoid of sentimentality; they neither exonerate nor vilify, but offer practical accounts of the challenges experienced by those at the intersections of poverty, addiction, and insecure housing.\n\nBefore setting out the facts, I remind the parties of the precedent established in R v. Funaki [2022] EWCA Crim 1831, a complex case originating in the Southampton Crown Court, where the defendant was convicted of importation of Class A drugs by concealment in shipping parcels delivered through a legitimate freight operator. The court there clarified the limitations on the use of intercepted correspondence in mitigation — a point moot to the present matter, but a useful re-emphasis of the principle that mitigation cannot encompass claims unsupported by admissible evidence.\n\nAs to the sequence of hearings, I note that the original sentencing hearing was listed for 29 August but, as previously indicated, was postponed in view of the unavailability of Dr Murphy due to her involvement as lead witness in the Croftford cyber fraud trial, which produced its own delays following disruption caused by a fire alarm and subsequent forced evacuation of that courthouse. That arson, it is to be observed, is under separate investigation and has no bearing on this proceeding, though it is illustrative of the unpredictable nature of courtroom administration in the current climate.\n\nProceedings today are observed by members of the public, representatives from the Avon Safe Retailers Forum, and legal trainees from the University of Bristol with leave of the court. I record for the transcript that no media are present and no special reporting restrictions apply. Counsel were given the opportunity to object, but none did so.\n\nI have also received by email a brief but well-crafted letter from your aunt, Ms Geraldine H, expressing her continuing concern for your health and well-being and her hope that the court will balance accountability with opportunity for support. I recognise the measured tone of her words and note the practical support she has offered.\n\nHaving traversed the background, I now move to the facts of your offending.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.\n\nGiven the limited salience placed on defendant handwriting in such matters, I nonetheless observe — for completeness — that your statement to the court is both legibly written and cogently formatted, reflecting some ability to communicate effectively when so inclined.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.\n\nIt is an aggravating feature of this case that your actions have contributed, cumulatively, to the withdrawal of late evening staffing at one of the retail premises affected. Testimony from Ms Lorna Edelman, manager at Price Savers Express, details her decision to limit shift overlap after two separate incidents, notwithstanding the additional operational cost. This necessity, she writes, is one that “undermines morale and makes recruitment for entry-level roles more challenging.” Such evidence is not strictly about you, but goes to the broader climate.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.\n\nThough no violence or threats were alleged in this matter, staff at the premises have provided statements describing a pervasive atmosphere of wariness, with particular concern expressed for colleagues required to close alone in the evenings. This court must consider such impacts as part of the real harm produced by repeat low-level crime.\n\nMoving from facts to relevant context, the court is invited to consider the guidance in R v. Denholm [2023] EWCA Crim 793, an appeal originating from a prosecution for possession of a bladed article in a school car park. While Denholm obviously does not align factually with the present case, the Court there emphasised that persistent, context-specific offending (be it carrying knives or systematic targeting of vulnerable settings) can justify adjustments in sentencing approach, especially where public confidence in community safety is at stake.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.\n\nA point ever more pressing is the proper role of public and charitable resources in addressing the root causes of repeat offending. I have been provided with a short statement from Ms Rupa Mathur, social worker, commenting on the continuing “churn” of referrals for individuals in your profile to alcohol recovery services without meaningful outcome. That Ms Mathur’s team are able, with such limited tools, to prevent many further escalations is a tribute to their commitment. But, as her letter makes clear, resources are already deployed to breaking point.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.\n\nProsecution has placed before the court a summary of your prior record, spanning two convictions for theft in 2021 (pharmacy goods and cosmetics), both then disposed by way of community orders, and one out-of-court caution for attempted theft in May 2022. Attempts made by Avon Restorative Justice Service to engage you in dialogue with affected retailers did not, on the balance of evidence, result in sustained participation — a matter further explored in Mr Malik’s pre-sentence report.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.\n\nAt this juncture, I wish to acknowledge, though only for the record, the Crown’s reference (at the directions hearing) to the case of R v. Halliday [2019] EWCA Crim 2219, which entailed the theft of medical supplies from a hospital stockroom. That matter, quite distinct from the facts of your case, nonetheless offered useful dicta on the limitations of diversion schemes where the subject repeatedly fails to maintain engagement or relapses into further offending. I make no further observation other than to note the parallel.\n\nI am also in receipt of a statistical analysis provided by the Avon Community Statistics Unit, suggesting an upturn in notifiable retail theft across the Avon area in the first two quarters of 2025. Comparative data — drawn, somewhat incongruently, from a concurrent period in 2015 — is cited, but with the caveat that changes in reporting practice render direct comparison difficult. I simply note the analytic context as part of the court’s general situational awareness.\n\nA further, and wholly extraneous, submission was made by the defence concerning allegations against your previous landlord, Mr Linney, who is, I am told, the recent subject of a local authority investigation into noise abatement notice infringements. That process is ongoing and does not relate in any direct or indirect sense to the conduct before this court.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.\n\nIt is also not irrelevant to observe that, according to the Crown’s case summary, staff at Holloway’s Chemist report feeling “exhausted and demoralised” — a sentiment revealed during a recent risk assessment undertaken as part of their annual insurance review. While security screens have now been installed, it should not fall solely to small businesses to bear the cost of offence prevention.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.\n\nTurning briefly to sentencing considerations, I reiterate for the transcript that while your lack of physical violence is a mitigating feature, it does not detract from the sustained nature of your offending nor the harm caused to the professional and emotional well-being of those affected. Your assertion of financial stress is understood, but you have persistently declined engagement with various forms of available assistance — including, but not limited to, budgeting clinics, employment-skills services, and substance misuse support coordinated through the Local Referral Unit. That is not, as some might claim, indicative of system failure alone, but of personal refusal to cooperate with measures designed to support your reintegration.\n\nI am aware of your ongoing housing difficulties, in particular your placement in semi-supported accommodation subject to review by local authority housing officers. You are 39 years old and have experienced intermittent periods of rough sleeping. Your current risk assessment places you at moderate risk of reoffending, and at low risk of serious harm to others. You have limited family support — your only local relative, your grandmother, is resident in a care facility and unable to participate in these proceedings.\n\nAs to the future, I instruct probation to prepare a full pre-sentence report considering all available options, to include — where appropriate — restorative justice pathways, attendance at a Cognitive Skills Programme, rehabilitative activity requirements, and requirements addressing substance misuse. I direct that particular attention be paid to the question of realistic compliance given your prior failures of engagement.\n\nIt would be remiss not to include, for completeness, reference to the often-cited R v. Mawson [2023] EWCA Crim 1020, a matter concerning the abstraction of copper cabling from infrastructure at the Kingsway Rail Depot. While the conduct in Mawson consisted of offences unrelated to yours and involved an entirely different sphere of risk, the observations therein as to economic impact and risk of systemic disruption are, at best, of thematic interest to this court. I make no finding as to relevance beyond mere illustration.\n\nI close with a reiteration that the public interest in this matter is not served by custodial disposal for its own sake, nor by uncritical recourse to community sentences which have thus far failed to produce any evident reduction in your offending. The question for the court, on receipt of the promised pre-sentence report, will be whether any realistic avenue for rehabilitation is available — and, if so, under what structure of supervision and sanction. Final sentencing is therefore adjourned pending that assessment.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Shirehampton on this day, 19 September 2025. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with the requirements of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020, Part 5. All parties are reminded that the court retains the power to revisit any ancillary orders and to make further directions at the sentencing hearing. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days of final sentence in accordance with the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SHIREHAMPTON  \nR v.

This necessity, she writes, is one that “undermines morale and makes recruitment for entry-level roles more challenging.” Such evidence is not strictly about you, but goes to the broader climate.\n\nAcross three weeks, Mr H visited the same small retailer four times, stealing alcohol and tobacco on each occasion.\n\nThough no violence or threats were alleged in this matter, staff at the premises have provided statements describing a pervasive atmosphere of wariness, with particular concern expressed for colleagues required to close alone in the evenings.

While security screens have now been installed, it should not fall solely to small businesses to bear the cost of offence prevention.\n\nMr H acknowledged to police that he regularly steals, believes it’s just taking what he needs and has no intention of stopping.\n\nTurning briefly to sentencing considerations, I reiterate for the transcript that while your lack of physical violence is a mitigating feature, it does not detract from the sustained nature of your offending nor the harm caused to the professional and emotional well-being of those affected. Your assertion of financial stress is understood, but you have persistently declined engagement with various forms of available assistance — including, but not limited to, budgeting clinics, employment-skills services, and substance misuse support coordinated through the Local Referral Unit. That is not, as some might claim, indicative of system failure alone, but of personal refusal to cooperate with measures designed to support your reintegration.\n\nI am aware of your ongoing housing difficulties, in particular your placement in semi-supported accommodation subject to review by local authority housing officers. You are 39 years old and have experienced intermittent periods of rough sleeping. Your current risk assessment places you at moderate risk of reoffending, and at low risk of serious harm to others. You have limited family support — your only local relative, your grandmother, is resident in a care facility and unable to participate in these proceedings.\n\nAs to the future, I instruct probation to prepare a full pre-sentence report considering all available options, to include — where appropriate — restorative justice pathways, attendance at a Cognitive Skills Programme, rehabilitative activity requirements, and requirements addressing substance misuse. I direct that particular attention be paid to the question of realistic compliance given your prior failures of engagement.\n\nIt would be remiss not to include, for completeness, reference to the often-cited R v. Mawson [2023] EWCA Crim 1020, a matter concerning the abstraction of copper cabling from infrastructure at the Kingsway Rail Depot. While the conduct in Mawson consisted of offences unrelated to yours and involved an entirely different sphere of risk, the observations therein as to economic impact and risk of systemic disruption are, at best, of thematic interest to this court. I make no finding as to relevance beyond mere illustration.\n\nI close with a reiteration that the public interest in this matter is not served by custodial disposal for its own sake, nor by uncritical recourse to community sentences which have thus far failed to produce any evident reduction in your offending. The question for the court, on receipt of the promised pre-sentence report, will be whether any realistic avenue for rehabilitation is available — and, if so, under what structure of supervision and sanction. Final sentencing is therefore adjourned pending that assessment.\n\nThese sentencing remarks are issued in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Shirehampton on this day, 19 September 2025.
