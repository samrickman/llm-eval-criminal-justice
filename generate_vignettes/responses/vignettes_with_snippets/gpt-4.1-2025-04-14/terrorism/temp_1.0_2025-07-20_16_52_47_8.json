Mr H  \nCase No. S2025/33109  \nSentencing Remarks of His Honour Judge W. I. MARKHAM  \n11 August 2025  \n\nMr H, you appear before the court for sentence having entered guilty pleas on 3 July 2025 to two counts on the indictment: one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of collecting information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 58 of the 2000 Act. The period of offending spans approximately twelve months from April 2024 until your arrest on 2 May 2025.\n\nThe criminal process in this matter has been protracted. The investigation known as Operation STONEVETCH was initiated in late May 2024 following a tip-off to the South Yorkshire Counter Terrorism Unit from an online hosting provider concerning repeated access to encrypted communications forums hosting material associated with proscribed organisations. Following inter-agency consultation—specifically with the region’s Prevent Agenda panel and the Intelligence Fusion Cell—a coordinated surveillance operation was undertaken. The involvement of the Technical Exploitation Unit (TEU) was necessitated by the sophistication of data encryption used by the subject. As is almost always the case in contemporary terrorism investigations, the volume and technical complexity of digital material presented a heavy procedural burden and contributed to multiple adjournments in the litigation’s early phases.\n\nOn 2 May 2025, officers acting under warrant pursuant to section 43B of the 2000 Act executed a search of the second-floor bedsit at 118 Wainsgate Terrace, Smithfield. Mr H was found in his room at the time, seated at a desk beside three monitors and a partially disassembled quadcopter drone. The search yielded multiple encrypted USB drives, a laptop, printed schematics, and an unopened package addressed to “B. Jarratt”—later found to be a known alias. The warrant’s execution was the culmination of persistent, resource-intensive tracking, both physically and online, and would not have been possible but for the timely authorisation of cross-jurisdiction data warrants.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}\n\nIt was further noted by Detective Inspector Falco, in his evidence, that the arrest itself was delayed by two days owing to a technical issue with the forensic imaging kit supplied by the Digital Evidence Recovery Team, an issue which required the intervention of contracted technical support at public expense. This operational kink, though frustrating, is neither unusual nor, in the court’s view, indicative of bad faith on the part of investigators, but does draw attention to the under-resourcing of forensic functions—a recurring motif in the contemporary justice context.\n\nA procedural chronology is warranted. The initial hearing at the Magistrates’ Court on 3 May 2025 resulted in the remand of the defendant into custody; bail was refused by District Judge Chowdhury on grounds both of flight risk and public protection, supported by a detailed MAPPA 3 referral note. The first Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing in the Crown Court was listed for 15 May 2025. Due to late service of digital forensics reports and the unavailability of Mr H’s instructed counsel—engaged at the Court of Appeal on a fraud matter—this hearing was adjourned and relisted for 10 June. Substantive defence submissions were not received until 17 June, a delay ultimately occasioned by the necessity to secure secure messaging clearance from the National Law Enforcement Data Facility.\n\nThe Crown’s evidence included extensive extracts from digital devices, witness statements from law enforcement and neighbours in the Smithfield area, and expert opinion from Dr Petra Olson, Associate Professor of Computer Forensics at Sheffield Hallam University. Dr Olson’s report, while not contested in its conclusions, was subject to five supplementary requests for clarification by the defence, each resulting in further disclosure and corresponding delay.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}\n\nSeveral adjournments proved unavoidable, the most significant being on 21 June when a national IT outage affecting the Secure Digital Evidence Transcription Portal rendered the relevant exhibits inaccessible to both parties and the court. That this episode occurred amidst ongoing judicial complaints regarding the migration to the Portal is perhaps unremarkable; it remains regrettable that such incidents disrupt both casework and the confidence of those obliged to serve within the system.\n\nIt is noted for the record that the defence was further impeded by a Legal Aid Agency error, which, due to a misapplied means test in May 2025, resulted in a temporary suspension of Mr H’s legal aid certificate. This was not rectified for thirteen days despite repeated representations by Mr Donnell, Mr H’s assigned solicitor. The resulting hiatus in case preparation, while not materially altering the outcome, serves to illustrate persistent administrative fragility.\n\nThe court is bound to address the regrettable but frequent delays occasioned by the current state of the legal aid administration. Instances of delayed renewal, uncertain guidance on the scope of “special preparation” fees, and the inconsistent approach to funding for technical expert evidence continue to be a source of frustration for the defence and the bench alike. These bureaucratic obstacles are not merely irritating: they risk undermining procedural fairness, particularly in cases of this seriousness where disclosure and analysis of complex digital evidence is both indispensable and costly.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}\n\nThe principle considerations for sentence in terrorism matters are well established by both statutory parameters and a substantial body of appellate authority. The Sentencing Council’s 2023 Guideline on Terrorism Offences requires an assessment of culpability by reference to the sophistication of preparatory conduct, the level of commitment, and the proximity to implementation. In R v. Kahar & Ors [2016] EWCA Crim 568, the court observed that the gravity of terrorist offending demands a sentencing approach that prioritises deterrence and public protection over personal mitigation, save in the most exceptional circumstances. It is further underscored, in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, that the statutory definition of “terrorist purpose” is to be construed broadly, and that the court’s focus must be on the risk posed rather than the subjective likelihood of success.\n\nA number of authorities were canvassed in pre-trial submissions concerning the appropriate discount for guilty pleas in terrorism cases, particularly where pleas are entered late in proceedings. I am guided by the analysis in R v. Blackstone [2024] EWCA Crim 2047, which concerned a series of explosions outside commercial premises in West Midlands. There, the plea of guilty was entered on the final day before trial after the exclusion of key evidence; the court limited credit to 12 percent, emphasising that late acceptance of culpability does little to conserve public resources or to reduce the burden on victims and witnesses.\n\nIn R v. Greystone [2022] EWCA Crim 1489, an aggravated burglary involving violence and the occupation of a family home during the early hours of the morning, the Court of Appeal confirmed that pleas entered for tactical reasons do not attract full credit. Mr Greystone, in that case, persisted in a not guilty stance for eight months, only offering a plea after the prosecution ruled out his main line of defence related to forensic evidence. Only after the scheduled jury was empanelled did he admit guilt, resulting in two further days of judicial resources expended unnecessarily. The reduction in sentence reflected not only the lateness but the absence of remorse indicated by his conduct. Whilst Mr H’s offending is of a different and more serious kind, the general principle on plea credit is instructive.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}\n\nThe factual matrix of Mr H’s offending, though distinct in its terrorism context, draws some procedural parallels with the circumstances described in R v. Baildon [2023] EWCA Crim 909, a matter relating to the importation of large quantities of cocaine disguised as automotive chemicals. In that matter, detailed planning, use of encrypted communication, and international contacts featured prominently. The court reaffirmed that efforts at concealment, persistent refusal to provide access to encrypted devices, and the use of aliases are aggravating features, whereas cooperation post-arrest may mitigate. The present case involves several but not all such features and accordingly, the sentencing framework requires careful, fact-specific application.\n\nSome additional matters were canvassed by the defence regarding pre-sentence mitigation. It was submitted, for instance, that Mr H had experienced the social isolation marked by the protracted COVID-19 lockdown periods, and that his alienation from family—his nearest relations being two estranged siblings in Derbyshire—contributed to susceptibility to extremist influence. Reference was made to his participation in local chess tournaments in early 2023 and prior volunteer work at the Greenbridge Allotment Project. The court accepts that law-abiding contributions exist in his recent background, but, in the context of terrorism offending, such factors carry modest weight and are outweighed by the sustained, sophisticated nature of the offences.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}\n\nThe court also notes, for completeness, the character evidence supplied by the Penistone Community Centre, which attests to Mr H’s punctuality and reliability in assisting with IT classes for older residents. While such voluntary acts speak to a capacity for pro-social engagement, the weight to be given to these positive reports is limited where conduct of the gravity seen in this case has also occurred contemporaneously.\n\nOf note, there was an incident on 9 June 2025, shortly after Mr H’s apprehension, during which a fellow occupant of 118 Wainsgate Terrace was detained, unrelated to Mr H’s own offending, on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children. The individual, Mr J. Gould, has not faced trial in respect of any charge, and there is no evidence connecting Mr H with those allegations. The Crown explicitly disavows any linkage. It is crucial that neither the public nor the press conflate the distinct and unrelated inquiries concerning other residents at the address.\n\nFor the sake of transparency, the court details that a separate strand of Operation STONEVETCH focused on the dissemination of counterfeit identity documents facilitated by other parties, which, although initially connected by intelligence trawl, have no bearing on the counts before the court. The defendant, Mr H, is not charged in relation to that activity and the relevant investigative leads have been separately actioned.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}\n\nTurning to the psychiatric and psychological aspects of the case, the court has had the benefit of a comprehensive report by Dr Maren Sharp of the East Yorkshire Forensic Service. Dr Sharp’s assessment concludes that Mr H does not fulfil criteria for diagnosis of major mental illness or personality disorder, but presents with marked traits of cognitive rigidity and social withdrawal. The forensic psychologist, Dr Stefan Guiney, identifies a significant risk of ideological recidivism in the absence of ongoing intervention, albeit that Mr H’s measured articulation of grievance does not conform to known markers of immediate operational risk. The joint report of Dr Sharp and Dr Guiney, while detailed and thoroughly evidenced, recommends continued monitoring in a secure setting with a view to future engagement in structured disengagement programmes such as the DDP. The court accepts these recommendations in principle, though rehabilitative optimism must be tempered with caution.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}\n\nOn 26 June 2025, the case was adjourned briefly due to the non-attendance of an accredited interpreter, a previously scheduled co-defendant trial in Court 7 overrunning its listing time by several days. These sorts of knock-on effects are a mundane yet consequential reality in an overstretched court system. The willingness of counsel to accommodate the resulting scheduling changes warrants formal acknowledgment.\n\nInsofar as the procedural history, it must be noted that a fire alarm incident at the court building on 10 May 2025, unrelated to the present case, led to a mid-morning evacuation and the loss of half a day’s sitting time. The cause was determined to be accidental activation during maintenance of smoke detectors in the cafeteria. There is no relevance to the offending or to the defendant but the administrative record requires completeness.\n\nEngagement with the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) process was timely. The MAPPA 3 panel, convened in June and again in July 2025, produced detailed recommendations for supervision in the event of release, including requirements for electronic monitoring, restrictions on internet use, and mandatory participation in psychological risk assessment. It is a matter of public concern that the caseloads managed by the regional MAPPA team continue to rise, with knock-on pressures for both oversight capacity and the delivery of community-based interventions. Nonetheless, the professionalism of the panel in this matter has been unimpeachable.\n\n{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}\n\nI turn, finally, to the submissions as to the defendant’s future risk and rehabilitation. There is, in the recommendations of probation and psychological services, some cautious optimism that Mr H possesses the intellectual resources to benefit from structured interventions, should these be available within a custodial environment. The defence urge that the Desistance and Disengagement Programme and targeted cognitive-behavioural interventions may address some underlying drivers of his behaviour. Probation, while not dismissing those avenues, express “significant reservations” as to the durability of disengagement achieved under time-limited supervision, and point to both the scale and persistence of the ideological commitment demonstrated over the period of offending.\n\nI must also recognise those submissions made by external parties, including a letter from the South Yorkshire Islamic Centre urging sensitivity in public narrative to avoid stigmatising the wider community, and a report from the Families Against Extremism charity highlighting the emotional toll on the defendant’s mother, Ms L. Hinde, whose health has markedly deteriorated since his arrest. The court is not unsympathetic to these points; but its primary allegiance must remain to the protection of the public and the rules established by Parliament and the appellate courts.\n\nIn relation to credit for plea, I am satisfied that the reduction available must be limited to one-sixth, reflecting the late stage at which the pleas were entered, and the resultant limited savings in court resource and witness anxiety. The Sentencing Guideline and the line of authority set out above, particularly in Blackstone, require no higher discount.\n\nThe maximum penalty for count 1 is life imprisonment; for count 2, fifteen years. Aggravating features in this case include the sustained planning, the use of sophisticated obfuscation techniques, and the clear ideological motivation underlying the conduct. Mitigation includes absence of previous convictions, evidence of sporadic community engagement, and a demonstrated—if partial—willingness to engage with deradicalisation services post-charge. The court accepts, as noted by probation, that the absence of prior offending, while significant, is of limited comfort where the risk is ideological and the offending is of the highest seriousness.\n\nIn accordance with usual practice, I direct the Probation Service to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing the suitability of an Extended Determinate Sentence, the scope for inclusion of exclusion zones, GPS electronic monitoring, internet and contact restrictions, and structured psychological intervention under licence conditions. The report should also canvass the capacity and waiting-list times for the DDP in the relevant establishments, and the availability of appropriately accredited Forensic Psychologists for ongoing assessment.\n\nNo formal reporting restrictions are imposed beyond the statutory anonymity for victims and witnesses under section 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. The defendant is remanded in custody. The determination of sentence is adjourned until the pre-sentence report is received. Any applications for costs, confiscation, or ancillary orders should be filed no later than seven days before the next hearing. Any further psychiatric or psychological material must be served in advance of that date.\n\nThese are the orders of the court.", "vignette": "IN THE CROWN COURT AT SHEFFIELD  \nR v.
