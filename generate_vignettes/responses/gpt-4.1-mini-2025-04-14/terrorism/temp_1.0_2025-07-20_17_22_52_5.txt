IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/15924  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. T. WALCOTT  
Filed: 14 August 2025  

Mr H stands before this court for sentence following conviction on one count of conducting an act in preparation for terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a single count of possession of an article for a purpose connected to terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending is said to have occurred between September 2022 and his arrest on 11 January 2025.  

Before turning to the facts of the offending and subsequent proceedings, this court observes that we operate within a deeply challenged public protection framework. The cumulative pressures on policing, counter-terrorism units, forensic laboratories, and associated agencies are profound. They manifest not only in resource constraints but also in competing priorities that strain organisational capacity. The criminal justice system itself is not immune from these competing tensions—persistent backlogs, court listing difficulties, and fluctuating legal aid availability often complicate the timely resolution of complex terrorism matters.  

The Crown Prosecution Service Counter-Terrorism Division has submitted clear evidence that this was a case marked by significant operational complexity, necessitating collaboration among various agencies including Counter Terrorism Policing South West, the National Crime Agency’s Financial Investigations Unit, and regional intelligence branches. The administrative burden occasioned by multi-agency coordination cannot be overestimated. Issues of data security, information sharing, and investigative compartmentalisation routinely lengthen investigation and disclosure timelines. It is a tribute to the persistence and professionalism of the officials involved that this matter progressed with the degree of procedural regularity it achieved, particularly considering the involvement of at least four distinct operational teams and the security sensitivities attendant on certain intercept material.  

The defendant was initially arrested at 07:45 hours on 11 January 2025 pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. This followed an extensive period of covert surveillance and intelligence analysis. The operation included a full-scale digital extraction of Mr H's electronic devices, with forensic teams reconstructing extensive deleted files including encrypted correspondence. The use of advanced forensic techniques such as file carving and encrypted partition recovery underscores the high degree of technical expertise required. Accessing such data often involves reliance on outside specialist contractors authorised under warrant, further complicating timely disclosure.  

Equally significant was the role of the Digital Forensic Service Unit whose efforts in decrypting messages sent via the “SecureMesh” application proved pivotal. The Unit’s backlog had, at times, exceeded 1,200 devices nationwide during the relevant period, severely testing capacity. Nevertheless, their focused efforts in Mr H’s case contributed to identification of critical communications, which served as a key evidential basis for prosecution.

In light of the above, it bears noting that the court has received comprehensive disclosure schedules comprising over 600 items, including intercepted communications, device metadata, physical evidence inventories, and witness statements. The volume of material, while necessary for a fair trial, imposed substantial demands on both the prosecution and defence teams and bears testament to the increasingly data-heavy nature of terrorism prosecutions in the digital age.  

A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 5 May 2025. The defendant entered not guilty pleas at that stage, maintaining them until trial. The trial, listed for late July 2025, was conducted over eight court days. Mr H changed his plea to guilty on the third day of the trial, prior to the commencement of evidence. Counsel for the Crown highlighted that this was a very late plea, offered only once the full evidential case had been scrutinised by the jury panel and extensive forensic testimony presented.  

An analogous precedent is found in R v. Draycott [2023] EWCA Crim 989, where late guilty pleas following protracted trial preparation were given only limited credit. There, the appellant had maintained a not guilty plea in a case involving complex importation offences, shifting only when faced with overwhelming expert evidence. The Court of Appeal confirmed that credit for guilty pleas in such circumstances is discretionary and generally limited to a fraction of normally available mitigation.  

It is noteworthy that R v. Oswald [2024] EWCA Crim 1762 also addressed the doctrine of plea timing in terrorism-related offences. The Court stressed that while the encouragement of early pleas is fundamental to judicial process, credit should only reflect genuine acceptance of responsibility. Tactical pleas to avoid trial consequences without real contrition do not merit substantial discounts.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

In this case, investigations revealed that Mr H maintained a semi-anonymous online blog started in 2021, initially devoted to commentary on local history and urban architecture. Over time, the tone shifted, incorporating material from extremist sources disseminated by groups proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The blog, entitled “SilentFurnace,” was hosted on an offshore server accessed via anonymising services, complicating attribution efforts.  

As part of the prosecution’s case, the Crown relied on linguistic analyses submitted by experts in extremist propaganda, demonstrating similarities between Mr H’s posts and radical manifestos. Defence counsel attempted to argue these entries were satirical or parodic in nature, an assertion rejected by the jury. The court must emphasise that while freedom of expression is foundational, the deliberate use of coded or veiled language to incite or glorify terrorism falls well outside protected speech.  

It is of passing relevance, though not germane to sentencing, that the defendant was also found in possession of handwritten notes describing chemical formulations for the synthesis of explosive precursors, partially redacted and appearing incomplete. The jury verdict confirms these were sufficient to establish intent under the relevant provisions.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

In considering the broader context of Mr H’s holdings, digital forensics uncovered multiple encrypted archives stored within a VeraCrypt container labelled “Compost.” Among them were documents detailing remote detonation techniques and maps annotated with target locations in public transport hubs. The association of such material with a person concurrently possessing other “innocent” files, such as architectural blueprints and gardening guides, speaks to the duality of the defendant’s online presence but does not diminish culpability.  

At trial, the question of partial or incomplete downloads of extremist material was raised. Citing R v. Huxley [2022] EWCA Crim 1470, the court recalls that possession of complete or partial materials is sufficient where intent is evidenced elsewhere in the conduct. Mere lapses in accessing all pages do not undermine proof of purpose.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

During re-examination of the circumstances surrounding the defendant’s possession of a set of aerial photographs of urban infrastructure, defence posited a genuine hobbyist interest in drone photography, supported by Instagram posts of scenic shots apparently uploaded under a personal account. While personal hobbies merit respect, the court accepts the Crown’s submission that such material, in the context of preparatory acts for terrorism, requires careful scrutiny.  

It is worth noting in passing that an unrelated warrant executed at an address linked to a co-defendant in the case uncovered a quantity of Category B firearms, neither of which are attributed to Mr H. Additionally, allegations unrelated to this matter, concerning a charge of affray involving one of the defendant’s associates during a pub incident in 2023, were heard in a separate magistrates’ court. These facts are noted solely for completeness, but bear no relevance to this sentencing exercise.

The defendant undertook travel to Brussels in early 2024, ostensibly for academic purposes linked to engineering conferences. Immigration and transport documentation, however, showed a same-day transfer to Charleroi, where CCTV captured Mr H meeting an individual subsequently arrested on explosives trafficking charges. Defence counsel argued coincidence; the Crown characterised it as circumstantial evidence of direct contact with extremist networks.  

The sheer volume of material necessitated rigorous disclosure vetting by the Crown Prosecution Service Secure Evidence Unit, requiring multiple redaction cycles and supplementary witness statements. The court observes that restraint and precision in disclosure are vital in terrorism cases lest operational capabilities or confidential sources be compromised. Delays resulting from this process inevitably impact listing schedules and judicial resources.  

A further administrative challenge arose from prolonged Legal Aid Agency authorisation to instruct an independent psychiatric expert. This court regrets that the initial requests took over seven weeks to be granted, delaying report completion and thus sentencing preparation. Such procedural bottlenecks must be addressed as a matter of urgency to safeguard defendants’ rights and ensure timely justice.

Financial investigations revealed a cryptocurrency payment of approximately £4,300 sent from a wallet associated with Mr H’s known aliases to an online vendor specialising in dual-use technologies. The payment was routed through multiple anonymising “mixing” services. This court recognises the evolving challenges of digital currency in criminal finance and notes increasing legislative proposals to mandate greater crypto-exchange transparency. Law enforcement must adapt rapidly to these technological shifts.  

When examining covert surveillance footage depicting Mr H’s nocturnal visit to the Avon River embankment in late October 2024, it is evident that such operations, while effective, consume disproportionate analytical resource. In this case, nearly 200 analyst hours were required to process less than 12 minutes of footage due to low light conditions and intermittent interference. This asymmetry in effort between criminal enterprise and detection remains a perennial problem for police forces nationally.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H, aged 28, holds a first-class honours degree in civil engineering from a reputable institution. Prior to the commencement of the offending, he was employed as a junior project engineer for a regional infrastructure firm, a position he left abruptly following a company inquiry into unauthorised access of internal data systems, allegedly to view extremist materials.  

Letters submitted by his former employer describe him as “bright, capable, though reserved,” with no prior disciplinary record. Despite these endorsements, the court must emphasise that professional promise offers limited mitigation in the face of serious terrorism offences. Additionally, character references from a local history society praise his participation in community archival projects, while correspondence from a volunteering organisation commend his work distributing food parcels during pandemic lockdowns. Such community engagement is laudable but must be weighed alongside the gravity of his convictions.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

A comprehensive psychological report prepared by Dr Sara Menon, consultant forensic psychologist, concluded that Mr H exhibits marked cognitive rigidity, a tendency to dichotomise issues in black-and-white terms, and an elevated propensity for narrow ideological conformity. Although no formal psychiatric diagnosis was established, the risk assessment flagged a significant potential for future extremist involvement absent intensive intervention.  

The report recommended targeted cognitive-behavioural programmes designed to address ideological fixation and enhance adaptive thinking. However, Dr Menon prudently cautioned against over-optimism, advising that existing structured disengagement initiatives, such as the Terrorism Desistance Support Programme, maintain significant attrition rates beyond licence expiry. This serves as a reminder of the enduring challenge faced by correctional and support agencies alike in addressing radicalisation.  

The sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council for terrorism offences in 2023 direct courts to consider the degree of planning, the sophistication of the activities, and the extent of public danger posed. Precedent in R v. Khalil [2024] EWCA Crim 580 underscores that even preemptive acts aimed at preparation warrant significant custodial sentences to deter similarly motivated offenders. The court must attend equally to the principles of public protection and general deterrence.  

The defence has advanced mitigation predicated primarily upon the defendant’s lack of criminal antecedents, educational attainments, partial cooperation post-arrest, and the posited potential for rehabilitation through community and psychological interventions. While these factors bear consideration, they do not outweigh the serious breach of public safety and societal trust occasioned by the offending, particularly given the intended indiscriminate nature of harm.  

Having regard to all material before the court, including full disclosure, detailed reports, case law precedent, victim impact evidence, and the submissions of counsel, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. It is requested that the probation service consider, inter alia, the feasibility of extended supervision under MAPPA arrangements category 3, suitability for intensive cognitive-behavioural programmes, accommodation stability, electronic monitoring options, and any demonstrable engagement with deradicalisation interventions.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this 14th day of August 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate registries for enforcement and oversight purposes.  

These are the orders of the court.
