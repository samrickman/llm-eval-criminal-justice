IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/34902  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. L. CARRINGTON  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence having been convicted on two counts relating to offences under the Terrorism Act 2006. The charges relate respectively to engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Act, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending period is identified as extending over the course of eighteen months culminating in the defendant’s arrest in February 2025.  

Mr H’s arrest occurred at 04:46 hours on the morning of 11 February 2025, following a coordinated and multi-agency operation led by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM). Search warrants under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 were executed at two residential premises linked to the defendant, one in Edgbaston and one in Shirley. The operation was triggered by signals intelligence joint with the Security Service, confirming communications with encrypted messaging platforms associated with proscribed organisations. Among the items seized were several electronic devices including hard drives formatted with multiple layers of encryption and chemical precursors stored in unlabelled containers.  

The procedural history of this case evidences the increasingly complex intersection between national security imperatives and established criminal justice processes. It is, perhaps, emblematic of the tension noted by Lord Justice Leveson in R v. Security Service [2017] EWCA Crim 450, where the need for secrecy and protection of intelligence sources must be balanced against the principles of open justice and fairness to the accused. This court is mindful of these considerations as it proceeds.

The extensive investigation that preceded the arrest included detailed analysis of metadata patterns, vehicular tracking data, and human intelligence sourced from regional units. Analysts also employed advanced digital forensics to reconstruct deleted content from solid-state memory cards recovered during initial searches. Noteworthy is the fact that the volume of material required triaging across multiple specialised units, including the National Cyber Crime Unit, reflecting the resourcing pressures recognised in the recent Home Office Digital Forensics Capacity Review (2024). Such capacity constraints not only prolong investigative timelines but also impact the timeliness of disclosure to the defence, with consequential effects on case management timetables.  

Throughout the pre-trial process, the defendant was remanded in custody, with several applications for bail succinctly refused on the grounds articulated in R v. Smith [2010] EWCA Crim 1376, where risk to public safety and the likelihood of reoffending or flight are paramount. It may be noted that on one occasion, a pre-trial hearing scheduled for 16 May 2025 was vacated due to a shortfall in available courtrooms triggered by industrial action among court staff, illustrating the systemic impact of administrative disputes on the criminal justice system at large.  

Notably, a referral under the Prevent programme was made in 2020 by a university tutor following concerns over the defendant’s engagement with extremist material during a political theory module. This referral resulted in attendance at a Channel panel; however, the panel ultimately discontinued intervention due to perceived low immediate risk and Mr H’s sporadic engagement. The decision accords with the approach outlined in the Prevent Duty Guidance 2019, which stresses proportionality and the importance of voluntary participation. Whether the present events might have been averted had alternative intervention strategies been successful is a matter for policy review rather than these sentencing remarks.  

Defence counsel, Mr Ian Melling, appearing under Legal Aid representation, has been commendably diligent despite encountering procedural hurdles. Notably, the authorisation for instruction of forensic psychiatric expertise was initially delayed pending protracted correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency. Such bureaucratic inertia has become a matter of concern across the jurisdiction, as noted in the Justice Select Committee’s 2025 Report on Funding Pressures. The court appreciates the efforts of Mr Melling and his team in navigating these complexities and making fulsome representations on behalf of the defendant.

This case raises perennial questions concerning the timing and scope of pleas entered. Mr H maintained a not guilty plea at the earliest hearings but altered his position to guilty on both counts at 09:18 hours on the morning of trial, 3 September 2025, after substantial evidential disclosures. The court is compelled to echo the comments of Lord Justice May in R v. Connors [2023] EWCA Crim 863 that guilty pleas entered at such a late stage, while to be acknowledged, warrant more limited credit. The rationale is well-established: representing genuine contrition and significant savings to court time and victim distress must be genuine and timely to merit full recognition.  

Intervening case law provides further illumination. In R v. Hawthorne [2024] EWCA Crim 745, the defendant, convicted of aggravated robbery involving a firearm, maintained a not guilty plea for seven months before pleading guilty on the morning of trial. The Court of Appeal unequivocally upheld a 10% discount for plea in those circumstances, distinguishing it clearly from early guilty pleas made at first reasonable opportunity. It is the court’s intention to apply these principles consistently here.  

Equally informative is the decision in R v. Tate [2023] EWCA Crim 1022, concerning a defendant indicted for conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Tate delayed plea until a critical challenge to forensic evidence was dismissed. The court emphasised that plea timing reflects not only the act of admission but its context and purpose—mere tactical delay does not attract generosity.  

In relation to risk assessment, the pre-sentence report contains a thorough itemisation of Mr H’s background and risk profile. As detailed by Dr. Simon Bexley in a comprehensive forensic psychiatric report dated 20 August 2025, Mr H exhibits no formal mental illness but displays traits consistent with an entrenched ideological commitment and high cognitive rigidity. Dr Bexley opines that these features correspond with a sustained risk of relapse into extremist thought without focused, long-term intervention. The report recommends ongoing psychological support under licence conditions and monitoring aligned with MAPPA Category 3 protocols.

The evidential picture was enriched by digital forensics revealing multiple encrypted archives — some open, others partially corrupted — stored on hidden partitions accessible only via complex key sequences. As the court is aware, possession of incomplete or partially accessible material does not diminish culpability where mens rea and preparatory
