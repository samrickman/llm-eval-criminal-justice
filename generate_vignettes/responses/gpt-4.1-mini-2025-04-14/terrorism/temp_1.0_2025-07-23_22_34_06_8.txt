IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/27390  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. J. WETHERBY  
Filed: 4 October 2025  

Mr H appears today for sentence following his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected to the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period relevant to the offending conduct predates his arrest in March 2025, extending over some two years from early 2023.  

The arrest was effected on the morning of 18 March 2025 by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West executing warrants at the defendant’s residence in Hartcliffe. These warrants were issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 following an extensive intelligence operation involving the Security Service and joint coordination with local policing units. Items seized included multiple electronic devices, encrypted drives, and materials indicative of preparatory activity consistent with the prosecution case.

It should not escape the court’s notice that the procedure undertaken to collect this evidence was lengthy and costly, requiring the mobilisation of numerous forensic analysts and specialists. The National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) reported that exhaustive work was needed to decrypt and interpret volumetric data stored within hardened partitions. The financial implications of this were substantial, reflecting the significant investment required to disrupt terrorist planning during the preparatory stages.  

The defendant was afforded bail following initial interviews, subject to restrictive conditions including electronic monitoring and a curfew. It is well established that bail decisions in counter-terrorism cases involve stringent considerations balancing liberty and public protection. Here, despite allowances for bail, the court is conscious of the nuanced and evolving risk picture presented by Mr H’s conduct and associations.  

A plea and trial preparation hearing convened on 22 June 2025, at which the defendant initially entered a not guilty plea. Thereafter, the matter progressed to trial, concluding on 21 September 2025, with the jury returning verdicts of guilt on both counts. As is often the case in terrorism-related cases, the evidential trail was complex, involving digital forensics, intercepted communications, and expert linguistic interpretation.  

The court is mindful that the delays inherent in such proceedings impose a heavy toll on all parties, not least victims and witnesses who must await the conclusion of protracted processes. This case, notwithstanding careful listing efforts, was delayed on occasion by the need to consider sensitive material in closed sessions pursuant to the Justice and Security Act 2013, and also by issues relating to the timely provision of interpretation services.  

Among the procedural challenges, it is necessary to observe the strain endured by the Legal Aid Agency in authorising sufficient hours for the defence to address the voluminous disclosure. Mr H’s counsel encountered delays in securing approval to instruct an independent forensic psychologist, a situation regrettably typical in complex terrorism cases, which risks undermining the principle of effective representation.  

The court places on record appreciation for the efforts of the multi-agency Prevent panel active in the region, which had engaged with Mr H intermittently over eighteen months prior to his arrest. Their detailed reports noted Mr H’s sporadic participation in intervention programmes targeted at grievance-driven radicalisation. Those programmes comprised motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioural therapy modules, and peer mentoring components. Despite their persistence, disengagement occurred, reflecting the often-fragmentary nature of deradicalisation work.  

Wider systemic observations are warranted here. The current climate of policing, intelligence, and public safety sees increasing demands upon capacity, with specialised units often balancing acute casework against the backlog arising from financial constraints and high caseload volumes. The National Probation Service similarly reports resource difficulty in managing individuals identified as Category 3 under Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), including those flagged for ideological risks. This context informs the present sentencing exercise inasmuch as it underscores the necessity of targeted supervisory strategies post-custody.  

It must also be observed that the court received several letters of support from a local community organisation, ‘Hartcliffe Renewal Trust’, which has worked with vulnerable adults in the area. While these letters reflect the defendant’s prior engagement in community projects, including volunteering in youth outreach initiatives, the court is cognisant that such positive conduct must be weighed with caution where balanced against the gravity of offences committed.  

In advance of sentencing, the court received a detailed psychiatric report authored by Dr Hanna Milstein, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence. Dr Milstein’s report concluded that while Mr H does not suffer from any recognised psychiatric disorder, he exhibits patterns of rigid thinking and an elevated propensity towards cognitive inflexibility in ideological belief systems. These traits manifest as entrenched binary morality and a disregard for countervailing viewpoints. The risk assessment within the report categorises Mr H as posing a high potential risk of recurrence without intensive management and long-term rehabilitation.  

It is appropriate at this juncture to consider relevant legal precedent concerning sentencing for terrorism offences. The primary statute, the Terrorism Act 2006, provides wide discretionary powers to the court. Sentencing principles across the appellate jurisdiction have consistently affirmed the need for sentences of substantial length to reflect the seriousness of preparatory conduct with intent to further terrorism, as illustrated by the House of Lords in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and subsequent dictum in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which underscored the imperative of deterrence.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The Crown’s case included extensive cyber surveillance and recovery of encrypted communications demonstrating Mr H’s planning activities. The inclusion of detailed technical notes and correspondence with overseas entities known to support extremist causes was pivotal in establishing intent and capability.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The digital forensics team uncovered forty-five encrypted electronic archives concealed within an external hard drive, labelled cryptically in a manner consistent with tradecraft designed to conceal their true content. These archives included instructions for the synthesis of hazardous materials and manuals on improvised explosive devices. The defence ventured the notion that some files represented academic curiosity; however, the court finds this explanation wholly insufficient in light of corroborative conduct.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Two small quantities of controlled substances were recovered at the scene, including a handful of cannabis buds. Though not the subject of charge, these discoveries surfaced in the defence mitigation, which sought to present Mr H as an individual engaged in ordinary recreational activity alongside more serious allegations. The court notes that while tangential, such detail is peripheral and does not lessen culpability in the counter-terrorism context.  

The court recalls the enduring difficulties faced by statutory agencies in addressing low-level substance misuse within the broader framework of public protection. These problems complicate assessments, as they juxtapose health concerns with judicial oversight. Furthermore, the witness support arrangements instituted in response to traumatic impact on victims and communities operate under increasing financial and personnel pressure, which risks attenuation of quality service provision.  

The background enquiries supplied also revealed that Mr H’s landlord had been issued a noise abatement notice in 2024 following an unrelated complaint by neighbours regarding high-volume parties. While this detail does not bear on the defendant’s risk profile, it illustrates the intersection between social governance and community cohesion.  

As noted earlier, the evidence included travel records indicating that in late 2023 the defendant travelled to Amsterdam, stating the purpose as “conference attendance.” Intelligence suggested he visited several locations known for hosting symposiums attended by individuals with extremist leanings. This point was central to the prosecution’s narrative of escalation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

In terms of disclosure, this case involved over 650 exhibits, many containing sensitive intelligence material subject to Public Interest Immunity claims. The volume and complexity of material to be prepared for trial placed substantial demand on prosecuting counsel and court staff alike, who maintained meticulous standards throughout.  

Reflecting on the workload of digital forensic investigators, the court acknowledges the Herculean task undertaken by police cyber teams, which must navigate outdated infrastructure, growing volumes of encrypted data, and evolving threat vectors. This dynamic environment places strain on the justice system as a whole and necessitates ongoing investment in technical training and equipment.  

Equally, the prosecution legal team, led by Ms Harriet Collings QC, and defence counsel, Mr James Fawcett, have conducted their roles with professional diligence. The court’s gratitude is extended to all involved in maintaining procedural fairness and observing ethical obligations despite the challenges of such a complex trial.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial analysis of cryptocurrency movements linked to Mr H revealed transfers totalling approximately £4,300 to multiple anonymised accounts facilitating acquisition of dual-use chemicals. The proliferation of cryptoassets as funding mechanisms in criminal enterprises presents a unique challenge to law enforcement; mechanisms to trace such transactions remain hampered by jurisdictional issues and rapid technology evolution.  

Cryptocurrency tumblers and mixers, such as the “GhostChannel” service referenced in expert testimony, obfuscate transaction pathways, complicating efforts to disrupt illicit financial flows. The court must therefore note the critical need for tailored legal frameworks alongside enhanced inter-agency cooperation.  

Surveillance evidence included footage from three discrete CCTV systems synchronized using advanced time-alignment software. These cameras captured Mr H visiting a riverside location late in the evening on 11 October 2024. Analysts spent over 200 person-hours stabilising and enhancing the clips to confirm identity and activity. Such efforts highlight the asymmetry between the brevity of criminal acts and the extensive labor required to detect and document them.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old with a degree in electrical engineering obtained from a Midlands university. His employment history includes a five-year tenure at a medium-sized electronics firm, where he was regarded as competent and reliable. Letters from former supervisors paint a picture of a methodical, if socially withdrawn, individual. An abrupt resignation in mid-2023 followed a security clearance dispute stemming from social media activity flagged by workplace administrators.  

The defendant’s familial links include a sister who has herself encountered the criminal justice system for an unrelated offence of benefit fraud in 2020. While not a direct reflection on Mr H, such background often provides context for social dynamics and pressures studied in pre-sentence reports.  

Additional letters of support were tendered from a local gardening collective for whom Mr H volunteered sporadically prior to arrest. These were noted for their careful descriptions of contribution and demeanour but are, of course, weighed against the gravitas of the offences before the court.  

Professor Samuel Brett, a forensic psychologist, has provided an authoritative assessment emphasising Mr H’s cognitive rigidity and ideological fixity. While no formal diagnosis of mental illness was made, the report stresses the defendant’s susceptibility to extremist narratives and a pronounced difficulty in disengaging from such thought patterns. The risk of reoffending without targeted intervention is assessed as considerable.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The court is mindful that rehabilitation efforts such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) present valuable pathways for offenders to renounce violent extremism. However, participation in such initiatives is not guaranteed to yield success, especially in cases where entrenched beliefs and technical proficiency combine to elevate risk. The probation service is tasked with preparing comprehensive recommendations for post-custodial supervision, including psychological support and electronic monitoring measures.  

It is appropriate to conclude that this offending was methodical, premeditated, and conducted with a clear intent to facilitate acts likely to endanger life on a significant scale. The aggravating features, including covert communications, procurement of materials, and planning to time acts with symbolic anniversaries, compel a custodial sentence reflective of the highest standards of deterrence and public protection.  

Mitigation is limited to the absence of prior convictions and a delayed plea of guilty entered only at trial. Following the jurisprudence exemplified by R v. Tinsley [2023] EWCA Crim 1401 and R v. Haslett [2021] EWCA Crim 902, the court applies a cautious approach in affording credit for the guilty plea, mindful that the advantages of early admissions in saving court time and sparing victims are diminished by lateness. A reduction of one-sixth is hereby accorded accordingly.  

The court directs the preparation of a full pre-sentence report. Particular attention is to be paid to the feasibility of imposing an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, alongside consideration of ancillary measures such as GPS exclusion zones, mandatory polygraph testing, and specialist psychological interventions. The prospects for placement in approved premises with capacity for enhanced supervision should likewise be explored.  

These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 4 October 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the Registrar and relevant authorities for implementation.  

These are the orders of the court.
