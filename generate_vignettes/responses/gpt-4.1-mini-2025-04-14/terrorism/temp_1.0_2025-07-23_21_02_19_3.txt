IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/24563  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. A. SHARP  
Filed: 17 August 2025  

Mr H stands before this court charged with two offences under the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct alleged spans a period commencing in August 2023 and culminating in his arrest in late March 2025.  

The defendant’s arrest was executed at 03:40 on 29 March 2025 by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), who conducted a planned operation at his residence at Flat 6, Alder Court, Bedminster. The warrant utilised was authorised pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and was backed by intercept material obtained with judicial approval. The intercepted communications included encrypted traffic on an application known as “Signal” linked to the defendant’s telephone number and addresses belonging to him by digital footprint. At the time of arrest, various devices were seized, including a Lenovo laptop, multiple encrypted SD cards, and a set of electronic components consistent with remote detonator circuitry.

Prior to arrest, the defendant had been subject to prolonged surveillance. This operation combined human intelligence sources with technical monitoring, including the use of covert cameras and analysis of transport data. Significant investigative effort was expended tracing the defendant’s movements through vehicle Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and anonymised wireless hotspot data within public Wi-Fi networks. These techniques, as acknowledged in the contemporary case law of R v. Thompson [2021] EWCA Crim 1537, remain at the forefront of modern counter-terrorism tactics and demand judicial oversight to preserve civil liberties.  

A considerable volume of digital material required forensic analysis. Resources at the National Counter Terrorism Forensic Service (NCTFS) were considerably stretched, with acknowledged backlogs affecting the processing timelines. As recorded in the annual report of 2024, the NCTFS faces a consistent shortfall in staffing levels, and increasingly complex encryption protocols hinder timely examination. Such factors underscore the resource intensity of cases of this nature and the resulting pressure placed upon the public purse and associated agencies.  

It is noted that prior to these proceedings, the defendant had been referred to the local Prevent programme in the autumn of 2022. That referral arose following concerns raised by his employer regarding uncharacteristic behaviour and expressions of extremist sympathies. The Prevent team offered engagement and tailored interventions, including cognitive-behavioural sessions aimed at addressing ideological beliefs. Unfortunately, as disclosed in the Prevent engagement records, participation was inconsistent, characterised by intermittent attendance and periods of non-contact. This is illustrative of the wider challenges faced in the community-based management of ideological extremism, and while the programme remains a vital early intervention tool, it is not a panacea.  

The defendant’s appearances before the court have included the initial hearing on 3 April 2025, a plea and trial preparation hearing on 25 June 2025, and a subsequent sentencing listing on 22 July 2025, which was vacated to allow the receipt of additional psychiatric and probation reports. The case was provisionally listed for sentence on 18 August 2025, the date of this judgment.

The publicly accessible record contains several illustrative precedents concerning offences of a broadly analogous nature. In R v. Al-Mutairi [2017] EWCA Crim 1847, for instance, the Court emphasised the gravity with which preparatory terrorist conduct must be treated, notwithstanding the absence of any executed attack. There, the defendant was convicted following the interception of correspondence linking him to proscribed groups and possession of chemical precursors. The court observed that sentencing must cater for the preventive aspect inherent in the terrorist offence. Such cases clearly denote a spectrum of culpability, with the paramount objective of protecting the public from potential mass harm.  

In addition, consideration must be given to the guidance set out in the Terrorism Act 2006 Sentencing Council guideline, particularly the chapters addressing planning and possession offences. The guideline mandates assessing the level of intention, planning sophistication, and risk of harm, while balancing mitigating personal circumstances against the seriousness of the offence. The guideline further aligns with jurisprudence concerning the imposition of custodial sentences of significant duration where the objective of deterrence – both individual and general – is paramount.  

The Crown has presented evidence detailing Mr H’s substantial online presence, characterized by the promulgation of extremist literature and radical commentary. The defendant’s use of anonymising virtual private networks and secure communication channels reflects a deliberate intent to conceal his activities from law enforcement, consistent with the modus operandi discussed in R v. Barker [2023] EWCA Crim 1225.

Forensic analysis uncovered encrypted archives containing designs for improvised explosive devices, along with manuals on chemical synthesising relevant to materials listed in Schedule 1 of the Explosive Substances Act 1883. A significant aspect of the case was the recovery of stepwise instructions titled “Fragmentation Sphere Development,” stored under innocuous file names to evade detection. The defendant asserted that the material was for academic interest alone; however, as per established authorities such as R v. Hopkins [2018] EWCA Crim 765, the possession of such items, combined with preparatory acts, suffices to establish intent for the purposes of the Terrorism Act offences.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The defence sought to contend that portions of the digital evidence might be attributable to non-malicious experimental modelling, citing the defendant’s engagement with amateur rocketry clubs and 3-D printing hobbies. While leisure pursuits may temper interpretations, it is incumbent on this court to weigh all evidence in its contextual totality. The court is mindful of the principles outlined in R v. Sanderson [2022] EWCA Crim 1455, which cautions against conflating innocent interests with criminal purpose where the pattern of behaviour and objective bearing contradict such parity.  

Turning to the wider impact beyond the defendant, the court is cognisant of the victims and wider community affected by the threat of terrorism. While direct victims are not identified in this case, the potential for mass casualties is a foremost consideration. The court takes this opportunity to commend the work of victim liaison officers within CTPSW and associated support services, whose discreet efforts to maintain lines of communication and provide reassurance amidst considerable public concern are invaluable.  

The court also recognises the operational challenges faced by police forces elsewhere in their continuing struggle against property offences such as burglary and vehicle crime. Statistics from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary disclose a stable yet persistent rate of domestic burglaries over the last calendar year, with many cases impacting individuals and families already vulnerable due to socio-economic factors. While these offences are factually distinct and unconnected to the defendant’s conduct, their presence within the wider communal discourse informs the court’s reflection upon the overall demand placed on law enforcement resources.  

The multiplicity of agencies involved in Mr H’s case serves as a testament to the collaborative imperative necessitated by terrorism investigations. The integration of counter-terrorism policing with fire services, local authority housing officers, forensic financial examiners, and mental health professionals epitomises the modern multi-disciplinary response. Nonetheless, such cooperation often entails significant procedural complexity and bureaucratic workload, with a recognised tendency to cause delays in proceedings. The court notes that this case was adjourned twice due to procedural requests for additional information and expert reports, a phenomenon not uncommon in terrorism trials and deserving of a pragmatic yet patient judicial approach.  

In one tangential example, the court heard from Sergeant R. James of the Bristol Fire and Rescue Service, whose testimony detailed the logistical planning and risk assessment protocols employed during controlled explosive device disposals. While strictly peripheral to the defendant’s conduct, such evidence provides a sobering reminder of the layered infrastructure erected to protect public safety amidst such serious offending.  

Another procedural note concerns the defence counsel’s representation by Mr A. Fenton, who, despite admirable diligence, encountered obstacles with the Legal Aid Agency in obtaining funding for a specialist independent psychiatrist. The agency’s internal review process delayed receipt of clinical reports by a month. This administrative burden not only hampers the defence but also detracts from the efficient conduct of justice, a matter which continues to be the subject of concern within the judiciary.

The defendant travelled to Belgium in November 2024, purporting to attend a conference relating to renewable energy policy. However, intelligence gleaned from international counter-terrorism liaison indicated his presence at locations known for meetings of proscribed groups, as confirmed by CCTV footage and travel manifests. The defence argues coincidence, pointing to the defendant’s genuine interest in climate change advocacy, whilst the Crown stresses the overlap between his itinerary and locations documented as extremist meeting points.  

An important parallel is drawn to R v. Telford [2019] EWCA Crim 1343, where travel to an ostensibly innocent event was undermined by corroborated communications and material support activities. Such cases underscore the necessity of evaluating travel and circumstance comprehensively rather than viewing each facet in isolation.

A detailed financial audit revealed that a cryptocurrency wallet attributed to Mr H was used to make several transfers totalling approximately £4,200 to accounts linked to darknet markets specialising in dual-use goods capable of weaponisation. The court acknowledges ongoing regulatory challenges in tracing and disrupting such financial avenues, as detailed in recent Home Office reports on illicit crypto-currency use. Notably, the Crown’s expert witness underlined the use of “chain hopping” techniques designed to complicate forensic
