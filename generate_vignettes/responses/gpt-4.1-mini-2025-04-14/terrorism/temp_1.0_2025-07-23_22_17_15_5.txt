IN THE CROWN COURT AT NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. N2025/24736  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. A. TREMONT  
Filed: 19 September 2025  

Mr H stands before the court today charged with committing offences contrary to sections 5(1)(a) and 57 of the Terrorism Act 2006 and 2000 respectively: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and possession of an article for such a purpose. The chronology of offending extends from late 2022 through to the defendant's arrest in March of this year.  

The defendant's case has unfolded against a backdrop of significant operational and judicial complexity. Mr H was initially detained at 08:45 on 10 March 2025 following the execution of a linked series of warrants by Counter Terrorism Policing North East at his residence in Elswick. The warrants themselves were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 subsequent to intercept evidence captured by the Security Service pointing to increased encrypted traffic between Mr H’s digital devices and servers linked to proscribed content dissemination. At the point of arrest, officers confiscated an assortment of items including a desktop computer, encrypted USB storage, and several technical manuals.

This arrest was the denouement of an operation designated “OPERATION CALIBRUM,” which bridged conventional investigatory methods with emergent digital analytical techniques. The investigative team routinely drew upon pattern analysis derived from energy consumption telemetry within the defendant’s block, which, intriguingly, revealed disturbances correlating with periods when 3-D printing and device usage were detected on seized digital storage. Such nuanced correlations were only identified due to the intervention of a National Data Exploitation Centre intern, whose bespoke software developments were crucial in parsing this otherwise impenetrable dataset. Although these pilot programmes remain under-resourced and vulnerable to funding constraints, they demonstrate the cutting-edge profile of current counter-terrorism efforts.  

As is often the unfortunate experience in cases of this nature, the disclosure of sensitive material was not immune from procedural delay. Several requests for prior disclosure under section 3 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 encountered extended vetting periods, engendering two successive adjournments. These were instigated to afford the Crown reasonable time to review and redact material in the public interest whilst safeguarding operational sources and methods. It is regrettable that these procedural accommodations naturally impact defence preparedness and may contribute to court listing pressures. However, such challenges are not unique to this matter and echo a broader theme of contemporary criminal justice resource allocation.  

Of relevance to the court’s fuller understanding is that, some three years prior to the offending timeline, a referral had been made to Prevent after Mr H’s submission of an academic essay quoting extensively from radical manifestos lacked critical engagement. That referral, reviewed under Channel protocols, culminated in a discontinued intervention after preliminary engagement failed to demonstrate material risk. This early history serves to illustrate the inherent tension in preventative frameworks attempting to balance individual liberty with societal safeguarding—a task repeatedly acknowledged as formidable and often fraught with uncertainty. That earlier decision, while not determinative, contextualises the trajectory culminating in these present charges.  

The plea and trial preparation hearing held on 1 August 2025 was notable for the defendant’s initial not guilty pleas to all counts. It was not until the commencement of the sentencing hearing on 16 September 2025 that Mr H entered guilty pleas for both offences. The court has, with customary circumspection, weighed the mitigating effect of these admissions against their timing. As recent judiciary elucidation confirms, notably in R v. Stafford [2024] EWCA Crim 985, the timing of a guilty plea is critical to the quantum of credit awarded. The very late pleas entered in this case fall into a category permitting only modest mitigation, given the limited relief offered to prosecution witnesses and the judicial system.  

In considering the doctrines relevant to plea discount, the court recalls the decisions in R v. Golding [2023] EWCA Crim 1127 and R v. Evershed & Bloxham [2022] EWCA Crim 451. In Golding, the Court emphasised that while early pleas necessarily afford maximum discount, the realities of negotiated resolutions require flexibility, particularly where evidentiary complexity looms large. In Evershed & Bloxham, appellate refinements underscored that discounts must meaningfully weigh the extent to which a plea saves prosecutorial and judicial resources while fairly reflecting offender remorse. Each of these has been carefully considered here.  

The statutory framework within which sentencing must operate includes the Terrorism Act 2006, most notably section 5, under which engagement in preparatory conduct is criminalised. The provisions mandating custodial sentences of potentially unlimited length underscore Parliament’s intent to deter and incapacitate those engaging in terrorism-connected conduct, irrespective of the ultimate fruition of attack plans. Judicial authorities have reinforced this view; R v. Suleiman [2018] EWCA Crim 1909 affirmed the imperative of prioritising public safety over rehabilitative leniency in cases exhibiting sophisticated planning. Equally, R v. Obasi [2020] EWCA Crim 1234 reminded courts that custodial sentences for terrorism offences routinely exceed guidelines applicable to general criminality, reflecting the societal harm and symbolic breach at their core.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The Crown has adduced evidence that Mr H operated and maintained multiple online personas, the most prominent of which, under the pseudonym “SteelVigil,” posted content oscillating from ostensibly benign political commentary to increasingly strident calls for violent action. The Fusion Centre undertook linguistic forensic analysis, the results of which suggest the embedding of coded exhortations mirroring proscribed organisation propaganda, a methodology refined to evade automated content filters.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Extensive digital forensic recovery revealed thirty encrypted PDF manuals within a protected container labelled "QuietForge," including materials on improvised explosive mechanisms and ballistics. These archives themselves were incomplete, a matter vigorously contested by defence due to claims regarding the defendant’s limited access to the files. However, appellate precedent in R v. Duresh [2021] EWCA Crim 765 affirms that possession of partial documents can suffice to ground intent where corroborated by ancillary conduct. Notably, a defence submission invoked the possibility that some materials were of genuine academic interest, referencing a dormant social media account with posts of architectural photography; the court, however, discerns no credible innocent explanation consistent with the totality of evidence.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The court must also acknowledge that during the operational period, cannabis residue was found incidentally at the defendant’s residential premises. This is not prosecuted within this trial; it is noted purely as contextual background, reflective of the attempts by counsel to paint an attenuated veneer of normalcy. Similarly, a historical fixed-penalty notice for public transport fare evasion entered as a minor aspect of mitigation does not detract from the gravity of these terrorism offences.  

Space must be afforded to the defendant’s travel history and its interpretative relevance. In the spring of 2024, Mr H undertook a series of international journeys, ostensibly for academic conferences and “heritage research.” Yet ticketing and border data reveal detours to locations known to host extremist gatherings. One trip to a European capital saw recordings of mobile communications with individuals later implicated in illicit explosives acquisition networks. While defence advocates advanced alternative explanations, the preponderance of evidence satisfies this court of a nexus to terror-related activity.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The disclosure process has been complicated considerably by the volume and classification level of seized materials. Over 800 exhibits underwent intensive redaction for operational security, with a dedicated team tasked with balancing transparency with public safety considerations. Such efforts are labour-intensive and are but one facet of the substantial pressures levied upon the court administration. Staffing shortages in the administrative judiciary often result in delays that professionals and litigants alike find frustrating yet are, regrettably, systemic.  

Similarly, the increased prevalence of “dark web” transactions using cryptocurrencies has posed unique challenges to prosecutorial evidence assembly. A forensic examination traced a series of transactions from digital wallets linked to Mr H to online entities marketing potentially dual-use chemical kits and technical components. These tools, while capable of legitimate scientific uses, have featured prominently in terror plot facilitation across jurisdictions. The court notes with concern the legislative and enforcement challenges posed by these emergent financial modalities and the wider societal debates surrounding privacy, regulation, and security.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

The evidential tapestry was further enriched by CCTV analyses. Surveillance footage secured from nocturnal patrols of the River Tyne embankments, spanning three separate locales and timeframes, was cross-referenced with mobile device data. These captured fleeting visits by Mr H to isolated areas, at hours consistent with reconnaissance activity. The prosecution relied on expert testimony attesting to the significant resource expenditure entailed in analysing over 150 hours of grainy, low-light imagery, illustrating the asymmetry between the brief moments of offending and the protracted investigations they provoke.  

Turning to Mr H’s personal background, he is a 30-year-old man holding a Masters degree in electrical engineering from the University of Durham. His employment history is characterised by roles in technical consultancy and engineering design until his sudden resignation in August 2023, a decision contemporaneous with the commencement of investigatory surveillance. Letters from community groups attest to his prior volunteer engagements, including participation in urban tree planting initiatives and contributions to local heritage societies. Notwithstanding the commendability of such involvements, they do not mitigate the deliberate and sustained nature of his offending conduct in this case.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

A psychiatric assessment conducted by Dr Caroline Merrick provided a detailed account of Mr H’s psychological profile. Her report delineates a pattern of cognitive inflexibility and entrenched ideological rigidity but finds no diagnosable mental illness capable of diminishing responsibility. The assessment emphasises the high risk associated with unresolved extremist predispositions, particularly in the absence of consistent disengagement from radical milieus.  

The defendant’s legal representation has advocated referral to specialist deradicalisation and cognitive restructuring programmes, such as the National Radicalisation Intervention Scheme (NRIS), which evidence suggests can assist in mitigating extremist propensity if engaged with earnestly. However, the court remains cognisant of the variable success rates in such pathways and the critical need for robust post-sentence management to ensure ongoing public protection.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

This case epitomises the challenges confronting the criminal justice system in adjudicating terrorism-related offending committed with sophistication and ideological conviction. The level of planning, the deliberate obfuscation, and the intent all situate Mr H’s actions within the worst culpability bracket as detailed in the current Sentencing Council Guidelines. Despite his absence of prior convictions and academic attainments, these are overshadowed by the magnitude of public risk his conduct engendered. The late pleas entered accordingly attract only moderate credit insufficient to substantially temper custodial consequences.  

In practical terms, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service, inclusive of risk assessments utilising Structured Professional Judgement tools tailored for extremism cases. The report shall address potential modalities of sentence management, including the feasibility of Extended Determinate Sentences with supplementary requirements, electronic monitoring, and tailored cognitive behavioural interventions. The burden upon community resources—including the capacity constraints within approved premises—must be evaluated alongside the prospects for meaningful rehabilitation and disengagement.  

It is incumbent on the court to recognise both the dedication and significant pressures borne by all agencies involved. Counter Terrorism Policing units operate under severe staffing and operational constraints, and community-based organisations engaged in Prevent and Channel initiatives face chronic underfunding despite the indispensable nature of their work. These systemic challenges remind us that public safety is a collective endeavour, reliant on the diligent co-operation of myriad institutional actors. Acknowledging their contribution is not mere formality; it is an imperative recognition of the fabric holding our society together.  

The sentencing hearing has proceeded in open court today, conducted with professional rigour and decorum. I thank counsel for their submissions: Ms Eleanor Price appearing for the Crown, and Mr Simon Radcliffe for the defence. I also record appreciation for Court Officers and ushers in maintaining order and facilitating proceedings amid ongoing refurbishment of this courtroom, which has recently seen renewed accessibility improvements to serve all attendees.  

The court is mindful of the challenge and delicacy inherent in balancing the imperatives of justice, security, and human rights when confronting ideologically motivated offending of this nature. While it is the solemn duty of the judiciary to impose sentences commensurate with the gravity of the offending, it is equally obliged to guard the procedural fairness and dignity of the accused.  

I reserve final sentencing for the formal hearing scheduled on 14 October 2025, pending receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations from counsel. The court conveys no indicative view on sentence length or custodial conditions at this juncture.  

These sentencing remarks have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules at the Crown Court at Newcastle-upon-Tyne this 19th day of September, 2025. The defendant is advised of his statutory right to appeal sentence within 28 days under the relevant statutory provisions, including the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no special reporting restrictions engaged pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
