IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/28648  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge F. L. WATKINS  
Filed: 4 September 2025

Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of articles for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is said to have taken place between January 2023 and his arrest in March 2025.

The defendant was initially arrested at 04:58 on 15 March 2025 pursuant to intelligence-led warrants executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at his residence in Bedminster. The warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and were the product of months of joint investigative efforts involving digital surveillance, informant reports, and forensic examination of intercepted encrypted communications. At the time of arrest, Mr H was found in possession of multiple USB storage devices, a modified laptop, and assorted electronic components including timers and circuit boards.

The nature of this investigation reflects the growing complexity and resource intensiveness of counter-terrorism policing. Members of CTPSW, alongside regional intelligence analysts and digital forensic specialists, coordinated their activities in an environment increasingly constrained by tight budgets and rising case volumes. It merits note that the prosecutions for terrorism-related offences nationally have increased steadily over the past five years, as detailed in the Home Office’s annual report for 2024. Staff shortages within specialist units have led to an increased reliance on inter-agency cooperation and external contractors for data analysis—a fact that inevitably impacts investigative timelines.

Historical examination of the legislative backdrop reveals that the Terrorism Act 2006 was a significant statutory intervention intended to fill gaps identified in previous counter-terrorism frameworks. As Lord Justice Laws noted in R v. Mohammed [2009] EWCA Crim 1231, the statute’s provisions were designed to address preparatory conduct that, though they may not have culminated in actual attack, nevertheless embodied serious risk to public safety—affirming Parliament’s intention to act preventatively rather than solely punitively. The Act's evolution, including limited amendments enacted in 2018 concerning possession offences, continues to be a benchmark for judicial consideration in related sentencing.

The path to trial was marked by various procedural developments. A plea and case management hearing was conducted on 1 July 2025, at which Mr H entered a not guilty plea. The court encountered a degree of delay due to an initial defence application for extended disclosure of intercepted materials, necessitating adjournment to facilitate proper expert examination. This delay, while regrettable, is a reflection of the protracted nature of contemporary terrorism prosecutions where volumes of digital evidence can number in the terabytes.

The defence were legally assisted by Mr Philip Cardozo of the Bristol Defence Inn, instructed under Legal Aid. The court heard submissions regarding the difficulties faced by defence teams in securing adequately funded expert witnesses in the digital domain. The Legal Aid Agency’s current tariff structure for such work has been the subject of ongoing critique, including in a recent report by the Criminal Bar Association, which highlighted the deleterious effects on case progression. In this instance, the court noted that delays attributable to funding authorisations occasioned some rearranging of the trial timetable but did not materially prejudice the defence.

The court wishes to note the distress and disruption experienced by the local community in the wake of the investigation. Although no charges relate directly to acts of violence or injury, the anxiety engendered by a terrorism investigation is palpable, and outreach by community liaison officers was undertaken with commendable diligence to inform and allay concerns. Similar community impact has been documented in other recent prosecutions, such as R v. Fleming [2023] EWCA Crim 904, where the Court of Appeal underscored the importance of balancing the rights of defendants with the collective interest in effective counter-terrorism enforcement.

Support and mitigation materials submitted on behalf of Mr H include letters from East Bristol Voluntary Initiative and a local faith group, each attesting to his prior participation in charity events and community clean-up campaigns. While such evidence speaks to a complexity of character beyond the criminal offending, the court observes that expressions of social engagement cannot diminish the seriousness of planning and preparatory conduct associated with terrorism offences. Similar sentiments were previously articulated in the judgement of R v. Al-Rashid [2018] EWCA Crim 1347, relating to the tension between community integration and public protection imperatives.

In reviewing the facts, the court encountered digital materials recovered from the defendant’s encrypted storage devices. Specialist examiners from the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC) and CTPSW’s cyber-crime unit testified to a pattern of systematic acquisition and analysis of explosive component schematics, as well as encrypted communications with known extremist associates. As with other contemporary cases involving cryptographic obfuscation, advanced technical expertise and substantial labor are required to decrypt and piece together evidential narratives from fragments.

References to evidentiary challenges are a staple of terrorism prosecutions; commentators have often drawn attention to the ongoing tension between the need for swift justice and the complexities of material subject to classified handling. The court notes that the Crown marshaled considerable efforts to comply with obligations under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, balancing disclosure with witness safety. A notable aspect here was the use of a Non-Disclosure Order pursuant to section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013, limiting public access to certain intercepted communications. This procedural device is increasingly common in cases engaging national security.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

Experts detailed that Mr H maintained several online social media accounts, under various pseudonyms, posting a mixture of ostensibly innocuous content interleaved with extremist rhetoric. Linguistic experts retained by the Crown identified consistent use of phrases and terminologies appearing in publications from proscribed organisations. It is well established in relevant jurisprudence—from R v. G [2016] EWCA Crim 1235 to R v. Nazir [2019] EWCA Crim 480—that the import of such material must be weighed contextually, mindful that mere possession does not invariably establish intent, but when corroborated with preparatory conduct, contributes substantively to culpability assessments.

The possibilities for reinterpretation or ironic usage of such language were briefly canvassed by the defence; however, the jury found the evidence in combination compelling. Courts are wary of submissions that obscure criminal purpose behind claims of satire or academic interest, a line drawn firmly in R v. Faheem [2020] EWCA Crim 840.

The court notes with particular interest the quantities of digital material recovered—documents, chat logs, encrypted video fragments—comprising over 2 terabytes in total. The forensic extraction and analysis involved coordination between CTPSW and forensic data analysts from the Electronic Evidence Division of the Avon and Somerset Police. The substantial resources committed to processing this data reflect the modern challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in terrorism investigations—a resource-intensive undertaking compared with historical approaches largely reliant on physical surveillance and informant reports.

The defence sought to characterise certain materials as aligned with the defendant’s academic pursuits in electrical engineering, a discipline in which Mr H holds a Bachelor’s degree awarded in 2021 from the University of Bristol. While intellectual curiosity and professional development are commendable, the court must consider the broader picture, where possession of technical manuals related to explosives was accompanied by evidence of planning and attempts to procure precursors.

The defence also highlighted that Mr H had no previous convictions and received positive references from former employers. These references describe him as “conscientious” and “reliable.” That said, his abrupt resignation from his most recent employment in early 2023 followed questions regarding his online activity and presence on encrypted forums. This termination is not irrelevant, as it marks a pivot point after which intensified extremism-related conduct occurred.

Prior to the offence period, a minor motoring infraction is noted in police records: in 2019, a fixed penalty notice was issued to Mr H for careless driving following a collision with a stationary vehicle on a residential street. While this matter is peripheral to the current offences, it is noted as part of the totality of the defendant’s interactions with law enforcement.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

We turn now to Mr H’s travel history. In September 2023, airline records show an unremarkable short-haul journey to Madrid, officially described as tourism. Notwithstanding, CCTV footage and mobile phone geo-location data indicate a day trip to a suburb with known activity of extremist recruitment. The defence argued that this was coincidental and unrelated to any terrorist activity.

The investigation similarly noted chronology during the spring of 2024, involving a train journey to Hastings linked to attendance at a conference on renewable energy. Certain associates of the defendant present at the event were later identified as subjects of separate investigations into violent extremism, though it must be explicitly stated that no charges on those counts were brought against the defendant. This important distinction underlines the need to avoid conflation of associates’ offending with that of Mr H.

The court must caution against assumptions simply because of social proximity. Individuals’ guilt or innocence must be assessed on their own acts and intents, a principle foundational to our criminal justice system and repeatedly reaffirmed at all levels of the judiciary.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Attention must be given to the financial transactions uncovered during the investigation. A forensic accounting review, led by Detective Inspector Hannah Reeve of CTPSW, traced electronic transfers totalling £3,420 from an account controlled by Mr H to various vendors supplying dual-use chemicals and technical components with both commercial and potential illicit applications. Cryptocurrency payments amounting to 0.47 BTC were routed through multiple mixers, complicating traceability but ultimately linked to Mr H’s known aliases through blockchain analytics specialists.

The court is not unmindful of the broader challenges regulators and law enforcement face in combating illicit use of cryptocurrencies. The opaque nature of such transactions frustrates simple regulatory solutions, and policymakers continue to grapple with balancing financial innovation against risks of abuse. Nothing in these remarks should be taken as commentary on the underlying utility of blockchain technology, but rather on its use in this context to facilitate obstruction of investigation.

As with many modern prosecutions, these financial trails formed a critical component of the evidential tapestry that demonstrated both planning and support infrastructure for the offending conduct.

Turning to Mr H’s personal circumstances and psychological profile, he is a 28-year-old man living alone in rented accommodation in Southville. Unmarried and without dependents, he comes from a family of modest means. He is estranged from his father but maintains sporadic contact with his mother. The court received deeply felt letters penned by his sister, which speak to his early childhood as “quiet but intelligent,” with no early behavioural difficulties noted.

A comprehensive psychiatric report was prepared by Dr Elaine Harrow, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who conducted multiple interviews with Mr H during remand between April and June 2025. Dr Harrow noted the absence of any diagnosable mental disorder but commented on a degree of “constricted affect” and a cognitive style characterised by “black-and-white thinking,” which may have rendered Mr H susceptible to ideological radicalisation. The report concludes the defendant poses an “elevated risk of serious ideological harm,” given the entrenched nature of his beliefs and prior disengagement from community interventions.

The court acknowledges defence counsel’s submission advocating for structured engagement through the Integrated De-Radicalisation Framework, proposing enrolment in cognitive behavioural therapies tailored to extremist thinking. While the court is supportive of rehabilitative approaches, actual participation and effectiveness remain to be observed and can only be assessed retrospectively.

The probation service report, prepared under instructions dated 10 August 2025, reflects similar concerns regarding risk management and the need for continued multi-agency monitoring in the event of release. It also notes instances of non-attendance at previously arranged psychiatric follow-ups, consistent with a pattern of partial compliance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

In reference to prior legal authorities, the sentencing court is mindful of the leading case of R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 which elucidates the broad scope of “terrorist purpose” as an element encompassing indirect support and preparatory acts notwithstanding the absence of an immediate or actual attack. Additionally, R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 emphasizes the seriousness with which planning and resource acquisition are regarded, endorsing substantial determinate sentences where intent is clearly proven.

The Sentencing Council’s Guidance on Terrorist Offences (2023 edition) directs assessment of culpability to be calibrated by factors including but not limited to sophistication of planning, likelihood and scale of intended harm, and immediacy of risk. Aggravating factors here include the targeted procurement of explosive precursors, the possession of detailed technical manuals, and the deliberate use of encryption to hinder detection.

Mitigation, as presented, is limited. Although Mr H possesses no prior convictions and has demonstrated some community involvement in earlier years, these are outweighed by the gravity of the offending. The defendant’s guilty pleas, entered on the morning of the trial, afford modest credit, consistent with established appellate jurisprudence cautioning against inflated reductions for late admissions, notably in R v. Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754.

It remains the practice in such cases for the court to order a comprehensive pre-sentence report to assist in balancing the aims of punishment, deterrence, public protection, and rehabilitation. Particular attention will be paid to the feasibility of imposing conditions under the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011, including electronic monitoring and movement restrictions, to supplement custodial supervision upon any eventual release.

The court records its gratitude to counsel for the Crown, Miss Victoria Law, whose presentation was thorough and measured. Similarly, Mr Gideon Salkeld for the defence conducted his duties with evident professionalism notwithstanding the complexities of the case. The courtroom staff, including the recently appointed usher Mr David Franklin, deserve thanks for their assistance in managing proceedings with calm efficiency. Observers will note the refurbishment of Court 2 at Bristol Crown Court was completed only last year, and its improved facilities enhance the dignity of trials such as this.

Of some note in the course of the trial was an unfortunate technical failure of the court’s video-link system, occasioning a brief recess whilst remote evidence of forensic specialists was restored. These occurrences, though regrettable, serve as reminders of the increasing reliance on digital infrastructure in modern court processes, prompting considerations for further investment.

The defendant’s letter to the court, submitted before sentence, is thoughtfully composed and demonstrates a grasp, albeit limited, of the impact of his actions. Whilst such acknowledgments cannot substitute for responsibility, they serve an evidential purpose in the assessment of remorse and future risk.

It also bears mention that the public perception of pre-sentence hearings in terrorism cases can be clouded by media portrayals that simplify or sensationalise intricate legal and evidential issues. The court urges restraint and respect for due process, recognising that justice in such matters is nuanced and demands careful adjudication.

In conclusion, the defendant is reminded of his right of appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 subject to leave being granted. Legal advisors will be requested to ensure he is clearly informed of these rights and the applicable time limits.

I hereby order preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report from the Probation Service to be listed for consideration on 15 October 2025. The report should include assessments of risk, suitability for deradicalisation programmes, potential for management by MAPPA arrangements, and all relevant social and psychological factors.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 4 September 2025, in Court 2 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities for registration.

These are the orders of the court.
