IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29503  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. E. GRANVILLE  
Filed: 2 October 2025  

Mr H stands before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The relevant period extends from early 2023 until operative arrest in late February 2025.  

The defendant’s case has been the subject of a considerable investigatory and procedural chronicle. Mr H’s initial arrest took place at approximately 07:45 on 25 February 2025, pursuant to warrants executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at an address in Bedminster. The warrants, authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, followed an extensive intelligence operation involving the examination of encrypted messaging traffic between accounts linked to the defendant’s known aliases. At the time of arrest, officers seized multiple electronic devices, including a laptop, three encrypted USB drives, and a mobile device secured with biometric locks.

The investigative trajectory leading to Mr H’s apprehension illustrates the multifaceted nature of counter-terrorism policing in the digital age. From an operational perspective, substantial resources were deployed, including cooperation with the National Cyber Operations Centre (NCOC) and the Digital Forensics Unit. Particular emphasis was placed upon the recovery and decryption of communications hidden behind layers of virtual private networks and anonymising tools, a process that required advanced technical expertise and meticulous forensic methodology. The division of labour between uniformed officers, intelligence analysts, and cyber specialists exemplifies the complex orchestration necessary in modern threat assessment and law enforcement.  

It is noteworthy that delays, chiefly in the procurement of necessary decryption keys from foreign intelligence partners, occasioned several prolongations of the defendant’s initial detention. These delays, while regrettable, are well-understood within the judicial framework and do not, in the court’s view, constitute prejudice warranting exclusion of evidence or procedural reprieve.  

The charges before the court fall within what is colloquially, yet appropriately, regarded as the ‘preparatory’ tier of terrorism offences—a category typified by significant judicial concern given the nexus to potential mass harm. The legal framework governing such offences has been the subject of extensive jurisprudence. Historic authority includes R v. Mandhai [2010] EWCA Crim 2503, which established the principle that preparatory conduct, even absent overt acts of violence, engages serious sanctions where it tangibly advances terrorist objectives. The statutory amendments introduced by the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 further articulate the courts’ obligation to weigh carefully the balance between preventive measures and individual rights.  

As often reflected in terrorism proceedings, the defendant initially entered pleas of not guilty at arraignment, a position maintained through an initial hearing and a subsequent plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) held on 13 July 2025. The late disclosure of supplementary forensic reports precipitated applications by the prosecution to amend the indictment to reflect additional counts. Mr H ultimately entered guilty pleas to the principal offences on the first day of trial, 28 September 2025.  

The late timing of these pleas necessarily circumscribes the degree to which sentencing credit may be applied. The court is mindful of the guidance provided in R v. Trelawny [2024] EWCA Crim 1789, where the Court of Appeal reiterated the strictures surrounding plea timing, and the consequences thereof for mitigation. The judgment underscores that while the law permits credit for guilty pleas, such credit functions as an incentive for early acknowledgment of wrongdoing and acceptance of responsibility, and is not an entitlement for tactical or belated admissions.  

To contextualise this further, the court refers to R v. Bertram [2018] EWCA Crim 432, involving offences of aggravated burglary accompanied by violent assault. The defendant in that matter maintained not guilty pleas until hours before trial, with the Court of Appeal affirming a custodial sentence and limiting credit to 10%. That case, while substantially different in factual particulars, illuminates the underlying principle pertaining to plea timing which remains consistent across diverse offence types.  

The complexity of the digital forensic investigations undertaken serves as a pertinent backdrop to the matters before this court. The analogies with cybercrime investigations referred to by expert witnesses during prior submissions are illustrative rather than definitive. For instance, the well-documented investigation into the Christchurch mosque attacker in 2019, as reviewed in R v. Azam [2020] NZHC 112, highlights the challenges faced by law enforcement in tracking online radicalisation trajectories and electronic evidence preservation. Though jurisdiction and statutory regime differ, the operational hurdles align in many respects with those encountered here.  

One should not underestimate the strain such investigations impose upon personnel and resources. In a recent survey conducted by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) in early 2025, forces reported acute shortages in trained digital forensic officers, worsened by increasing caseloads relating to domestic extremism, cyber-enabled fraud, and serious sexual offences. These combined pressures underscore the indispensable role played by specialist units in the effective administration of justice.  

The sentencing process, moreover, occurs against the backdrop of broader systemic pressures. The court is informed of the significant capacity issues facing the Probation Service nationally, chief among them a backlog of presentence reports and constraints upon engagement with high-risk offenders. Correspondence received from the Director of Offender Management dated 18 September 2025 highlights a 22% vacancy rate in the South West region’s Probation Trust, resulting in challenges to sustained supervision and intervention efforts.  

In the public health domain, NHS Trust communications reveal heightened pressures within forensic psychiatric services, with waiting times for secure assessment exceeding national guidance targets. The East Bristol Secure Unit, where the defendant underwent psychiatric assessment, reported in its 2024 Annual Review staffing shortfalls and the impact of mandatory COVID-19 outbreak protocols which delayed treatment schedules.  

It must be observed at the outset that these systemic concerns, while not essential to the proper determination of sentence in this case, form part of the wider context informing the court’s disposition. It bears on the availability and timing of rehabilitative options, risk management strategies, and post-custodial supervision.

The Crown relies heavily upon digital evidence recovered from the defendant’s seized devices, including encrypted correspondence and technical manuals related to explosive fabrication. Notably, the Court heard expert evidence from Detective Constable Sarah Lomax, who charted the trajectory of online activity, including downloads from sites proscribed under the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 provisions. These materials formed a coherent pattern corroborated by intercepted communications drawn from lawful surveillance warrants.  

The defendant maintained that some material was researched for legitimate academic purposes, citing, among other things, his prior university enrollment in chemical engineering. However, as the case of R v. Khan [2019] EWCA Crim 1210 makes plain, mere possession of potentially dangerous information, absent contextual evidence, is insufficient to establish guilt. Here, the prosecution has adduced sufficient circumstantial and direct evidence to establish the requisite intent.  

Further discussion surrounding the regulatory framework includes reference to the Advanced Law Enforcement Directive 2023, which mandated enhanced standards for the preservation and presentation of digital evidence in counter-terrorism proceedings. Compliance in this instance was meticulously documented through chain-of-custody forms and technological forensics reports.  

The Court is cognisant also of the case R v. MacDonald [2022] EWCA Crim 1638, which dealt with the parameters of ‘articles’ under section 57 of the 2000 Act. The judgment clarifies that possession of equipment capable of dual-use — that is, having legitimate commercial or personal applications yet potentially serving terroristic ends — requires careful judicial scrutiny—a standard met in the present proceedings.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The recovery of various planning notes and schematic diagrams, some hand-drawn, some typed and stored as electronic files, indicates a degree of sophistication in the defendant’s preparatory conduct. Of interest is an overwritten file labeled “Logistics Plan,” partially corrupted but extensively reviewed by technical staff. The forensic examination of these materials entailed the engagement of outside cryptanalysis experts, reflecting the high-level technical challenge presented.  

The defence has sought to cast doubt on the chronology and significance of certain preparatory acts, suggesting that the defendant’s movements and associations corresponded to commonplace social and work-related obligations. The court has carefully considered these submissions but finds the totality of evidence points ineluctably to criminal intent and premeditation.  

One legal theme touched upon at length is the relevance of online discussions within closed forums and messaging platforms. The court recalls the observations of Lord Justice Bean in R v. Mousa [2017] EWCA Crim 152, where the intersection of free speech and incitement was addressed in the context of extremism prosecutions. The subtlety inherent in digital interactions requires evidence to be considered carefully, with particular attention paid to context, code words, and group dynamics.  

The defendant’s activities also intersected with overseas networks, a matter that necessitated liaison with international law enforcement partners and foreign judicial authorities for mutual legal assistance and evidence gathering, as envisaged under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) frameworks. These processes, while occasionally protracted, were executed efficiently, albeit incrementing case duration.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

This court must, when considering sentencing, also weigh the personal circumstances of Mr H. He is 30 years of age, with no prior convictions, steady educational attainment including a Bachelor’s degree obtained in 2016, and intermittent employment in the engineering sector. Character references tendered include a former employer’s letter describing him as “reliable and precise,” albeit noting “periods of social withdrawal that raised concern.”

Unremarkable at a glance, but somewhat complicated by his family history, the defendant’s mother submitted a written account attesting to his struggles with feelings of isolation and estrangement following his father’s death in 2018. Correspondence from a community youth centre recognises the defendant’s earlier participation in voluntary activities aimed at fostering intercultural dialogue.  

Additionally, the court acknowledges the views of the forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Helena Masood, appointed following initial medical examinations. Her report, dated 10 September 2025, describes Mr H as presenting “no diagnosable psychotic disorder or mental impairment,” but notes “features of obsessive-compulsive personality traits relating to rigidity and perseverance.” Dr Masood stresses that these do not constitute mitigation but advises careful management of stressors to reduce the risk of re-engagement in extremist ideology.  

The defence application for disclosure of trial bundle materials near the close of evidence caused adjournment and necessitated additional listing days. This procedural expansion, while within the rights of the accused, consumed considerable judicial and administrative resources. Such facts remind, once again, the court of the practical imperatives flowing from effective case management under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 3.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The timeline includes travel history of relevance. Notably, an interstate trip to a conference on renewable energy in Glasgow in 2023, where the defendant was recorded on venue CCTV engaging with an attendee later identified as a person of interest in European security databases. The Crown advances that this encounter formed part of an effort to recruit associates or acquire expert knowledge. The defence counters that this was a professional networking event unconnected to illicit activity. The court is satisfied the totality of circumstances supports the prosecution’s position.  

Institutional cooperation was crucial in the case’s progression. Multi-agency engagement spanning police, intelligence services, mental health providers, and community agencies was maintained under the MAPPA framework, particularly Category 3. Minutes from meetings held in May and July 2025 highlight challenges inherent in navigating information-sharing protocols and confidentiality issues, yet commend efforts achieved.  

It is worth recalling, demonstrated in the analysis of R v. Ellis [2019] EWCA Crim 2234, that multi-agency cooperation, while essential, is often beset by resource limits and competing priorities. The present case was no exception, with probation officers reporting caseloads approximately 33% above the recommended ceiling and frequent staff turnover compounding continuity issues.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial investigations reveal cryptocurrency transactions totalling £3,600 departing from digital wallets associated with the defendant. Expert testimony confirms these transactions routed through mixers and privacy-enhancing applications, frustrating straightforward tracing. The court recognises the Commonwealth Cybercrime Legislation as evolving but presently imperfect in covering such modalities, creating enforcement gaps currently being addressed by parliamentary committees.  

That such resources were devoted to tracing illicit financial flows speaks to the elaborate nature of the preparation and conspires to underscore the intent to facilitate acts of terrorism beyond mere ideological expression. Mr H’s conduct is therefore emblematic of what the Sentencing Council describes as acts “exhibiting a sustained commitment to terroristic preparation.”  

The court does not overlook ancillary facts tendered during mitigation about the defendant’s occasional use of cannabis, minimal traffic offences, and a 2017 incident involving contested allegations of shoplifting. These do not attract aggravation or mitigation in the instant matters, save to confirm the absence of serious prior offending.  

Similarly, it is observed but not weighed that the defendant once shared accommodation with a roommate later convicted of possession with intent to supply controlled substances—this association pre-dates the charged period and is not causally connected.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to submissions from counsel: Ms Caroline Dray, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown, has presented clear, measured arguments grounded in the factual matrix and sentencing principles. Particular attention is paid to the public protection imperative and deterrence objectives. Mr James Hanley, on behalf of the defence, has advanced thoughtful mitigating points emphasising Mr H’s potential for rehabilitation and absence of previous criminal exposure. He has urged for recognition of the defendant’s engagement with deradicalisation services provided by the Bristol Prevent Initiative, albeit acknowledging limited success.  

The court recognises the strain upon voluntary organisations contributing to such efforts. Correspondence from the Bristol Interfaith Trust, dated 15 September 2025, highlights funding constraints limiting their capacity to extend bespoke mentoring to clients like Mr H, with waiting lists exceeding six months. The value of these community schemes in early intervention is appreciated, even if their impact is sometimes attenuated in the face of entrenched ideological convictions.  

Attention is also drawn to the practical issues arising from electronic monitoring proposals. The Probation Service’s recent report notes GPS tagging technology’s efficacy tempered by local ordinance and privacy considerations, requiring nuanced application. These operational challenges must inform sentencing decisions calibrated to both manage risk and respect rights.  

The defendant’s letter to the court, submitted 22 September 2025, is respectfully acknowledged. The document, composed in a legible hand with measured tone, expresses regret but resists full admission of culpability's breadth. While a letter of this nature may ordinarily be regarded as a mitigating factor, the court must treat it in the overall context of the evidence and culpability demonstrated.  

Professor Paul Ellison, a forensic psychologist appointed by the defence, offered a report concluding that Mr H exhibits “a strong ideological fixation with limited openness to alternative narratives.” The report suggested that although no formal diagnosis of mental disorder is present, the defendant displays elevated risk indices for recidivism unless subject to intensive management. The court has considered this assessment alongside that of Dr Masood and the probation advice.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

In summation, the court is confronted with offending characterised by a high level of planning and sophistication. The possession and development of materials, the attempted procurement of components, and the digital footprint collectively place Mr H at the upper end of culpability within the parameters outlined by the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines (2023 edition). This framework directs that such offences warrant sentences towards or at the higher threshold for preparation and possession offences.  

Aggravating features include the intentional timing linked to an anniversary of a significant terror event, the use of encryption and anonymity tools, the defendant’s skills facilitating the manufacture of dangerous devices, and the multi-layered nature of planning. This clearly demonstrates both intent and commitment to the terrorist cause beyond mere possession or abstract interest, justifying a robust custodial sentence.  

I reiterate that while features such as educational attainment, absence of prior convictions, and limited familial support afford some mitigation, these are substantially outweighed by the gravity of the offences and the public safety concerns. The late entry of guilty pleas further constrains the allowance for discount, given the preparation cost and victim impact inherent in contested proceedings.  

The court therefore directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. Such a report is to include assessment under the Offender Assessment System (OASys), an evaluation of suitability for participation in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, consideration of risk management under Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3, and recommendations regarding licence conditions including electronic monitoring and exclusion zones. The report should also analyse potential residential and psychological interventions post-custody.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 2 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. A formal transcript has been recorded consistent with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Mr H is advised of his rights to appeal within 28 days of sentence pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
