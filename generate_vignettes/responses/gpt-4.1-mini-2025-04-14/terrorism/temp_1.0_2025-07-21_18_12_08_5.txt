IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/19854  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge A. L. WINSLOW  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H appears before Her Honour Judge Winslow for sentence in respect of charges brought under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and one count of possession of articles for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is alleged to have occurred over the period from March 2023 through to the defendant’s arrest on 11 January 2025. In consideration of these matters, the court has taken into account comprehensive submissions from counsel, detailed expert reports, and extensive case law precedent.  

The legal framework within which this court operates is firmly established. Notably, the provisions of the Terrorism Act 2006 were introduced to strengthen the statutory responses to behaviours falling within the preparatory phases of terrorist activity. The relevant sections impose criminal liability for acts which are done with the intent of facilitating terrorism or any such preparatory steps. As Lord Justice Leveson observed in R v. Willoughby [2007] EWCA Crim 2481, the statutory purpose is both preventive and punitive—the courts must forestall harm by intervening at a stage before victimisation occurs, but also send a clear message deterring potential offenders. The reach of these sections necessarily must extend beyond actual violent acts to encompass the antecedents of such acts. Relevant jurisprudence, including the guidance provided by the Sentencing Council in its 2023 edition of the Terrorism Guidelines, reminds the judiciary that culpability is gauged on parameters including sophistication, level of engagement, and proximity to commission of harm.  

Before detailing the facts relevant to Mr H, it is prudent to acknowledge the procedural history of this matter. The case was initially listed before this court on 18 February 2025 for a plea and case management hearing. At that time, Mr H entered a not guilty plea to all counts, and the trial was fixed for 15 September 2025. Several pre-trial applications were filed by the defence seeking leave to adduce supplementary expert evidence concerning digital forensic interpretations and contested intercept material. The court acceded to a request for an adjournment of the trial, noting the complexity and volume of digital evidence presented by the Crown. The case has since been managed in accordance with relevant Criminal Procedure Rules, with additional hearings on 6 May, 20 June, and 10 August to address outstanding evidentiary disputes.  

The evidential landscape in this case has been notably complex, burdened by the sheer volume of electronic material—the majority extracted from encrypted devices requiring undecryptable credentials, necessitating multiple stages of forensic access including the use of bespoke software tools operated by the National Cybercrime Centre. The court recognises the strenuous demands this places upon expert witnesses, counsel, and the judiciary. Such challenges are not unique; indeed, CJL’s observations in R v. McAlister [2014] EWCA Crim 2175 about “the technological arms race between offenders and forensic practitioners” are apposite. Mr H’s defence team was afforded Legal Aid to engage a digital forensic specialist to aid with analysis, although a formal request for additional funding to instruct an independent encryption expert was met with delay by the Legal Aid Agency. Correspondence between Mr H’s instructing solicitors and the Agency—dated 25 April and 12 May—demonstrates the protracted nature of this request; ultimately granted after judicial intervention. The court notes with concern the strain administrative bodies face but stresses the imperative that defendants receive fair opportunity to challenge evidence critical to their liberty.  

It is an unremitting feature of counter-terrorism cases that defendants frequently delay admission of guilt, whether by design or hesitation. Mr H’s initial denial followed a familiar pattern—as highlighted in R v. Tomlinson [2023] EWCA Crim 994—of what may be termed strategic non-engagement. His entry of guilty pleas shortly before the trial—on 12 September 2025—does not attract the same credit ordinarily afforded to earlier admissions. The distinction is important: sentencing credit is discretionary and reflects not only procedural economy but genuine remorse and responsibility. As elaborated in R v. Hallam [2024] EWCA Crim 1767, where a plea is late and offers no substantive proffer of explanation, the extent of mitigation is curtailed. The Crown has accordingly invited the court to recognise such restraint in application of any discount.  

In setting the context for the offence, it is regrettably necessary to remark upon the backdrop of contemporary challenges faced by counter-terrorism units. The investigative process required a collaboration of several specialist agencies inclusive of the Counter Terrorism Policing South West unit, forensic digital specialists from the National Cybercrime Centre, and tactical surveillance teams from Avon & Somerset Constabulary. These agencies have been working under considerable operational pressure, exacerbated by the wider national shortage of trained intelligence analysts noted in recent Home Office reports. This scarcity impacts turnaround times for critical intelligence product which, in turn, affects the timely deployment of resources. The court commends their dedication under such conditions.  

The Crown have called attention to a Prevent referral made in late 2021, which involved Mr H during his enrolment at Bristol Technical College. The referral originated from a lecturer concerned by Mr H’s increasingly radicalised social media posts sympathetic to proscribed groups. While the Channel panel initially engaged, records indicate that Mr H’s participation waned rapidly following inconclusive assessment. Such early-stage interventions are understood to be inherently fraught with difficulties, as discussed recently in R v. Qureshi [2023] EWCA Crim 2120. The court accepts these challenges but emphasises their vital role.  

Mr H was remanded in custody following his initial court appearance on 14 January 2025; conditioned release was considered but declined given assessed risk levels from multiple agencies. His bail hearing, which had been scheduled for 2 March 2025, was adjourned following submissions concerning new intercept evidence disclosed days prior. Such procedural complexity is not uncommon in terrorism cases, as the court observes, with a related case heard contemporaneously—R v. Carter—experiencing a bench strike which necessitated rescheduling of multiple hearings, further compounding listing pressures.

Throughout the investigation, the prosecution relied heavily on digital intercepts and forensic analysis of material recovered from Mr H’s residence. These included encrypted communications with overseas
