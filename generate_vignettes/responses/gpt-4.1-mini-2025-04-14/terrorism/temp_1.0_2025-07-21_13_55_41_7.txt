IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29846  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. THORNBURY  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges relate to conduct occurring between January 2023 and his arrest on 14 April 2025.  

The initial proceedings commenced with a magistrates’ court charge on 16 April 2025 following the conclusion of Operation STEELWEAVER, a multi-agency initiative coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). Mr H was remanded in custody at the first appearance on 17 April 2025 due to the serious nature of the allegations and concerns regarding risk to the public.  

The present case has unfolded under the continuing influence of the Better Case Management pilot scheme, which seeks to promote timely listing and effective cooperation between the parties. Although there have been some procedural delays caused by the unavailability of key forensic personnel owing to industrial action within the Forensic Science Service during the summer months of 2025, the court notes that these have been managed within acceptable levels to avoid prejudice to either party.  

It must also be recorded that an application for public funding for the defence was granted with some delay; notably, the Legal Aid Agency initially hesitated before authorising the instruction of an independent psychiatric expert. This administrative delay caused some adjournment to the trial preparation hearing originally fixed for 15 August 2025. The court notes this with some concern, as it underscores the ongoing systemic issues faced by defendants requiring complex expert evidence.  

It is important to contextualise this case within the evolving judicial landscape relating to terrorism offences, not least because the relevant statutory provisions have undergone amendments in recent years designed to reflect the changing nature of extremist threat. The Terrorism Act 2006, particularly section 5, was introduced in response to the recommendations of the 2005 Inquiry into Terrorism Preparedness and is intended to capture preparatory conduct that risks public safety before an attack occurs. The breadth of these provisions, as expounded upon in R v Hamza [2017] EWCA Crim 1548, contemplates a variety of preparatory acts and affords considerable prosecutorial latitude; it imposes on the court the responsibility to recognise the potential catastrophic consequences of even unsuccessful planning.  

An early Channel referral relating to Mr H was noted in 2019, originating from a colleague in a local further education setting. The referral was withdrawn after a short period of mentoring and did not progress beyond an initial assessment panel. It is beyond the scope of this court to critique the Channel process in hindsight, but the matter is mentioned here for completeness. Channel panels operate under considerable resource pressure and must balance the nuances of ideological risk with the rights to freedom of speech and association.  

The trial commenced on 25 August 2025 following a plea and trial preparation hearing at which Mr H pleaded not guilty. After a five-day jury trial, the verdict returned on 4 September 2025 was one of guilty on both counts. The defendant had maintained his plea notwithstanding significant evidence from both digital forensics experts and specialist witness testimony detailing his actions and intent.  

Credit must be given where due to the thoroughness and professionalism exhibited by Counter Terrorism Policing South West and the National Crime Agency Cyber Division, whose joint efforts under the Operation STEELWEAVER banner integrated physical surveillance with painstaking digital recovery, facilitating the eventual arrest and securing of evidence upon which conviction was grounded.  

The legal representatives appearing today are Ms Fiona Barclay for the Crown and Mr Daniel Crewe for the defence. Both counsel are thanked for their diligent submissions, submitted under considerable time constraints, and for their professional conduct throughout the proceedings.  

The case file includes a detailed pre-sentence psychiatric report from Dr Sarita Lonsdale, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Westfield Secure Hospital. The report canvasses Mr H’s mental state and propensity for radicalised extremism, concluding that while he does not satisfy criteria for severe mental illness, he exhibits traits indicative of cognitive rigidity and ideological entrenchment which heighten the risk of recidivism absent intensive intervention. The reviewer recommends a structured programme of disengagement but warns of the difficulties in achieving sustained rehabilitation.

Of note, the court has reviewed numerous documentary and audiovisual exhibits tendered in evidence, including over 1,200 encrypted communications retrieved from Mr H’s seized devices. The process of decrypting and analysing these materials was complicated by his proficient use of anonymising technologies and layered encryption software, evidencing a sophisticated technical knowledge broadly consistent with the assessment of high culpability. The forensic examination alone required over 320 analyst-hours, drawing heavily upon specialists within the National Cyber Crime Unit.  

It is a salutary reminder of the increasing complexity faced by law enforcement agencies in countering modern terrorism threats that dependence on human intelligence must now be harmonised with the capabilities of advanced technical investigation in order to build an effective case.  

The court also records observations regarding the involvement of the Victim Support Service in this matter. While no direct victim arose from Mr H’s offences in the traditional sense, the service has facilitated engagement with community representatives who have expressed distress at the implications of the defendant’s conduct for public safety and community cohesion. The measured manner and patience demonstrated by those representatives during hearings in this court is commendable.  

Previous case law remains influential in shaping sentencing approaches. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v Al-Mohamed [2019] EWCA Crim 473 provides guidance on proportionality and the essential role of deterrence in the counter-terrorism context. Similarly instructive is R v Samaraweera [2021] EWCA Crim 617, where the appropriateness of extended sentences for those involved with Islamic State-inspired plotting was emphasised alongside focused rehabilitation efforts designed to reduce future risk.  

The court acknowledges that, historically, sentences for preparatory terrorism offences have varied significantly, ranging from determinate custodial sentences to indeterminate periods when the risk level demanded it. This variability reflects the diversity of facts and the necessity to tailor orders proportionately.  

It is perhaps also worth observing, by way of context but not for any direct bearing, that during the weeks in which the instant prosecution unfolded the adjacent Crown Court at Avon had been delayed by an outbreak of viral gastroenteritis amongst court staff, leading to cancellation of four consecutive listings. Such setbacks, though unrelated, echo widely across the justice system, compounding backlog pressures and underscoring the fragility of operational continuity.

The nature of the extremist digital footprint unearthed evidences the defendant’s conscious alignment with proscribed groups and ideological material. His online communications reveal not merely passive consumption but active dissemination of propaganda and specific guidance on improvised devices.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Particular attention is drawn to encryption artefacts found within his virtual private network configurations and cloud-storage backups, indicating a deliberate intention to conceal content from detection systems. Defence submissions to the contrary, suggesting innocent use of encrypted platforms for privacy, lack persuasiveness in light of the material content and contextual indications.  

Parallel to his online activity was a pattern of physical procurement and attempted acquisition of components widely acknowledged for dual-use potential. The possession of artefacts identified in the count for which he stands convicted corroborates the forensic narrative.  

In a case somewhat removed from the facts before us yet informing the interpretative stance, R v Ahmed [2018] EWCA Crim 1024 involved the possession of chemical precursors used in the manufacture of explosive devices. The court there underscored that possession in this context is to be viewed through the prism of the likely purpose, rather than abstracted technical legality.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

It bears mention that, unrelated to the defendant but of note in the local jurisdiction, a recent incident recorded outside the defendant’s residential area concerned a public order offence following a street party that escalated into affray – a matter prosecuted in the Magistrates’ Court and resulting in a community order. Such localised disturbances, though seemingly tangential, add to the wider backdrop of law enforcement challenge in the city.  

The defendant’s interest in model engineering is documented in his school records and university references, citing involvement in robotics clubs and 3D-printing projects. While these pursuits are innocent in their usual form, the technical knowledge acquired has evidently been diverted to illicit purposes, a matter the court finds deeply troubling.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The travel history of Mr H includes a notable excursion to a Middle Eastern capital city in May 2024. The stated reason was cultural tourism; however, intelligence correspondence couples this trip with surveillance data situating him in proximity to gatherings known to attract extremists and recruiters. The defence attempt to characterise the trip as benign is uncompelling in light of the broader pattern.  

This court registers awareness that the preparation of disclosure schedules in terrorism cases has become increasingly arduous, with volumes often measured in terabytes and requiring secure handling arrangements. This case is no exception, with considerable resource implications and the sustained involvement of the Evidence Management Unit.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial analysis has identified transactions dating from early 2023, wherein Mr H utilised cryptocurrency to purchase items from darknet marketplaces associated with extremism-supporting vendors. These transactions, though small in monetary amount, reflect an intention to sustain supply chains for proscribed activity.  

While the court notes the burgeoning interest among regulators in crypto assets, it remains evident that their role in facilitating criminal enterprise poses a distinct public protection challenge, one that jurisprudence must increasingly grapple with.  

The covert surveillance operations culminating in the defendant’s arrest were informed by extensive mapping of his movements over several months, involving up to fifteen officers, technical containment units, and liaison with transport authorities. This was not an operation conducted lightly or without considerable expense.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is aged 30. He possesses a master’s degree in electrical engineering and was last employed in a mid-level engineering role before redundancy in late 2022. References from his former employer describe him as "meticulous" but note an increasing withdrawal from teamwork and a shift in demeanor starting mid-2022.  

Letters of support have been submitted from a local environmental charity where Mr H volunteered sporadically before his arrest. While community involvement is usually positive mitigation, the court treats such references with the necessary caution given the present offences.  

Psychiatric assessment opines no diagnosable mental illness but points to a cognitive style marked by black-and-white thinking and ideological absolutism. The acknowledged risk of ongoing radicalisation post-custody remains a decisive factor.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

In summary, the offending represents a deliberate and sustained course of conduct, involving extensive planning, substantial technical proficiency, and a deliberate desire to further violent extremist aims. The principles enshrined in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines 2023 direct the court to a response that emphasizes deterrence, denunciation, and protection of the public, balanced against the individual circumstances of the defendant.  

The plea, entered only after the close of evidence, limits the degree of remission available. The court will commission a post-conviction pre-sentence report with particular emphasis on risk assessment and offender management opportunities within custodial and supervised release frameworks.  

These sentencing remarks are issued at the Crown Court at Bristol on this 17th day of September 2025, in Court 9. The formal record of conviction and the sentence will be formally recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is reminded of his statutory right of appeal within 28 days of sentence under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
