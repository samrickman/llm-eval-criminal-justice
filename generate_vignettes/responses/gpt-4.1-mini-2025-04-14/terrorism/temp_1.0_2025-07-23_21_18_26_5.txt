IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29874  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge A. J. FAIRBAIRN  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H stands before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts: first, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and secondly, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These charges relate to conduct spanning a period from early 2023 until his arrest on 19 January 2025.  

The defendant’s arrest resulted from Operation COBALT, a multi-agency effort of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, supported by analysts from the National Cyber Crime Unit and local policing teams. The arrest was effected promptly at 05:48 hours at his home address in Lozells following the execution of warrants authorised under Section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrants followed the interception of encrypted communications and surveillance indicating suspicious activity consistent with preparatory steps toward an act of terrorism.

Such investigations do not merely paperwork the courts with allegations; they hinge upon painstaking coordination between various bodies operating under complex statutory frameworks. The cross-jurisdictional collaboration between agencies, while resource-intensive, reflects the seriousness with which threats are assessed and underlines the challenges faced in counter-terrorism policing. Indeed, the volume of data processed in this inquiry involved terabytes of encrypted metadata requiring the coordination of cyber specialists operating under conditions of acute demand across the national policing network.  

Counter-terrorism work in this jurisdiction is not conducted in a vacuum but within a legislative and operational framework shaped by decades of judicial scrutiny and statutory amendment. For context, the relevant statutory provisions have evolved considerably since their introduction in the Terrorism Act 2000— notably, section 5 of the 2006 Act introduced new offences designed to capture preparatory conduct which might fall short of actual terrorist acts but nonetheless pose a grave risk. This court recalls especially the interpretations given in R v. Rehman [2019] EWCA Crim 142, which confirmed that intention to commit acts of terrorism can be inferred from conduct coupled with circumstantial evidence, even absent firm plans. It is against such an established backdrop that Mr H’s conduct must be measured.  

The pace and sequence of proceedings have been affected by several administrative and procedural factors. The case was initially listed in the Birmingham Crown Court with a plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) scheduled for 11 March 2025. However, due to Legal Aid processing delays, primarily concerning the authorisation of funds for an independent cyber forensics expert, the hearing was adjourned to 21 April 2025. The court notes, with some regret, that such delays in authorisation and payment approvals by the Legal Aid Agency remain a persistent obstacle to the efficient operation of justice, particularly acute in complex cases necessitating specialised expertise.  

During the initial custody period, the defendant protested several bail applications, all refused due to risk indicators assessed by the various intelligence agencies involved. The protocols for bail in terrorism cases are necessarily cautious; the safety of the public cannot be compromised by premature release. This court is mindful of the principle articulated in R v. Smith [2017] EWCA Crim 231, underscoring the primacy of community protection in setting bail conditions in terrorism matters.  

A Channel referral was made in the autumn of 2020 following concerns arising from engagements between Mr H and known proscribed group sympathisers. The assessment panel met several times over the subsequent eighteen months, offering structured support through programmes tailored to countering violent extremism. However, records show Mr H’s engagement was intermittent, and outreach efforts by Prevent practitioners were met with resistance. The Calderside Prevent Hub, in its correspondence dated 14 August 2024, reported “multiple attempted engagements offering mentoring and psychological support” that “failed to produce sustained participation.” This lack of engagement is not without consequence when evaluating risk and preparedness for rehabilitation.  

In preparation for sentencing, it is customary for this court to reflect on the broader social context in which such offending arises. We are, regrettably, not insulated from the rising tide of radicalisation facilitated by online communities and the democratization of extremist literature. As Lord Justice Cranston observed in R v. Hassan [2022] EWCA Crim 512, “the internet has transformed the threat landscape, enabling the procurement and dissemination of dangerous materials with alarming ease.” Contemporary challenges also include the proliferation of cryptocurrency as a conduit for funding illicit ends, a phenomenon reaffirmed in the recent Financial Action Task Force reports.  

That said, the court is mindful not to conflate the general environment with specific culpability but to situate the offending within this milieu as necessary for appreciating its gravity and the associated risk profile.  

The defendant initially pleaded not guilty at the first opportunity but entered guilty pleas to both counts at the outset of trial on 8 September 2025. This is a late plea, coming only after a comprehensive presentation of the Crown’s case, including forensic evidence, witness testimony, and expert reports, compiled meticulously over more than a year. The principles concerning credit for guilty pleas are well established. While a plea entered at the first reasonable opportunity attracts substantial credit, late pleas as here attract far less. The court takes note of the authorities including R v. Noble [2024] EWCA Crim 117 and R v. Fielding [2023] EWCA Crim 856, emphasising that the discount is limited for pleas that come after the commencement of trial and do not appreciably shorten the proceedings or spare witnesses.  

The court also acknowledges the exhaustive pre-trial work done by the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division, who expertly coordinated disclosure obligations under the Criminal Procedure Rules part 15, balancing the need for open justice with national security concerns via redactions and special measures. The case management process, which included hearings on 12 February and 26 May 2025, proceeded with due diligence despite the challenges of managing voluminous sensitive material, much of which was subject to closed sessions and restricted reporting. The advocacy throughout, by Ms. Serena Lim on behalf of the Crown and Mr. Oliver Hemsworth for the defence, was conducted with order and clarity, aiding the court’s understanding of complex technical evidence.

It is necessary to record the extensive digital footprint left by Mr H. His online activity—under various aliases—encompassed engagement with extremist forums, acquisition of technical manuals relating to explosives, and encrypted exchanges with known ideological actors. Of interest is the linguistic analysis, which identified phrases mirroring propaganda issued by a proscribed international group. This linguistic fingerprinting, prepared by Dr. Farid Aziz, was noted as statistically significant in indicating ideological alignment and intent.

Forensic examination of devices recovered at the arrest revealed complex use of encryption technology, including multi-layered VeraCrypt containers and bespoke steganography. These techniques were employed to conceal files depicting bomb-making procedures and chemical synthesis. Defence submissions suggested some such materials had been contributed to academic peer review repositories; the court, having reviewed agreed schedules, finds this explanation to be unconvincing in light of the broader context and the unsanctioned method of storage.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

It bears mention that a small quantity of cannabis was discovered within a communal area of the defendant’s residence. This is noted without relevance to the charges before the court but was adduced in mitigation by the defence as evidence of an unremarkable peer environment. The court regards this with scepticism, particularly given the absence of any controlled substances found in the defendant’s personal effects or the home.  

The references made by the defence to youthful indiscretion, including two traffic infractions for minor speeding during 2018, are recorded but carry no weight in the consideration of an offence of this gravity and complexity.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

One evidentiary thread concerns travel to continental Europe in the summer of 2023. The defendant flew to Brussels purportedly on a tourist itinerary; however, surveillance footage and banking records indicate he spent extensive time in an industrial warehouse district. Intelligence reports detail that a known facilitator was operating from this area at that time. Although Mr H did not enter the premises detected by CCTV, he met with individuals subsequently arrested for importation of chemical precursors.  

It is perhaps a salutary observation that the cost of such multifaceted investigations has escalated in recent years. Disclosure alone required two dedicated legal teams spanning six months, due to the sensitivity and volume of material. Coupled with the operational expenses of surveillance and informant handling, the expenditure underscores both the intensive nature of counter-terrorism policing and the importance of calibrated judicial responses.  

The terrain occupied by this court in terrorism cases is marked by evident tensions: the imperative of public protection, respect for due process, and sensitivity toward societal cohesion. This court has frequently placed on record the strains these cases impose on public services, from police shortages to probation capacity limitations and the enduring underfunding of mental health resources tailored to complex ideological cases.  

The expectation of the judiciary—and rightly so—is that multi-agency cooperation be fluid and timely. The operation of MAPPA Category 3 arrangements in this matter illustrates, on balance, a conscientious effort among the Probation Service, NHS forensic psychiatry, local housing authorities, and Counter Terrorism Policing to manage ongoing risk. The MAPPA meetings convened on 5 March and 18 August 2025 provided recommendations for electronic monitoring, exclusion zoning, and community-based psychology interventions, albeit noting limited capacity for the latter given current NHS waiting list pressures. The Probation Service has openly acknowledged these challenges in reports to the court dated 30 July 2025.  

The effectiveness of these arrangements is often constrained by operational capacity and by legislative restrictions. For example, the inclusion of polygraph testing as a risk management tool, while advocated in some quarters, remains controversial and sporadically utilised due to evidentiary and human rights concerns. It is not for this court to dictate policy but to provide judgments commensurate with the facts and risks as presented.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial tracking holds a notable place within this investigation. A forensic accountant engaged by Counter Terrorism Policing traced several cryptocurrency transactions linked to the defendant's digital wallets, including payments to online vendors specialising in chemical reagents and electronic components. The use of tumbling services and layered exchanges complicated analysis; nonetheless, a sum equating to approximately £3,800 was identified as funding potentially related to the preparatory conduct. While cryptocurrencies have legitimate applications, as recognised in the Financial Services Authority’s 2024 report, their anonymity poses significant hurdles in prosecuting crime and managing risk.  

In considering the volume and depth of evidence arising from electronic and financial forensic examination, this court acknowledges the exemplary work done by the digital investigation unit. Their responsibilities, however, are increasingly burdensome, with many units stretched to breaking point and subject to high staff turnover. The court echoes calls made in recent judicial forums for increased investment in cybercrime expertise, including for proactive intelligence analysis and real-time interdiction capability.  

The surveillance efforts extending to physical observation of Mr H included multiple deployments conducted over several months. Night-time footage captured activity representative of experimentation with explosive devices at a remote location near Staffordshire. The energy spent by investigators on reviewing the footage—often hampered by poor lighting and adverse weather—cannot be overstated. Not infrequently, an hour of viewing results in confirmation of mere routine activity, yet every suspicious movement must be scrutinised to inform protection decisions.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to the defendant’s background, Mr H is 30 years old, unmarried, and has no prior convictions. His early education culminated in a degree in chemical engineering, which he obtained with upper second-class honours. Employment history reveals a period of work at an industrial chemicals firm, terminated following a dispute over data security protocols. Character references have been tendered on his behalf from a local youth outreach worker, reflecting his involvement in community projects promoting STEM education. These references speak to his intellect and community spirit but do not diminish the severity of his chosen conduct.  

In a letter dated 10 September 2025, submitted on his behalf by the Eastbrook Community Welfare Trust, volunteers describe Mr H as “initially resistant but gradually engaged in group discussions on peaceful conflict resolution.” While community engagement is commendable, it remains insufficient to offset the breach presented by his actions.  

Expert psychological evaluation was commissioned to assist the court in understanding Mr H's mindset. The report, authored by Dr Serena R. Milton, consultant forensic psychologist, dates from August 2025. Dr Milton describes the defendant as exhibiting obsessive cognitive patterns and rigid ideological beliefs, yet without diagnosable psychosis or personality disorder. The assessment warns of a high probability of recommitment to extremist activity if untreated and inadequately supervised. The report references research underscoring the challenges inherent in deradicalisation programmes, noting completion rates below 60% and a notable attrition in the post-release period.  

The defence has advanced the possibility of Structured Professional Judgement led interventions, citing the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) as a preferred route. This court recognises the potential utility of such programmes but is acutely aware of their limitations, including resource scarcity, variable practitioner quality, and the unpredictability of individual response. Such interventions require not only willingness on the part of the offender but substantial institutional support to mitigate risk effectively.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

In assessing aggravating and mitigating factors, the court observes that Mr H’s conduct exhibits a high level of sophistication, persistent intent, and evidence of active concealment measures. These features position this offending at the upper echelons of culpability within the framework established by the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guidelines for terrorism offences. Aggravating circumstances include the intended scale of harm, the technological expertise deployed to evade detection, and the timing of preparatory acts to coincide with significant anniversaries associated with prior terrorist events.  

Mitigation is confined to the absence of any previous convictions, educational achievements, and the defendant’s ultimate admission of guilt, albeit at a late stage. Credit for the plea is therefore modest, reflecting the limited utility the court ascribes to its tardiness.  

The court will direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report, with particular instruction for the Probation Service to consider custodial and community options in light of the defendant’s risk profile. The report should evaluate the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the appropriateness of High Intensity Cognitive Behavioral Therapy modules, and the potential of electronic monitoring including GPS-enabled exclusion zones as part of any licence conditions. It should also explore options for domiciliary psychological supervision by suitably accredited forensic specialists in accordance with Structured Professional Judgement criteria.  

This sentencing hearing has been conducted in open court with all parties fully attending throughout. The court records appreciation for the advocacy of Ms Serena Lim representing the Crown and Mr Oliver Hemsworth instructed on behalf of the defendant under a Legal Aid certificate. The court reiterates its ongoing concern regarding delays and procedural obfuscations originating from the Legal Aid Agency, which in this case complicated timely retention of expert advisers and contributed to the adjournment of pre-trial hearings.  

The court recognises the challenges confronting the police, probation, healthcare, and voluntary sectors in managing the sequelae of such offending. It hopes the multi-agency mechanisms deployed in this matter will remain robust and fruitful in managing residual risk post-sentence.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with the requirements of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities for registration. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this proceedings. Costs are reserved.  
These are the orders of the court.
