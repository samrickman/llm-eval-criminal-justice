IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29831  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. L. STONECROSS  
Filed: 29 August 2025

Today, Mr H stands before this court for sentence on multiple counts under sections 5(1)(a) and 57 of the Terrorism Act 2006. Specifically, he is charged with engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism and possession of articles for purposes connected to terrorism. The conduct under scrutiny spans a period commencing in September 2022 through to his arrest in late April 2025. Mr H’s case has, over the past eighteen months, necessitated extensive investigative and prosecutorial attention, reflecting the serious nature of the charges and the public interest at stake.

This Crown Court, established in the early 1970s at the historic Bristol Law Courts, continues to serve as a primary venue for the trial of offences across the West of England and South Gloucestershire. Over the years, the court’s Criminal Justice Units have adapted to evolving procedural requirements, including the implementation of the Better Case Management (BCM) framework to expedite trial readiness and sentencing processes. The present matter illustrates both the challenges and merits of such reforms, with numerous hearings scheduled and adjourned amidst competing demands on court time and personnel.

It is important at the outset to acknowledge the diligent efforts of all parties involved. I extend thanks to Ms. Fiona Ellery QC for her thorough and measured presentation of the Crown case, and to Mr. Gabriel Trench, solicitor-advocate, who has represented Mr H with professionalism amid the complexities of this litigation. The court is, however, constrained to record its lingering dissatisfaction with the performance of the Legal Aid Agency in issuing timely approvals for expert reports and forensic digital analysis, which occasioned avoidable delays.

Given the intricate nature of counter-terrorism investigations, it behooves this court to offer a brief overview of the statutory landscape guiding sentencing decisions. The Terrorism Act 2006 represents a significant legislative instrument designed to both deter and punish preparatory conduct linked to terrorist activity. Section 5(1)(a) criminalises acts undertaken with intent to commit or facilitate terrorism, encompassing conduct both overt and covert. Section 57 addresses possession of items designed or adapted for terrorist use, a broad provision reflecting the diverse threats faced by contemporary security services.

The case management hearings observed in this matter reflect the intricate balance between open justice and national security imperatives. Protective markings have limited the degree to which certain evidence may be publically disclosed, necessitating applications under the Justice and Security Act 2013 to facilitate closed material proceedings. This court remains mindful of the principles enshrined in R v. AB [2014] EWCA Crim 354, which emphasise the need to preserve the integrity of intelligence sources while ensuring procedural fairness.

The defendant’s bail conditions underwent multiple revisions following the initial remand, occasioned in part by the fluctuating assessments of risk presented by the Probation Service and counter-terrorism units. The Domestic Extremism Risk Panel (DERP) convened in September 2024 reiterated concerns regarding the defendant’s accessibility to digital platforms capable of disseminating extremist propaganda. No less significant were the findings contained within the reports prepared by Dr. Constance-Marie Farrell, forensic psychiatrist, which will be discussed in due course.

It is tempting to digress momentarily to note the prevalent strain upon institutions tasked with mental health and risk assessment in such cases. The NHS’s forensic psychiatry units routinely contend with extended waiting lists and pressure stemming from population growth and constrained funding. These systemic challenges underscore the precarious straits in which adjudicators and clinicians alike operate when asked to provide timely evaluations impacting liberty and public safety.

Before turning to the factual matrix giving rise to Mr H’s conviction, it is instructive to reflect on judicial authorities relevant to sentencing in terrorism offences. R v. Khalil [2018] EWCA Crim 2329 remains the leading case demarcating the contours of what constitutes preparatory conduct. The Court there underscored that the gravity of the offence lies not solely in completed terrorist acts but critically in the intent and steps taken toward those ends. Additionally, R v. Ghani [2021] EWCA Crim 1112 further elaborated on the limited mitigation available where an offender's conduct demonstrates sophisticated planning or resource acquisition.

Turning to investigatory procedures, the arrest of Mr H took place on 21 April 2025 at his residence in Bedminster following the culmination of Operation AEROLITE, a multi-agency endeavor led by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). This operation, spanning some twenty-four months, incorporated advanced cyber surveillance techniques, including VPN traffic analysis and dark web infiltration by National Cyber Crime Unit experts.

The sheer volume of data gathered—spanning terabytes of encrypted communications and digital storage—necessitated a specialist team of forensic computing specialists drawn from the National Crime Agency’s Technical Crime Unit. The rigour of such digital forensics is vital, but it also imposes significant resource demands and logistical challenges; the delays encountered in decrypting cloud backups stored on international servers were a particular source of procedural friction.

The significance of social media and online communication platforms in the proliferating landscape of radicalisation cannot be overstated. Mr H’s use of ephemeral messaging applications with end-to-end encryption, coupled with rapid account turnover, displayed familiarity with counter-surveillance tactics routinely encountered in similar prosecutions. The covert interception operations underpinning this case were authorised only after judicial oversight, reflecting adherence to the safeguards prescribed in R v. G [2008] UKHL 37 concerning proportionality and necessity.

It is pertinent here to acknowledge the wider context in which this prosecution unfolds. Recent Home Office data reveal that extremism-related referrals through the Channel programme have increased by over 12% in the Southwest region in the last five years, reflecting both enhanced detection efforts and evolving threat profiles. In addition, agencies in Bristol report a confluence of pressures from rising instances of knife crime, gang-related violence, and street homelessness—factors which collectively place strain upon law enforcement and social services.

The office of the local probation service responsible for Mr H’s supervision is known to be experiencing a surge in caseload, with reports indicating average workloads exceeding the recommended ratio set by the National Probation Service’s operational guidelines. This human resource challenge impacts the delivery of tailored rehabilitation programmes, an issue the court hopes will be addressed by authorities in the coming fiscal cycle.

A trial preparation hearing was convened on 3 July 2025, during which submissions on disclosure, admissibility, and sentencing guidelines were debated. Those proceedings were conducted with customary
