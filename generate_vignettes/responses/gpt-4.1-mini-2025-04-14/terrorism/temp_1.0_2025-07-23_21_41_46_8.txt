IN THE CROWN COURT AT CHESTERFIELD  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. C2025/28716  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. L. Fenwick  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr H stands before this court charged with a breach of section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and a further count under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, namely possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The offences, as particularised, span a period commencing in early 2023 and extending to the date of arrest on 2 March 2025.  

The defendant was arrested promptly shortly after 07:15 on that date, following the execution of a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residential premises in the Chesterfield district. The warrant issued by His Honour Judge L. Westmoreland was supported by material received from the Security Service and Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands (CTPEM), reflecting concerns derived from encrypted messaging metadata and suspicious patterns of procurement consistent with material gathered in previous counter-terrorism operations.

This arrest marked the conclusion of Operation IRIDESCENT, a multi-agency inquiry coordinated through the National Counter Terrorism Policing Headquarters and involving domestic intelligence, cyber forensic specialists, and financial investigators. The complexity of the enquiry was significant, incorporating the joint efforts of CTPEM, the Forensic Civitas Unit, and a dedicated team from the National Crime Agency's digital financial crimes division. The collaborative nature of this operation underscores the evolving landscape of counter-terrorism investigations, which increasingly require the integration of technical expertise across domains.  

During the ensuing investigation, detectives faced challenges in accessing encrypted data on devices seized from the defendant’s property. Substantial time was devoted to applying bespoke decryption techniques and liaising with foreign intelligence agencies possessing the requisite capabilities, a process that introduced delay but safeguarded compliance with prevailing judicial oversight and human rights frameworks.  

The court is conscious of the wider social context within which such cases arise. There has been, regrettably, a discernable increase in public anxiety regarding the steady rise of street homelessness in urban centres across the region. The visibility of those living rough coupled with a rise in begging throughout key transport hubs has prompted considerable community concern. While wholly unrelated to the defendant’s conduct, the interrelation of social vulnerability and criminogenic environments is a topic of ongoing policy consideration and public debate.  

Mr H initially appeared before the magistrates at Buxton on 10 March 2025 where consideration was given to bail and remand pending transfer to this Crown Court. Owing to the nature of the allegations and the risk profile indicated by initial assessments, the defendant was remanded in custody. The magistrates’ clerk and legal advisors performed their duties with customary efficiency despite the pressures occasioned by intermittent industrial action affecting court staff. There were minor delays in translating documents submitted from one of Mr H’s overseas contacts, though these had no discernible effect on case progression.  

The court notes for balance that Mr H’s counsel, instructed via a legal aid representation order, has admirably navigated a system beset by chronic underfunding and administrative impediments. These include an unfortunate delay of four weeks in authorising an independent psychiatric expert, a shortfall regrettably symptomatic of the prevailing difficulties faced by the Legal Aid Agency across the country. Such delay imposes strain not only on defence preparation but on judicial timetabling and ultimately on the defendant’s right to a fair and proportionate process.  

The defendant's preliminary hearing took place on 15 April 2025, wherein pleas of not guilty were entered. Subsequent trial preparation hearings were conducted on 7 May and 21 July 2025. The final trial commenced on 4 August 2025, and after four days of evidence, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of guilty on all counts on 14 August 2025.  

Much has been made within defence submissions of the purportedly sporadic nature of Mr H’s engagement with deradicalisation programmes offered through regional Prevent initiatives since mid-2021. The Calverton Prevent Centre’s written representations acknowledge the defendant’s partial attendance at several sessions, though they record a pattern of disengagement without substantive commitment. Rigorous evaluation of such programmes consistently reveals that successful deradicalisation is a complex and protracted enterprise, with completion rates modest and relapse not uncommon. The court places limited weight on engagement absent demonstrable behavioural change.  

It is instructive to revisit the jurisprudence governing sentencing credit for guilty pleas, particularly where such pleas follow extensive preparation and contestation. As reiterated in R v. Gibson [2022] EWCA Crim 1789, credit for a late plea must be measured against the extent to which it relieves the burden on witnesses, expedites proceedings, and manifests genuine remorse. A plea entered mere hours before verdict, especially where ample opportunity for earlier admission was afforded, attracts a diminished degree of discount, typically no more than one-sixth.

The court further contends with the complexities of balancing deterrence and rehabilitation in sentencing in terrorism offences. The Counter Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines (2022 Ed.) updated by the Sentencing Council emphasize the primacy of public protection and deterrence. These guidelines delineate culpability categories, taking into account the nature of the preparatory acts, the sophistication and technical expertise demonstrated, and the defendant’s proximity to potential execution of harm.  

Reference is made to R v. Darzi [2017] EWCA Crim 1242, where the Court reaffirmed the principle that sentences must reflect not only the objective gravity but also communicate unequivocal societal condemnation of terrorism-related offending. Equally pertinent is the observation in R v. Hesketh [2019] EWCA Crim 347 that sentencing must avoid the twin errors of complacency and disproportionate anxiety. The challenge lies in calibrating responses that are neither unduly harsh nor insufficiently robust.  

In the present jurisdiction, the defendant had a history of nominal compliance with lawful supervision but was noted by probation officers to display a marked tendency toward social withdrawal and ideological rigidity. The Probation Service’s pre-sentence report collated in July 2025 documents these behavioural traits, alongside a lack of reported substance misuse or significant mental health diagnoses. The report also highlights, however, the escalating isolation from previously stable social networks, which accords with risk factors identified in specialist risk assessment instruments for extremism.

Further complicating assessment is the interrelated forensic evidence recovered in digital form. Noteworthy is the retrieval of files encrypted under open-source software, alongside evidence of heavy use of anonymising networks such as Tor and the deployment of crypto-assets, details which denote a degree of technical acumen deployed in concealment efforts. These behaviours mimic established patterns observed in known terrorist facilitation cases as described in the Dodd Report (2021) on the use of technology in violent extremism.  

In a bid to elucidate psychological disposition, the court has also reviewed the report of Dr Julian Markham, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence. Dr Markham recognises that while the defendant exhibits traits of cognitive inflexibility and a propensity towards black-and-white thinking, no formal psychotic process or personality disorder was discernible. The report situates Mr H within a framework of ideological fanaticism rather than clinical disturbance. The court also notes correspondence from the East Midlands NHS Trust regarding waiting list delays in forensic mental health community services—a factor relevant to consideration of future interventions and risk management but not mitigation for sentencing.

Interestingly, the defendant’s pre-offence history includes no prior convictions for violent or extremist-related crimes. This aligns with the well-established principle, articulated in R v. Houghton [2013] EWCA Crim 355, that absence of prior record is of limited mitigating value where the gravity of the present offending is substantial. The court is conscious that participants in ideological extremism can emerge from ostensibly ordinary backgrounds and without prior criminal antecedents.  

Of tangential note but recorded for completeness, it was observed in the trial that a co-defendant charged with related but separate offences concerning importation of Class A drugs involving courier use was convicted and sentenced in an earlier proceeding. The current sentences in that matter involve extended determinate terms exceeding ten years, though that conduct, unrelated to the defendant, is not to colour the assessment of Mr H beyond an understanding of the broader criminal milieu of which the defendant’s acts may be a part.  

Prior to conviction, the defendant was subject to a series of stringent bail terms in the magistrates’ court, including restrictions on internet use and electronic communication monitoring. These conditions were administered by the East Midlands Bail Supervision Scheme but were repeatedly breached, leading to revocation of bail and remand to custody. The operational challenges faced by the Bail Support Unit in overseeing individuals posing a risk of ideological harm are well-documented, including capacity strain, resource shortfalls, and evolving risk profiles, as noted in the Home Office’s 2024 report on bail enforcement.  

Correspondence from the community housing association managing the defendant’s former residence in Chesterfield highlighted increasingly tense interactions between residents, including complaints about noise disturbances and graffiti of an explicit political nature. While these matters do not directly inform sentencing, they form part of the background circumstances and illustrate the social context within which individuals vulnerable to radical views reside.

It is noted that during the pre-trial phase, the defence produced documentary evidence of Mr H’s travel history, including a two-week excursion to Istanbul in September 2023. The itinerary included visits to recognised sites of cultural and academic interest. However, intelligence reports simultaneously documented Mr H’s attendance at meetings within a diasporic extremist community in the city’s outskirts. These dual patterns are not uncommon and highlight the difficulties in ascribing singular motivation to travel in such cases.  

The court also takes this opportunity to place on record its appreciation for the efforts of social support agencies within the Derbyshire jurisdiction. The Volunteers in Action (VIA) group, noted for their outreach towards at-risk youth, provided a submission reflecting on resource challenges within the voluntary sector, including funding volatility and the impact of pandemic-related disruptions. Their commentary—though not directly connected to the defendant—g
