IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. BR2025/32701  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. TREVOR  
Filed: 3 October 2025  

Mr H comes before this court for sentence following his conviction on multiple counts, including engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct for which he stands convicted is said to have taken place during the period from November 2022 until his arrest in February 2025.  

The defendant was taken into custody at 07:15 on 14 February 2025 when officers from the South West Counter Terrorism Unit (SWCTU) executed a warrant at his residence in Kingsweston Road pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. This warrant was issued following prolonged surveillance and intelligence gathering by the Security Service combined with digital forensics. Items seized included multiple encrypted mobile devices, external hard drives, and various digital storage media.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

The arrest was the culmination of a nearly eighteen-month investigation that involved cooperation between SWCTU, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and overseas intelligence partners. Surveillance work included physical observation, use of unmanned aerial reconnaissance in the vicinity of the defendant’s home, and monitoring of digital communications under Section 28 of the Terrorism Act 2000. This operation was particularly resource-intensive, necessitating overtime shifts for specialist officers and analysts at a time when the department was already stretched managing a surge in “low-level” violent incidents, including several aggravated burglaries in neighbouring districts.  

The court notes the inherent tension faced by counter-terrorism units operating in a climate of limited human and technical resources, as acknowledged in the Home Office’s 2024 report on “Operational Resourcing Challenges.” This document highlights the increasing complexity of cases involving encrypted technology and multi-jurisdictional networks, and the added burden this places on front-line teams tasked with protecting the public.  

The defendant was initially remanded in custody on 15 February 2025. A plea and trial preparation hearing was scheduled for 22 May 2025 but was adjourned to allow the defence further time to consider a voluminous and highly technical disclosure package. That package comprised some 1,234 primary exhibits and associated source materials, including expert linguistic analysis and a range of recovered electronic artefacts. The multiplicity of technical evidence, its classification status, and the need for restricted material handling under the Justice and Security Act 2013 introduced further scheduling complications.  

Much has been said by successive courts about the impact of disclosure on modern terrorism trials. In R v. Fairclough [2023] EWCA Crim 2431, the Court of Appeal underscored the importance of balancing disclosure with national security concerns, reminding trial judges to make “careful and tailored directions” on handling sensitive material in the interests of justice. That balancing act was diligently managed in the present case, notwithstanding occasional procedural delays attributable to the need for security-cleared counsel and privacy-compliant redactions.  

The court is obliged to acknowledge the ongoing challenges faced by the Defence Legal Aid system in authorising sufficient hours for the preparation of cases of this complexity. Mr H’s legal team, led by Mr Ian Merrick, applied repeatedly for extended legal aid resources to instruct independent digital forensic experts, ultimately authorised beyond the typical cap but only after considerable administrative delay. The court shares the rising concern expressed by the Criminal Bar Association about the adverse effect of such funding constraints on effective defence representation, and consequently, on the fairness and pace of proceedings.  

At the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 14 September 2025, the defendant — having throughout the proceedings maintained a not guilty plea — entered guilty pleas to the counts on the morning of trial. The court regrets the lateness of this change of plea, noting well-established principles limiting credit for pleas entered well into the trial preparation phase, as reflected in the rulings in R v. Corrigan [2024] EWCA Crim 1793 and R v. Foxley [2023] EWCA Crim 882.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The facts reveal a measured escalation in the defendant’s activities, moving from online expressions of grievance to more concrete preparations facilitated by a network of digital communications employing state-of-the-art encryption tools originally developed for legitimate commercial purposes. This saw the defendant involved in forums, some openly proscribed, sharing and receiving detailed manuals on improvised explosive device assembly and remote triggering mechanisms. The sophistication evident in his communications and procurement plans places the offending in the highest culpability stratum under the relevant Sentencing Council guidelines.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Among the materials recovered during the execution of the search warrant were multiple encrypted archives labelled with ciphers and dog-whistle codewords, a methodology reminiscent of the patterns observed in R v. Bhatti [2022] EWCA Crim 1102. The possession of fragmented but technically meaningful information on explosive manufacture, combined with the intent inferred from digital footprints, sets the stage for a sentence guided by deterrence and danger prevention.  

The court notes some submissions made by defence counsel to contextualise these materials within a broader narrative of youthful disillusionment and academic curiosity, citing Mr H’s contributions to a university drama society and his partial completion of an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering. While such background information is properly taken into account in mitigation, it provides little comfort in light of the serious risk posed and the evidence of intent.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

A factor not explored to exhaustive depth by the defence, but nevertheless noted here for completeness, was a small quantity of controlled substances discovered during the search—principally, a few grams of cannabis in a shared kitchen area. This has not resulted in any separate proceedings, and the court concurs with the prosecution that it forms no aggravating feature in the terrorism offences, although it may bear on consideration of broader personal circumstances such as social environment and behavioural patterns.  

During the investigation, officers noted a notable absence of any prior criminal history on the defendant’s part, save for a 2020 caution for shoplifting of alcohol and toiletries from a local supermarket located some three miles from his family home. While that incident was fleetingly referenced by the prosecution in mitigation of risk as a youthful lapse rather than a pattern, the court keeps in memory the concerns expressed in R v. O’Connell [2019] EWCA Crim 2719 about the potential unreliability of isolated prior misdemeanours as indicators of character.  

The court takes this opportunity to remark on the increasingly common phenomenon of defendants navigating multiple overlapping criminal justice pathways — a fact that places unusual logistical burdens on courts and support services alike. Mr H’s case was not directly enlivened by parallel proceedings; however, the adjacent court lists bear the marks of multiple defendants with co-occurring charges such as possession of bladed articles within school precincts, public order offences following disorder at licensed premises, and even complex fraud allegations involving online loan applications. These co-existing caseloads impact overall judicial throughput and are a reminder of the interconnected nature of crime and public protection responsibilities.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

International travel by the defendant was scrutinised extensively during the pre-trial phase. According to airline manifests and immigration logs, Mr H made several short trips within Europe between late 2023 and mid-2024, including a visit to Amsterdam ostensibly for the purpose of attending a renewable energy symposium. CCTV footage showed him spending time in a café frequented by known associates of proscribed groups, though no direct evidence of unlawful conduct on those trips was established.  

The court records some procedural delays occasioned by the late disclosure of additional material relating to those visits, including intercepted communications obtained via mutual legal assistance treaties. While the defence complained of prejudice due to timing, the court is satisfied on review that these materials were disclosed well in advance of trial commencement and that adequate opportunity was provided for their consideration.  

In the course of the investigation, SWCTU analysts also uncovered evidence of extensive online financial transactions involving cryptocurrency. A forensic accountancy report dated 1 July 2025 traced several wallet-to-wallet transfers aggregating over £12,000, with some funds linked to darknet marketplaces specialising in dual-use chemical precursors. The report emphasised the difficulty, despite improvements, of establishing conclusive links between wallet ownership and individual users, a point accepted by the defence experts in their own consultancy assessments.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

The court also acknowledges the fatigue suffered by professionals tasked with managing technical examinations of digital evidence in terrorism cases. The necessary triage of terabytes of data is labour-intensive, requiring repeated peer review and cross-checking to avoid errors or misinterpretation. The forensic team working in this investigation made effective use of bespoke software tools but were hampered at times by outmoded hardware and limited access to cloud computational resources due to funding constraints. Such conditions are well-known across the country and form part of the broader conversations about investment in criminal justice infrastructure beyond the courtroom.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

In terms of personal circumstances, Mr H is a 28-year-old former apprentice electrician who left formal employment in early 2023 under unclear circumstances. His family provided a series of letters recording his involvement in local church volunteering activities and a prominent role in a community theatre company producing Shakespearean repertoire. The defendant’s sister, Ms Naomi H., provided a statement emphasising his outwardly calm disposition but also reported increased withdrawal and intensifying political commentary over social media in the period leading to his arrest.  

Psychiatric assessment was undertaken by Dr Morgan Pryce, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Avon Secure Assessment Centre. Dr Pryce’s comprehensive report, dated 18 September 2025, diagnosed no formal psychiatric disorder but noted marked cognitive rigidity and deeply entrenched ideological fixation consistent with a high risk of recidivism in terrorism-related activities absent structured intervention. The risk assessment component of her report concludes with a recommendation for intensive multi-agency management and supervised reintegration if the defendant is released.  

Defence counsel has argued vigorously for consideration of participation in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), designed for offenders with extremist ideologies, citing research suggesting moderate success rates where engagement is wholehearted. The court is mindful, however, of the limited evidence on long-term outcomes and the known attrition rates that undermine the full promise of such community-based schemes.  

The court expresses cautious appreciation for the charitable organisation “Hope Beyond Hate,” which has offered to continue engagement with the defendant post-release. Its submissions demonstrate an informed and pragmatic outlook, acknowledging both the challenges and the necessity of sustained support. Such partnerships are essential in the broader strategy of countering violent extremism but cannot substitute for the imposition of custodial deterrence where merited.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Turning to sentencing principles, the court is guided principally by the Terrorism Act 2006, the Sentencing Council’s Guidelines on terrorism offences issued in 2023, and relevant appellate authority. Deterrence, public protection, the seriousness of ideological motivation, and the technical sophistication of the offending are paramount considerations. In sentencing, the court must also have regard to the impact on victims, the degree of premeditation, and any steps taken at the earliest opportunity to demonstrate remorse or cooperation.  

Mitigation is limited in this case. Mr H’s previous good character, lack of prior convictions relating to violence or serious dishonesty, and community involvement must be balanced against the manifestly high level of culpability and the ongoing risk to the public that he poses. The late pleasure of guilty pleas allows only modest credit, which the court quantifies as a reduction of 15%.  

The court will direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report. This report should evaluate the potential for safe rehabilitation through available deradicalisation and cognitive intervention programmes within the custodial estate, the feasibility of risk management on licence, and the viability of stringent restrictions including but not limited to electronic monitoring and exclusion zones. Further attention should be given to the prospects of engagement with faith-based and community organisations dedicated to extremism prevention.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 3 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be lodged with the National Archives and shared with relevant criminal justice partners as appropriate.  

These are the orders of the court.
