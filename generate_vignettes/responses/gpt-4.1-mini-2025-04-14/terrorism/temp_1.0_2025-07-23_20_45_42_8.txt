IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/25349  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. J. MONROE  
Filed: 10 September 2025  

Mr H stands before this court to be sentenced following his conviction on two counts: one of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a further count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct, as established, primarily occurred between August 2023 and the date of his arrest in March 2025.  

The defendant’s case reached these proceedings after a protracted investigatory period involving numerous agencies, including the Southwest Counter Terrorism Unit, the National Cyber Crime Centre, and local policing bodies. His arrest was effectuated on the morning of 18 March 2025 at an address in Fishponds, Bristol, pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The arrest operation was executed with due regard to operational safety and in accordance with statutory protocols governing terrorism-related detentions.  

At the outset, the court must acknowledge the involvement of technical specialists whose contribution was pivotal in disentangling complex electronic evidence. The forensic digital examinations spanned multiple platforms and communications channels, notably encrypted messaging applications such as Wickr and Signal. These investigations demanded a sustained deployment of public funds and personnel, underscoring the substantial resource implications inherent in counter-terrorism investigations.

The court is mindful that a case of this nature does not exist in isolation but against a broader societal and historical backdrop which demands reflection. It is pertinent to mention, for instance, the jurisprudential lineage that informs the interpretation of conduct preparatory to terrorism. The foundational judgment in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 remains authoritative, defining the parameters of “terrorist purpose” with clarity and underscoring the necessity of distinguishing between criminality and lawful dissent.  

Moreover, appellate authorities such as R v. Ahmad [2017] EWCA Crim 421 provide guidance on the requisite mens rea and the evidential thresholds applying to possession charges under section 57 of the 2000 Act. The court notes that these principles served as important touchstones during the jury’s deliberations.  

As customary in such proceedings, the administrative timeline evidences multiple adjournments. Some adjournments arose from justified requests for disclosure extensions and the time-intensive analysis of voluminous digital material. Other delays were occasioned by the late involvement of specialist counsel with relevant terrorism expertise. The court records its appreciation for all counsel involved, in this instance Ms. Fiona Rigby on behalf of the Crown and Mr. Daniel Fox for the defence, for their diligent navigation of a complex evidential matrix, notwithstanding occasional logistical frustrations.  

A notable procedural hurdle emerged early when issues concerning the disclosure of intercept material raised the question of the application of closed material procedures under the Justice and Security Act 2013. While such applications remain exceptional, the case management judge granted a limited closed session to consider sensitive intelligence reports, thereby balancing open justice with national security imperatives.  

The court is also compelled to observe the difficult position in which the Legal Aid Agency occasionally finds itself. In this proceeding, timely authorisation for the appointment of a forensic psychologist for the defence was delayed by administrative bottlenecks, prolonging a pre-trial assessment which counsel contended was essential for mitigation planning. Such delays highlight systemic challenges in resourcing defence representation within the constraints of public funding, and the court urges ongoing reforms to streamline these functions.  

Turning to the defendant’s personal history, Mr H is 31 years old. Intelligence and social services records reveal that he grew up in a socially deprived area of Bristol, with intermittent engagement in education but no prior convictions for violent or terrorism-related offences. Character references were submitted from a local youth mentoring scheme and a volunteer coordinator at a community city farm who both testify to his generally quiet disposition and recent attempts at employment in manual trades. Such positive elements, however, cannot diminish the gravity of the offending conduct found proven.  

It is pertinent to record that the defendant had interactions with local Prevent coordinators commencing in late 2021 following concerns raised by educators about radicalising content shared on his social media accounts. Those interventions, documented in Home Office reviews, were intermittent and, notwithstanding repeated outreach attempts, yielded limited sustained engagement. This history reflects the challenges inherent in deradicalisation efforts and the fine balance between safeguarding and enforcement.

Evidence tendered demonstrated Mr H’s curated online presence evolved from commentary on foreign conflicts to advocacy of violent extremism. Open-source content downloaded and disseminated by him included manuals on improvised explosive devices, drawn from proscribed extremist entities, as referenced in the prosecution’s exhibits. Analysis by expert witnesses established these materials were used with apparent purpose in preparing operational capabilities. The court also heard from linguistic experts whose assessments detailed the defendant’s communication employing coded language and symbols consistent with known extremist networks.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

A further tranche of evidence included recently acquired encrypted videos and images of paramilitary-style training scenarios, capturing Mr H engaged in simulated exercises. The defence suggested these were for purposes of hobbyist interest equating to airsoft sports, but this explanation was found wanting in light of corroborative evidence.  

Several letters from acquaintances and community organisations were submitted in mitigation. They speak to Mr H’s participation in a local music project designed to engage at-risk youth and his attendance at cooking classes sponsored by the Bristol Food Alliance. While these contributions are laudable at the individual level, such gestures cannot be regarded as exculpatory of the aims underlying the malicious planning uncovered.  

The court is aware that this case emerged during a period in which the Crown Prosecution Service has contended with unprecedented workloads in counter-terrorism prosecutions, often exacerbated by higher caseload pressures arising from emerging security concerns abroad and the domestic threat landscape. This context is relevant to understanding, though not excusing, some procedural delays experienced in listing and trial management.  

Mr H’s trial heard substantial expert psychiatric and psychological evidence. Consultant psychiatrist Dr. Marianne Jackson provided a comprehensive report concluding that whilst the defendant exhibits personality traits consistent with rigid cognitive frameworks and paranoid ideation, he does not meet criteria for a major psychiatric disorder. Dr. Jackson’s assessment cautions, however, as to a high risk of recidivism absent intensive post-custodial supervision and mental health engagement.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The case tested the operational capacity of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA). The local MAPPA panel convened early in the proceedings, with representation from probation services, police counter-terrorism units, and clinical commissioning groups. The minutes from these meetings disclose thorough and ongoing risk management discussions focusing on accommodation, restrictions on Internet access, and possible future licence conditions. These inter-agency efforts exemplify the multi-vector approach to public safety coupled with rehabilitative ambitions.  

The difficulties in securing suitable housing for Mr H upon release cannot be overstated. The persistent shortage of approved premises and the strains on supported housing place constraints on the design of effective monitoring. The court trusts that the local authority and probation service maintain their commitment despite these challenges.  

The forensic documentary analysis required sifting through vast quantities of data encompassing encrypted emails, cloud storage, and peer-to-peer sharing platforms. The National Cyber Crime Centre personnel devoted hundreds of hours to reconstructing timelines and establishing provenance of digital artefacts, a task complicated by intentional obfuscation techniques deployed by the defendant.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The chronology of Mr H’s travel outside the United Kingdom was examined. Passport entry and exit records showed a trip to Switzerland in June 2024, during which he attended a conference nominally focused on renewable energy technologies. Intelligence sources, however, later indicated the presence at that event of known affiliates of proscribed organisations, raising the prospect of covert networking. The court acknowledges the evidential nuances and the defence’s argument regarding innocent presence but concludes the cumulative picture supports the prosecution’s assertion of preparatory conduct.  

The engagement of the National Prevent programme, alongside community policing teams, merits formal recognition for its measured approach. Yet, as sometimes regrettably occurs, the voluntary nature of engagement allows for disengagement or evasion by those subject to intervention.  

The crown witness service provided support to two affected community members who testified at trial. Their fortitude in participating despite anxieties—heightened by the nature of the offences—is testament to their resilience and deserving of the court’s respect.  

Notably, Mr H’s counsel assisted by making detailed submissions on the reflective process surrounding delayed plea entered less than two weeks before trial. While this addresses some practical benefits, the court concurs that it does not equate to early admission and limits the extent of any discount.  

Defence counsel drew on the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines (2023), noting the importance of distinguishing between those whose activities extend beyond ideology to operational planning and those whose involvement is peripheral. These submissions, while considered, must be balanced against the full factual matrix and the demonstrated level of planning and capability development found by the jury.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial investigation reports submitted by Counter Terrorism Policing trace a series of cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H. Payments were routed through multiple anonymisation services, facilitating the acquisition of specialist electronic components used in the assembly of explosive devices. The opaque nature of blockchain technology, while challenging for enforcement, has been a source of significant intelligence advances and disruption in recent years.  

The court notes the technological sophistication involved in these on-line transactions reflects a disturbing evolution in terrorist logistics, exploiting innovation for malevolent ends. The criminal justice system must, therefore, remain vigilant and adaptive to such technological challenges, balancing privacy interests with investigative necessity.  

The recovery of electronic storage media from the defendant’s residence further yielded data indicating knowledge of remote detonation devices and encrypted correspondence with individuals later subject to investigation in continental jurisdictions. These contacts loom large in contextualising Mr H’s intentions and resources, notwithstanding the absence of direct involvement by those individuals in this prosecution.  

With regard to the defendant’s education and employment history, Mr H holds a diploma in electronics but has had intermittent employment since 2019, working variously in warehouses and as a freelance IT technician. Letters from former employers describe him as “reliable but withdrawn.” The court notes, parenthetically, that periods of underemployment or economic instability are often cited in scholarship on radicalisation but do not suffice to excuse culpability.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The defendant’s family background is modest. Several letters were tabled from family members describing the impact of his incarceration on relations. One such letter from a younger cousin, employed at a local recycling centre, speaks to the enduring family ties and the distress occasioned by the present conviction. While such familial supports may play a role in post-release reintegration, they cannot diminish the seriousness of the offence.  

In mitigation, it is also relevant that Mr H has no previous convictions. However, as Lord Woolf CJ noted in R v. Thomson [1998] 1 Cr App R 108, absence of a prior record has diminishing mitigating value in cases of grave societal threat.  

The psychiatric report provided by Dr. Harriet Glover confirms an absence of diagnosable mental illness but highlights “marked difficulties in emotional regulation and entrenched extremist beliefs,” which inform risk considerations. Furthermore, Dr. Glover cautions that ideological disengagement requires long-term, multi-modal intervention.  

The court notes the emergence of de-radicalisation intervention models such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). While promising, these require careful assessment of individual suitability and readiness for engagement, and the evidence base remains contested.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The court is mindful that sentencing must serve the core objectives set out in the Sentencing Code: punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public. In terrorism cases, deterrence and public protection often assume heightened prominence. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines provide a clear framework, emphasising that the level of culpability and the degree to which the defendant’s conduct approached or envisaged perpetration of harm are critical considerations.  

In the present case, the nature and extent of planning, the sophistication of the techniques involved, and the sustained engagement with extremist ideologies collectively position Mr H in the upper tier of culpability. That said, the court recognises factors such as his early history of cooperation with authorities and his absence of violent prior convictions as limited mitigation.  

Having regard to the late timing of the guilty plea, the court will allow credit equivalent to one-sixth reduction only. The necessity of protecting the public, and upholding the rule of law in the face of ideological extremism, compels a custodial sentence commensurate with the highest degree of culpability.  

Sentencing will be deferred pending receipt of a full pre-sentence report prepared in collaboration with probation, mental health services, and counter-terrorism police. This report will explore suitability for intensive supervision, structured intervention, and the possible imposition of an Extended Determinate Sentence. Consideration will also be given to post-release risk management measures including electronic monitoring, licence conditions restricting travel and communication, and potential engagement with specialist psychologists accredited in structured professional judgement frameworks.  

The court warmly acknowledges the ongoing role of the Southwest Regional Prevent Team and the MAPPA Category 3 panel in maintaining oversight of cases of this gravity. There remains great strain on public services in providing appropriate resources for both protection and rehabilitation — a reality that should temper expectations but not abrogate responsibilities.  

Finally, the court extends gratitude to the court staff and ushers, whose professionalism in maintaining order in a recently refurbished courtroom with enhanced digital facilities facilitated today’s proceedings. The timely arrival of translation and transcription services ensured the smooth conduct of what was a complex hearing.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 10 September 2025, in Court 2 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules (2020 revision). The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the appropriate regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies for registration and enforcement purposes. The defendant is advised of his statutory right of appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged in this matter. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
