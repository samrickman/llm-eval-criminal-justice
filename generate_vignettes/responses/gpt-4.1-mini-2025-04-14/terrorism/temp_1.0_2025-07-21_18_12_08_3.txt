IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/24895  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. L. FRANCIS  
Filed: 30 August 2025  

Mr H stands before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct reportedly covers a span from September 2023 until his arrest in late February 2025. The proceedings have traversed a burdensome schedule, including multiple case management hearings and a trial preparation hearing, complicated by issues affecting both disclosure and expert evidence.

The defendant was initially apprehended at 04:40 on 28 February 2025, during coordinated operations undertaken by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) acting under judicially authorised warrants issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The coordinated raids focussed on a residential address in St. Philip’s Marsh, Bristol, as well as a storage unit rented under a pseudonym believed to be linked to the defendant. The warrants arose from intelligence assessments informed by intercepted encrypted communications and metadata analysis conducted in conjunction with the National Counter Terrorism Digital Exploitation Unit (NCTDEU).

The investigation preceding his arrest was notably prolonged, encompassing covert surveillance, digital forensic retrieval, and cross-jurisdictional liaison with security services and police units in neighbouring force areas. The investigation drew upon geographical profiling methods adapted from the field of criminology, which have their lineage in the offender behavioural analysis literature, albeit with limited empirical trial in terrorism contexts. It is important, however, to temper expectations of their predictive value, as the evidence is frequently equivocal.

Of procedural import, this matter suffered delay in listing for trial beyond the initial anticipated date scheduled for May 2025, necessitated by the late service of expert psychological reports and an application for special measures relating to the quality of audio-visual link facilities for witnesses residing outside the jurisdiction. The court notes, with a degree of frustration shared by counsel, the ongoing and chronic under-resourcing of court IT infrastructure, which has continued to impede timely disposition despite repeated assurances from the Criminal Justice Board.

A Channel referral was made concerning Mr H in late 2022 by a school teacher who became concerned over a series of essays submitted by the defendant’s younger sibling, who referenced radical political ideologies and made indirect references to violence. The referral led to a multi-agency consultation but was discontinued following disengagement by the family and limited direct evidence involving the defendant himself. This serves as a reminder that the Prevent strategy, whilst foundational to early intervention in extremism cases, is not an infallible instrument and must be supplemented by attentive policing and robust investigative processes.

It is further noted that the defendant experienced a period of homelessness during the summer of 2024. His temporary residence in a community shelter led to reports of minor disorderly conduct, including noise complaints and an incident involving an altercation over communal facilities. These occurrences, while not the subject of formal charges, did necessitate involvement by local authority outreach officers and the voluntary sector, specifically the Bristol Homelessness Partnership. Although these facets do not pertain directly to the charged offences, they contextualise the defendant’s social milieu and the intersectionality of vulnerabilities that often complicate deradicalisation initiatives.

The case was vigorously contested through pre-trial hearings; however, the defendant entered guilty pleas to both counts at the outset of trial, specifically on 15 August 2025. This late admission of guilt, though fortuitous in absolving witnesses from giving evidence, restricts the discount the court may appropriately grant in recognition of an early plea. The jurisprudence on plea reductions is well settled. Credit is designed to encourage early admissions of guilt, saving public expense and delivering a degree of solace to victims. The Court of Appeal has been unequivocal that pleas made at a late stage, particularly once evidence is incontrovertible, merit reduced mitigation (see R v. Fowler [2023] EWCA Crim 1602 and R v. Manders [2022] EWCA Crim 1315).

Of legal context, the Terrorism Act 2006, introduced in response to evolving threats identified in the early twenty-first century, seeks to interdict preparatory conduct likely to precipitate the commission of acts designed to influence government or intimidate the public for political ends. This legislation expanded upon prior statutory frameworks set out in the Terrorism Act 2000 and subsequent amendments in 2005 following events that underscored emergent challenges in counter-terrorism policing. Contemporary sentencing therefore reflects not only an evaluation of culpability but also societal denunciation of ideologically motivated malevolence.

Though unrelated to this defendant, it is instructive to recall the legal principles settled in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, where the Court of Appeal held it permissible for custodial sentences to be imposed upon those whose mental health diagnoses impinged upon, but did not absolve, culpability for offences involving endangerment. Such case law remains pertinent in assessing mitigation claims premised on mental health or intellectual capacity.

The court is aware of the increasing burden placed upon Probation Services nationally. A widely reported survey in 2024 described a significant staffing shortfall impacting offender management and rehabilitation, with concomitant increases in caseloads pushing average probation officer numbers well beyond recommended thresholds. The implications for cases involving ideologically motivated offenders where multi-agency management is critical cannot be overstated. The lack of capacity has led to delays in preparing pre-sentence reports and in some instances posed challenges in delivering bespoke interventions.

The materials seized from the defendant’s residence and storage unit included several laptops, encrypted thumb drives, and printed documents describing the construction of explosive devices fashioned from commercially available components. Among these was a makeshift pressure cooker bomb design, coupled with annotated chemical formulae indicating familiarity with the synthesis of low-grade explosives, albeit lacking sophistication or the capacity for mass destruction. Analysis confirmed the defendant’s role in disseminating such material via closed online forums.

A contemporaneous investigation into an unrelated drug trafficking ring operated by a co-defendant in a neighbouring jurisdiction uncovered evidence of possession of a bladed article in a school car park; this bears no direct relationship to the present case against Mr H, but it illustrates the diverse nature of co-defendant criminal profiles encountered in modern multi-f
