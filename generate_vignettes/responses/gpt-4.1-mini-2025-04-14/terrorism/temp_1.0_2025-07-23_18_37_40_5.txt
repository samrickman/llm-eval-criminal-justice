IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/30192  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. T. FAIRWEATHER  
Filed: 1 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on multiple counts of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles for a purpose connected to terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct occurred over a period extending from April 2023 until his arrest in January 2025.

The defendant was first detained at 04:37 hours on 9 January 2025, when officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTP WM) executed an authorised search under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence in Longbridge. The warrant was issued following receipt of intercept intelligence indicating that an encrypted communication account linked to the defendant had been actively exchanging files with servers associated with proscribed terrorist entities. Items seized at that time included multiple laptops, encrypted USB drives, and several hardback notebooks containing handwritten notes.

This arrest concluded Operation BLACKWOOD, a protracted investigation combining overt surveillance with covert technical operations spanning several months. The investigation was notably reliant on analysis derived from mobile device geolocation data aggregated from telecommunications service providers under judicial authorisation, correlated with social media metadata captured through lawful interception. These high-level investigative activities required extensive cross-agency collaboration, involving the National Cyber Crime Unit, MI5’s technical branch, and regional mental health liaison teams who assessed the defendant’s presentation and risk during various interaction points.

The court is acutely aware that these multi-agency operations, while indispensable to national security, place enormous pressure on finite investigative and analytic resources. The burden on the National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES), already contending with a backlog measured in thousands of devices, was substantial. The capacity constraints within those specialist units remain a matter of serious concern. It is also worth noting the significant costs incurred in deploying signals intelligence assets to monitor encrypted chat rooms and virtual private network nodes associated with the defendant’s online conduct.

It is recognised by the court that the defendant’s case also suffered procedural delay, occasioned by the extension of reporting timelines from the forensic psychiatry services due to his intermittent voluntary engagement and the necessity of conducting multiple risk assessments under the Offender Personality Disorder pathway. These delays, further prolonged by the initial refusal of the Legal Aid Agency to authorise expert reports without extensive paperwork, illustrate systemic barriers well documented in recent parliamentary oversight hearings regarding criminal justice funding and mental health service provision.

During the course of the proceedings, the welfare and safety of those indirectly impacted have not been overlooked. The support offered to victims, or more accurately, potential victims who contacted local resilience forums for advice amidst heightened public anxiety triggered by associated media coverage, is acknowledged with respect. Several victim liaison officers reported commendable professionalism in managing discrete updates and offering timely psychological first aid referrals.

The court also records that a referral had initially been made in May 2021 by a further-education instructor, who noted troubling deviations in Mr H’s coursework, which included copying of extremist propaganda without critical analysis. That referral, considered under the statutory Channel programme, was discontinued after the initial risk panel concluded there was no immediate threat. Whether subsequent developments could have been foreseen remains a question for policymakers rather than adjudicators.

The defendant elected to enter pleas of not guilty on the first occasion of his appearance before this court on 14 March 2025. He maintained those pleas throughout the lengthy pre-trial period, including bail hearings and detailed case management hearings on 9 April and 22 May 2025, respectively. It was not until the morning of trial, on 15 August 2025, that Mr H amended his plea to guilty on all counts. The lateness of this change compels the court to consider carefully the mitigating weight to be afforded for this guilty plea. The well-established jurisprudence, including the recent pronouncement in R v. Waddington [2024] EWCA Crim 1265, underlines that the timing of a plea is a critical factor and that the fullest credit is properly reserved for early admissions which demonstrably spare the court and victims the ordeal of contested proceedings.

The defendant’s conduct, as revealed by the prosecution case, was characterised by a clear and deliberate effort to obtain materials for the construction of improvised explosive devices and to cultivate sympathisers via encrypted channels. The Crown relies heavily on expert witness testimony outlining the technical sophistication evident in Mr H’s digital activities, which included the use of layered encryption, the deployment of dead-drop messaging protocols, and the careful operational security to evade detection.

Reference has been made to the seminal authority of R v. Iqbal [2015] EWCA Crim 32, which elucidates the significance of preparatory acts in the context of terrorism offences. The judgment stresses the context and accumulated weight of such acts, even when no attack has been executed, recognising that the law requires sufficient latitude to intervene early on the basis of credible threat.

Among the various materials recovered were engineering blueprints for accelerant dispersal mechanisms, and digital manuals on the manufacture of detonators adapted from sources widely available on darknet forums hosted outside the jurisdiction. Of particular note was the meticulous manner in which Mr H anonymised his communications, including employing onion routing VPNs and the use of removable media wiped with multiple data shredding methods.

Forensic examination disclosed that the defendant maintained an extensive library of ideological publications, including manifestos and audio-visual propaganda disseminated by proscribed organisations. Linguistic analysis by court-appointed experts affirmed the defendant’s use of jargon reflective of incitement and direct advocacy for violent jihadist acts. The court is mindful of the difficulty in distinguishing between unorthodox but legal forms of expression and those that cross into facilitation, a balance addressed in R v. Chen [2018] EWCA Crim 987.

These factors align with the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines, which compel courts to weigh the gravity of the material and the defendant’s intention to channel it into harmful acts.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

There was some suggestion by the defence that certain technical materials had been accumulated as part of academic interest, referencing a long-dormant blog maintained by Mr H which dealt with theoretical discussions of civil engineering failures. The court has thoroughly considered this submission but finds it inconsistent with the broader pattern of concealment and the targeted communications exhibited.

The court records, for completeness, that during the investigation, minor ancillary offences unrelated to terrorism were disclosed. Specifically, a 2022 conviction for shoplifting alcohol and toiletries from a supermarket some miles distant, as well as an historic fixed penalty for driving without a valid licence attached to the defendant’s name, were referenced in documentation provided to the prosecution. These incidents, while noted, are peripheral and do not influence the culpability or sentencing in the instant case.

It should also be noted that a co-defendant named in the original charge was subsequently discharged at the preliminary hearing owing to evidential insufficiency. The co-defendant is not before this court and hence any offences allegedly committed by that individual, including an unrelated charge for affray following a pub disturbance, do not bear upon Mr H’s sentencing.

In May 2023, immigration and travel records indicate that the defendant undertook a brief visit to Belgium. While the defence posit this as a routine business trip, it transpires that Mr H visited locales known for hosting far-right and extremist gatherings, as confirmed by foreign security services’ reports. CCTV footage corroborated his presence at a gathering with individuals under international surveillance for distribution of extremist material. No direct evidence established participation in criminality during that visit.

The disclosure process in this case was extensive, encompassing over 800 exhibits with complex classification levels, including several documents marked ‘Secret’ necessitating additional handling protocols. The court acknowledges the painstaking efforts of CPS Counter Terrorism Division and the security-cleared advocates involved, who ensured adherence to the Criminal Procedure Rules and the strict guidelines imposed by the Practice Direction on Sensitive Material. The desire to balance open justice with national security imperatives remained paramount throughout.

The court also notes, as part of the institutional background, a period of regional court staff strike action during March 2025 which delayed listing of the contested trial from its initial estimate of June to July. Such industrial action has been referenced frequently in judicial reviews addressing access to justice and highlights ongoing tensions within the justice sector.

Of particular concern is the financial trail uncovered by investigators. Cryptocurrency transactions totalling approximately £4,800 were routed through anonymous wallet addresses linked to darknet marketplaces known to traffic in explosives precursors. The sophistication of these transfers involved multiple mixing services designed to conceal end use and origin, emerging as part of a growing trend noted in the 2024 National Crime Agency Threat Assessment.

There is a broader policy debate over the regulation of such financial instruments. While blockchain offers legitimate utility in several sectors, its misuse presents new challenges which lawmakers have yet fully to address. The court welcomes continued interdepartmental efforts but underscores the importance of judicial oversight to safeguard fundamental rights while empowering effective investigation.

The workload on digital investigators here was augmented by the necessity to decode encrypted files with partially corrupted headers, involving iterative manual password guessing and reverse engineering. The resource intensity of such tasks cannot be overstated: a matter well-documented in parliamentary committee reports on policing and cybercrime funding.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is aged 30 and holds a degree in electrical engineering from a mid-ranking university. Prior to his arrest, he was self-employed as a freelance CAD technician, primarily servicing automotive clients. References from former employers stress his punctuality and technical competence but also remark upon a noted withdrawal from social activities commencing in late 2022.

Letters submitted to the court from a local photography club highlight his enthusiasm and artistic ability in landscape photography, including a series of nature shots recently exhibited at a community arts festival. While such pursuits ordinarily would form a component of mitigating personal background, in this context they form part of the wider complex mosaic of the defendant’s life, underscoring the sometimes hidden nature of radicalisation.

The court is cognisant that voluntary organisations supporting vulnerable adults have expressed concerns about service capacity and funding shortfalls. It is a regrettable reality that multi-agency schemes designed to offer timely intervention often operate at or beyond their stretch limits, rendering earlier preventative work challenging. The Ministry of Justice has commissioned reviews into extending resource allocations but effective implementation remains pending.

The probation officer allocated to this case has submitted a thorough bail supervision report noting the defendant’s compliance with licence conditions pre-trial, albeit with evident reluctance to engage substantively with rehabilitative programmes offered. Specialist counter-extremism mentors from the West Midlands Prevent Hub have likewise reported mixed interactions, noting some sporadic attendance but no demonstrable disengagement from radical ideation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

A psychiatric assessment from Dr Rupert Sandwell, forensic consultant to Northfield Secure Hospital, diagnoses no formal psychotic or personality disorder but identifies significant cognitive inflexibility and entrenched ideological obsession consistent with high risk of re-offending without intensive management. The risk assessment concludes that the defendant requires multi-modal intervention including close supervision, structured cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to grievance-based extremism, and electronic monitoring post-release.

Defence submissions urge consideration of less restrictive community measures, citing partial engagement in voluntary programmes and absence of prior convictions. The court has examined authorities including R v. Ammari [2021] EWCA Crim 392 and notes the judiciary’s duty to balance rehabilitation potential against the paramountist mandate to protect the public from harm.

This defendant’s actions reflect a disturbing strategic threat, placing this case within the upper echelons of culpability under current sentencing frameworks. Aggravating factors include planning for indiscriminate mass harm, use of sophisticated encryption and anonymisation, and recruitment tendencies.

Mitigation is limited to early adult acquiescence to counsel’s submissions and the late guilty plea, for which only restricted credit is appropriate after the extensive preparatory work undertaken by prosecution and defence alike.

The court therefore directs the compilation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The probation service is specifically requested to consider the feasibility of high-intensity supervision under MAPPA Category 3, including the suitability for an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Assessments should explore the availability of approved premises with specialist security features, the possibility of GPS monitoring with exclusion zones, and the integration of structured de-radicalisation intervention programming.

The court expresses no final view on sentence at this stage but emphasises that public safety considerations will be paramount.

These sentencing remarks are pronounced this day, the 1st of September 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted accordingly.

These are the orders of the court.
