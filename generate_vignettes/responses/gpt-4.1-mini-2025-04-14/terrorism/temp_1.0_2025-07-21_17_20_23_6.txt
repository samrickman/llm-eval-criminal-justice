IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/19654  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. CARTER  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court to be sentenced for an indictment containing two counts: one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a second count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending period, as established by the prosecution, spans from November 2022 until his arrest in January 2025.  

The defendant was initially taken into custody at 04:48 on 12 January 2025 following an extensive operation led by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands that executed a warrant on his residence at Flat 15, Claremont House, Perry Barr. The autorisation of these warrants was obtained under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, informed by intelligence gathered by the Security Service and corroborated through signals interception indicating the presence of encrypted communications synchronized with known extremist servers. Included in the items seized were several encrypted storage devices, an assortment of electronic components consistent with improvised explosive devices, and multiple layers of obfuscated digital material.

The investigative team operated under severe and ongoing resource constraints. It must be noted that Counter Terrorism Policing units nationally are grappling with scrutiny of intelligence prioritization amid budget reductions and rising caseloads. Despite this, the coordination between regional units and the National Cyber Crime Unit was efficient, and the subsequent forensic digital examination was carried out with methodical precision over a period of several months. The substantial volume and complexity of encrypted data necessitated engagement with external technological specialists in cryptanalysis and data reconstruction, highlighting the growing intersection of technical expertise and law enforcement in responding to ideologically-motivated threats.  

At the first hearing in the Crown Court on 25 February 2025, Mr H entered pleas of not guilty to both counts. The matter was listed for a trial preparation hearing approximately twelve weeks later. During this interim, the court was advised of multiple applications by the defence to admit further expert psychiatric assessments and a supplementary disclosure application, resulting in an adjournment of the trial date. Such adjournments, while regrettable, are not uncommon in cases of this magnitude where technical and psychological complexities demand thorough scrutiny to ensure fairness.  

In reflecting on procedural evolutions within the criminal justice system, it may be observed that the introduction of the Better Case Management (BCM) regime has sought to mitigate prolonged adjournments and holdups. While conceived to streamline pre-trial operations and encourage early guilty pleas, the utility of BCM in terrorism cases remains circumscribed by the substantial evidential and disclosure burdens inherent to such prosecutions. This is exemplified in the present case where technological disclosure demands have necessitated extended investigative and defence preparation timeframes.

The defence’s representation deserves mention, led by Mr James Thornton QC and junior counsel Ms Eleanor Maddox. Their submissions have been diligent and professionally robust despite the often logistically challenging nature of the case, including the coordination of multi-jurisdictional forensic materials and the management of restricted sensitive security information. It is proper to recognise that the conduct of both Crown and defence counsel has largely complied with the expected standards, notwithstanding this court’s frustration with the relatively slow decision-making processes experienced with the Legal Aid Agency, which prolonged the authorisation of additional investigative hours by a number of weeks. Such delays are obstructive and hinder the overall administration of justice in these highly demanding cases.  

The court acknowledges letters of support from community groups submitted on behalf of the defendant, including correspondence from the Saltley Community Inclusion Project, which noted Mr H’s past volunteer involvement in local foodbank distribution efforts. While civic participation is laudable, it is essential not to exaggerate the mitigating influence of such activities in offsetting the gravity of the charges relating to terrorism. Rather, these letters illustrate the complexity of individuals within community networks who may simultaneously engage in positive social acts alongside gravely harmful conduct.

At all times, the custodial sentence imposed must reflect the dual imperatives emphasised by the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines: deterrence and the protection of the public. Deterrence serves not only to dissuade the defendant from further criminal acts but also to signal clearly to others contemplating similar offences that such conduct will not be tolerated and will bear severe consequences. Public protection is paramount, particularly given the unpredictable and insidious forms terrorism can take, often mimicking ordinary conduct to avoid detection until too late.  

In considering precedent, recourse may be made to the decision in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 which underscores the wide ambit of “terrorist purpose” encompassing preparatory and supportive acts that facilitate potential violence, whether or not a physical attack ultimately materialises. The court is mindful also of the ruling in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which instructs that early disruption of a terrorist plot does not lessen the culpability where intent can be established and that long determinate sentences are appropriate for prevention and denunciation.  

The defendant’s digital footprint was of considerable evidentiary value. Forensic examination of encrypted volumes discovered on physical devices seized from the defendant’s home revealed a catalogue of electronically stored instructions, manuals on explosive construction, and communications referencing proscribed organisations. These materials were carefully concealed within nested encryption containers and distributed across multiple cloud-based platforms to avoid detection. One particularly notable file was encrypted under the label “PhoenixManifest.”  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The defence contended some content could represent innocuous hobbyist interests or material downloaded incidentally. However, the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the nature and complexity of the digital archives demonstrate deliberate procurement, retention, and operational knowledge consistent with the prosecution case. This is strictly distinguished from the mere possession of extremist literature in isolation, which, while still serious, may not correlate with a preparatory function.  

Further, during the period of alleged offending, Mr H engaged in encrypted communications designed to test supplier reliability in acquiring precursor chemicals. The surveillance and extracted communications reveal links between Mr H and an unindicted individual, who is currently at large and believed to be involved in other unrelated offences, including burglary of a private dwelling during a holiday absence and criminal damage to a church noticeboard in a nearby town. These offences, while apposite to contextualise investigation focus, are not attributable to Mr H and therefore remain outside the scope of culpability here.  

The court took careful note of the offending’s chronology and the defendant’s patterns of behaviour, including his attendance at workshops ostensibly devoted to electronics and mechanical engineering. Such education and experience, while not inherently culpable, provided the technical foundation for the sophistication of the preparatory acts. This understanding reflects the ever-increasing challenges faced by law enforcement in preventing attacks by individuals possessing high degrees of specialised knowledge and the ability to exploit common materials for nefarious use.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Mr H’s personal circumstances, as summarised in the pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation Service, describe a man in his early 30s with no previous convictions but a complicated history of social isolation and intermittent involvement with mental health services. The report, compiled with information from the Community Mental Health Team and local housing officers, reflects the complexities of multi-agency case management amidst increasing demand and limited resources. Notably, it refers to the impact of housing insecurity in the defendant’s early adulthood and a period of homelessness punctuated by temporary accommodation placements, which contributed to vulnerabilities later exploited by extremist influences.  

The court was also assisted by a detailed psychiatric report from Dr Felicity Crane, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who assessed the defendant at Waverly Forensic Unit. Dr Crane’s report, dated 30 August 2025, references Mr H’s pronounced cognitive rigidity and evidence of maladaptive belief systems. She concluded that while there is no formal diagnosis of psychotic illness or major affective disorder, there is a significant risk of relapse into extremist ideological adherence without intensive psychological intervention and stringent supervision on licence. The report emphasises the challenges of re-engagement when such offenders disengage from voluntary radicalisation programmes.  

The court acknowledges the efforts of the West Midlands Prevent Hub, which maintained contact with the defendant over a prolonged period prior to arrest, offering but ultimately failing to sustain Mr H’s engagement with tailored disengagement interventions. Their outreach was hampered by both capacity constraints and the defendant’s sporadic cooperation, a cautionary note on the limits of voluntary schemes in the face of entrenched ideology.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Further complicating risk management are findings regarding the defendant’s use of cryptocurrency to facilitate transactions. A financial forensic investigation revealed a transfer of approximately £3,100 in Bitcoin routed through multiple mixing services before reaching an online marketplace associated with dual-use chemical components. These anonymised financial movements present typical challenges in contemporary counter-terrorism financial investigations, necessitating collaboration with specialist agencies and international counterparts.  

The court is compelled to remark upon the proliferation of such digital assets in facilitating illicit activities, a trend that amplifies investigative complexity and requires legislative and enforcement agility. While such technology offers many legitimate benefits, its exploitation by offenders to conceal procurement chains underlines the evolving nature of threats and the necessity for proportionate but robust regulatory frameworks.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

On the matter of procedural fairness, the court notes that the defendant submitted several evidential challenges, including disputes over the admissibility of intercepted communications and the method of electronic forensic extraction. These disputes were resolved in prior hearings, and the court is satisfied that the defendant was afforded full opportunity to present his defence within a fair trial framework. The jury returned verdicts of guilty after a five-day trial in July 2025.  

The court is mindful that Mr H’s conduct, though serious and calculated, occurred in a social milieu impacted by rising levels of street-level antisocial behaviour and visible community tensions. The deteriorating social cohesion in certain urban areas serves as an important backdrop to the genesis of radicalisation, as studied in recent criminological research. Nonetheless, this context offers no mitigation for deliberate engagement in acts preparatory to terrorism.  

In support of sentencing submissions, the defence presented character references including from Mr H’s university mentor, who described him as “gifted with an enquiring mind” and “engaged in social justice causes.” There was also submitted a letter from an estranged sibling, who is currently the subject of separate criminal proceedings for harassment offences. Neither letter mitigates the defendant’s culpability here, but illustrates the complexity and sometimes troubled nature of the defendant’s familial relationships.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The sentencing framework requires a careful balancing exercise—recognising the defendant’s hitherto unblemished record, his educational qualifications, and expressed remorse, albeit belated and partial, alongside the imperative to deter, denounce, and incapacitate to protect the public from future harm. The court is cognisant of research indicating that programmes such as the Structured Professional Judgement approach and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy-based desistance models have demonstrated mixed success. Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon probation and health services to pursue every credible avenue to reduce risk.  

In conclusion, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, with particular emphasis on the prospects for rehabilitation, risk management strategies, and suitable accommodation arrangements post-release. The Probation Service is requested to liaise with the West Midlands Prevent Hub, local housing authorities, and mental health providers to ensure a coherent resettlement plan is in place. The court reserves final sentence until receipt and consideration of these materials and any further representations.  

These sentencing remarks are given this day on 17 September 2025, in Court 4 of the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of the conviction and sentence will be dispatched to the relevant authorities.  

These are the orders of the court.
