IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/34902  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. A. Fenwick  
Filed: 20 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence upon his conviction on multiple counts including engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, alongside possession of an article for use in connection with terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences span a period beginning late 2022 and culminating in Mr H’s arrest earlier this year. 

His initial remand hearing was conducted on 4 March 2025 before District Judge Hopkins at Avon Magistrates’ Court, following which bail was refused on grounds of risk to the public and the seriousness of the allegation. The court notes that this bail decision was unchallenged and that Mr H has since been held on remand without incident. The remand status reduced opportunities for pre-sentence community assessments, a matter which may regrettably delay some aspects of procedural disposition.

It is indispensable, at the outset, to reflect briefly on the evolution of the relevant statutory framework. The Terrorism Act 2006 represented a significant legislative tightening following extensive review prompted by case law such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 which addressed the breadth of acts preparatory to terrorism. The provisions strive to balance constitutional safeguards with the pressing need for preventative powers to counter modern ideological violence, a task complicated not only by the diversity of threats but by evolving tactics - increasingly sophisticated use of encrypted communications, for example, as well as the challenges posed by decentralised extremism and self-radicalisation. 

The present case falls uncomfortably within that demanding landscape. Whereas historic terrorism prosecutions might have involved state-sponsored or hierarchical groups, contemporary cases evidence engagement with online manifestos, patchwork operational planning, and independent initiative, thus testing even well-honed prosecutorial and policing capabilities. Policing of “lone actor” or “small cell” phenomena moreover places acute pressure upon intelligence sharing at precinct and crown level—especially in an era of constrained public budgets and ongoing service pressures.

It is noted with interest that the Gloucestershire Community Cohesion Forum sought to provide contextual submissions on the impact of public discourse surrounding terrorism charges, cautioning against overgeneralisation and the stigmatization of religious minorities. Such public engagement is welcomed, albeit extrinsic to the instant sentencing exercise. The legitimate concerns raised about the social repercussions of stigmatising communities must be acknowledged but balanced rigorously alongside the imperatives of conviction and public protection.

Schedules of evidence submitted ran to over 3,400 pages, encompassing intercepted communications, forensic digital recovery data, witness statements, and expert analytical reports. These materials were exhaustively reviewed by the defence team, led commendably by Mr Jasper Fielding of Counsel, under a legal aid allocation which had initially capped preparatory work at an unrealistic 120 hours before being increased following application. The notorious delays and caps imposed by the Legal Aid Agency remain an unfortunate and persistent hurdle in high-complexity terrorism work. Such limitations risk eroding the equality of arms the adversarial system aims to protect.

A Channel Programme referral was noted from February 2021 when university staff raised concerns regarding Mr H’s attendance at lectures where inflammatory rhetoric was reportedly uttered. That referral, however, failed to advance beyond the initial assessment phase due to perceived absence of imminent risk. Channel’s gatekeeping function continues to face critical scrutiny, not least given the low conversion rate of referrals into formally treated cases; nonetheless, multi-agency oversight remains an invaluable tool when effectively deployed.

A trial management hearing was conducted on 1 July 2025, when the case was heard in Bristol Crown Court’s Courtroom 9, newly refurbished and with updated video-link facilities accommodating witnesses abroad. The hearing was adjourned due to late disclosure issues, notably involving encrypted files stored on cloud servers outside the jurisdiction, a problem increasingly encountered and repeatedly lamented by prosecuting authorities.

The Crown’s case rested heavily upon the expert testimony of Dr Amal Sheikh, a digital forensics consultant with over fifteen years’ experience in counter-terrorism projects. Dr Sheikh’s detailed reports traced the defendant’s online activity, including the use of anonymisation networks and instant messaging applications commonly scrutinised in extremist groups. Of particular note was the recovery of chat logs referencing materials previously identified in the International Security Agency’s “Proscribed Literature Database,” which features heavily in prior offences identified within the Swindon Circuit involving importation of extremist texts.

This court takes judicial notice of the sustained pressures on Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) teams managing increased workloads relating to digital investigations. Local force briefing notes reveal that during 2024, investigations into extremist content rose by 32%, outpacing available specialist analyst recruitment by a factor of nearly two. The dedication of those officers is commendable and must be recognised in the context of growing operational demands that stretch thinly staffed units beyond reasonable limits.

Without belabouring matters, it is germane to observe that this court's registry has faced its own challenges with listing. Industrial action at the wider courts service in late spring delayed availability of hearing rooms for several weeks, creating a backlog for terrorism-related matters. The presiding Judge thanks staff for their resilience during these periods and regrets any inconvenience caused to participants.

The defendant has availed himself of Legal Aid representation throughout. Noteworthy is a letter from Mr Fielding dated 12 August 2025 expressing concerns over impediments to service delivery imposed by budgetary constraints, including restrictions on specialist expert retention and forensic transcription turnaround times.

Reference is also made to the fact that Mr H’s elder brother, not himself implicated in the charges here, faces unrelated proceedings for alleged benefit fraud in a neighbouring jurisdiction. Such peripheral matters bear no consequence on the instant sentencing exercise beyond demonstrating the familial context within which the defendant resides.

The victim impact statements submitted underscore the profound residual anxiety felt by the community following news coverage of the arrest and trial. Though direct physical victims are absent here, community representatives describe a sense of betrayal and distrust engendered by the defendant’s conduct.

The circumstances surrounding the defendant’s facilitation of remote acquisition of dual-use components—materials that, while susceptible to legitimate modeling or engineering use, retain the potential for weaponisation—highlight the complexity of intention in cases involving emerging technologies. Specialists in emerging threat modalities have commented that such component acquisition patterns are signals warranting urgent risk assessment.

This court is mindful of previous appellate authorities including R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, which established that the offence’s gravity encompasses preparatory conduct unexecuted but demonstrative of clear intent. Additionally, the principle elucidated in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 underpins the imposition of extended sentences in cases where risk trajectories are deemed elevated.

Recovered communications revealed attempts by Mr H to exchange coded messages relating to improvised explosive device component designs. Among these messages was a file named “Helios – final,” apparently detailing a remote detonation protocol side-stepped via proxy server infrastructures. This aligns with evidence collated during Operation WRENCH, a multi-agency investigation into a previously disrupted plan involving a known co-conspirator who was convicted in 2024 for an unrelated act of arson involving two commercial warehouses.

It is emphasized, however, that while certain co-defendants have been charged with offences such as affray and possession of a bladed article, these charges are distinct and not attributable to Mr H in the present matter.

The police service’s continued difficulty in processing the surging tide of digital forensic material is, regrettably, all too apparent. The increasing reliance on third-party cloud storage and foreign-hosted resources complicates timely action. This case is an exemplar of the problem: analysis took months to complete, hampered further by software incompatibilities.

The defendant’s usage of social media to disseminate extremist narratives has been traced through accounts deactivated shortly after arrest. The Crown refers to an account coded under the nom de plume “IronFist” purporting to share manifestos and calls to arms. Efforts to recover this content have been met with mixed success due to rapid deletion protocols.

Mr H also attended a training camp abroad, allegedly under the cover of pursuing architectural interests. Documentation includes a single return ticket from Bristol to a Mediterranean country, with connecting travel to a remote region cited by security agencies as a nexus for radical recruitment and arms smuggling. Intelligence intercepted during that trip has been instrumental in piecing together the broader network facilitating equipment transfer.

The court recalls the salient principles enunciated in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, which addressed the intersection of mental health and premeditated criminality, noting the necessity to balance rehabilitation and deterrence without compromising public protection.

While a pre-sentence psychiatric report was not available at this sentencing stage due to ongoing commissioning delays within the NHS forensic psychiatry panel (exceptionally backlogged beyond anticipated timelines), a preliminary screening report authored by Dr Navid Rahman of the Avon and Somerset Secure Unit reached the court. The report highlighted cognitive traits consistent with ideological rigidity but stopped short of diagnosing enduring mental illness.

The defendant’s history, including brief employment at a local engineering firm known as TechSolutions Ltd, where he was disciplinarily queried over online activity during work hours, was elicited. Letters of character submitted by staff at TechSolutions and a local youth mentorship program depict a person outwardly conscientious yet socially withdrawn.

The court has received correspondence from the Bristol Peace Initiative, a community organisation advocating for peacebuilding and reintegration of individuals disengaging from radical ideology. Their communication expresses cautious optimism about rehabilitation possibilities but stresses the imperative of structured and professionally supported intervention regimes.

Travel records chart Mr H’s journey to a European capital where he allegedly met with individuals subsequently arrested in a separate investigation pertaining to the illegal importation of industrial chemicals. Although those co-defendants pleaded guilty to offences including fly-tipping on protected green belt land and theft of copper cabling from railway depots, no charges have been apportioned to Mr H concerning environmental offences or property crime.

The prosecuting Crown has outlined historic case law concerning delays in guilty pleas, referencing especially R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145, a burglary case in which the late plea occasioned a reduction of mitigating credit. The principle that credit for guilty pleas is tempered by timing and motivation resonates in the present proceedings, Mr H having entered pleas close to commencement of trial.

Financial investigations have traced cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H, involving amounts totalling approximately £3,280 GBP transferred to a known darknet marketplace vendor specialising in materials with dual-use capabilities. The payment trail was obscured via “tumbling” services designed to frustrate law enforcement tracing efforts.

Such utilisation of decentralised currency platforms continues to challenge regulatory frameworks and investigative methodologies, amplifying complexities in fully accounting for the defendant’s resource mobilisation.

Documents tendered include detailed logs of surveillance conducted, including late-night foot patrol recordings in the vicinity of the River Avon embankment where Mr H met with a known extremist operative. The surveillance operation consumed significant manpower and technological resources over several weeks, pointing to the resource-intensive nature of contemporary counter-terrorism policing.

Other exhibits unrelated to the defendant but introduced for evidential completeness reflect the arrest of a co-defendant for impersonating a police officer during the execution of a separate warrant, as well as a minor assault on arresting officers using a chair in an unrelated offence several months later.

Mr H is 31 years old. Personal circumstances include a degree in applied physics from a regional university, a brief stint as a CAD technician, and a history of mental health engagement initially for anxiety and, latterly, for cognitive rigidity linked to dogmatic ideological belief. The court recognises the comprehensive psychiatric reports authored by Dr Esther Wyler, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who profiles Mr H as “highly risk-prone when exposed to extremist stimulus but currently amenable to structured intervention.”

Letters submitted on his behalf by community mentors and the local mosque council stressed his initial engagement with faith but expressed regret at his subsequent alienation and distancing from communal life.

Notwithstanding the consistency of Mr H’s prior civic engagement, including volunteering at food banks and community clean-up events, no derogation of sentence is merited on the grounds that pro-social activity extenuates conduct otherwise clearly detrimental to public safety.

The court is aware that the Second Chance Employment Trust has offered support for future vocational rehabilitation, highlighting the pressing need for meaningful employment pathways as a factor in deradicalisation frameworks.

Professor Robert Llewellyn, appointed as a forensic risk assessor, underscores a concerning pattern of “binary reasoning coupled with motivational amplification concerning grievances.” His risk assessment places Mr H in the highest category for prospective ideological activity, recommending robust supervision upon release, if such occurs.

The court notes the growing array of available measures including licence conditions encompassing GPS enforcement, electronic monitoring with area exclusion zones, and mandated participation in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) run by the East Bristol Prevent Hub.

The assessment also flags the difficulties that may arise from limited accommodation options with adequate security infrastructure, alongside stretched mental health services—both descriptors resonating with recent parliamentary reports on the systemic pressures in offender reintegration.

In addressing the sentencing framework, this court is guided principally by the Terrorism Act 2006 and the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Definitive Guidelines. The court weighs factors including the level of premeditation, sophistication of planning, risk of harm envisaged, and the broader societal impact of the offending.

Aggravating factors here are significant: the use of encryption, attempts to procure materials with known violent applications, and association with ideologically motivated extremist networks. Mitigating factors are sparse and chiefly comprised of Mr H’s previous clean record, educational attainment, and submission of a guilty plea albeit late in the process.

The interplay between deterrence of similar conduct, protection of the public, and the rehabilitative potential of the offender form the principled basis for sentencing determination. The court is respectful of defence submissions advocating for credit in view of letters submitted from charitable organisations but is mindful that such factors cannot eclipse the gravity of the crimes proven.

This case exemplifies the multi-agency cooperation imperative in counter-terrorism work. Not only police and prosecutorial teams but social services, mental health providers, and community organisations stand at the junction of prevention and response. Careful coordination remains the key to eventual risk reduction.

These sentencing remarks conclude the substantive observations on this matter. I hereby direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service. This report should specifically address options for custodial management, assessing suitability for Extended Determinate Sentence considerations under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and the potential application of the Managing Ideologically Motivated Offenders (MIMO) protocol. The report must further comment on psychological intervention prospects and post-release supervision frameworks including MAPPA Category 3 oversight.

In closing, the court records its sincere thanks to Ms Felicity Moore QC who has appeared on behalf of the Crown with assured professionalism throughout, and to Mr Jasper Fielding, who has represented Mr H under a full legal aid mandate. Appreciation is also due to the court ushers and administrative staff whose efforts maintain the operation of this jurisdiction amid resource constraints.

These sentencing remarks are issued this 20th day of September 2025 in Court 9 at Bristol Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcriptionally recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be placed on record and distributed to parties accordingly. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
