IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/28964  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. T. Greaves  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H stands convicted following a jury trial on two counts under terrorism legislation: one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending behaviour spans the period from autumn 2022 until his arrest in January 2025.  

The procedural history of the case has been lengthy and at times complex. Mr H was arrested at 04:23 on 13 January 2025, following a multi-agency warrant execution at a residence in Southville, Bristol, conducted by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The warrants were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following detailed intercept intelligence indicating that an encrypted communications device linked to the defendant had been used to disseminate extremist manuals hosted on a foreign server listed as proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. At arrest, several electronic devices were seized including encrypted mobile phones, solid-state drives, and printed materials on chemical precursors.

The investigation that preceded Mr H's arrest was notable for its deployment of sophisticated digital forensic techniques. CTPSW collaborated with the National Digital Investigations Unit, whose personnel worked extensively to recover encrypted communications and deleted electronic artefacts. This forensic effort was complicated by the defendant’s use of bespoke Linux-based virtual machines and steganographic techniques for data concealment. At the time, the National Unit was managing an unprecedented backlog of devices, exceeding 12,000 cases, which inevitably imposed delays upon analysis. The resources dedicated to Mr H’s prosecution thus reflect the gravity with which the State viewed the threat posed by his conduct.  

In the early stages, the case was marked by delays associated with the Legal Aid Agency’s approval of funding for necessary psychiatric expertise. Defence counsel made an urgent application to instruct an independent expert to evaluate Mr H’s mental state and assess ideological fixations. That application was not granted until four months after initial request, resulting in a compressed timeline for report compilation. This court has previously expressed concern about systemic hurdles posed by funding shortfalls and administrative inertia within the Legal Aid system. These are not trivial matters, as they directly affect a defendant’s right to adequate representation and the courts’ ability to complete proceedings within reasonable timeframes.  

The Channel programme had engaged with the defendant intermittently since 2021. An initial referral came from staff at a local university following Mr H’s submission of a political science essay containing quotations from extremist literature without critical context. The Channel panel convened on two occasions but concluded that risk factors at the time did not warrant further intervention. That determination, while perhaps open to public debate, remains a judgment of specialist case workers operating under complex constraints. Regrettably, early-warning mechanisms such as these remain imperfect; individuals may slip through initial screening only to surface later as genuine threats.       

Of procedural note, the matter was first listed for plea and trial preparation hearing on 2 April 2025. Mr H entered a not guilty plea at that stage and pleaded in the same vein throughout the trial process. However, on the morning of the concluding day of the trial in July 2025, having heard the strength of the prosecution’s evidence, he entered pleas of guilty to both counts. The court is bound to reflect upon the timing of this plea, as the jurisprudence is clear that credit for a guilty plea is not an automatic entitlement but depends materially on its timing and sincerity.  

It has become a regrettably frequent pattern in contemporary criminal practice for defendants to defer guilty pleas until the evidential noose tightens. This forum has often cautioned that such delay impedes the proper administration of justice, ensures prolonged victim distress, and imposes heightened costs on public resources. This court, therefore, accords a modest, tempered discount on sentence in recognition of the plea, limited by the late stage at which it was entered.  

The Court of Appeal’s judgment in R v. Longstaff [2019] EWCA Crim 1239 provides authoritative guidance on the proper assessment of plea credit in terrorism-related offences. There, the court observed the critical importance of a plea being entered at the first realistic opportunity to maximise the practical benefits to justice. Similarly, R v. Daly and Bradley [2021] EWCA Crim 556 reiterated that pleas entered promptly reduce the psychological toll on victims and witnesses and demonstrate genuine remorse. Late pleas, especially those delivered after jury selection or during evidence presentation, attract significantly less mitigation.  

In the borderline context, R v. Sidhu [2018] EWCA Crim 86 addressed the interaction of mental disorder and sentencing credit. While psychiatric impairment may affect culpability and sentencing disposal, it does not entitle a defendant to enhanced plea credit where the plea timing is tactical rather than genuine.  

The relevant statutory maximums for these offences — life imprisonment under section 5(1)(a) of the 2006 Act and, where appropriate, extended sentences pursuant to section 57 of the 2000 Act — provide the sentencing yardstick against which the court measures culpability and risk. The Sentencing Council’s revised Guidelines issued in 2023 offer a comprehensive framework calibrated to the severity, sophistication, and intended harm of the offending. It is axiomatic that terrorism offences attract sentences at the higher end of the spectrum where there is evidence of intent to cause indiscriminate harm or to facilitate remote connections to terrorist entities.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

Mr H’s ideology evolved in a discernible trajectory. For some months in 2023, he maintained a blog under the pseudonym “Technomarauder,” which at first chronicled local concerns regarding urban redevelopment and transport policy. Gradually, the content shifted to espouse grievance narratives sympathetic to proscribed organisations. Expert linguistic analysis tendered during the trial identified clear patterns of mimicry and near-direct quotations from extremist manifestoes published online by banned networks. These data points strongly support the proposition that his engagement transcended mere passive consumption and was active and preparatory in nature.

Recovered digital materials included an encrypted VeraCrypt volume titled “HeronRecipes.” Analysis revealed an assortment of weapon-building manuals, shrapnel dispersal test schematics, and encrypted communications instructing the sourcing of dual-use chemical compounds. It is noted that one of the files encountered a corrupt byte segment on page 47, sparking defence arguments that the defendant may not have possessed or completed review of the full contents. However, given the wider corpus of material and correspondences, this court accepts the materiality of the evidence as establishing intent.  

Importantly, forensic review of recovered social media history identified a dormant Instagram account featuring high-resolution aerial photography of public infrastructure sites, specifically substations and transit hubs. Defence submissions argued these images were benign and consistent with a known hobbyist interest in urban exploration. The court finds such exculpatory assertions unpersuasive when placed in the greater context of the investigation and the defendant’s encrypted communications.  

During the police search of the address, officers encountered a small quantity of cannabis resin in shared living spaces. No charges arose from this finding, and it carries no relevance to the terrorism offences. Defence counsel highlighted a previous local authority fixed-penalty notice for fare evasion on the Bristol Metrobus system in 2020; again, this is irrelevant to the gravity of the present charges and is noted only to illustrate attempts at peripheral mitigation during submissions.

Digital forensic data also revealed twenty-seven encrypted chat threads on the defendant’s device evidencing communications with a known international facilitator. Intercepted messages contained code words and swapping of instructions relating to buying materials consistent with explosive manufacture. Defence suggested the defendant’s travel to Ostend in Belgium for a weekend in May 2024 was purely recreational. Travel records, however, disclosed a same-day journey crossed into a border town with documented extremists' gatherings, alongside witness evidence placing the defendant in conversations with individuals subsequently apprehended for the possession of explosive compounds.

This case generated approximately 835 primary exhibits for disclosure, all vetted under the highest tiers of national security classification by the Joint Operations Security Unit. The volume and security constraints of exhibits imposed heavy operational burdens on staff and necessitated restricted access, contributing to unavoidable listing delays. Defence counsel navigated redaction protocols professionally but with understandable concern over the effects on case progression and client welfare. Such measures must be balanced judiciously between public interest, national security, and the accused’s fair trial rights—a delicate equilibrium the courts must defend vigilantly.  

A forensic accountant briefing tendered to the court traced cryptocurrency transactions from a wallet linked to the defendant’s encrypted email. On 11 December 2024, a sum of 1.2 Ethereum (estimated at £3,400 then) was transferred through multiple mixers to an online marketplace associated with dual-use chemical supplies. The Court notes the growing challenge of cryptocurrency’s role in criminal financing in terrorism cases. While legitimate purposes abound, anonymising tumbler services undermine detection and enforcement efforts. This phenomenon demands continuing legislative and operational responses commensurate with evolving technological realities.

Covert footage documented the defendant’s occasional nocturnal visits to the River Avon embankments between September and November 2024, coinciding with surveillance indicating his handling of materials believed to be consistent with precursor substances. The analytic efforts to confirm these movements were intensive, requiring cross-reference of environmental sensor data with multiple low-light camera feeds, underscoring the disproportionate resource allocation necessitated by such investigations.  

In the realm of public service delivery, it should be recorded that the Probation Service faces structural challenges. Staffing shortages, high caseloads, and the need for specialised counter-terrorism risk management underscore the difficulty in supporting defendants with complex rehabilitation needs such as Mr H. The court is mindful that effective risk management requires adequate institutional capacity.  

The defendant is 31 years old with a degree in computer engineering. Former employers have described him as meticulous but introverted. His last employment role terminated following refusal to complete company security vetting forms, citing privacy concerns. This resignation occurred shortly prior to the escalation of surveillance against him. Character references from members of a local philosophy group have been submitted, praising his “deep ethical curiosity” and “commitment to community discourse,” but such commendations, while appreciated, cannot overshadow the seriousness of the offences.

Professor James Latham, a consultant forensic psychologist, contributed a comprehensive assessment of the defendant. His report identifies traits of cognitive rigidity, “black-and-white” moral assessment, and a tendency toward conspiratorial thinking. Notwithstanding the absence of any diagnosed formal psychiatric disorder, the assessment concludes a high risk of serious harm with continued extremist associations, particularly in unsupervised environments. The report emphasises that desistance prospects, while not nil, depend heavily on structured interventions and sustained multi-agency management.  
Defence counsel argued for mitigation based on Mr H’s partial engagements with voluntary organisations aimed at disengagement from radicalisation, notably the Southside Community Resilience Project and the Bristol Youth Mentoring Programme. These submissions are noted, though the court must recognise the uneven success rates and real organisational challenges, including funding uncertainty and volunteer turnover, which complicate consistent involvement.  

The multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), categorised under Level 3 for high-risk offenders engaged in extremist conduct, have been properly activated in this case. The integrated efforts of probation officers, counter-terrorism police units, NHS forensic mental health services and local authority safeguarding panels remain a cornerstone in protecting the public from recidivist harm. Particular acknowledgment is due to Detective Inspector Rana of Counter Terrorism Policing South West and Dr Fiona Webb of the Avon Secure Psychiatric Centre for their diligent collaboration and unwavering commitment under considerable systemic strain.

This defendant’s engagement with multiple layers of institutional surveillance, forensic evidence, and ideological research reveal a case of substantial gravity. The presence of calculated steps towards manufacture and dissemination of an improvised device, combined with evidence of active affiliations to proscribed groups, raises concerns not only about past conduct but future risk should enhanced supervision not be imposed. The pre-sentence reports will be vital in determining the full sentencing matrix, with particular regard to options for extended sentences, licence requirements mandating GPS monitoring, and potential conditions aimed at digital device restrictions. The court looks toward the feasibility of involving specialist deradicalisation programmes as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation strategy, though recognises the limitations inherent in such schemes as borne out by current evidence.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal hearing for sentence will follow once the pre-sentence reports have been received and considered.  

These are the orders of the court.
