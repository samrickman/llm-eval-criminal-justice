IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/30956  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge I. M. RADCLIFFE  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence upon his conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to Section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and a further count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to Section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct under consideration extends over a significant timeline, beginning in early 2023 and culminating in his arrest in January 2025.  

The court recognises the procedural history of this case, which commenced with a formal investigation initiated in August 2024 under the codename Operation PROXIMA. This investigation was propelled by intelligence received from a combination of sources, including signals intercepts provided by the Security Service and human intelligence reports obtained through confidential informants. Multi-agency coordination was essential, involving Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), specialised units from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, and digital forensic analysts from the National Crime Agency’s Cyber Crime Unit.  

The defendant was subsequently arrested in the early hours of 15 January 2025 at his residence in Bedminster, Bristol, pursuant to a warrant authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. At the time of arrest, officers recovered various electronic devices, including a desktop computer, several encrypted mobile telephones, and a distinctive blue backpack containing electronic components of a nature consistent with the production of improvised explosives.

The evidential process post-arrest was methodical and expansive. Digital forensic examination involved the use of state-of-the-art decryption software, augmented by manual analysis from examiners trained to recover data from encrypted containers and anti-forensic artifacts, such as false partitions and steganographically concealed files. This process proved to be prolonged, affected in part by the defendant’s deployment of sophisticated obfuscation techniques and the extensive volume of data, exceeding 3.7 terabytes in total.  

The duty of disclosure in such complex terrorism proceedings highlights the friction between the imperatives of national security and the right to a fair trial. In this case, the Crown complied with stringent protocols overseen by the Counter Terrorism Disclosure Management Board, applying redactions as necessary and utilising special advocates where appropriate to protect sensitive intelligence sources, pursuant to section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013. Despite these safeguards, it is regrettable that defence counsel reported challenges in accessing certain material promptly, a problem not unique to this case but symptomatic of systemic pressures within the justice system's handling of sensitive material.  

It is necessary to place on record the court's observations concerning the role of the Legal Aid Agency in this matter. Mr H was represented throughout by counsel appointed under a public funding order. At various stages, the court received applications from defence solicitors seeking additional preparation time and resources, most notably in relation to instructing independent technical and psychological experts. These applications were met with procedural delays owing to administrative backlogs within the Legal Aid Agency. Such delays inevitably place additional strain on all participants and have the potential to prejudice the timely administration of justice. It is a matter deserving of urgent attention by policymakers to ensure that defendants in cases of this gravity receive adequate representation without undue impediment.  

The prosecution’s case was first listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 28 March 2025. Despite initial indications of a not guilty plea, Mr H altered his position at trial commencement on 11 August 2025, entering pleas of guilty to both counts. The Crown appropriately recognised the late nature of these pleas and indicated limited mitigation accordingly.  

The court is mindful of the jurisprudence governing credit for guilty pleas. Broadly consistent are the observations made in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, where the Court of Appeal asserted the necessity that early pleas of guilty be incentivised by comparatively greater reductions in sentence than those offered in circumstances where pleas are entered only after the prosecution's denial case has become compelling beyond reasonable doubt. The rationale for this approach derives from the overriding interests of justice, including the conservation of public resources, the reduction of victim and witness trauma, and the promotion of genuine contrition. The court finds those principles directly engaged here.  

The authorities serve as a reminder that the court must be vigilant against the more cynical tactical pleas entered at the eleventh hour solely to secure maximum reduction unavailable through cooperation or early acceptance of responsibility. Against that background, the plea entered by Mr H at the commencement of trial limits the quantum of credit appropriate.  

The appellate decision in R v. Haslett [2021] EWCA Crim 902 similarly illustrates the dangers posed by defences which rely on implausible deniability; in that case, the defendant sought to distance himself from overwhelming scientific and circumstantial evidence concerning the importation of large quantities of Class A drugs concealed within modified commercial vehicles. A Newton hearing was held, and the plea was ultimately accepted at the day of trial, thereby limiting credit to 10%. That case echoes the present circumstance insofar as it serves as a cautionary exemplar of the risks attendant in dilatory pleas and disputed factual bases.  

A further authority worthy of mention is R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, where the Court emphasised the sentencing objectives unique to terrorism offending. Specifically, deterrence, public protection, and denunciation assume exceptional prominence when sentences are calibrated. Notwithstanding mitigation peculiar to individual defendants, these public interest factors remain paramount. The defendant’s conduct is thereby considered in this wider context, as one with potential ramifications beyond the immediate victims, striking at the very foundations of peaceful democratic society.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

This court is mindful, moreover, of the defendant’s digital footprint, which reveals a progression from ostensibly innocuous internet activity to communications overtly endorsing and facilitating extremist ideology. The blog maintained under the alias 'IronLance' transitioned over time into an incendiary repository of radical literature, including re-postings of materials proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The technological competence displayed permeates not only the hosting of such materials, but also operational security measures employed to shield these communications from casual detection.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The possession and dissemination of manuals concerning explosives manufacture, in encrypted archives discovered on his devices, albeit implicit in the statutory offence charged, raise particularly grave concerns. That such materials were partially incomplete, as established in R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 764, does not detract from culpability. Possessing even fragmentary components of such instructions in the context of active steps to acquire precursor chemicals represents a manifest step beyond mere thematic interest.  

The defendant’s arguments to the contrary, namely that these actions reflected a benign interest in mechanical engineering or pyrotechnics in isolation, lack credibility when viewed in conjunction with the broader context and supporting evidence. The court is compelled to conclude that no innocent explanation withstands scrutiny.  

The forensic recovery of a quantity of cannabis plants within a communal garden shed shared by the defendant’s residence had no bearing on the primary charges. This offense, while regrettably common and dealt with routinely by local police, neither exacerbates nor mitigates the terrorism offences before the court, save perhaps to highlight a complicating set of personal circumstances not otherwise determinative.  

The defendant’s prior offending is sparse and without any history of violence. However, the court acknowledges that absence of prior convictions, whilst a relevant mitigating factor, cannot carry disproportionate weight compared to the seriousness of the current offending. The defendant’s sudden disengagement from stable employment following an internal inquiry into alleged breach of IT policy is noted but does not excuse or diminish the gravity of his subsequent conduct.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The defendant’s travel history attracted scrutiny, notably a journey in May 2024 to Budapest. The visit was officially described as involving attendance at an international machine tooling seminar, though clandestine surveillance revealed meetings with individuals later identified as members of a network trafficking in illicit precursor chemicals used in bomb making. The prosecution invites the court to regard this travel as demonstrative of intent and preparation consistent with the prosecution case.  

Disclosure in this case entailed the scrutiny of over 650 items, encompassing intercepted communications, financial records inclusive of cryptocurrency wallets, and interview transcripts. The process of certification and disclosure involved multi-layered reviews by Home Office Counter Terrorism Disclosure Units, with attention paid to balancing open justice against operational security requirements. The court notes with appreciation the professionalism displayed by all involved despite the well-documented systemic under-resourcing constraints that continue to challenge agencies charged with prosecuting such cases.  

Operational cooperation features prominently, with case management meetings held quarterly under the auspices of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), category 3, with attendance by probation officers, forensic psychiatrists, counter-terrorism policing leads, and community rehabilitation company officials to ensure ongoing risk management strategies are in place during the defendant’s custodial period.  

Recognition is due to the staff at the Avon & Somerset Prevent Hub, who have provided longitudinal reports demonstrating considerable efforts to intervene, notwithstanding limited engagement by the defendant, who repeatedly declined to attend scheduled deradicalisation sessions. Such resistance exemplifies the challenges encountered in managing individuals within the ideologically motivated offending cohort.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The defendant’s attempt to procure ammonium nitrate and other dual-use chemicals via international parcel freight systems from suppliers in Eastern Europe was thwarted following customs interceptions. These actions, detailed in intercepted correspondence, constitute significant preparatory steps consistent with the maximum level of culpability outlined in the Sentencing Council Terrorism Guidelines 2023.  

The court also notes, with a degree of professional curiosity, the somewhat tangential prosecution of a co-defendant in this matter who was separately convicted for committing assault occasioning actual bodily harm during an unrelated incident in Bristol city centre. Such collateral proceedings bear no relevance to Mr H’s culpability but inevitably add procedural complexity to case management.  

Legal argument during the trial phase touched upon issues first explored in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, concerning the interplay between mental illness and criminal responsibility, albeit in a factually distinct context involving serial arson. While that authority provides guidance on psychiatric considerations in sentencing, it is of limited application here, as examination of psychiatric evidence in the present case reveals no formal diagnosis of serious mental disorder capable of diminishing culpability.  

From a mental health perspective, a comprehensive commission was conducted by Dr Edmund Glazer, forensic psychiatrist, who reported no psychosis or personality disorder, but noted evidence of rigid ideological belief systems and a pronounced tendency toward cognitive absolutism. The report concludes that Mr H represents a high risk of future harm without intensive, structured intervention and supervision.  

In the wider social context, the court observes the increasing visibility of street homelessness throughout the urban core of Bristol in recent years, a phenomenon arguably linked to austerity measures and local authority funding cuts. Whilst not directly relevant to the defendant’s offending, this unfortunate social reality provides a backdrop against which radical recruiters often operate, preying on those vulnerable to social exclusion.  

The dislocation of traditional community structures and the normalisation of antisocial behaviour, including graffiti tagging and possession of bladed articles in public parks, has contributed to a challenging environment for law enforcement and social services alike. Such trends indirectly influence radicalisation pathways, though causation should not be simplistically inferred.  

Professional constraints within probation services also merit mention, as recent reports by the Inspectorate of Probation reveal chronic staff shortages and high caseloads, threatening effective supervision. These systemic pressures are particularly acute in terrorism-related cases, where the requirement for multi-disciplinary inputs and inter-agency communication is paramount but often compromised by understaffing.  

Counter-terrorism policing units have borne increased workload due to a rise in social media-driven radicalisation over the past decade, with investigations frequently requiring decryption of encrypted messaging applications employing end-to-end protocols, amplifying both technical and resource challenges.  

The court recognises the efforts of voluntary sector organisations, such as the Bristol Radicalisation Outreach Project, which, despite limited funding and occasional community scepticism, provide critical support frameworks aimed at preventing escalation of extremist ideology. Their submissions to the court commend the defendant’s limited engagement but prudently temper expectations regarding lasting deradicalisation outcomes.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

A detailed forensic audit traced a financial transaction totalling approximately £4,500 in Bitcoin, transferred via multiple mixing services to a vendor advertising chemical precursor kits on the dark web. Blockchain analysis required cross-jurisdictional collaboration among domestic and international law enforcement agencies, exemplifying the increasingly transnational nature of terrorism financing investigations.  

Such technological and operational complexities underscore the challenges confronting law enforcement and judicial bodies in addressing crimes committed or facilitated by emerging technologies. Legislative frameworks struggle to keep pace with rapid innovation, and courts often must rely upon expert witness evidence to elucidate technical matters for judicial determination.  

During the period of Mr H’s custody prior to sentencing, the court notes the absence of major disciplinary infractions, a fact of some relevance but not determinative. The prison regime has reportedly afforded Mr H access to education courses in mechanical engineering principles, although whether these extend an unintended benefit in the realm of technical knowledge relevant to his offending remains unknown.  

It is regrettable that a co-occupant of the defendant’s block of flats was recently convicted for fly-tipping on green belt land, causing localised environmental damage. While unrelated, such occurrences contribute to community tension and complicate housing management efforts.  

At the listing hearing held on 7 August 2025, the court experienced minor delay due to a late arrival of interpreter services arranged for a witness from overseas, highlighting logistical hurdles in managing international evidential material. The courtroom itself, having recently undergone refurbishment of its media and recording systems, provided improved facilities but staff observed a learning curve in adapting to the new technological infrastructure.  

The court expresses particular thanks to Ms Rosie Chambers, prosecuting counsel, and Mr Lionel Gardner, instructed on behalf of the defendant, for their comprehensive and professional submissions. Despite divergences in legal perspective, their advocacy exhibited regard for the solemnity of these proceedings and the importance of upholding due process.  

Victim liaison officers representing the affected communities provided statements reflecting a measured balance of grief, resilience, and determination to see justice served. Their contributions, while not directly impacting sentence, underscore the human dimension often obscured by legal formality.  

Mr H’s own letter to the court was carefully structured, legible, and reflected a thoughtful approach to expression, though its content nevertheless conveyed limited remorse and instead indicated adherence to a radical ideological framework, consistent with psychiatric observation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is 30 years old, educated to degree level in applied mechanical engineering, and formerly employed at a local engineering firm specialising in aerospace components. His character references include one from a former line manager who described him as “intelligent, meticulous, and quiet, though increasingly withdrawn in the months before resignation.” The resignation followed questions arising from unreported internet use during working hours, including visits to extremist networking forums.  

While commendation must be accorded to community groups, such as the Knowle Green Volunteers, who attest to Mr H’s limited but consistent engagement in social gardening projects, the court is mindful that communal goodwill must be weighed against the substantive risks posed by his offending conduct.  

Professor Sarah Langdon, forensic psychologist, authored a detailed assessment report concluding that Mr H exhibits traits consistent with elevated cognitive rigidity and dichotomous thinking. No major personality disorder or psychosis was evident. The risk posed by Mr H was categorised as ‘High’ for the purposes of structured professional judgement tools, with particular emphasis on his resistance to existing disengagement offers and the likelihood of propaganda dissemination post-release absent strict controls.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The court accordingly directs that a full pre-sentence report be prepared as a matter of urgency. This report should address the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, with recommendations concerning rehabilitative interventions, management of radical beliefs, and potential restrictions including electronic monitoring and exclusion zones. Consideration is also invited on the deployment of polygraph examination and the availability of specialist approved premises with expertise in counter-extremism.  

These sentencing remarks are issued today, 14 September 2025, in Court 4 of the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be communicated to the relevant authorities for registration and future management purposes.  

These are the orders of the court.
