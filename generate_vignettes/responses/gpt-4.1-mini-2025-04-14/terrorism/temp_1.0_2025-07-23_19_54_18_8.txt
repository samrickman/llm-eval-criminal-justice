IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/24983  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. S. TEMPLETON  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H stands before this court to be sentenced for offences contrary to sections 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 and section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges pertain to conduct spanning from early 2023 through to the date of his arrest on 15 January 2025. This sentencing hearing follows a voluminous evidentiary trial, extensive pre-trial hearings, and multiple interlocutory applications.  

Mr H was apprehended in the early hours of 15 January 2025 pursuant to arrest warrants executed under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The arrest was conducted by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) acting on intelligence derived largely from long-term covert interception of encrypted communications. At the time, Mr H resided at a refurbished council flat in Hanham, Bristol, a location which was subject to multiple covert searches under judicial authorisation in December 2024.  

This case came before the court amid a growing public unease surrounding the complexities of counter-terrorism policing blended with the ever-evolving digital landscape. Increasingly, courts find themselves grappling with the fine balance between upholding individual rights and safeguarding the community from emerging threats. The legislative framework is buttressed by a body of precedent which, while voluminous, continues to develop in response to technological change and shifting ideological currents.

The path to trial was not free from procedural delays, some attributable to the demands of complex disclosure obligations. The prosecution disclosed over 910 items, including encrypted message logs, device extraction reports, intercepted communications, and covert surveillance records. Defence applications for additional disclosure and further forensic expert opinions occasioned a series of adjournments over the course of 2024. This court observes that such delays, while regrettable, are symptomatic of the inherently intricate nature of terrorism cases in the modern era.  

This court also acknowledges that the Legal Aid Agency’s processes remain a source of operational difficulty. The defence encountered protracted delays in obtaining authority to instruct a second independent forensic digital expert, a specialist crucial to mounting an effective challenge to the voluminous technical evidence. This impediment, arising from the intersection of underfunding and administrative bottlenecks, serves as a reminder that justice is vulnerable to the effects of systemic under-resourcing.  

Prior to his arrest, Mr H had contact with the regional Prevent team, which had initiated a referral in late 2021 following concerns raised by a university tutor regarding his fascination with violent ideological materials encountered during academic study. The Panel met on three occasions over a 14-month period; intervention included psychological screening, voluntary workshops addressing grievance narratives, and referral to community mentoring programmes. The court recognises that such multi-agency efforts are challenging to sustain and that their efficacy is variable.   

In sentencing Mr H, it is germane to recall the judgments of the Court of Appeal that explore the role of mental health considerations in terrorism offending. In R v. Simms [2018] EWCA Crim 2017, the Court emphasised that psychiatric conditions may inform mitigation but cannot displace the fundamental demands of public protection when the risk to community safety is high and enduring. Similarly, in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the interaction between serious mental illness and calculated acts of arson was considered, underscoring the importance of containment alongside treatment. While those cases are factually distinct, their principles merit careful reflection in this sentencing exercise.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The evidence demonstrates a trajectory of ideological development by Mr H, characterized by increasing engagement with extremist manifestos across digital forums. His online presence, analyzed by the National Centre for Counter-Terrorism Research, reflected complex and technical discourse, occasionally invoking encrypted codewords and layered symbolism that escaped straightforward interpretation but were consistent with proscribed material dissemination. This pathological absorption was not isolated; parallel work by the West Englia Digital Forensics Unit recovered deletion logs evidencing deliberate attempts to obfuscate digital footprints.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

A further consideration arises from recovered materials stored on encrypted drives. Among these were draft documents potentially intended to function as instructional manuals for the manufacture of explosive devices. The existence of partial drafts raises nuanced questions of intent and preparation; however, as laid down in R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 911, incomplete documentation does not absolve one of liability when taken in conjunction with corroborative actions. Defence arguments contending a “mere academic interest” lack persuasive force when set against the volume and aggregation of preparatory acts, including travel patterns and resource procurement.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Mr H’s visitation records, obtained through judicially authorised warrant, reveal extensive research-oriented excursions to locations having no obvious legitimate purpose, including restricted industrial compounds where chemicals of dual-use nature were stored. Such movement patterns were dissected in open court and supported the inferences drawn by the Crown concerning intent and planning. Defence submissions sought to portray these visits as innocuous, citing a purported hobby in urban exploration. This court remains unconvinced, not least in light of contextual digital evidence.  

The court would be remiss not to flag the ancillary implications of the defendant’s household environment. Although no connections to counter-terrorism material were found at his mother’s address in Easton, the landlord has submitted correspondence expressing concern over noise and reported incidents of fly-tipping in the communal garden—issues unrelated to the present offences but indicative of social disruption within that locale. Moreover, a review of neighbours’ complaints to the local authority revealed a small number of alleged anti-social behaviours by residents unconnected with Mr H, including a bout of intimidation involving pool cues at a nearby public house. Such factors, while extraneous, sketch the broader context in which these offences took place but bear no direct relevance to culpability or risk assessment in this matter.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The court has given due consideration to an international journey undertaken by Mr H in late 2023. Official immigration and customs records show that he travelled to Brussels ostensibly for a conference on renewable energy technologies but evidence presented indicates a clandestine meeting with an individual later implicated in chemical weapons trafficking. Recorded encrypted communications preceding this trip featured coded language suggestive of logistics arrangements for hostile acts. While the defence contended that the trip was purely academic, the cumulative circumstances point to a calculated engagement with proscribed actors.  

The revelation of a covert operation running for over eighteen months prior to arrest highlights the painstaking work of CTPSW and allied agencies. This included coordination with European counterparts within the European Counter-Terrorism Centre and liaison with cyber-investigators tracking cryptocurrency transactions facilitated through anonymizing protocols. The use of decentralized finance is not novel in terrorism financing, as outlined in the Court of Appeal’s guidance in R v. Donovan [2023] EWCA Crim 1239, which underscores the evolving nature of funding practices and the need for continued vigilance.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial records, pieced together with blockchain analysis tools, uncovered transfers totalling approximately £3,500 in cryptocurrency from wallets associated with Mr H to vendors known for supplying components which have dual civilian and potential explosive applications. Although some had plausible innocuous uses, the volume and frequency of these transactions exceeded typical hobbyist levels and were executed with operational security protocols consistent with criminal behavior. These findings echo the concerns raised in R v. Keleghan [2024] EWCA Crim 1984, in which similar patterns of cryptocurrency use formed a significant aggravating circumstance.  

The court found it necessary to review surveillance footage captured over several nights from fixed and mobile cameras. These recordings depicted Mr H at different hours conducting activities at the Avon embankment which, although appearing mundane, were evaluated through the lens of contextual intelligence to establish pattern and purpose. The time-intensive nature of this technical analysis is not insignificant; the cumulative analyst hours run into hundreds, testifying to the resource-intensive demands of modern law enforcement’s intelligence-gathering apparatus.  

The defendant’s case, and indeed the Crown’s, must be weighed against the ongoing systemic pressures experienced by the probation service. Since 2021, the South West regions have reported chronic staffing shortages owing in part to recruitment challenges and increased caseload complexity—including a marked rise in MAPPA Category 3 cases relating to ideological extremism. This stretched resource environment complicates supervision strategies post-custody and necessitates forward-planning incorporating bespoke risk management and robust multi-agency collaboration.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Regarding the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 30 years old with a background in engineering studies. He completed a degree with upper-second class honours from a metropolitan university and was briefly employed in a technical receptionist role prior to his resignation in mid-2023. References submitted describe him as “quiet, scholarly, and dependable,” though some note signs of social seclusion which may have deepened as his ideological preoccupation grew. Letters of support from the East Bristol Community Development Trust highlight his sporadic volunteer participation in environmental clean-up initiatives, though attendance waned after 2022.  

Professionally, it is noted that Mr H’s prior employer initiated an internal inquiry following his inappropriate use of workplace computers to access extremist forums during working hours. This disciplinary proceeding precipitated his departure and coincided with a notable escalation in his online engagement with radical content. The court recognises that previous stable employment is a mitigating factor, yet it does not offset the serious breach of law herein.  

While community engagement is ordinarily a positive aspect of character assessment, as Lord Burnett CJ noted in R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928, commendable daytime deeds do not compensate for clandestine acts planned in the shadows. The court is cognisant of the dichotomy presented here and finds that paradox instructive rather than exculpatory.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The psychiatric report prepared by Dr Maira Falkenberg, forensic psychiatrist, provides a comprehensive assessment. She observes that Mr H displays “marked cognitive rigidity” with a tendency towards dichotomous thinking and moral absolutism, hallmarks commonly associated with extremist cognitive radicalisation trajectories. There is no evidence of major mental illness, yet the psychological profile identifies a high risk of serious harm in the absence of sustained supervision and intervention. The prognosis is guarded, contingent upon engagement in structured deradicalisation and cognitive behavioural programmes. Defence submissions emphasised these factors in mitigation, advocating for community-based frameworks post-sentence. The court notes the limited success rates tied to such interventions, particularly if commenced only after lengthy custodial sentences.  

The principles embedded in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines (2023) require a proportional response calibrated to culpability, harm potential, and public protection. The aggravated features of this case include deliberate concealment, use of advanced digital encryptions to mask intent, procurement of dual-use materials, and planning timed to coincide with an anniversary of a previous attack—a fact underscoring symbolic significance and planning sophistication.  

Mitigation is constrained to the absence of prior convictions, some positive community engagement, and the defendant’s eventual guilty pleas entered relatively late in proceedings. As this court has previously remarked, the timing of pleas remains central to the assessment of credit, as articulated in R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440 and R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029.  

The court respectfully recognises the efforts of organisations such as the Avon Radicalisation Prevention Scheme and the Bristol Mental Health Outreach Team, who have engaged with Mr H during remand. Their joint reports speak to his intermittent engagement and the challenges posed by entrenched ideological convictions, despite repeated outreach attempts. These professional efforts underscore the importance—and inherent difficulty—of sustained multi-agency management in terrorism-related cases.  

In fashioning an appropriate sentence, the court directs the compilation of a detailed pre-sentence report by the Bristol Probation Service. This report should address suitability for custodial and community sentence options, the feasibility of imposing extended conditions under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, including licence restrictions, exclusion zones, and electronic monitoring, as well as the availability of structured psychological interventions. The report should also evaluate accommodation stability and post-release supervision frameworks given the geographic dispersal and community resilience factors identified.  

These sentencing remarks are delivered on 18 September 2025 at Bristol Crown Court. The hearing has been conducted in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5, and the official transcript has been duly recorded and archived. Counsel appearing today for the prosecution was Ms Celia Mardon, whose submissions were clear and thorough. Representing the defendant was Mr Alex Gerard QC, instructed under a Legal Aid order. The court notes with regret the administrative delays in securing Legal Aid authority for additional forensic expertise, reflecting systemic issues of resource allocation affecting defence capacity in complex terrorism trials.  

The public is reminded that any application for reporting restrictions under section 4 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 or section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 is not engaged in this matter. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal conviction and sentence within 28 days, pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. Costs are hereby reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
