IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/34692  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Felicity J. BRAMPTON  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct under consideration took place between May 2023 and his apprehension on 12 January 2025.  

Mr H was arrested at approximately 07:45 hours on Sunday, 12 January 2025, at his residential address in Bedminster, Bristol. That arrest was effected pursuant to a warrant executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West, operating under the auspices of the Prevent and Pursue strands of the CONTEST strategy. The warrant was issued on the strength of intelligence derived from an extensive covert surveillance operation, as well as intercept material authorised by the Secretary of State pursuant to sections 15 and 16 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The defendant was found in possession of various digital devices, including an encrypted mobile telephone, a tablet computer, and several encrypted storage drives.

This arrest brought to a close a sustained and high-priority multi-agency investigation involving CTPSW, Security Service analysts, and forensic cybersecurity teams. Special mention must be made of the specialist cryptography section of the National Crime Agency, whose painstaking recovery efforts on Mr H’s devices spanned over eight months and required a blend of innovative protocol breach techniques and collaborative international intelligence sharing. Of note, the delay in decrypting Mr H’s secure communications correlated with the emergence of novel encryption tools released as open-source software by entities operating overseas, outside any recognised state control framework.  

The defendant was initially remanded in custody pending further investigation. Procedural timetabling was complicated by a series of factors, including a mid-2025 industrial dispute affecting court clerks and registry staff, which had repercussions across the Crown Court network in the South West. Furthermore, the Legal Aid Agency’s repeated requests for additional documentation delayed the defendant's access to independent expert advice, most notably impeding timely instruction of cyber forensic and psychological consultancy. Matters were further complicated by the interdepartmental liaison required to adjudicate the extent of closed-material procedures permissible under the Justice and Security Act 2013 to preserve national security interests while respecting open justice.  

At the plea and case management hearing held on 3 July 2025, lengthy legal argument ensued concerning the admissibility of intercept evidence. Defence teams argued for exclusion on grounds of procedural irregularity. Notwithstanding, the court upheld the Crown's position, referencing the decision in R v. Anwar [2017] EWCA Crim 1506, which held that where statutory safeguards are strictly observed, such intercepts are admissible to establish intent and proximity in terrorism offences.  

It bears noting the delay in resolution of the evidential dispute contributed to the matter’s adjournment until 11 August for trial. Encouragingly, the proactive listing of the trial reflected the court’s ongoing efforts to maintain an efficient docket in the face of the increasing volume of complex terrorism prosecutions arising nationwide, particularly following enhancements introduced by the new BCM procedures endorsed by the Lord Chief Justice in 2022.  

The court acknowledges the routine and steady work of the West of England Prevent Hub, which engaged with the defendant intermittently from October 2021. Their detailed reports chronicle a complex and troubled outreach comprising multiple engagement offers, including ideological mentoring, vocational training referral, and cognitive behavioural support targeted at grievance-fixation and social alienation. Despite these interventions, engagement was inconsistent. The Hub’s written submissions to this court provide valuable insight into Mr H’s fluctuating motivation and partial withdrawal from offered assistance. Notably, the Hub emphasised the importance of sustained multi-agency management post-release, highlighting the challenges faced when contact with individuals is sporadic.

The Crown relies heavily upon the digital forensics report prepared by Ms Alice Harwood of the National Digital Exploitation Service. Her report, supplied on 22 April 2025, meticulously catalogues encrypted archives, including detailed step-by-step guides on improvised explosive devices, as well as correspondence with known supporters of proscribed groups. Of particular concern are files named with innocuous titles such as “RevisedPlans” and “Logistics-Alpha,” identified through codeword analysis as referencing potentially lethal devices and operational arrangements. Although some files were incomplete or partially corrupted, the court considers the totality of the material sufficient to establish preparatory acts consistent with intent to facilitate terrorism.  

The court remarks, in passing, on the incongruity of certain ancillary recovered files. Among them were several mp3 audio tracks from the late 1980s, including fan remixes of synth-pop classics, and numerous digital photographs cataloguing European urban graffiti. These items, while interesting cultural artefacts, neither mitigate nor aggravate the sentencing calculus, serving rather as an archival snapshot of the defendant's eclectic personal tastes. The court notes the defence’s reference to this trove as evidence of “non-ideological curiosity,” but declines to be distracted from the gravamen of offending behaviour by ancillary cultural pursuits.  

Several letters were received and read with attention from voluntary agencies working in the resettlement and social inclusion sector, in particular the Bristol Literacy Network and the Harbourside Community Trust. Correspondence from both organisations attests to Mr H’s sporadic involvement in community literacy classes and informal peer support groups designed to engage vulnerable adults with histories of social exclusion and trauma. Neither organisation claims responsibility for any ideological transformation but emphasises a commitment to holistic support for individuals transitioning from custody to society. The court notes, however, that these groups are under considerable pressure, operating with limited funding and high participant churn, which constrains their capacity to undertake specialist counter-radicalisation work.  

It is unfortunate but inevitable in the current climate that the court must comment on the increasing prevalence of non-crime related demand on policing and judicial resources. The rise in street-level antisocial behaviour, including unauthorised encampments, bicycle theft, and public intoxication, has further stretched counter-terrorism units who must prioritise threats of serious harm. While these matters are not here germane, their presence in court annals serves as a reminder of the complex ecosystem in which public protection is pursued.

The Crown relies further on electronic evidence recovered from cloud storage accounts accessible via a VPN associated with the defendant. The recovered documents indicate a structured effort to obtain materials with dual-use characteristics, with clear potential applications for harmful devices. The Supreme Court in R v. Keshavarz [2021] UKSC 45 established the principle that possession of such materials, even absent direct harm, warrants severe penal sanction when coupled with manifest preparation and intent. This line of authority informs the court’s approach to the present case.  

A further complexity arises in the intersection of mental health and risk assessment. The defendant underwent psychiatric evaluation over a four-week period in late June and early July 2025, conducted at the Bristol Forensic Mental Health Unit. The report, prepared by Dr Fiona Mallard, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, is detailed and professionally composed. It diagnoses no major mental disorder but highlights persistent traits of cognitive inflexibility and an entrenched ideological worldview resistant to alternative narratives. Dr Mallard’s assessment concludes that Mr H poses a high risk of serious harm, particularly absent intensive treatment, and that risk may well persist into the community without robust management frameworks.

The court has reviewed the defence’s submissions referencing R v. Griffin [2018] EWCA Crim 1234, wherein a defendant with similar ideological fixations successfully argued for a community-based disposal supported by intensive psychological supervision. The court is mindful that Griffin’s offending was of a markedly different scale and lacked the demonstrable acquisition of dangerous materials apparent here. In any event, the principles of deterrence and public protection must prevail.  

Reference was made during argument to a series of unrelated offences purportedly committed by a co-defendant in an ancillary matter, including charges of burglary of a residential dwelling during a period of temporary absence, historic fly-tipping on protected greenbelt land, and multiple counts of criminal damage involving graffiti on public transport infrastructure. While these charges received attention during sentencing submissions, the court is clear that none bear upon the culpability or risk posed by Mr H and accordingly declines to factor them into its assessment.  

The court recognises the ongoing difficulties faced by all parties in discharging the administrative burden attendant upon cases of this nature. Multi-agency collaboration—encompassing constabulary resources, NHS forensic teams, the National Probation Service, and local authority safeguarding panels—requires constant liaison and information exchange. This is made more challenging by staff shortages, competing priorities, and secure information governance protocols that impede seamless communication. Nonetheless, these agencies have worked collaboratively with commendable perseverance in this instance.

The defendant’s digital footprint also reveals travel to locations overseas, ostensibly for tourism or study purposes. Records show multiple short-stay visits to Istanbul and Beirut during the summer of 2024. Cross-referenced security assessments flagged these cities as locations with known extremist cell activity. While defence counsel contends these trips were purely cultural and charitable in nature, the prosecution relies upon evidence including encrypted messaging intercepts indicating contact with individuals subsequently arrested abroad on terror-related offences. The complex nature of international travel and the variability of state responses make such evidence inherently challenging and require careful judicial scrutiny.  

Contemporary criminal justice faces the additional challenge of confronting rapidly developing modes of communication and finance, particularly the rise of cryptocurrencies
