IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/19364  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. M. STRATHMORE  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence having been convicted following a trial of offences contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and an offence under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The conduct charged against the defendant relates to a period commencing in September 2022 and culminating in his arrest on 15 March 2025.  

The defendant was remanded in custody following his arrest by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West. The initial warrants authorising the search and seizure of property at the defendant’s residence in Filton, Bristol, were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 after intelligence led the Security Service to conclude that encrypted communications linked to the defendant’s known handles had shown a pattern of detailed operational exchanges with an overseas extremist entity. At the police station, Mr H was found in possession of digital devices including two mobile phones, an encrypted external drive, and assorted fittings consistent with home manufacture of firearms components.  

The investigation that led to the arrest was protracted and involved multiple agencies working in tandem, including the Regional Organised Crime Unit and digital forensic teams from the Company Computing Crime Unit (CCCU). The forensic examination of encrypted materials proved to be especially challenging, requiring the intervention of the National Cyber Crime Unit, whose workload at the time included a substantial backlog of devices awaiting analysis. The painstaking decryption effort demanded considerable resource allocation and the application of bespoke software tools developed under classified security protocols. The coordination of such multi-agency operations, undertaken in the shadow of growing concerns about domestic radicalisation, further underscores the complexity and cost borne by the public purse.  

It is important, at the outset, to acknowledge the ongoing pressures on frontline policing and justice services. The increased incidence of so-called “low-level disorder” incidents in urban centres, whether in the form of public nuisance, minor assaults, or retail theft, continues unabated. A report by the Home Office on urban policing capacity published earlier this year noted a worrying trend in the cumulative effect of these crimes on the availability of officers to engage in pro-active counter-terrorism operations. This court is conscious that such pressures form the broader context within which the present prosecution took place.  

The case has, regrettably, experienced a number of procedural delays largely attributable to the complexity of disclosure and the dual necessity to balance open justice with legitimate national security concerns. The defendants’ legal team required extensions granted by the court to properly review and instruct on voluminous digital exhibits, many of which contain material sensitive to intelligence sources and methods. The difficulties inherent in securing adequate Legal Aid funding for expert digital forensics, a matter that has been the subject of correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency, are well-documented and regrettable. It is notable that, despite repeated representations, defence counsel's application for additional specialist hours was met with protracted delay, a matter which this court formally records with concern.  

It should also be recorded that prior Prevent referrals were made concerning Mr H, dated 2019 and 2021 respectively. The first arose from disclosures by a university tutor who observed submissions with philosophical articulations regarding conflict and martyrdom that were described as concerning. Notwithstanding initial engagement, the intervention concluded prematurely after disengagement. The 2021 referral, prompted by community outreach workers noting a pattern of withdrawal and the purchase of suspicious materials online, similarly resulted in the cessation of formal contact. The court notes that early intervention programmes such as Prevent sometimes struggle to effect change, but they form a vital part of the broader public safety architecture.  

A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 4 August 2025. On that occasion, the defendant maintained his pleas of not guilty. He was duly tried over a period of twelve days in the Crown Court at Bristol commencing 7 September. The jury returned unanimous verdicts on all counts on 25 September. Sentencing has today been listed to allow full submissions on mitigation, assessment of risk, and the gravity of the offences.  

I must stress at this juncture the court's experience with the increasingly common phenomenon whereby defendants elect to enter guilty pleas at a late stage in proceedings. The procedural economy that is otherwise the hallmark of early admissions is all too frequently undermined by tactics designed to maximise evidential advantage rather than demonstrate genuine remorse. The Court of Appeal in R v. Cabot [2024] EWCA Crim 1592 cautioned that a plea entered only after trial preparation, extensive disclosure and witness mobilisation is unlikely to attract more than minimal credit. The present facts conform in important respects to that pattern.  

Drawing upon the case law which continues to illuminate the contours of sentencing in terrorism cases, mention may be made of R v. Daoud [2022] EWCA Crim 1208, where the court considered the appropriate parameters around culpability thresholds and the gradations of harm anticipatable by preparatory conduct. The principles set out therein emphasise that culpability is heightened not only by proximity to attack but also by technical sophistication and engagement with improvised weapon manufacture. Yet another relevant authority is R v. Spillane [2023] EWCA Crim 2044, which clarified the necessity of linking possession of articles to demonstrable intent when applying section 57 of the 2000 Act.

Turning to the scope and scale of the defendant’s actions, it must be noted that the expert evidence adduced at trial laid bare a concerted effort to acquire materials demonstrably capable of being adapted to explosive use, coupled with detailed plans to assemble devices with the potential for mass lethality. The defendant’s proficiency with electrical engineering principles, as acknowledged in professional references, facilitated this complex undertaking.  

The fact that the defendant’s digital footprint includes encrypted channels linked to foreign entities proscribed for terrorist activity compounds the clear danger posed. It is appropriate at this juncture to reiterate that the dissemination and active pursuit of such material is, under law, inherently grave given its implications.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

I have perused the extensive and carefully prepared reports from the South West Prevent Coordination Unit. Their detailing of the defendant’s sporadic engagement with de-radicalisation initiatives and the limited success of mentoring sessions offers a sobering insight into the challenges faced by such programmes. Clearly, the defendant’s fluctuating cooperation impeded meaningful progress.
