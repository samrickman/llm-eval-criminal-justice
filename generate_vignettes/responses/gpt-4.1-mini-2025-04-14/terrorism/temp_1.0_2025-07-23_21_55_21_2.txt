IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/27844  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge V. J. FLETCHER  
Filed: 8 October 2025  

Mr H stands before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges relate to activity believed to have been undertaken between September 2023 and his arrest in April 2025.  

The defendant was arrested on the morning of 15 April 2025. This arrest was the culmination of a wide-ranging investigation spearheaded by the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, supported by the National Cyber Crime Unit, and various intelligence agencies. The authorisation for the search and seizure was obtained under provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000, specifically section 43B, permitting the execution of warrants on premises suspected of harbouring material related to terrorism. At his home were recovered multiple electronic devices, including encrypted smartphones, data storage units, and components consistent with technical assembly work.

It is of note that this case proceeded under the auspices of the Better Case Management scheme recently introduced in this jurisdiction, intended to streamline preparation and ensure timely progression. Despite the complexity of the materials involved, including lengthy forensic digital analysis and the requisite vetting of sensitive material for disclosure, this case was marshalled from the point of charge through various hearings with admirable adherence to indicative timelines. Of course, such expediency must not come at the expense of fairness or thoroughness; in this instance, it has been a balancing act achieved by committed practitioners on all sides, including the defence team. Mr H was legally represented throughout by Mr Benjamin Clark QC, who appeared under a Legal Aid representation granted after administrative delay.  

As a point of procedural history, it must be recorded that the defence’s application for an independent psychiatric expert was initially delayed by uncertainty within the Legal Aid Agency. Such delay is lamentably common in modern litigation; notwithstanding, Mr Clark persevered in securing approval in time to instruct a leading forensic consultant. The report generated by Dr Sarah Lincombe, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was detailed and professionally composed, yet ultimately did not alter the trajectory of these proceedings materially. The court expresses its gratitude to Dr Lincombe for her timely cooperation under challenging workload conditions, as the NHS forensic services continue to confront significant staffing shortages and a growing case burden.  

It is also appropriate on this occasion to observe the pressures facing the probation service in delivering effective multi-agency risk management under MAPPA Category 3 supervision. The defendant was briefly managed in the community following his initial release on bail, with close monitoring, yet resources remain visibly strained, impacting the capacity to offer consistent intervention. Probation officers continue to report excessive caseloads, administrative burdens, and frequent turnover—factors not conducive to building the rapport and engagement conducive to risk reduction.  

Reflecting momentarily on the broader context, the court is aware that terrorism investigations, inevitably, divert significant operational capacity from other public protection functions such as investigations into organised crime and serious violent offences. Recent statistics published by the Home Office indicate that cyber-enabled crimes have increased by 27% over the past 18 months, stretching the abilities of digital forensic teams, who are often redeployed as priorities shift. The intricate nature of modern terrorism cases compounds this, requiring careful integration of intelligence, technical analysis, and human assets. The fact that Mr H’s case was managed within these strained parameters speaks to the dedication of the professionals involved.  

It is further necessary to acknowledge the role of voluntary sector groups who advised on early intervention efforts regarding Mr H. In 2021, a referral was made by a college lecturer to a Prevent-based outreach programme following concerns about his social media postings. That effort, coordinated through the Midland Community Engagement Hub, offered cognitive behavioural therapy and mentorship lasting six months. The court recognises the difficulties in sustaining such interventions and the frustration expressed by outreach workers at intermittent participation. While these efforts did not forestall the subsequent offending, they represent the essential, if imperfect, first-line pre-emptive strategy.

Proceeding to the evidential matrix, the Crown rely extensively on forensic examination of encrypted communications and recovered files. The digital material includes partially redacted chat histories, video recordings demonstrating practical experiments, and documentation reflecting intent and technical know-how. Defence counsel have argued at length regarding potential innocent explanations, including assertions that certain files related to lawful scientific inquiry and hobbyist electronics. The court has examined these arguments with care but finds them unconvincing in the face of the totality of evidence indicating clear preparatory activity with a view to terrorist ends.  

The defendant’s online persona, operating under the alias “BlackSpike,” maintained activity across multiple platforms—some ephemeral and encrypted, others more public-facing—collectively evincing a progression from casual political commentary toward advocacy of violent action. Linguistic experts called by the prosecution noted similarities to propaganda disseminated by proscribed organisations relating to incitement and operational planning.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The volume of material and its encrypted nature necessitated complex forensic interventions. Notably, referenced in the defence’s case were the limitations of such analysis, including partial data corruption and the challenges in attributing intent based solely on digital footprints. Nevertheless, expert witnesses provided clear explanations distinguishing incidental possession of information from purposeful preparation of actionable plans. The forensic chain of custody, maintained meticulously throughout, precludes any assertion of tampering or misattribution.  

Of procedural note, the case was twice adjourned due to issues surrounding disclosure and the gathering of expert reports, reflecting the complexity inherent in counter-terrorism prosecutions. The court acknowledges the cooperation of all involved in managing these demands. The court is also mindful of the jurisprudential developments relating to evidential thresholds in terrorism cases, including the principles articulated in R v Torre [2019] EWCA Crim 1296, which emphasise not merely possession but the intent behind access to prohibited material.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

At the time of arrest, among the recovered articles was a partially assembled device, details of which are subject to official secrecy orders but which are understood to have no precedent in legitimate hobbyist manufacturing. While the defence contends this may be the result of experimental engineering curiosity, the court does not accept such an explanation given the convergence of other evidence.  

In relation to peripheral matters, it should be noted that a small sum of cannabis resin was found at the defendant’s address—managed by a separate authority and not forming part of the terrorism-related offences. Mention is made only to illustrate the broad parameters of the investigation, not to detract from the gravity of the primary charges. Equally, there is no evidence to suggest that these substances intersected materially with the conduct under scrutiny here beyond their incidental presence.  

In an unrelated matter but worthy of record, the defendant’s former roommate, during a police search unconnected with this enquiry, was found in possession of a small quantity of cannabis. The roommate is not a party to these proceedings and these findings have no relevance to Mr H’s culpability.  

The defendant’s social circumstances include being estranged from his parents for several years; correspondence from his sister was tendered by the defence, expressing concern for his welfare but containing no explicit acknowledgement of wrongdoing. Letters from a local allotment society praising his horticultural work were also submitted. While these details illustrate dimensions of the defendant’s character, they do not diminish the seriousness of offences committed. Ongoing support from the community remains essential for successful rehabilitation but is subordinate when considering custodial penalty.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The Crown case further emphasises the defendant’s travel to various European cities in 2024, ostensibly for cultural tourism. However, movement data places him near known extremist gatherings—meetings from which co-defendants have been convicted of related conspiracy offences. The defence suggested coincidence; the court is satisfied, having reviewed closed-circuit television footage and telecom traffic data, that these were deliberate but covert attempts to associate with like-minded individuals.  

Moreover, travel records indicate a journey to a border town known for cross-channel drug trafficking; the defence disclaims any connection, citing cancelled onward travel and absence of direct engagement with known criminals. The court, however, notes the coincidence with extensive chat logs referencing covert logistics arrangements.  

Surveillance operations preceding the arrest consumed considerable resources. The necessity of prolonged electronic monitoring, including geolocation and audio interception authorised by judicial warrant, reflects both the sophistication and perceived threat posed by the defendant’s conduct. The operational burden on law enforcement agencies is substantial and noteworthy, contributing to an ongoing strain on the allocation of public safety assets.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial tracing uncovered cryptocurrency transactions linking the defendant to darknet marketplaces specialising in dual-use technology. Notwithstanding the fungibility of such assets, and the defence’s submissions on the legitimate uses of emergent financial instruments, the timing and routing of transfers coincide with the procurement of specific electronic components used in the partial device assembly. This pattern reinforces the prosecution’s contention that the defendant sought to circumvent traditional financial scrutiny to acquire prohibited items.  

The court acknowledges the burgeoning impact of cryptocurrency in criminal finance. This calls for sustained legislative and enforcement attention, given the ease with which such transactions can obscure provenance and end users, thereby complicating risk assessment. Regulators and enforcement agencies alike face significant challenges in adapting to this rapidly evolving landscape.  

The prosecution introduced evidence of covertly recorded conversations in public spaces, the admissibility of which was contested by the defence on grounds of privacy and entrapment. The court ruled admissible the recordings, noting their clear provenance and lawful acquisition. Content analysis revealed detailed planning discussions concerning location, timing, and potential collateral impact of intended actions.

Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old and holds a master’s degree in electrical engineering. His employer prior to the alleged offending period was a medium-sized electronics firm specialising in communications equipment. Testimony from his line manager describes him as “reliable and highly skilled,” though increasingly withdrawn over the course of 2023. Resignation followed a dispute regarding security clearance forms, which the defendant refused to complete citing privacy concerns.  

The defence provided letters from community organisations including the Birmingham Urban Gardeners Association, praising his voluntary contributions. These are sincere acknowledgements of positive engagement but must be balanced against the fundamental breach of trust his offending entails. Recent reports from the local council cite an ongoing problem with antisocial behaviour in the area, although the defendant is not implicated in these disturbances.  

The court also notes that the defendant resides in accommodation managed by a housing association. The landlord has previously been subjected to noise abatement notices unrelated to Mr H but alleges that the presence of multiple law-enforcement visits has caused disturbance to neighbours. While sympathetic to community disruption, the court's focus remains squarely on the criminal conduct.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The report commissioned from Professor Derek M. Langford, forensic psychologist, concludes that the defendant exhibits rigid cognitive styles and a tendency to absolutist reasoning, but no diagnosable disorder. The high risk of serious harm is underlined, with recommendations for intensive intervention if release is contemplated. Defence submissions highlight the potential benefits of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, although the court is mindful of the mixed outcomes observed in such initiatives.  

It should be emphasised that while opportunities for rehabilitation exist, the paramount objective remains protection of the public. Sentencing must balance deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation, and public safety. Mitigating features include Mr H’s lack of previous convictions, educational attainment, and some belated cooperation manifested through a guilty plea entered late in proceedings.  

The Crown court remains bound by statute and guideline in considering sentences available under the Terrorism Act. The maximum penalty for the section
