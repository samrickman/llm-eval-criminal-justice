IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/24892  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. M. STRATHMORE  
Filed: 17 October 2025

Mr H stands before this court today convicted on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct, according to the evidence presented, spanned a period from late 2022 until the defendant's arrest in February 2025.

The procedural history of this matter is indicative of the complexities inherent in cases involving terrorism-related allegations. Initially arrested at 04:45 hours on 12 February 2025, Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) executed a series of simultaneous search warrants authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at the defendant’s residence in Easton. The warrants followed intelligence drawn from intercepted encrypted communications, which demonstrated unusual patterns of data transfer to servers commonly associated with extremist propaganda dissemination and operational planning.

The arrest itself was the culmination of a multi-agency investigative endeavour, involving CTPSW, the National Crime Agency’s Cyber Crime Unit, and the Security Service. Forensic digital investigations were markedly challenging due to the defendant’s sophisticated use of layered encryption protocols, anonymising VPN networks, and the deployment of ephemeral storage devices purged regularly. It is of note that the National Digital Forensics Capability (NDFC) was operating at reduced capacity owing to concurrent resource demands linked to countering increased cyber-enabled fraud across the jurisdiction.

The court begins by acknowledging the considerable operational strain placed upon law enforcement and intelligence agencies dealing with such cases. The investigative timeline covers over eighteen months, during which time several interim reviews were necessary to authorise further intrusive surveillance measures. This required judicial oversight and rigorous evidential justification, as mandated by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and subsequent statutory amendments.

The initial bail application was refused on grounds of risk, resulting in the defendant's remand to custody. Subsequent applications to vary conditions, including requests for curfew and electronic monitoring, were declined due to assessed flight and public protection risks. It is regrettable that similarly complex cases often result in protracted periods of pre-trial detention, yet the court recognises this sometimes unavoidable consequence given the nature of the offending and the broader societal implications.

A Prevent referral was made regarding Mr H in August 2020 by an educational welfare officer following concerns about increasingly radicalised expressions manifested in classroom writing assignments. The referral was assessed by the regional Channel panel in September 2020, but no further action was taken after an initial risk assessment scored as low likelihood of progression. A gentle monitoring approach was maintained by local Prevent coordinators, though no substantial engagement ensued as the defendant declined offered interventions. The court notes such early-stage interventions, while valuable in principle, often wrestle with the limits of individual consent and the imperative of proportionality.

In accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5, a plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 3 September 2025. Mr H initially pleaded not guilty, intending to contest the charges. On the morning of the trial, which commenced on 13 October 2025, he indicated a change of plea to guilty on all counts. This eleventh-hour admittance naturally impacts on sentencing credit, as the court has repeatedly affirmed in cases such as R v. Mortimer [2021] EWCA Crim 526 and R v. Glenford [2023] EWCA Crim 1103. Early guilty pleas reduce victim trauma, conserve public resources, and demonstrate early acceptance of responsibility — attributes absent in pleas entered at a late stage.

The court has given attention to the historical evolution of the statutory provisions under which the defendant is convicted. The Terrorism Act 2006, enacted amidst heightened concerns over transnational terrorism, brought a new framework for pre-emptive interventions aimed at disrupting plots prior to execution. Section 5 was intended to criminalise preparatory acts, overcoming evidential challenges that previously hampered prosecution of those engaged in the early stages of terror planning.

Judicial interpretations of section 5 have been shaped by appellate decisions such as R v. Bassam [2013] EWCA Crim 456 where the Court of Appeal elucidated the requisite threshold of intent and materiality of preparatory acts. The present situation falls squarely within this rubric, given the evidence of the defendant’s active engagement in communications, acquisition of dual-use materials, and attempts to conceal his activities.

Reference must be made to the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Guidelines on Terrorism Offences, which instruct courts to consider culpability by assessing the sophistication of the plot, the defendant’s role, and the imminence of the threat, balanced against mitigating factors such as remorse and co-operation. In the present case, it can be credibly inferred from the chronological sequence and technical complexity of the defendant’s conduct that culpability falls within the higher spectrum envisaged. The court is bound to express concern at the evident intention to cause significant harm, notwithstanding the absence of actual casualties.

Throughout the investigation, digital forensic analysis recovered encrypted chat transcripts demonstrating ideological commitment to proscribed organisations, as well as exchanges of explicit discussions concerning bomb-making and target reconnaissance. The defendant’s use of several pseudonyms and deleted messaging accounts underscores the deliberate efforts undertaken to evade detection.

One peculiar but ultimately immaterial artefact discovered was an extensive digital archive of vintage vinyl record playlists structured by year and genre. Though unconnected to the offending conduct, it elucidates how extremist digital footprints can often intersect with wholly benign user profiles — a challenge keenly felt by cyber analysts seeking to differentiate signal from noise in vast repositories of data. It is a salient reminder that possession of particular media or hobbies in isolation cannot form the basis for suspicion nor for mitigation.

The court observes, in passing, that a co-defendant involved in a related matter before the same court was arraigned on charges of possession of bladed articles in a public place, though no such charge arose against Mr H. This demonstrates the diversity of offences that can be linked by association but which must be carefully disentangled when determining individual culpability.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

The defendant’s assertion before this court that some of the materials found may have been inadvertently downloaded during online research into “model engineering” was examined carefully. The prosecution presented compelling challenge to this claim, supported by metadata showing repeated review and modification of files relating to explosives rather than benign hobbies.

It is worth recording that the defendant’s accommodation is managed by a housing association subject to recent noise abatement procedures due to complaints from neighbours. While unrelated to these charges, such background information often finds its way into pre-sentence reports to provide fuller context on the social environment of defendants. It highlights the multifactorial challenges facing agencies tasked with housing, welfare, and risk management.

The court also notes that during the period preceding his arrest, Mr H had been repeatedly detected for fare evasion on the Bristol MetroBus system, most recently in December 2024. These infractions, though trivial and not directly connected to terrorism, nevertheless contribute to an overall picture of disregard for legal norms.

The prosecution’s case was buttressed by witness evidence from CTPSW officers, including Detective Sergeant Fiona Ripley, whose testimony detailed the painstaking processes of connecting disparate data sources — CCTV, mobile cell-site location, and intercepted communications — to build a cohesive narrative of the defendant’s preparatory activities. The court commends the professionalism and dedication of those involved, who operate under sustained operational and public scrutiny.

The defence, through Mr Duncan Blythe, counsel instructed under Legal Aid, submitted a series of mitigation points. Mr Blythe argued for recognition of Mr H’s previously unblemished character and steady employment history. Additionally, counsel drew attention to letters from neighbours attesting to Mr H’s courteous demeanour and voluntarism in local community litter-picking schemes, attempting to paint a holistic picture of the defendant’s personality beyond his offending acts.

It is relevant that the defendant undertook an international trip to Poland in early 2024 purportedly for architectural tourism. Flight and travel records were examined and cross-referenced against data showing Mr H attending a fringe conference on geopolitics. Surveillance indicated intermittent contact with individuals later identified as members of extremist networks. The court recognises the difficulty of parsing lawful travel from impermissible conduct but notes that the titres of conversations and digital records undermined the claimed innocence of these movements.

Discussion is also merited regarding the extensive demands placed on the court’s disclosure processes in cases such as this. The volume of material generated has increased exponentially with advances in mobile and cloud technology. A recent procedural review found that average disclosure in terrorism prosecutions now exceeds 500,000 pages, often heavily redacted due to security concerns. This produces delays and logistical challenges that affect all parties. The present case was subject to a number of adjournments necessitated in part by the Legal Aid Agency’s procedural requirements to approve expert witnesses and establish funding for digital forensic specialists instructed by the defence.

The financial trails uncovered in the investigation highlighted numerous cryptocurrency transactions designed to obfuscate the origins and destinations of funds. One payment of 0.57 Bitcoin, equivalent to approximately £15,400 at the time, was routed through multiple mixers and then to vendors supplying dual-use chemical precursors. The court reflects with concern on the growing role of cryptocurrencies in facilitating clandestine transactions related to terrorism and organised crime, a modern challenge confronting law enforcement.

The court also considers the detailed forensic accounting provided to the prosecution by Mr Alan Marks, an expert in blockchain analysis, whose report was admitted under Rule 15 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. His findings elucidated how anonymity-enhancing techniques complicate investigations and underscore the necessity for ongoing cross-jurisdictional cooperation.

While the defendant maintained partial engagement with counter-radicalisation programmes prior to arrest, reports from the Bristol Prevent Hub indicate sporadic attendance and a lack of meaningful ideological shift. This intermittent participation highlights the limitations of current deradicalisation schemes and the vital importance of intensive and sustained interventions, particularly in cases exhibiting entrenched belief systems.

A review of surveillance footage showed Mr H visiting a riverside park late at night on multiple occasions between August and November 2024. CTPSW analysts devoted considerable resources — estimated at over 120 man-hours — to cross-referencing environmental sensors, timestamps, and signal triangulation to ascertain the purpose of these visits. The expenditure of effort relative to the limited duration of each event illustrates the asymmetrical nature of modern intelligence work.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Regarding personal background, Mr H is 31 years of age. He holds a degree in materials science awarded by a regional polytechnic institution. Former employers describe him as reliable but somewhat withdrawn, with a penchant for precision work. His sudden departure from a position at a manufacturing firm in mid-2023 followed an internal inquiry prompted by evidence of unauthorised computer access to extremist websites. Although no formal disciplinary action was pursued, the incident marked a turning point in his social and professional trajectory.

Defence submissions included character references from a university alumni group, citing his involvement in mentoring apprentices and participating in charitable fundraisers. While commendable, the court acknowledges, these contributions represent facets of the defendant that exist incongruously with his convictions.

The comprehensive report prepared by Dr Fiona Albright, consultant forensic psychologist, forms a critical part of this court’s consideration. Dr Albright notes that Mr H exhibits marked tendencies towards black-and-white thinking and cognitive rigidity, characteristics often observed in those susceptible to radicalisation. Notwithstanding, there is no diagnosed psychotic or personality disorder. Dr Albright’s professional opinion warns of a continued risk of ideological entrenchment in the absence of rigorous and long-term supervision.

It is the responsibility of this court—balancing justice, harm prevention, and rehabilitation—to calibrate a sentence that reflects the gravity of the offence, protects the public, and provides an opportunity for correction. The five primary sentencing objectives outlined in R v. Crosby [2020] EWCA Crim 778—punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, protection of the public, and denunciation—must be applied with fidelity.

The levels of complexity in Mr H’s case, both factual and procedural, justify a meticulous approach to sentencing. This will be aided by the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report, including risk assessment and proposed management strategies. Among the interventions to be explored are cognitive behavioural therapy targeting extremist thought patterns, controlled release to Approved Premises with electronic monitoring, and restrictions on internet access under current statutory frameworks.

The court further notes wider systemic pressures such as those identified in recent Ministry of Justice reports concerning probation staffing shortages, which inevitably impact the resources available for intensive terrorism case management. These constraints underscore the importance of coordinated multi-agency oversight under MAPPA Category 3, involving liaison between Probation Services, CTPSW, the NHS forensic mental health teams, and local authorities.

In assistance to this court, both counsel have conducted their representations with diligence and professionalism. Ms Harriet Rundle, appearing on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, provided cogent and measured submissions. Mr Duncan Blythe, instructed to represent the defendant under Legal Aid, supplied mitigation material, including letters from community organisations and the defendant’s sister. The court takes this opportunity to express its appreciation for their respective efforts, notwithstanding any difference in position.

Moving forward, the pre-sentence report shall be ordered forthwith, with a specific focus on how best to mitigate the risk posed by Mr H upon release, including the feasibility of imposing Extended Determinate Sentences and post-custodial licence conditions of an exacting nature.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration and subsequent enforcement.

These are the orders of the court.
