IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/24639  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. TREVOR  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentencing following his conviction on charges under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The conduct at issue occurred over a period of approximately eighteen months, ending with his arrest on 3 March 2025.  

The defendant’s case has proceeded through a number of court hearings, notably including listing for plea and trial preparation hearings from May to August 2025, and a trial which concluded with conviction on 4 September 2025. Counsel appearing for the Crown was Miss Imogen French, instructed by the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Department. Defence counsel, Mr Dexter Caldwell of the legal aid panel, represented Mr H throughout.  

The proceedings were conducted in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules and relevant statutory provisions. Notable in this case were delays occasioned by the need for extensive legal aid authorisations for forensic digital review, an issue which the court has recorded with some concern given the increasingly routine nature of such investigations. Further delays arose due to the unavailability of a specialist interpreter, whose scheduled attendance necessitated the adjournment of a prior hearing in June 2025.  

In accordance with the Better Case Management (BCM) model discussed at length in R v. Thurlow [2010] EWCA Crim 1460 and subsequent appellate decisions, the court acknowledges the diligent efforts of all parties to progress the case expeditiously despite systemic pressures. However, the strain upon resources in both the forensic disclosure units and legal aid administration remains a matter of ongoing judicial concern.  

Early in the investigative phase, Mr H was subject to a Channel Prevent referral, initiated by teaching staff at a further education college in Birmingham, based upon essays displaying radical ideological sympathies. The referral, dated 13 November 2022, resulted in limited engagement through mentoring sessions, but was discontinued after six months for failure to demonstrate sustained vulnerability or intent. The court's view is that such early intervention schemes, though commendable in principle, cannot foresee or forestall every eventuality, especially where engagement is intermittent and guarded.  

On the morning of 3 March 2025, officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) arrested Mr H under a warrant authorised pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The operation formed part of a complex multi-agency investigation involving digital intelligence, covert surveillance, and open source monitoring. The arrest was precipitated by a request from the Security Service following encrypted communications analysis identifying persistent contacts between Mr H and overseas extremist networks.

It should be recognised that such investigations impose considerable burdens on public sector resources. The National Counter Terrorism Headquarters reported that, at the height of Operation GADFLY, personnel resourcing comprised 8 Detective Sergeants, 22 Detective Constables, and 5 intelligence analysts dedicated exclusively to this inquiry. Notwithstanding the dedication of officers, the backlog of devices awaiting examination within the National Digital Forensics Service (NDFS) exceeded 22,000 at that time, underscoring the challenges inherent in contemporary counter-terrorism work.  

In the course of these proceedings, issues surrounding bail conditions and remand periods were rigorously ventilated. Mr H was initially remanded in custody on 5 March 2025, with subsequent variations on 18 May 2025 and 27 July 2025 to permit limited daily release for legal consultations, conditional upon electronic monitoring and curfew. This approach reflects the delicate balancing act faced by courts in assessing not merely the risk of reoffending or interference but also the defendant’s rights and the principles set out in R v. Alom [2006] EWCA Crim 1563.  

It is regrettable that Legal Aid Agency administrative processes, which bear heavily upon defence preparation, occasioned extended delays in instructions for expert psychiatric evaluation. Mr Caldwell’s diligent efforts to procure timely assessment were met with protracted bureaucratic hurdles, prompting a formal complaint lodged by the Bar Council. While such procedural obstacles are regrettable, the court is satisfied they have not prejudiced Mr H’s fair trial rights within the meaning of Art 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  

The victim impact statement prepared on behalf of the community affected by the defendant's conduct was received with gratitude. While this case does not involve an identifiable direct victim, the broader societal implications and the effects upon public confidence in security measures warrants reflection. Those working in community resilience programmes in Birmingham, including the Birmingham Faith Engagement Forum, have furnished documents attesting to the heightened anxiety and disruption caused by such offences, even in their preparatory stages.  

Turning to principles of sentencing, the court is mindful of the statutory framework established under the Terrorism Act 2006 and the Terrorism Sentencing Guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council in March 2023. These guidelines articulate the need to calibrate sentences proportionally against culpability, risk, and the necessity for deterrence and public protection, as endorsed in R v. Khan [2024] EWCA Crim 927. The maximum penalty for offences contrary to section 5 of the 2006 Act is life imprisonment, reflecting the gravity with which Parliament and society view terrorism-related conduct.  

The court also notes established sentencing precedents such as R v. Ahmed [2017] EWCA Crim 12 which reinforce the view that early disruption of plans does not inherently diminish culpability if the preparatory acts demonstrate sufficient intent and sophistication. Similarly, R v. Preston [2019] EWCA Crim 572 highlighted the importance of considering the defendant's degree of active participation and leadership in a terrorist enterprise.

Evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that Mr H operated multiple pseudonymous accounts on encrypted messaging platforms, through which he disseminated radical manifestos and secured technical materials relevant to explosives manufacture. This conduct was facilitated by a router fitted with anonymisation software and the use of cryptocurrency for procurement, reflecting an advanced operational security posture.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

This court recognises the comments of Lord Justice Davis in R v. Mutuku [2021] EWCA Crim 815, where the possession of incomplete or draft materials was held capable of evidencing intent depending on the contextual matrix. The same interpretation applies here: partial possession does not negate culpability when considered with other acts such as communication and surveillance.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The intermittent presentation of hobbyist interests by the defendant, including model aircraft construction and amateur entomology, was explored during trial. Defence submissions invited the court to see these as evidence of benign diversion. Such arguments, while cogent on a human level, do not outweigh the documented evidence of engagement with extremist networks and preparations for violence.  

The possession of minor quantities of stimulant medications in the defendant’s accommodation was referenced in mitigation, with counsel asserting a history of medically diagnosed Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The psychiatric report, while comprehensive, did not identify any formal disorder that would materially diminish culpability under R v. Jameson [2016] EWCA Crim 1634, although it noted limited impulsivity in decision-making.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Travel history submitted as evidence included a visit to Lisbon in September 2023, purportedly for academic conference attendance. Independent inquiries exposed a deviation to a suburb known for congregations of identified radical extremists, a factor not satisfactorily explained or mitigated by the defence.  

In considering procedural facets, it falls to be recorded that pre-trial listing was constrained significantly by the Nationwide Magistrates’ Court strike in February and March 2025, which limited hearing availability and contributed to unavoidable scheduling delays. These events underscore the fragility of the criminal justice timetable in times of industrial action.  

The court further acknowledges the correspondence received from the Independent Mental Health Advocacy Service dated 10 July 2025, which highlighted the necessity for continued structured psychological support post-conviction. This emphasises the increasing intersection between mental health services and counter-terrorism management, a complex interplay noted in the recent Home Office report “Psychological Aspects of Terrorism Offending” (2024).  

A forensic financial investigation revealed a number of cryptocurrency transfers linked to Mr H’s various digital wallets, including an aggregated sum of £3,150 transferred to an entity associated with dual-use chemical suppliers in Eastern Europe. Whilst the collection and analysis of blockchain transactions remain a novel feature of criminal intelligence, courts must be cognisant of their reliability and possible vulnerabilities to spoofing or hacking, issues canvassed in R v. Feng [2023] EWCA Crim 279.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

The volume of data requiring analysis imposed a heavy operational burden upon the digital forensics centres. Notwithstanding the recent investment in upgrade programmes, including the National Casework and Disclosure Platform (NCDP), delays persisted. This is a reminder of the growing gap between investigative demands and processing capability, a gap which, if unaddressed, risks diminishing the efficacy of counter-terrorism efforts.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to the defendant’s personal background, Mr H is a 31-year-old male, educated to degree level in computer science at a regional university. His former employer, a software development firm specialising in embedded systems, provided a written reference highlighting his technical aptitude but also noting his “social isolation and occasional disengagement from team dynamics.” The reference further recorded his resignation in October 2023 following concerns about unauthorised use of company resources.  

This court notes with interest, though without substantive weight, the letters submitted on behalf of Mr H by the West Midlands Community Arts Forum and the Riverside Youth Project. Both organisations acknowledged his class attendance and volunteer work with disadvantaged youth groups. While commendable, such contributions must be weighed against the severity and nature of the offences.  

Professor Simon Frazer, forensic psychologist instructed by the defence, conducted a detailed assessment and diagnosed the defendant with a rigid cognitive style, marked by an absence of remorse and a high risk of ideology-based recidivism. This assessment is consistent with the Crown’s expert evidence and with public protection concerns articulated in various Prevent guidance documents.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Finally, the court has reviewed the comprehensive pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation Service, incorporating specialist assessments from the Counter Terrorism Risk and Harm Panel. It notes the proposed inclusion of Intensive Public Protection requirements, including the implementation of an Extended Determinate Sentence with licence conditions restricting internet interaction and association with identified extremist contacts.  

The Probation Service’s submissions emphasise the chronic understaffing and resource constraints faced by high-risk terrorism offender teams nationwide—a matter that hampers immediate resettlement plans and the allocation of approved premises slots. The court pays due attention to these operational realities.  

In consideration of the foregoing, the court reserves sentence pending the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report addressing immediate custodial facilities and proposed engagement with structured disengagement programmes, including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme. This report is to be submitted within four weeks. Both parties may make further written representations upon receipt.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within twenty-eight days of sentencing. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved for future determination.  

These are the orders of the court.
