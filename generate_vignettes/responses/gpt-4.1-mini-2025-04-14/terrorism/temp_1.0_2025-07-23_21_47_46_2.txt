IN THE CROWN COURT AT CARDIFF  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. C2025/31764  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. F. BRIDGMAN  
Filed: 17 October 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences occurred between January 2023 and his arrest on 11 April 2025.  

The matter first came before this jurisdiction at the initial listing on 3 May 2025, following Mr H’s arrest earlier that month by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing Wales. The arrest arose amidst a lengthy investigation involving collaboration between the National Crime Agency’s Cyber Division, local counter-terrorism units, and the Security Service. The thoroughness of the inquiry was notable, reflecting the increasingly complex nature of investigatory work in terrorism prosecutions today.  

The court is constrained to note the prolonged period that elapsed between charge and final listing owing to a confluence of factors, including defence applications for additional disclosure, adjournments necessitated by late third-party evidence, and multiple requests for psychiatric assessment which were subsequently diagnosed as critical to assessing risk profile and sentence planning. The delays mirror a wider systemic issue affecting public justice cases in recent years—something that merits serious policy consideration though it cannot excuse protracted uncertainty for victims, nor must it diminish the urgency of appropriate public protection measures.  

A plea and trial preparation hearing was conducted on 2 September 2025, at which the defendant indicated a not guilty plea and maintained it through the jury empanelment process. The change of plea to guilty was entered late, on the morning of the sentencing hearing itself, namely 17 October 2025. Given the timing, the credit that can fairly be afforded is limited and will be considered further below.  

The principles applicable to credit for guilty pleas have been well-established in recent appellate authority. In particular, R v. Loughridge [2024] EWCA Crim 927 serves as an instructive precedent, reasserting that credit is a discretionary but not an automatic entitlement, and its extent is closely tied to the timing of the plea and the effect on court resources and witnesses. The court's discretion must be exercised with due regard to the need for proportionality and fairness but must equally guard against tactical pleas made only at the point of evidential inevitability. This case presents a clear example of such a late plea, diluting the discount available.  

Turning to the legal framework under which sentencing is to be conducted, the court is obliged to apply the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline, published January 2023, which directs assessment of culpability on a graded scale reflecting, in tandem, factors such as the sophistication of preparation, the extent of the defendant’s involvement, the nature of the intended harm, and the level of risk to the public at large.  

Historical jurisprudence continues to have salience. Standing examples include R v. Farooq [2015] EWCA Crim 1531, which confirmed that preparatory offences under section 5 of the 2006 Act are grave and merit a sentencing approach calibrated to the risk of substantial harm, and R v. Khan [2021] EWCA Crim 584, in which the Court emphasised the need for deterrence in offences demonstrating planning and material support for terrorist acts. While acknowledging that Mr H’s case includes distinct factual and evidential features, these principles provide the statutory and common law contours within which sentence must be framed.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

The circumstances of the offending, as set out in the agreed statement of facts and supported by extensive digital forensic evidence, clearly demonstrate a level of intent and premeditation that cannot be underestimated. Further, this case exemplifies the emergent challenges posed by the intersection of radical ideology and technological facilitation.  

Council for the Crown, Ms. Serena Voss, has submitted comprehensive argument grounded in the prosecution’s extensive documentary and digital evidence, including a voluminous schedule of encrypted material recovered from the defendant’s devices, intercepted communications lawfully obtained under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, and covertly recorded meetings with known extremists. The prosecution’s outline elegantly linked these pieces of evidence, illustrating a pattern of conduct directed towards procuring materials suitable for violent acts designed to cause indiscriminate harm.  

The defendant's counsel, Mr Dhruv Mehta of Defence Chambers, while conceding the factual basis for conviction, has sought to emphasise mitigating factors. These notably include Mr H’s previously unblemished record, the apparent absence of overt violence in his conduct, and his cooperation in providing a personal statement on the day of sentence. Importantly, defence submissions also rely heavily on the report and recommendations of Professor Jane Kershaw, consultant forensic psychiatrist.  

Professor Kershaw’s recent and meticulously prepared dossier, which has been accepted and admitted into evidence, diagnoses Mr H as exhibiting features consistent with a rigid cognitive style, marked social isolation, and a pronounced susceptibility to extremist narratives. Crucially, the report finds no diagnosable severe mental illness but indicates a vulnerability that could, without structured intervention, perpetuate risk to public safety upon release. The report underscores that engagement with specialist deradicalisation programmes may be beneficial but cannot guarantee success or permanent disengagement.  

The court is aware, of course, that such evidentiary psychiatric assessments represent but one part of a broader mosaic of risk evaluation in terrorism cases. It recalls observations made in R v Beckett [2019] EWCA Crim 1763, where the Court of Appeal cautioned that clinical opinions must be integrated into holistic assessments incorporating behavioural, ideological, and situational factors. The absence of mental disorder does not negate dangerousness, nor do mitigating psychiatric features necessarily obviate the appropriateness of custody for public protection.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The Crown has further adduced evidence regarding the defendant’s use of online platforms featuring decentralised and encrypted communication. The evolution of Mr H’s digital footprint reveals a gradual intensification of ideology, with online posts transitioning from generalised political commentary to explicit endorsement of violence. Linguistic analysis commissioned by the National Centre for Digital Forensics identified text resembling propaganda from groups proscribed under Schedule 2, indicating ideological alignment rather than mere passive consumption.  

It is relevant to observe that in this era of technological advancement, law enforcement agencies are increasingly reliant upon sophisticated cyber investigative methodologies. Between 2023 and 2025, the workload of digital forensic units across Wales and neighbouring regions has expanded exponentially, resulting in significant backlogs and resource constraints. The investigative team in this case employed time-intensive manual decryption processes and collaborative intelligence sharing to build a near-comprehensive profile of Mr H’s communications and intentions. Such efforts represent a valuable but costly investment of public resources.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Forensic examination further revealed possession of a quantity of apparatus consistent with the manufacture of improvised explosive devices, along with detailed notes on chemical compounds and detonation sequences. While some of this documentation was incomplete or damaged, the overall pattern aligns with established preparatory conduct as set out in the case of R v. Sigurdsson [2016] EWCA Crim 723, which held that possession of incomplete explosives instructions is nonetheless culpable where intent is otherwise clear.  

The defence has suggested alternative explanations for certain items, including an asserted interest in chemistry as a hobby and legitimate collection of technical manuals unrelated to terrorism. The court acknowledges that engagement in scientific inquiry is not inherently culpable; however, in this context, the materials must be viewed through the prism of accompanying communications and actions which strongly corroborate an intent to commit violence.  

The court also notes the recent proliferation of homebrew fermentation as a social pastime, including in communities to which Mr H is connected. Evidence was presented concerning small batches of homemade cider found in the shared accommodation rented by the defendant. While peripheral, it is a fact that such undertakings have no bearing upon the gravity of his felonious conduct.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

To the court’s knowledge, the defendant’s personal background includes a degree in chemical engineering from a respected university, a fact that is confirmed by documents submitted on his behalf. Letters from academic referees speak to his analytical abilities and prior contribution to research projects, though none endorse the illicit purposes for which such skills were later diverted.  

The court acknowledges receipt and careful consideration of several community character references, including one from the local Mens’ Health Initiative, praising Mr H’s recent involvement in volunteer work assisting elderly residents with mobility equipment. Such activity, while commendable, is nevertheless overshadowed by the significant risk his offending conduct poses to wider society.  

It is, regrettably, common in terrorism cases for individuals with previously unexceptional records and seemingly unremarkable lives to present latent risks that abruptly crystallise into criminal action. This underscores the necessity of measured responses that balance the potential for rehabilitation against immediate public safety imperatives.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Attention is drawn to a short international journey undertaken by the defendant in March 2024 to Eastern Europe, which was ostensibly for tourism but nevertheless coincided with meetings with persons later identified by European counter-terrorism agencies as associates of proscribed organisations. Although Mr H did not ultimately cross into conflict zones, the intent evinced by attempts to establish connection with extremist networks is troubling.  

The court is conscious that, in the broader geopolitical climate, international travel patterns often reflect complex motivations. Nonetheless, the security services were justified in investigating such movements in the context of Mr H’s ideological trajectory.  

It is pertinent to mention that during the course of the investigation, a co-defendant charged in a connected but separate count was apprehended but failed to appear for trial and remains at large. His unrelated flight has complicated inter-agency cooperation and underscored systemic challenges in tracking transnational movements. The co-defendant’s conduct must not, however, be conflated with that of Mr H, whose case is adjudicated on its own evidentiary and factual base.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial forensics revealed transactions amounting to several thousand pounds traced to cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Monero, transferred from accounts attributed to the defendant via unlinkable wallets to vendors of dual-use chemicals and electronic components commonly employed in the manufacture of explosives. This pattern is consistent with concealment strategies identified in recent European Court decisions on terrorist financing, for example in R v. Svensson [2023] EWCA Crim 1103.  

These transactions were layered through multiple mixing services, increasing the consequent difficulty for law enforcement in tracing sources and destinations. The court notes with concern the technological sophistication of such methods, which provide a veil of opacity that complicates investigation and evidentiary collection.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The defendant’s personal circumstances have been set out in detail in the Pre-Sentence Report prepared by Community Rehabilitation Company Offender Manager Ms. Eleanor Price. The report details Mr H’s background as a 31-year-old single male residing in locally funded accommodation with a history of social disengagement and unemployment since 2023. Prior to offending, his employment history included brief tenure as a laboratory technician at a private firm, terminated following concerns about unauthorised internet usage flagged by employers.  

Ms. Price’s report further emphasises the systemic pressures on probation and support services in this jurisdiction, noting instances of staff shortages exceeding 17%, high turnover, and inadequate specialist training in ideological extremism. These structural challenges inevitably impact service delivery and the prospect of effective rehabilitation.  

Notwithstanding these difficulties, the probation service has over recent months made extensive efforts to engage the defendant in risk management and intervention programmes, albeit with limited success due to Mr H’s reluctance to participate fully.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The report prepared by Professor Marius Fraser, forensic psychologist, appended to the probation material, reiterates the absence of formal mental illness but highlights cognitive rigidity and a pronounced us-versus-them worldview. The risk assessment concludes that Mr H presents a high risk of serious harm in the absence of intensive, multidisciplinary supervision and structured deradicalisation interventions.  

Professor Fraser’s report rightly cautions that successful disengagement in ideological offenders is often protracted and fraught with relapse risk, thereby necessitating sustained engagement across custodial and community phases. The likely need for an extended sentence incorporating Licence Conditions and bespoke community monitoring is made manifest.  

Within this context, mitigation arises principally from Mr H’s previously unblemished record and the belated plea of guilty. The court is mindful that a plea entered at so late a stage affords only modest discount, as anticipatively stated at the outset.  

As this court has remarked on numerous occasions during recent years, the public protection imperative remains paramount in terrorism cases. The theft of copper cable from a rail depot in a distinct prosecution concluded last year, as well as recent spates of graffiti daubed on public transport infrastructure in Cardiff, may not be directly linked to Mr H, but they contribute to an atmosphere of pervasive community harm demanding vigilant response. It is imperative that sentencing reflects the seriousness of ideological terrorism at a scale capable of catastrophic consequences if left unchecked.  

On a procedural note, the court acknowledges the professionalism and dedication of Ms. Voss for the Crown and Mr Mehta for the defence. I also thank court staff who facilitated smooth running of this matter despite the recent refurbishment of this courtroom, which has been a welcome improvement in working environment. The court clerk was particularly diligent in ensuring timely filings and managing the late arrival of interpreter services called upon during intermediate stages.  

The Legal Aid Agency’s involvement in this case, although finally secured after procedural delays in permissions for independent expert instruction, was sufficient to ensure adequate representation. Nonetheless, the court registers its continual disappointment with ongoing systemic underfunding and administrative backlogs that challenge timely justice.  

In the wider context, it is worth observing that the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) processes were engaged promptly with Category 3 oversight from the outset, involving the Probation Service, regional CT Policing, local authority social care, and mental health teams. The MAPPA meetings demonstrated standard inter-agency co-operation, notwithstanding the aforementioned staffing pressures and coordination difficulties. This collaborative approach, while imperfect, remains our best defence against risk of serious harm from individuals such as Mr H.  

Turning finally to the sentencing approach, the court finds that the culpability of Mr H’s offending sits squarely within the higher bracket envisaged by the Terrorism Guidelines. The sophistication of preparation, ideological commitment, and proximity to actualisation are all clear and demonstrable. The court must impose a sentence that reflects these aggravating features, preserves deterrence, and secures public protection.  

Mitigation is, as noted, limited. Credit for the plea, late as it is, shall be allowed at one sixth reduction. The defendant’s age, lack of previous convictions, and educational achievements also modestly temper sentence, to be balanced against the gravity of conduct and potential harm envisaged.  

This sentencing hearing will be adjourned to permit completion of a full pre-sentence report addressing risk-appropriate custodial options, availability of high-intensity psychological intervention, suitability of extended licence supervision, and feasibility of structured Community Rehabilitation on release. The report should explore the potential application of electronic monitoring and restrictions on internet access consistent with current public safety protocols.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Cardiff. They have been transcribed and duly recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentencing hearing will be listed once the aforesaid reports are received and considered by the court. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of sentence. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
