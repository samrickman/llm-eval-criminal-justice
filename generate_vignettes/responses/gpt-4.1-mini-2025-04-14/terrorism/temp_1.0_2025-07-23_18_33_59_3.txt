IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29756  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. G. MALTBY  
Filed: 18 October 2025  
  
Mr H stands before this court to be sentenced upon his conviction for two counts: one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is found to span the period from late 2022 until his arrest in January 2025.  
  
The procedural history of this case is extensive and illustrative of the complexities that attend prosecutions under the Terrorism Acts. Mr H was initially charged on 29 January 2025 following a multi-agency operation coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The arrest and subsequent searches were authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and took place at his residence in Eastville, Bristol, at approximately 04:25 hours.  
  
Prior to the trial, the case underwent several procedural events of note. The initial listing for trial was scheduled for 12 May 2025 but was adjourned twice owing to the late disclosure of digital devices containing encrypted material requiring decryption. The National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) assisted in this technical process. The delays extended the trial commencement to 3 September 2025. The court notes these procedural adjournments placed additional demands on the already constrained listing arrangement of the Crown Court in Bristol, a facility which has seen significant refurbishment over the last three years, including updated technological capability designed to handle complex digital evidence presentations.  
  
The Legal Aid Agency's administration in relation to the defence's application for funding to instruct an independent digital forensic expert was marked by uncharacteristic delay. This delay accumulated in excess of six weeks, raising concerns about the sufficiency of provisions available for defendants in terrorism cases and the risk that procedural fairness may be prejudiced by bureaucratic inertia. Counsel for the defence, Mr Jayden Cross, is to be commended for his professionalism navigating these hurdles, including multiple correspondences and appeals to the Legal Aid Provider Resolution Unit.  
  
During the early stages of the investigation, a referral to the Prevent programme was made by a local sixth-form college teacher in December 2021 following Mr H's submission of a political science essay embedding extensive quotations from extremist texts, accompanied by a series of social media posts which were deemed to express a radicalised worldview. The referral resulted in a Channel panel meeting, which was subsequently discontinued after Mr H attended a series of voluntary mentoring sessions and showed apparent disengagement. The Prevent panel’s minutes, submitted in evidence, demonstrate meticulous risk assessment but ultimately concluded that the threshold for further intervention was not met at that time.  
  
It is pertinent to note that the national context remains challenging for such interventions. The Prevent programme continues to face debate over its efficacy and community trust. The court observed correspondence from the West Country Interfaith Forum submitted on behalf of the community representatives, which cautioned against overly punitive approaches that might alienate minority groups. While such perspectives warrant respect, this court’s remit remains confined to the application of law and safeguarding of the public.

The investigation leading to Mr H’s arrest was exhaustive in its deployment of intelligence-gathering tools, including the analysis of anonymised internet metadata and examination of digital artefacts. The utilization of network traffic analysis, triangulation of encrypted messaging applications, and cross-comparison with international watchlists underscores the advances in counter-terrorism capabilities, albeit highlighting the escalating resource demands upon law enforcement agencies.  
  
The indictment was precipitated by detailed entries stored within an encrypted data repository located on a solid-state drive seized during the search. The decryption effort required international cooperation involving magistrates in Germany and Finland due to transnational hosting of servers and third-party digital intermediaries. Notably, technological hurdles such as perfect forward secrecy and ephemeral keys within messaging platforms prolonged evidential processing, an issue described in less complex form by Lord Justice Fulcher in R v. Kennington [2017] EWCA Crim 1539.  
  
It bears mention that system constraints similarly affected the disclosure timetables in the present case, necessitating extensions sanctioned by the listing judge. The Digital Evidence Working Group’s guidelines, while aspirational in its efficient disclosure model, has yet to be fully realised in day-to-day practice across the various regional forces.  
  
Concerning the timing and nature of Mr H’s plea(s), the court notes that although initially entering not guilty pleas, Mr H entered guilty pleas to both counts at the start of the trial on 4 September 2025, a point at which significant pre-trial work had been completed by both prosecution and defence. Such late admissions reduce, but do not extinguish, the credit allowable for a guilty plea. This follows the principles enunciated in R v. Loughton [2023] EWCA Crim 2274, where the Court of Appeal underscored that the discount attaches primarily to the timing and sincerity of the plea and the public interest in resolution.  
  
In addition, the court acknowledges submissions from the defence that tendered mitigation concerning Mr H’s mental state, in particular a report compiled by Dr Simon Ellison, consultant forensic psychiatrist, attached to the medical records of the Forest Hill Secure Facility. That document, while detailed and professionally composed, ultimately does not engage positively with considerations of diminished responsibility or capacity. Dr Ellison’s report highlights Mr H’s lack of previously diagnosed mental illness but identifies elevated levels of cognitive inflexibility and preoccupation with ideological themes characteristic of what has been described within literature as ‘fixated belief disorder.’ The court is mindful that such syndromic terms have not yet been generally endorsed as a formal diagnostic entity.  
  
A letter from Mr H’s mother, Mrs Yasmin Khalid, has also been submitted, expressing profound distress at her son’s trajectory and expressing hopes for eventual rehabilitation. While these expressions merit sympathy, the court must weigh the paramount need of public protection and deterrence.  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  
  
The Crown’s case included evidence of Mr H’s online activity, some of which was recovered and decrypted with considerable effort by digital forensic analysts. The Facebook and Telegram messaging accounts attributed to Mr H contained a series of posts and shared materials invoking violent extremist ideology and advocating for “precipitated insurrection.” The material showed engagement with terrorist propaganda, some of which bear resemblance to publications proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000.  
  
It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that the evidence demonstrated clear intent and planning, including procurement discussions for dual-use items, intended manufacture of components adaptable into explosive devices, and reconnaissance data concerning local critical infrastructure. The aggregated digital footprint, assessed alongside surveillance conducted by CTPSW, constitutes a substantial evidential base.  
  
Nonetheless, defence counsel argued for a narrative of fantasy and bravado, suggesting that Mr H’s conduct was aspirational rather than preparatory. This submission is broadly rejected on the evidence.  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  
  
The decrypted contents of a VeraCrypt container labelled “BlueHorizon” contained a number of documents and video files: improvised explosive device schematics, test results from shrapnel packing trials using gelatine blocks, and encrypted briefing notes purporting to outline a “target selection matrix.” Some of these materials were incomplete or corrupted; the issue was contested in pre-trial hearings concerning mens rea and evidential sufficiency, following the Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Ganesh [2024] EWCA Crim 1429. The verdict is that possession of partially accessible documents, in context, suffices for evidential purposes.  
  
Separately, the court acknowledges the defence’s effort to contextualise some forensic exhibits as components of lawful hobbies or academic study. For example, the presence of home-brew beer kits and gardening manuals was cited in mitigation. While such artefacts may signify an attempt to portray Mr H as otherwise engaged, their presence neither diminishes nor negates the seriousness of the terrorism-related conduct.  
  
Recent technological developments have made the demarcation between reckless enthusiasm and criminal preparation ever more nuanced. As Lord Justice Holbrook noted in R v. Ali [2020] EWCA Crim 767, “the possession of certain technical knowledge cannot be viewed in isolation from its potential application.”  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  
  
In cross-examination, the defence sought to place reliance upon certain contemporaneous travel records. Mr H was recorded making a two-day trip to the Lake District in June 2023 allegedly for hiking, although the prosecution highlighted CCTV evidence of meetings at petrol stations with persons subject to foreign terrorist intelligence service monitoring.  
  
The court does not find the suggested innocent purpose plausible in light of the full evidential picture. Similarly, mention of a 2018 speeding ticket and a 2019 noise complaint against a flat several streets from his residence is immaterial to the core allegations.  
  
There was also reference to a case management delay caused by the overlapping of listings due to an arson trial in Crown Court 4, which in itself had no association with the present case. Furthermore, a co-defendant charged under separate indictment with offences involving possession of a weapon was noted to have absconded prior to trial; this fact is irrelevant to the court’s consideration of Mr H’s individual culpability.  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  
  
Among the Crown’s submissions was elucidation of Mr H’s international travel, including a week-long visit to Antwerp in April 2024. Immigration records showed an itinerary involving transit through international hubs common to logistics channels exploited by terrorist facilitators. Although Mr H asserted in his police interviews that the trip was cultural tourism, there were electronic communications linking him to persons of interest in Belgium who were subsequently arrested for offences involving precursor chemicals.  
  
The significant electronic surveillance and intelligence-sharing mechanisms involved in this investigation reflect the cross-jurisdictional nature of modern terrorism threats. The court expressly notes the cooperation extended by European partners, under existing frameworks governing mutual legal assistance and intelligence exchange.  
  
The police investigative logs detailed that officers devoted over 1,200 man-hours in examining digital footage from public transport hubs, residential CCTV, and private property monitoring devices. The resource implications of such work not only impact national security budgets, but also influence the capacity of local policing to respond to conventional criminality such as serious violent crime or domestic burglary.  
  
A criminological analysis provided by Ms. Elizabeth Rowe, an intelligence analyst with the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, demonstrated that during the period in question, there was a slight but statistically significant increase in reported offences of fly-tipping in known green belt areas. While not germane to the defendant’s case, this observation is emblematic of a broader societal challenge concerning environmental crime and urban neglect.  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  
  
Financial forensics formed a substantial portion of the investigative case. Blockchain analysis traced multiple cryptocurrency transfers—totaling approximately £5,000—originating from wallets linked to Mr H’s known pseudonymous accounts. Those payments routed through tumblers designed to obscure transactional origins before arriving at sellers advertising components with dual civilian and military applications. This pattern is consistent with what has increasingly been termed “dark web procurement,” a growing concern highlighted in recent Parliamentary reports on illicit finance.  
  
The court reiterates the complex debate surrounding cryptocurrencies and public safety. While decentralisation offers financial privacy benefits, the weaponisation of this technology by malicious actors poses a genuine regulatory challenge. Adherence to AML/KYC standards within legitimate finance contrasts starkly with the deficiencies exposed by illicit flows such as those in the present case.  
  
The court acknowledges the exhaustive efforts taken by the Counter Terrorism Policing South West Serious Crime Directorate’s forensic accountants, whose reports ran to over 230 pages and included comprehensive graphical representations of linked accounts, transfers, and anonymising services.  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  
  
Turning to the personal profile of Mr H, he is 31 years old with a Masters degree in electronic engineering from a university in the south west of England. He was formerly employed in a mid-sized defence contracting firm. Letters from former employers describe him as “precise,” “intellectually curious,” and “capable of creative problem-solving.” His sudden resignation in late 2022 followed internal enquiries relating to compliance concerns over overseas communications.  
  
The court has also considered a series of character references from voluntary organisations where Mr H engaged in community gardening and foodbank volunteering. While such contributions denote a degree of social conscience, they are insufficient to offset the severity of the offending in this terrorism context.  
  
The probation service submitted a report that touched on the heavy workload pressures faced by offender managers assigned to terrorism-related cases, noting average caseloads double those of standard probation officers and the churn caused by frequent sick leave and vacancies. This systemic strain presents challenges for sustained supervision and rehabilitation planning.  
  
The court further acknowledges correspondence from the Bristol Hate Crime Advisory Panel expressing concern that extended custodial sentences might exacerbate community tensions but affirming support for measures prioritising public safety.  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  
  
Professor Anya Woodbridge, consultant forensic psychologist retained for this matter, submitted a comprehensive report addressing Mr H’s ideological adherence and psychological risk. Professor Woodbridge observes “fixed ideological schema consistent with high-risk profiles, a tendency toward black-and-white thinking, and a guarded attitude toward authority.” No diagnosable mental illness was identified. The risk assessment concluded that without intensive, multi-disciplinary intervention, the risk of recidivism and extremist offending in the community is substantial.  
  
The report advises that structured deradicalisation programmes, including cognitive behavioural approaches tailored to grievance-based extremism, coupled with close monitoring through MAPPA Category 3, provide the best hope for risk management. Nonetheless, the report wisely cautions against optimism, citing attrition rates and the ambivalence exhibited by Mr H during engagement.  
  
The Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Offences Guidelines instruct the court to apply principles of denunciation, deterrence, and public protection in calibrating sentence. The aggravated features in this case include deliberate planning, sophistication of technical knowledge, and possession of material aimed at mass harm. The mitigation is restricted to absence of previous convictions, educational attainment, and late guilty pleas.  
  
In keeping with established case law — including the decisions in R v. Wali [2024] EWCA Crim 685 and R v. Simms [2023] EWCA Crim 1129 — the court must impose a sentence reflecting the gravity of the intended terror activity, the need to send a clear societal message, and the imperative of incapacitating danger for a sufficient period.  
  
Accordingly, this court directs the commissioning of a detailed pre-sentence report, instructing the probation service to consider the availability of high-intensity prison psychology resources, potential extended determinate sentencing under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and appropriate licence conditions designed around electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and internet restrictions. Any involvement of specialist agencies, such as the Southern Counter Terrorism Unit’s deradicalisation practitioners, should also be examined.  
  
These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. A formal transcript has been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  
  
These are the orders of the court.
