IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29921  
Sentencing Remarks — His Honour Judge L. F. MONTGOMERY  
Filed: 17 October 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on charges under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism under section 5(1)(a) and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges arise from conduct occurring between July 2023 and February 2025. The proceedings have been conducted pursuant to standard principles governing terrorism cases, reflecting the seriousness with which the state approaches any manifestation of extremist or violent intent.

The defendant was initially arrested at 07:45 on 14 February 2025, by officers attached to Counter-Terrorism Policing West Midlands. The arrest followed execution of warrants at premises in Aston, Birmingham, supported by intelligence from MI5. That intelligence indicated communications from an encrypted account attributed to Mr H strongly evidenced preparatory steps to commit acts of terrorism. At arrest, Mr H was found in possession of electronic devices including two laptop computers, several encrypted hard drives, and materials later assessed by experts as relevant to the creation of explosive devices.

The investigation underpinning Mr H’s arrest was the culmination of Operation REDPINE, an intricate inquiry involving liaison between Counter-Terrorism Policing West Midlands, the National Crime Agency, and the National Cyber Crime Unit. The inquiry drew extensively upon telephone intercepts authorised under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, as well as covert surveillance, witness testimony, and forensic analysis of digital material. The resources deployed reflected the recognised threat level prevailing in this jurisdiction. Public interest in such cases is of course acknowledged, yet the court must balance transparency with the need to safeguard operational integrity.

It should be noted in passing that the methodical approach applied in Operation REDPINE echoes earlier inquiries, such as Operation NIGHTFALL in 2018, which similarly involved painstaking reconstruction of encrypted communications and travel data to disrupt a planned attack. Such cases exemplify the evolving sophistication of counter-terrorism investigations in an era where digital footprints often provide critical evidential pathways, yet also pose tremendous analytic challenges.

In the course of proceedings, it emerged that the defendant had been subject to an earlier Prevent referral, made in October 2020, by a university lecturer who observed his attendance at meetings where extremist materials were discussed. The referral was considered by a Channel panel but discontinued after Mr H attended a limited number of mentoring sessions and demonstrated some initial receptiveness to engagement. Whether that early intervention missed opportunities cannot be adjudicated here; hindsight offers clarity that prospective measures inherently lack.

The case was first listed on 12 March 2025 for a plea and trial preparation hearing. Despite a comprehensive disclosure exercise involving over 1,100 exhibit items and multiple expert reports, Mr H declined to enter a plea, maintaining not guilty until the fifth day of the trial hearing on 8 September 2025, when he pleaded guilty to both counts. Such late admissions, while accepted by the court, are afforded reduced mitigatory effect on sentence, pursuant to well-established sentencing principles.

The observation may be made that the practice of entering pleas at what is widely recognised as the “eleventh hour” places strain upon judicial resources and causes significant emotional toll on witnesses and victims. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed that discount for guilty pleas is intended as recognition for early responsibility, not tactical delay when the case inevitably fails.

The established authorities pertinent to credit for guilty pleas include R v. Charters [2019] EWCA Crim 345, where the Court of Appeal made clear that credit must be denied or severely curtailed where pleas are given only after overwhelming evidence is presented and trial timetables compressed. That approach was reinforced in R v. Dymond [2021] EWCA Crim 1122, highlighting the importance of actual remorse and cooperation rather than acceptance born of strategic necessity.

It is also appropriate to acknowledge the jurisprudence surrounding the sentencing framework for terrorism offences. The Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Offences Guideline emphasises that culpability must be assessed in light of the sophistication of the planning, the proximity to execution, and the extent of harm intended. Cases such as R v. Sherwood [2022] EWCA Crim 897 and R v. Kellar [2024] EWCA Crim 143 provide binding precedent that custodial sentences must reflect the paramount objectives of deterrence and public protection.

During the trial, evidence was adduced demonstrating that the defendant maintained an online forum under the username “IronSentinel.” Initially, the site contained innocuous mechanical engineering discussions; however, by mid-2023 it had evolved into a platform disseminating extremist propaganda, including manuals on improvised explosive device (IED) construction. Linguistic analyses revealed patterned usage of terminology originating from proscribed organisations listed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The digital forensic unit reported recovery of encrypted files stored within a concealed VeraCrypt volume, labelled misleadingly as “HolidayPhotos2023.” Amongst the documents were instruction manuals, component procurement lists, and video tutorials related to the manufacture of explosive devices and incendiary materials. It was notable that attempts had been made to mask file access timings through the use of time-stamping manipulation software.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Defence submissions sought to characterise some of the recovered technical materials as the products of an academic’s curiosity in chemistry and mechanics, referencing Mr H’s prior attendance at a local Makerspace and his membership of a drone enthusiasts group. While the court recognises the value of scientific enquiry and constructive hobbies, there exists no plausible basis upon which such materials can be disentangled from their manifest purpose when viewed in concert with the whole evidential picture.

For completeness, the court records that a small quantity of cannabis was found in a sealed container at the defendant’s residence. No charges arose from this, and the matter is noted only to address attempts by defence to present Mr H’s lifestyle as unremarkable or innocuous. Further, an unpaid parking charge from 2019 and an abandoned bicycle registration are similarly peripheral and bear no weight on sentencing.

The court is also aware of prior case law involving weapons possession and violent disorder, such as R v. Mansell [2017] EWCA Crim 456, wherein the defendant was convicted for affray following a pub brawl involving pool cues. While the circumstances bear no direct relevance here, these cases illustrate the breadth of offences that the Crown Prosecution Service routinely confront and help contextualise the serious nature of terrorism offences in comparison.

The Crown also adduced travel records showing Mr H attended a conference in Berlin in November 2024, ostensibly for participation in a robotic engineering symposium. However, contemporaneous logs revealed separate bookings for a day trip to a suburb known to host fringe ideological meetings. CCTV footage retrieved from the suburb documented a meeting between Mr H and an individual subsequently linked to arrests for possession of precursor chemicals. That individual, referred to as Co-defendant J, remains at large following a failure to surrender to bail.

The operation also suffered certain challenges not uncommon to complex investigations. For instance, digital forensic teams struggled to decrypt data stored on a prototype “quantum-resistant” encrypted drive recovered from co-defendant J’s vehicle. That obstacle led to significant delay and multiple requests for judicial authorisation of covert technical measures.

The court further notes the ongoing pressure exerted on the judiciary from rising demand in non-terrorism criminal matters. Recent Annual Reports from the Ministry of Justice indicate a worrying trend in prosecutions of environmental crime such as fly-tipping on protected green belt land, which diverts prosecutorial resources and can indirectly delay terrorism case management. The ecosystem of criminal litigation is thus increasingly pressured, and any undue delay inflicts significant costs on all parties.

A financial analysis submitted by Counter-Terrorism Policing traced a series of cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H, including the movement of funds through so-called “mixing” platforms designed to obfuscate origin. Of particular concern was a transfer approximating 1.5 Bitcoin, valued at £37,000 at the date of transaction, delivered to wallets associated with dark-web vendors specialising in dual-use chemicals and industrial motors suitable for weapon fabrication. The court acknowledges the broader societal debate about the regulation of such technologies, but must focus firmly on criminal misuse.

In considering the digital and financial evidence, the court reflects on the increasing ubiquity of cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based finance, often lauded as innovation in commercial activity yet exploited repeatedly to circumvent lawful scrutiny. The judiciary remains alert to the evolving modalities of trafficking and fraud that leverage emerging technologies—a recognition underscored in recent decisions such as R v. Greer [2025] EWCA Crim 586.

It is also pertinent to mention that the investigative teams conducted covert surveillance lasting over three months, including use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology, closed-circuit television (CCTV), and thermal imaging cameras mounted on police drones. One such operation involved overnight monitoring of the River Tame embankment at Aston, capturing footage of Mr H engaged in suspicious activity consistent with reconnaissance of potential target sites.

Regarding personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age and holds a Bachelor of Engineering, obtained with upper-second class honours from a university in the West Midlands. His former employer, Midlands Advanced Machinery Ltd., provided a reference noting his diligence and technical ability, but also remarked on his abrupt termination following a dispute over data protection compliance. The company is currently cooperating with police, providing logs indicating periods where Mr H accessed proprietary documents without authorisation.

Letters of support from community groups, such as the Handsworth Harvesters Gardening Collective, describe Mr H’s contributions to local urban green spaces, including sustainable planting initiatives. While such activities are to be commended, their effect in mitigation is necessarily constrained in light of the conviction evidence. The court also notes a letter from the Evening Star Youth Club thanking Mr H for mentoring adolescents in drone-building workshops.

Mental health assessments conducted by Dr Naveed Qureshi, consultant forensic psychiatrist, report no formal diagnosis of psychiatric illness but identify traits of cognitive rigidity, marked social isolation, and a tendency towards absolutist beliefs. These are noted in the broader assessment of risk, together with observations from probation practitioners regarding Mr H’s sporadic engagement with voluntary support schemes.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The sentencing assessment acknowledges the high risk of serious harm posed by Mr H, particularly in view of his engineering skills and continued ideological commitment. The court has been provided with a detailed pre-sentence report commissioned from the West Midlands Probation Service and specialist input from the Birmingham Regional Counter-Terrorism Unit. The report advises that, without intensive supervision and intervention, there remains a substantial risk that Mr H would engage in further extremist conduct.

Defence counsel have advanced proposals for enrolment in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). While such initiatives offer potential avenues for rehabilitation, it must be emphasised that completion rates vary, and successful reintegration requires constant, multidisciplinary oversight. As the Sentencing Council notes, rehabilitation is an important aim but cannot be allowed to supersede the primary imperatives of deterrence and protection.

It is necessary to address the impact of public perceptions and community sensitivities. Submissions made on behalf of local faith organisations caution against disproportionately severe sentencing that might exacerbate feelings of alienation within minority populations. The court recognises the validity of these concerns but remains bound to administer justice without favour or fear, ensuring community safety above all else. The rule of law is the cornerstone of societal cohesion.

This case exemplifies the challenges of contemporary counter-terrorism work: balancing the need for robust enforcement with respect for individual rights; harnessing technological tools without undermining civil liberties; and providing meaningful opportunities for disengagement without compromising public safety. All those engaged in the numerous agencies involved merit recognition for their professionalism and resolve, particularly given the sustained pressures and stretched resources observed across criminal justice and mental health services.

This court directs that a final pre-sentence report be prepared addressing the feasibility of an extended custodial sentence with ancillary licence conditions including electronic monitoring, restricted internet access, and ongoing psychological evaluation. It should explore possibilities of placement within a specialist high-security prison estate equipped with counter-radicalisation programming, and the capacity of approved premises to manage terrorist risk categories. Probation should further assess the viability of introducing GPS-enabled exclusion zones and polygraph testing.

Careful consideration must also be given to post-release supervision frameworks under multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), noting national concerns with capacity, information sharing, and inter-agency coordination. These procedural elements are crucial to the ongoing management of risk in this sensitive cohort.

Finally, the court expresses gratitude to Ms Sarah Milton, counsel for the Crown, and to Mr Daniel Trent, instructed for the defence under Legal Aid. While delays caused in part by administrative difficulties within the Legal Aid Agency were regrettable, both advocates conducted their roles with professional dedication.

These sentencing remarks are delivered this 17th day of October 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. A full transcript is recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his statutory right of appeal to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division within 28 days of sentencing, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 engaged by these proceedings. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
