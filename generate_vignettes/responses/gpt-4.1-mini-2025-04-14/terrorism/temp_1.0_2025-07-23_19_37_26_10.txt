IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/32941  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. RENAUD  
Filed: 12 August 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, relating to engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for possession of an article for purposes connected with the commission of terrorism. The offending conduct is found to have occurred from approximately September 2022 through to the defendant’s arrest in March 2025.

Procedurally, the case has traversed a somewhat protracted path. Following the defendant’s arrest shortly after 04:00 hours on 15 March 2025 pursuant to warrants executed at his residence in Edgbaston by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTP WM), the matter was initially listed for plea and case management hearing on 23 April 2025. Those first hearings were adjourned twice to accommodate further forensic disclosure, notably digital forensics involving encrypted data recovery. It was only at a subsequent hearing on 17 June 2025 that Mr H indicated a not guilty plea, maintaining this stance through the initial stages of disclosure. The jury was empanelled on 26 July 2025, and only on the morning of the trial scheduled to commence on 5 August 2025 did the defendant enter guilty pleas to all counts.  

The late plea has obvious implications for discount in sentencing credit, which the court will address in due course. To that end, the Crown has placed before the court voluminous exhibits consisting of intercepted communications, electronic device analyses, expert witness reports, and a chronology compiled by the investigating officers. Defence counsel have submitted mitigating material including a personal statement, correspondence from community groups, and mental health assessments.

It is appropriate to place these facts within the broader operational and legal framework. The counter-terrorism function within the United Kingdom has undergone significant evolution since the Terrorism Act 2006 was enacted, particularly as the nature of threat has developed from centrally planned conspiracies to more decentralised, “lone actor” or “self-starter” phenomena. The present prosecution reflects that trend. As held in R v. Shahzad [2016] EWCA Crim 1018, the breadth of “preparation” encompasses acts beyond direct plotting; the conduct must nonetheless manifest a clear intention and capability to advance terrorism.

Prior to the hearing today, extensive forensic input was received. The National Counter Terrorism Digital Forensics Unit (NCTDFU) provided evidence after months of painstaking recovery of deleted files from multiple devices. Notably, the devices included encrypted virtual machines, which complicated analysis due to layers of masking and anti-forensic measures. The court acknowledges the contribution of the digital analysts, who operate under considerable pressure and resource constraints, particularly at a time when the backlog of digital devices awaiting triage across the UK police forces exceeds 20,000. This limits the speed by which investigations can proceed, influencing the timeliness of justice.

The court also notes with appreciation the detailed reports from the West Midlands Prevent Coordinators, who first made initial referrals concerning Mr H in early 2021 following concerns raised by an academic tutor regarding radical material on social media profiles. Although those concerns did not culminate in Channel intervention, given Mr H’s then limited engagement and absence of imminent risk, the referral evidenced early recognition of the risk window Mr H occupied. It is a regrettable but accepted reality that not all such referrals advance to formal programmes. This does not diminish the value of early detection or the continuing refinement of Prevent policy frameworks.

Equally, the court registers alongside its procedural observations a sombre reflection on the systemic pressures that pervade community mental health services. The forensic psychiatric assessment ordered by the court, consisting of reports from Dr Lydia Hotham and Dr Rajiv Naik, was delayed by some five months due to capacity issues within the NHS forensic psychiatry services. Waiting lists for tier four psychiatric evaluations are known to be lengthy; this limitation must be factored into consideration of both procedural efficiency and the adequacy of responses to complex cases involving ideological risk.

The plea and case management hearing on 17 June 2025 yielded particulars of the Crown case and a timetable for trial. Defence indicated the need for additional expert psychiatric evidence and listed witnesses drawn from the field of counter-extremism studies. The challenges inherent in these hearings include balancing the defendant’s rights with public safety and managing sensitive disclosures, particularly where intelligence sources or methodologies are implicated. The robust engagement of counsel ensured a clear framework for trial, which the court acknowledges as a mark of professional diligence.

Discussions pertaining to sentencing credit for late pleas have been well traversed in recent jurisprudence. The Court of Appeal decisions in R v. Kambon [2024] EWCA Crim 1576 and R v. Delaire [2023] EWCA Crim 1342 provide guidance that where a defendant pleads guilty only once the trial is imminent, the customary reduction for guilty plea must be curtailed to reflect the marginal savings in court time and the impacts on witnesses. There is a growing judicial impatience with strategic delay masquerading as contrition. While the law rightly encourages early admission of guilt, it does not envisage a system abused as a mechanism to defer sentencing advantages.

The defendant’s written submissions assert a degree of remorse, emphasising regret for the consequences his actions may have had on community cohesion. Letters tendered from neighbours and community social clubs attest to periods of constructive local engagement, including volunteering at a community allotment scheme and involvement with the Edgbaston Youth Arts Project. While such efforts are, naturally, to be acknowledged, they stand in uneasy contrast to the gravity of the offences of which Mr H stands convicted.

The court is mindful of a related point arising from the trial: co-defendants in associated investigatory strands have faced charges for distinct offences, including possession of bladed articles in a school car park and an unrelated charge of benefit fraud by a third-party relative. These matters, while perhaps germane to contextual understanding, do not bear directly upon Mr H’s culpability and ought not to factor into sentencing calibration save accordingly.

The complexity of digital evidence in modern terrorism trials is well illustrated in this case. Investigators relied upon overlays of data drawn from public transport smartcard metadata, encrypted messaging services, and open source intelligence platforms. The trial also revealed intriguing manifestations of ordinary hobbies intersecting with the offence landscape: a collection of model railway paraphernalia found in Mr H’s bedroom served as a locus for exchanges with interlocutors flagged for ideological extremism. One participant in the investigation found this convergence “both mundane and chilling,” underscoring the hybrid nature of radicalised identities.

It is a regrettable commonality that offences under the Terrorism Acts often intersect tangentially with other criminal acts within complex networks. In this instance, the co-defendant charged with criminal damage to a church noticeboard during protests unrelated directly to Mr H’s conduct surrendered to authorities during trial proceedings. Another co-defendant remained at large after an incident of fly-tipping on green belt land. These details illustrate the wider ecosystem in which radicalised activity occurs but do not diminish the individual accountability of the defendant.

A notable procedural feature has been the recurrent delays occasioned by Legal Aid Agency resource shortfalls. The court records its frustration that counsel for the defence, despite prompt application, encountered delays exceeding six weeks before being remunerated for expert reports commissioned, a delay that threatened to disrupt the continuum of capable representation. These systemic challenges are symptomatic of broader underfunding impacting the justice sector, negatively affecting defendants’ rights and the court’s pace.

Considerations regarding mental health and risk have been prominent. The pre-sentence report supplemented by a specialist psychiatric risk assessment concludes that while Mr H does not manifest formal psychotic disorder, there exists a persistent ideological rigidity and obsessive-compulsive tendencies related to his extremist beliefs. The report notes, quoting Dr Naik directly, that “Mr H presents with elevated risk of recidivism unless subjected to tightly controlled interventions including cognitive restructuring and supervised social contact.” The limitations of voluntary de-radicalisation programmes, such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), are candidly acknowledged in the literature and repeated in probation submissions.

The Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Level 3 group convened regular case reviews in this matter. Their coordination across Probation, CT Policing, NHS Forensic Psychiatry, and Local Authority risk panels demonstrated institutional resilience, though the court remains concerned about continued resource scarcity leading to potential risk gaps upon the defendant’s release.

The court also notes with disappointment reports from a local probation officer involved earlier in the defendant’s supervision, who was subsequently arrested on separate charges of corruption unrelated to Mr H. While unconnected, the disruption speaks to the vulnerabilities within offender management systems, complicating risk oversight.

On the subject of international travel, the prosecution outlined multiple trips undertaken by Mr H in the months preceding arrest, including a return flight to Brussels in February 2024 ostensibly for academic conferences. Notably, surveillance identified contacts with individuals subsequently convicted for importing wholesale quantities of Class A drugs via parcel freight. While the drug offences pertain to other parties and are not attributable to Mr H, their mention illustrates the tangled nexus of criminal and extremist milieus. These complexities underscore the challenges inherent in disentangling ideological offending from broader criminality.

The prosecution further highlighted digital evidence of encrypted communications referencing materials suppressed in various national counter-terrorism databases. The defendant’s engagement with these materials—from incendiary manifestos to explosive device assembly instructions—evinces a troubling commitment to violent ideation. This is not mitigated by collateral artefacts such as Mr H’s possession of gardening tools or locally brewed elderflower wine, which defence counsel cited in support of an argument for “ordinary hobbies” but was rejected as irrelevant to culpability.

Financial investigations disclosed a chain of cryptocurrency transfers from wallets linked to the defendant’s known aliases to accounts associated with darknet vendors. Notably, a transaction valued at approximately £3,200 was traced through a cryptocurrency “tumbler” service designed to obfuscate origin and destination. This financial conduct, while technically sophisticated, is illustrative of contemporary challenges law enforcement faces in countering the funding of terrorism. The opacity of blockchain technology complicates transparency; it demands a level of cyber-investigative acumen that, regrettably, is in short supply across many jurisdictions.

The court recognises that these financial dealings straddle the line between legitimate technology use and illicit ends, a tension reflected in governmental reports on cryptocurrency regulation. Legislative efforts persist, yet the fluidity and innovation within crypto ecosystem continually outpace statutory responses. This technological asymmetry underlies not just problems of enforcement but also difficulties in sentencing, where gain or loss from such transactions may be indirect or intangible.

Turning now to Mr H’s personal circumstances. He is 32 years old, educated to postgraduate level in electronic engineering, with no previous convictions. He formally resigned from a position as a research analyst at a local telecommunications firm in late 2022 following a contested disciplinary inquiry concerning Internet usage policies. Letters submitted describe him as “meticulous, reserved, and occasionally socially withdrawn,” with regular attendance at a local mosque and volunteer work assisting elderly community members with digital literacy.

The prosecution drew attention to reports submitted by the East Midlands Resettlement Organisation, which provide risk assessment and intervention suggestions in respect of cases upon release from custody. They note heavy caseloads and limited financial resources constraining long-term monitoring, emphasising the necessity of structured community measures to mitigate residual risk. The court echoes these concerns, acknowledging the fragile state of post-custodial frameworks and the attendant public safety imperative.

The court also recognises the input provided by community strategic bodies such as the Birmingham Council for Counter-Extremism Engagement, whose correspondence portrays a nuanced understanding of ideological radicalisation pathways and stresses the value of coordinated multi-sector partnerships in prevention and containment. Their observations include reference to challenges faced in engaging reluctant individuals and the variable success rates of intervention programmes.

Professor Helen Stanners, a consultant forensic psychologist specialising in terrorist offending, opines that Mr H exhibits traits of cognitive inflexibility and “moral absolutism,” accompanied by a high propensity for justifying violence through a selective interpretation of religious doctrines. The report assigns a high likelihood of reoffending absent intensive monitoring and structured interventions. These assessments are drawn from multiple interviews, psychometric testing, and collateral information. The court acknowledges the careful and professionally rigorous nature of the psychological evaluation.

It is worth reiterating that while rehabilitation and disengagement remain paramount aims of the criminal justice system, public safety is the overarching priority in cases of this nature. The sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in 2023 expressly categorise offences involving terrorist preparation as requiring sentences aligned with protection of the public and deterrence, particularly where the intended acts could cause indiscriminate harm.

Mitigation is modest. It comprises the absence of prior convictions, the defendant’s educational attainment, a degree of remorse expressed following his plea, and indications of possible future compliance if conditions for release include strict supervision and psychological support.

The aggravating factors are pronounced: the defendant’s conduct involved sustained planning over an extended period, the use of advanced technical means to conceal activities, and evidence of intention to cause mass casualties. These elevate the matter to the highest culpability tier within the Sentencing Council’s guidance matrix.

The late pleas, whilst welcome, come only at a point when the trial was imminent and do not significantly spare court resources or reduce victim distress; accordingly, the permitted reduction in sentence for these pleas is limited to one-sixth.

The court directs the preparation of a pre-sentence report addressing the viability of an Extended Determinate Sentence, considering High Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) tailored to ideologically motivated offenders, the practicality of Restricted Internet Access Orders, and suitability for accommodation in approved premises with secure electronic monitoring. The report should include input from the National Counter Terrorism Prisons Unit to assess custodial management prospects.

These sentencing remarks are delivered on this day, 12 August 2025, in Court 11 of the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been transcribed under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules for the official record. The defendant is advised of his statutory right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
