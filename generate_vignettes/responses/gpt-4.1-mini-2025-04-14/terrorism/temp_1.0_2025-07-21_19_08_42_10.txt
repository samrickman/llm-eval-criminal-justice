IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/32654  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. T. McALLISTER  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on multiple counts arising under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count of preparing acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is alleged to have taken place between September 2023 and the defendant's arrest in April 2025.

The defendant was detained at 07:43 on 14 April 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). The warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 following receipt of covert intelligence indicating substantial traffic between encrypted messaging applications attributable to Mr H, including the transmission of digital materials consistent with instructional manuals deemed of extremist intent by the Security Service. Devices seized included two laptop computers, multiple USB storage devices, and an assortment of electronic components.

The operation leading to the arrest involved a cross-agency task force incorporating CTPSW intelligence analysts, forensic IT specialists from the National Digital Crime Unit, and coordination with the National Crime Agency's cyber division. Over a period of eleven weeks, targeted surveillance and network monitoring, authorised by Judicial Commissioner Defence Orders, provided compelling evidence of the defendant's engagement in preparatory planning. The complexity of decrypting intermittent packets of communications necessitated innovative analytic techniques derived from recent computational linguistics research.

The administrative proceedings that followed were not without difficulty. Initial bail applications were resisted due to the serious nature of the charges and the assessed risk of flight. Two hearings were adjourned owing to delays in the provision of full case material by the Crown; these delays, while unfortunate, were attributed in large part to the volume of digital evidence requiring redaction for security reasons. Correspondence from the Bristol Legal Aid Office reveals significant challenges in securing timely representation for the defendant, compounded by an ongoing shortage of barristers experienced in terrorism-related defence work.

It is noteworthy that the defendant's first indication of intention to plead guilty did not emerge until the day before trial, raising complex questions as to the appropriate extent of sentencing credit. The Court of Appeal’s jurisprudence in R v. Lawson [2019] EWCA Crim 1234 establishes the principle that credit for a guilty plea is inherently discretionary and diminishes in proportion to the delay in admission, particularly where the delay occasions unnecessary disruption and increased burden on the court and witnesses.

In R v. Renshaw [2022] EWCA Crim 2113, a case involving offences broader in scope than the present matter, the Court emphasised that a plea entered immediately prior to trial must be scrutinised carefully to ensure that the mitigation reflects genuine remorse rather than tactical expediency. Counsel for the defence has argued that Mr H’s delayed plea should attract a moderate discount owing to personal circumstances and ongoing engagement with a variety of support services. The Crown, however, submits that the late nature of the admission and the consequent strain on the prosecution justify limited reduction.

Several ancillary matters arose during pre-trial proceedings. The court received extensive correspondence from the Easton Riverside Support Group, a charitable organisation involved in community resilience work, who detailed their experience of working with individuals vulnerable to ideological radicalisation. They conveyed concerns over the limited funding available to sustain such initiatives, and underscored the broader socio-political imperative to bolster preventative interventions in localities subject to higher rates of radicalisation.

This case is heard in the context of contemporaneous police operations targeting a cohort associated tangentially with Mr H. Among co-defendants, one is currently subject to a bench warrant following failure to appear, though it is emphatically clarified in the evidence that the actions of that individual are not attributable to Mr H. Indeed, it is vital to maintain precise focus on the defendant before this court without conflating separate lines of inquiry and offending.

Reference must also be made to the evolving statutory framework underpinning terrorism sentencing. The Terrorism Act 2006 has undergone amendments since its inception, with the Sentencing Council's revised guidelines of 2023 reflecting current judicial attitudes toward culpability and harm. The guidance directs courts to weigh factors such as the defendant's level of planning sophistication, targeted audience, potential for mass harm, and motivation—whether ideological or personal grievance.

The digital trail left by the defendant illuminates a gradual but deliberate intensification of extremist material engagement. An encrypted blog under a pseudonym traced to Mr H's verified IP addresses evolved from innocuous political commentary to increasingly radical manifestos citing foreign insurgency movements. This trajectory aligns with known markers of radicalisation identified in psychological and sociological studies presented during sentencing.

A volume of encrypted files uncovered on digital media included instructions for the manufacture of explosive devices and the acquisition of controlled substances from unregulated sources. Defence counsel urged that possession of incomplete files and corrupted documents should temper findings of intent, but this court concurs with the Crown's argument that the context and combination of materials evince a clear preparatory purpose.

Digital forensic examination also disentangled code snippets hosted in publicly accessible repositories which, though obfuscated, were linked with projects attributed to designated terrorist groups overseas. The prosecution adduced expert witness testimony to confirm the forensic methodologies employed, including hash validation and timestamp correlation, defeating claims of innocent interest or mere academic curiosity.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

The defence proffered a narrative that some of the recovered items were artefacts of a hobbyist interest in pyrotechnics and electronics. However, this explanation falters against the backdrop of the defendant's contact with known facilitators and deliberate use of encrypted communication platforms designed to evade detection.

In considering the defendant's prior criminal record, it is noted that he has no previous convictions for either violent or non-violent offences. One addendum to the defence mitigation disclosed a 2017 fine for shoplifting minor goods from a convenience store, specifically alcohol and toiletries, which bore no relevance to the present serious offences and did not denote a pattern of criminality. Nevertheless, the court duly acknowledges this ancillary history, as is the practice in comprehensive sentencing analysis.

The defendant’s social history highlights a period of residence in a supported accommodation project administered by Bristol Housing Support Services during 2020. Reports from the probation officer supervising that placement indicated compliance with regulation but intermittent attendance to counselling sessions. The accommodation provider is currently subject to a noise abatement notice owing to alleged disturbances unrelated to Mr H's tenancy.

Travel records presented to the court reveal that Mr H undertook a brief visit to Lisbon in July 2024, purportedly for attendance at an academic conference on renewable energy. CCTV and immigration records disclose that he also visited the suburban district of Amadora, coinciding temporally with an unrelated investigative operation into firearms trafficking. Defence submissions assert coincidence, yet the prosecution presented intercepted communications during that period suggestive of exploratory contact with individuals involved in illicit commerce. While the court notes the travel in itself is not criminal, it forms part of the evidential mosaic indicating preparedness and intent.

It is both routine and necessary to observe the range of institutional actors engaged throughout this case. The involvement of the National Health Service forensic psychiatric teams was requested to provide assessment reports concerning the defendant’s mental state and potential risk. Dr Susan Blewett's report was detailed and professionally executed, concluding no significant psychiatric diagnosis requiring treatment but highlighting cognitive inflexibility and susceptibility to ideological absolutism.

It is unfortunate that Mental Health Services nationally continue to grapple with capacity constraints and protracted waiting lists, a circumstance noted in the recent Parliamentary Health Committee report of May 2025. The implications for individuals labelled as at risk of radicalisation are profound — interventions may be delayed or hindered, thereby frustrating early deradicalisation efforts.

Financial forensics yielded evidence of cryptocurrency transactions amounting to a total of £3,490 moving through several tumbling services before linkage to vendors specialised in dual-use chemicals. The use of cryptocurrency in this context is emblematic of a troubling trend in obscuring terrorism financing, as outlined in the Home Office’s latest Financial Crime Bulletin. Such financial opacity complicates enforcement efforts and underscores the need for comprehensive technological and legislative countermeasures.

The defence sought to characterise these transactions as innocuous transfers related to online gaming currencies and unrelated commercial purchases. However, the weight of forensic evidence establishes a clear nexus with procurement of materials of concern.

It is worth remarking on the diligent work of the counter-terrorism policing team, who face ongoing challenges in reconciling operational priorities with finite staffing resources. The Bristol Metropolitan Police's recent annual report flags a 22% increase in non-terrorist “low-harm” public order incidents, which diverts frontline officers from specialist assignments.

The court also records its gratitude to the court ushers and administrative staff, whose assistance in managing the complex listing and security arrangements inherent to cases of this nature has been exemplary. The layout of the courtroom itself, refurbished earlier this year, reflects a modern approach to facilitating both open justice and witness protection.

Turning to the defendant's personal circumstances, he is aged 28 and holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from a regional university. His former employer described him in a character reference as “methodical and reliable, though somewhat socially withdrawn.” The employment relationship ended abruptly in 2023 following concerns about unauthorised access to company servers.

Aside from these professional notes, the defendant’s familial circumstances include ongoing contact with his mother and younger sister, the latter having provided a written personal statement to the court outlining her hopes for rehabilitation. Charitable organisations such as the Bristol Community Integration Project have also submitted dated correspondence commending Mr H’s limited voluntary involvement in local environmental clean-up initiatives during 2021 and 2022.

Such positive engagements, while commendable, must be weighed carefully against the gravity of the offences. They neither excuse nor neutralise premeditated planning to cause mass harm.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The psychological assessment concludes that although Mr H exhibits no formal mental disorder, he presents elevated risk indicators including ideological fixity and low amenability to rehabilitation in the absence of intensive intervention. These factors contribute to a high risk of public harm as measured on standardised forensic instruments.

Defence counsel advocates for inclusion in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, describing it as an evidence-based path to fostering disengagement from extremist ideology. While the court acknowledges the value of such a programme, it must be observed that completion rates remain guarded, and success is far from guaranteed.

In mitigation, Mr H has no recorded previous convictions, has educational qualifications of a high standard, and has offered late guilty pleas which, while welcomed, materially reduce the extent of credit available. Aggravating factors include the sophistication of planning, the intention to cause indiscriminate harm, and the use of encrypted technologies to conceal offending.

In considering sentence, the court directs the preparation of an extensive pre-sentence report. The probation service is tasked with exploring options including cognitive restructuring interventions, close supervision under MAPPA Category 3, address verification through electronic monitoring, and liaison with the local Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC).

It is imperative that the report address possible accommodation pathways post-release, including approved premises with tailored security arrangements. Consideration should be given to licence conditions restricting internet access and requiring participation in specialist deradicalisation programming provided by accredited forensic psychologists.

This sentencing hearing has proceeded in open court with all parties duly present. I record my thanks to Ms Jennifer Maloney for the Crown and Mr Daniel Pritchard for the defence. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

I reserve sentence until the pre-sentence report is received and any further representations have been made. The date for sentencing is fixed provisionally for 9 October 2025.

These are the orders of the court.
