IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/25694  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. W. Grant  
Filed: 16 October 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges including one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The prosecutorial timeline outlines conduct spanning from September 2022 until his arrest in February 2025.  

The defendant was first taken into custody at 04:45 on 12 February 2025 following the execution of a warrant at a residential property on Elm Crescent, Bristol. This warrant was authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The investigative impetus stemmed from a lengthy Security Service operation, which uncovered increased communication traffic linked to foreign-hosted extremist forums. The executed warrant recovered an array of digital devices, including encrypted smartphones, portable hard drives, and materials consistent with bomb-making manuals.

This case is emblematic of the modern complexities faced by counter-terrorism agencies. The investigation required an extensive collaboration between Counter Terrorism Policing South West, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Digital Forensics Lab at Avon and Somerset Constabulary. Particularly noteworthy was the reliance on advanced decryption efforts and the painstaking piecing together of a virtual timeline, bridging virtual communication and physical movement. This, of course, severely taxed technical resources amidst a background of growing caseloads in cyber-enabled investigations. The volume of forensic data — amounting to close to two terabytes of extracted content — necessitated the mobilisation of a specialist digital swathe team, whose core function is to triage encrypted digital evidence for operational relevance.  

During the pre-trial procedural stages, the court noted delays precipitated in part by the need for judicial warrants authorising the disclosure of proprietary encryption keys held by telecommunications providers. The Legal Aid Agency’s administrative inefficiencies compounded this delay. Defence counsel’s legitimate requests for independent forensic expertise were hampered by protracted authorisation processes, thereby affecting preparatory timelines. Such obstacles, while regrettable, highlight systemic challenges in balancing the rights of the accused against expedited justice in matters of significant public safety.  

A Prevent referral had been initiated in autumn 2021 when Mr H was a student at the local technical college; this arose after a psychology lecturer observed writings containing extremist themes. The Channel programme panel convened on two occasions; however, the referral was discontinued due to a lack of substantive risk indicators at the time. The court must remind stakeholders that Channel referrals, whilst a critical tool, are not linear predictors of future offending. The inherent uncertainties surrounding radicalisation trajectories continue to challenge preventive frameworks nationwide.  

At the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 21 August 2025, Mr H maintained pleas of not guilty to all counts. It was not until the morning of the substantive sentencing hearing on 16 October 2025 that he amended his pleas to guilty. The lateness of his admission necessarily tempers the level of credit this court is prepared to afford. As reiterated in R v. Denholm [2022] EWCA Crim 1895, while credit for a guilty plea can materially reduce the punitive element of sentencing, such credit presupposes early and sincere acceptance of responsibility. Guilty pleas entered after the extensive mobilisation of court and prosecutorial resources, and after substantial witness preparation, merit a significantly reduced discount.  

Historical context provides further guidance on this principle. In the well-known decision of R v. Cartwright [2021] EWCA Crim 1432, the Court of Appeal reiterated that a plea entered only after the failure of the defence case, particularly in the face of incontrovertible evidence, is unlikely to demonstrate genuine remorse aimed at sparing witnesses the ordeal of trial. The court looks askance at tactical late pleas offered solely as a matter of expedient case management.

Supporting the Crown’s case in the present matter were intercepted communications corroborated by linguistic and behavioural analysis that demonstrated a progressive adoption of radical ideologies. Records reflect the defendant’s digital footprint through online forums notorious for promoting violent extremism. These communications occurred under pseudonymous aliases, require sophisticated cyber-intelligence interpretation, and indicate attempts to procure materials with dual-use potential.  

It is pertinent to recognise a red herring introduced during defence submissions regarding the defendant’s possession of a collection of antique computing hardware, including a functioning ZX Spectrum and vintage modems. While some might speculate this hobby as an innocent eccentricity, the court, following detailed examination, concluded such artifacts bear no evidentiary significance regarding the gravamen of the charges. Indeed, the presence of such items speaks more to a nostalgic interest than relevant intent or capability.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The prosecution’s forensic digital analysis revealed Mr H’s possession of encrypted archives stored under innocuous titles such as “Holiday_Photos_2023” and “Project_Backup.” Within these files were documents detailing explosive device schematics and methods of circumvention of security screening. Such possession, coupled with the defendant's prior travels, as will be discussed further, forms a cogent pattern of preparatory conduct with a real risk of catastrophic outcomes. Defence counsel sought to portray these files as mere research undertaken for academic curiosity, referencing a history dissertation undertaken by Mr H during the period. This argument, however, was not supported by the forensic timeline indicating active, contemporaneous editing and sharing with known extremists.  

Recognising the importance of precedent, it is useful to note the analogues drawn with R v. Faraday [2023] EWCA Crim 1031. In Faraday, the court considered possession of dual-use documents alongside verified preparatory acts as elevating culpability, notwithstanding lack of actual deployment. The court here respectfully concurs that possession alone, where contextualised by intention and communication, warrants severe reprobation and substantial custodial sentencing.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Turning to ancillary matters, the court was informed of the defendant’s prior non-terrorism related offending, consisting of a charge of criminal damage in 2019 for defacing a parish church noticeboard with slogans unrelated to his current ideological beliefs. This youthful indiscretion, though unrelated and minor, was raised during mitigation as reflective of a non-violent temperament. Such submissions are noted but carry limited weight in the context of the present offences. It bears mention that co-defendants in associated proceedings included a Mr C. who was permissibly convicted of affray at a licensed premises, an episode unrelated to Mr H beyond logistical connection through communication channels. No inference may be drawn from these disparate charges to the defendant’s conduct.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Of considerable note is the defendant’s travel history during the material period. Flight manifests confirm Mr H undertook a weekend trip to Brussels in March 2024, ostensibly for a cultural exchange programme. CCTV footage from a metropolitan railway station shows a significant delay en route to the airport, during which time he was observed conversing with an individual subsequently apprehended abroad with a cache of explosives. The court finds the defence’s suggestion of innocuous meeting devoid of persuasive evidence. The prosecution's depiction of the meeting as a nexus in the wider supply chain is supported by intercepts indicating encrypted communications following the encounter.  

The court also acknowledges administrative correspondence from the Bristol Probation Office dated 5 September 2025, which highlighted persistent difficulties in allocating resources for management of cases involving extremist ideologies. The burgeoning caseload and staff shortages have, regrettably, limited the availability of tailored cognitive behavioural programmes. These structural deficiencies serve as a sobering reminder of the complexities inherent in rehabilitative provision in cases of this nature.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial investigations unearthed a series of cryptocurrency transactions from a wallet linked via digital forensic analysis to Mr H’s known email aliases. The sum of £3,750 was transferred incrementally to a darknet marketplace vendor specialising in dual-use chemicals. Prosecution experts emphasised the lack of legitimate commercial rationale for these transactions and their alignment with a known procurement pattern for device synthesis. The use of such anonymised payment channels underscores the defendant’s deliberate operational security mindset and sophistication, escalating the severity of his culpability.  

While digital currency presents challenges to law enforcement, this court notes legislative efforts embodied in the Financial Services and Markets Bill 2024, which seek enhanced powers for tracing and seizure. Despite these advances, prosecutorial efforts remain resource intensive, and the justice system contends with continuing evolutions in criminal financial methodologies.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Addressing personal circumstances relevant to mitigation, Mr H is currently aged 31, with unblemished health save for a longstanding diagnosis of mild Asperger’s Syndrome, as documented in a clinical report supplied by Dr Farah Khalid, consultant psychiatrist. This report describes Mr H as “intellectually gifted but demonstrating pronounced social communication difficulties and obsessive tendencies.” Moreover, while no formal mental illness is diagnosed, the report cautions that Mr H "exhibits an unusual capacity for moral absolutism and cognitive rigidity," factors which may reduce responsiveness to standard rehabilitative programming but do not diminish culpability.  

Letters of support were tendered from Eastville Community Gardening Project, where Mr H participated intermittently over two years. These letters, while commendable in highlighting a measure of positive community engagement, cannot overshadow the prevailing risk evidenced by the case facts. Additionally, the court notes a character reference from a former employer praising Mr H’s meticulous approach to mechanical design work but flagging concerns following his abrupt resignation amid a workplace disciplinary matter unrelated to the charged offences. The broader implications of employment instability are acknowledged but remain peripheral to sentencing considerations.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The accompanying psychiatric report concludes a high risk of serious harm remains without intensive supervision and structured intervention following release. Specifically, the specialist forensic psychologist, Dr Amira Daniels, emphasises Mr H’s entrenched ideological beliefs and the attendant risk of recidivism, recommending Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements Category 3 supervision should release be considered. The report also highlights limited engagement with previous deradicalisation offers, including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), underscoring the challenges of fostering genuine disengagement.  

It is necessary to reflect briefly on the jurisprudential foundations of sentencing in terrorism offences. Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 carries penalties extending up to life imprisonment, recognising the societal gravity of preparatory conduct proximate to terrorist acts. The Sentencing Council’s Guidelines on Terrorism (2023) direct courts to calibrate sentences on parameters of culpability, risk, and harm. Judicial authority, including the Supreme Court’s guidance in R v. Abu Qashem [2019] UKSC 87, affirms the primacy of deterrence and public protection. This court neither deviates from nor diminishes these principles.  

In considering principles elaborated in R v. Al-Saleh [2024] EWCA Crim 72—the “Marathon Bomber” appeal answered the balance between proportionality and denunciation—the Court was emphatic that sentences imposed must “reflect society’s abhorrence of violent political extremism while preserving individual rights through procedural fairness.” This dual charge directs the court’s sentencing exercise.  

In light of the late guilty pleas, the court affords Mr H a reduced discount of one-tenth from the applicable custodial term. Early pleas afford a significantly greater concession; such, however, cannot be counted when pleadings are delayed until after protracted pre-trial procedures and considerable preparatory expense.  

Given the highly technical nature of the evidence and the multidimensional risk factors present, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. This report is to address not only punishative sentencing options but also an assessment of rehabilitative prospects, risk management through probation oversight, and potential accommodation within approved premises. The inclusion of extended monitoring conditions such as electronic tagging and restrictive internet access should be considered, with contributions from the Multi-Agency Case Management Group (MAPPA Category 3).  

The court explicitly requests the adult offender management service to consider the feasibility of high-intensity cognitive interventions tailored to ideological extremism, as well as pharmacological assistance if clinically indicated. The pros and cons of integration into the national DDP scheme must be contained in the report, along with an informed appraisal of Mr H’s capacity to engage with such frameworks.  

This matter has been delayed somewhat by external factors, including national courthouse refurbishment works and intermittent strike action affecting legal representatives and court officers. The court acknowledges and thanks all practitioners involved, including Ms Ayesha Nasser representing the Crown and Mr Theo Armstrong for the defence. Their undertakings, conducted with diligence amidst challenging circumstances, merit formal appreciation.  

Correspondence from the Legal Aid Agency dated 30 September 2025 confirms funding authorisation for the attendance of independent forensic psychiatry expert witnesses, although ongoing administrative pressure threatens similar authorisations in future cases. It is a matter of systemic concern that the justice process is vulnerable to budgetary constraints, which in cases of such public interest ought to be immune from arbitrary curtailment.  

The court notes further observations regarding the strain on public services broadly. Recent annual reports from the National Probation Service reveal persistent undercapacity, with frontline staff vacancies running at a national average of 18%. This inevitably impacts the supervision quality for high-risk cases, including those sentenced under terrorism legislation. Equally, NHS adult forensic psychiatric services report waiting times for specialist assessments extending into months, a delay incompatible with the prompt delivery of justice and risk management expected in such sensitive matters.  

It is beyond the scope of this hearing to address such systemic issues in full; nevertheless, the court reiterates the necessity of sustained governmental investment in these vital public safety infrastructures. Failure to do so risks weakening the efficacy of judicial sentences designed to protect the public at large.  

Today's sentencing hearing has proceeded openly, with all participants present. I record my gratitude to Ms Nasser and Mr Armstrong for their submissions, evidence presentation, and professionalism throughout. The court also acknowledges the work of probation officers engaged with Mr H both pre- and post-arrest, whose reports have informed this sentencing exercise.  

The maximum penalty available for the principal offence is life imprisonment. In calibrating sentence, this court is guided unequivocally by the need for adequate punishment reflective of culpability and risk, meaningful deterrence both specific and general, and the imperative of public protection. Mitigation exists solely in the absence of prior convictions, academic attainment, and belatedly entered guilty pleas, which nonetheless attract limited credit.  

The offending in this case was characterised by a high degree of planning, operational security, and mobilisation of specialised knowledge. The intended harm was indiscriminate, aimed at maximising civilian suffering and societal disruption. No mistake must be made in minimising the consequences or the threat posed by such conduct.  

I shall therefore adjourn final sentence until receipt of the pre-sentence report, which the probation service is directed to compile with urgency. The report must address custodial and post-release arrangements, psychological and ideological risk, and potential rehabilitative engagement. It should consider extended determinate sentencing options as authorised by updated provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Terrorism Act 2006.  

These sentencing remarks are pronounced this day, 16 October 2025, in Court 4 at Bristol Crown Court. The hearing has been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record will be forwarded to the appropriate registries and authorities for reflection and action. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal the eventual sentence within 28 days of pronouncement under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are presently engaged. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
