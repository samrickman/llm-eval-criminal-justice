IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/30942  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. D. LAMBERT  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges stem from events spanning the period from March 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in January 2025.

The procedural history of the case is extensive, reflecting the complexity frequently encountered in counter-terrorism prosecutions. Initially remanded in custody following his arrest on 22 January 2025, Mr H subsequently applied for bail on three separate occasions. These applications were refused due to assessed risk factors and intelligence indicating ongoing radical involvement. The hearing was further delayed owing to the late arrival of defence disclosure and the necessity for supplementary police reports on intercepted communications. The efforts of court staff and liaison officers in navigating these logistical challenges are worthy of acknowledgment.

The case highlights the intricate interaction between criminal litigation and the operational realities of counter-terrorism policing. The defendant’s digital footprint and travel history were subject to intense analysis by the National Counter Terrorism Digital Forensics Unit (NCTDFU), a division which routinely faces backlogs due to the sheer scale of encrypted material necessitating decryption under stringent legal protocols. These resource constraints can lead to protracted case progression—unfortunate but unavoidable, given the dual imperatives of national security and individual rights.

Prior to his trial preparation hearing, the Crown provided nearly 900 items of evidence spanning intercepted communications, forensic analyses, and behavioural reports prepared by the Prevent programme and the channel interventions unit. The latter’s involvement began in mid-2022 following a referral by a university tutor who expressed concern about the defendant’s increasingly inflammatory rhetoric in coursework discussions. Unfortunately, that panel’s efforts to engage Mr H in deradicalisation processes met with limited success; his participation was intermittent and lacked meaningful commitment.

In preparing these remarks, the court acknowledges the difficult balancing act required where evidential sufficiency must be weighed alongside the defendant's rights to a fair trial. Defence counsel have been diligent throughout, submitting a detailed mitigation bundle including personal statements and character references, as well as commissioning psychiatric assessments. The Legal Aid Agency's engagement with this case has been erratic, evidencing delays in authorisations for expert reports and intermittent correspondence lapses, reflecting wider systemic issues in the funding and administration of criminal defence services.

Earlier this year, the court was presented with a forensic psychiatric report from Dr Mohammed Ansari of the Bristol Forensic Assessment Service. The report concluded that Mr H does not suffer from any major psychotic disorder but noted traits consistent with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, potentially exacerbated by social isolation and ideological fixation. Dr Ansari observed that such personality traits, while not excusing offending, do have bearing on capacity for disengagement from extremist beliefs. The report rated Mr H as posing a significant risk of serious harm to the public, principally on ideological grounds, a risk amplified by his technical capability to enact or facilitate harm.

The history of the relevant legal provisions underscores the evolution of counter-terrorism legislation since the early 2000s, when parliamentary debates centred on the balance between civil liberties and national security imperatives. The Terrorism Act 2006 represented a major statutory revision following recommendations from the 2005 Review of Terrorism Legislation. Its provisions reflect lessons learned from, inter alia, R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which defined the contours of ‘terrorist purpose’ in statutory interpretation. This case falls firmly within the ambit of these principles.

The investigative lead, Detective Chief Inspector Fiona Mallory, provided a detailed witness statement outlining the intelligence gathering phases. Noteworthy was the integration of open-source intelligence (OSINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT), coordinated with international law enforcement partners. Such multi-jurisdictional cooperation is a hallmark of contemporary counter-terrorism investigations but inevitably introduces layers of complexity in terms of data sharing protocols, oversight requirements, and evidentiary admissibility.

The court recalls that the defendant was also under surveillance during the autumn of 2024, as recorded in submitted logs. This included monitoring at public demonstrations, where Mr H was observed distributing leaflets espousing extremist narratives unrelated to but often conflated in media discourse with broader social grievances about civil liberties and immigration. Such events, while protected as free expression in democratic societies, must be carefully assessed in the context of individual conduct and intent.

Of note is the ongoing strain on public protections posed by persistent low-level offending which nevertheless commands disproportionate investigative resources. As witness evidence in R v. Tranfield [2019] EWCA Crim 460 illustrated, the diversion of specialised officers towards protracted analytic tasks can reduce capacity for conventional crime prevention. The court is compelled by these reflections to advocate for continued resource prioritisation, ensuring that both counter-terrorism and traditional policing demands remain effectively balanced.

The Crown’s case relies heavily on the material recovered from the defendant’s residence and electronic devices, including encrypted files, manuals consistent with explosives manufacture, and communications expressing clear intent to facilitate acts causing mass harm. The timing of several of these activities suggests planning deliberately aligned with the anniversary of previously recorded extremist attacks, indicating an element of symbolic resonance designed to amplify fear and publicity. This conduct is particularly serious under the statutory framework.

The defendant’s internet usage patterns were analysed by cyber forensic experts. Their report detailed Mr H’s engagement with numerous forums which, while superficially dedicated to technical hobbies, served as conduits for disseminating extremist ideologies. The digital forensic methodology involved complex artifact recovery and de-obfuscation techniques. The court is mindful that such extended investigations necessitate careful judicial oversight to protect rights under applicable data protection and human rights legislation.

Mr H’s previous encounters with law enforcement include a 2017 charge for shoplifting alcohol and toiletries from a supermarket in Bath, resolved by a conditional discharge. Such early minor offending bears no direct relevance to subsequent ideological offending but was canvassed by defence counsel in mitigation. The court, however, must view the sequence of offending in the round and resist conflating unrelated matters.

The comprehensive digital archive seized comprised numerous files encrypted within a VeraCrypt container labelled “ForgeBox.” Among these were documents describing improvised incendiary devices and techniques for camouflage and evasion of detection. Defence submissions offered alternative explanations, suggesting a possible interest in pyrotechnics as a hobby. The court is unpersuaded by these contentions given the contextual nexus of other material recovered and intelligence reports indicating ongoing ideological commitment.

In addition to electronic materials, physical evidence included components deemed dual-use items, such as tubing and wiring, acquired from legitimate suppliers but matched to descriptions commonly cited in manuals monitored by counter-terrorism agencies. Defence attempted to frame these acquisitions as part of lawful model-making activities. Yet expert testimony confirmed that quantities and specifications exceeded typical hobbyist requirements.

The legal landscape is marked by accumulating case law setting standards for sentencing in terrorism cases. Prominent among these is R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 and the more recent R v. Newell [2023] EWCA Crim 812, the latter reinforcing the need for sentences to reflect not only culpability but also the necessity of deterrence in the digital age, where facilitation of harm may be remote yet effective. The court is apprised of such authority but is bound primarily by the specifics of this individual case.

The defendant’s travel history was a subject of focused inquiry. Official immigration records show attempts to reach conflict zones abroad under the pretext of attending “academic workshops” or “cultural exchanges,” none of which culminated in actual travel due to visa denials or cancellations. One such attempt coincided with a transnational law enforcement operation, leading to a missed connection. Defence counsel argue these attempts were innocent and aspirational, whereas the prosecution interprets them as evidence of intent to engage with proscribed groups.

A letter from Bristol City Council’s Homelessness Service was submitted as mitigation. This highlighted Mr H’s precarious housing situation prior to remand, including a brief episode when he slept in a local shelter due to eviction. While such factors are tragic and compounding, defenceless cannot be excused on social hardship alone. The criminal justice system must differentiate between vulnerability and volitional risk-taking.

Public mental health resources in the region have experienced significant pressure in recent years, with increasing waiting times reported for psychological assessment and community interventions. This strain underlines structural challenges faced by agencies attempting to manage individuals with complex needs and ideological extremism. The court is cognisant of this wider context though it remains charged with justice rather than service provision policy.

The Crown introduced evidence concerning associations Mr H maintained with other individuals under investigation for offences including affray following a pub brawl in Bath’s Old Town, an incident involving pool cues. These unrelated but contemporaneous offences, committed by acquaintances with whom the defendant shared living quarters, have no direct bearing on the charges before this court. Defence counsel rightly objected to any conflation of these matters in determination of individual culpability.

Letters from the parents of the complainants in those affray cases illustrate the ripple effect such disturbances have in local communities. The court has considerable sympathy with these victims but must exercise caution to avoid overshadowing the factual matrix pertinent to the defendant’s ideological culpability.

The system also recalls that a co-defendant named S.M., charged with possession of indecent images unconnected to Mr H's offending, absconded during pre-trial proceedings. His absence complicated investigation sequencing, yet no direct evidence linked Mr H to these particular offences.

The defendant’s cryptocurrency transactions were scrutinised by financial forensic specialists. A trace of £1,450 worth of Bitcoin transferred via mixing services to vendors specializing in electronic components was uncovered. While such transactions are not intrinsically criminal, the context—coupled with the nature of goods purchased—supports the prosecution’s narrative. The court notes the growing challenge of policing decentralized financial systems and joins judiciary voices calling for legislative updates.

Covert footage analyzed by counter-terrorism officers captured Mr H visiting a riverside embankment on an autumn evening to what was described in reports as “suspicious activity.” Authentication of this footage required considerable technical effort, involving synchronisation of disparate camera angles, network latency adjustments, and image enhancement algorithms. Such trials of analytical resource demonstrate the asymmetry between the speed of criminal ingenuity and the painstaking operational work required for interdiction.

The defence tendered character references from the Green Valley Gardeners’ Co-operative, praising Mr H’s voluntary work in maintaining urban allotments. While commendable, such civic engagement must be balanced against the grave nature of his offending. This court notes the principle, articulated in R v. Varlow [2022] EWCA Crim 928, that commendable daylight conduct offers no licence to perpetrate darkness.

Mr H’s personal circumstances reflect a complex portrait. He is a 31-year-old graduate in mechanical engineering from Bath University with previous stable employment in design consultancy, reportedly dismissed following concerns about online activities. Letters from former employers describe him as punctual and meticulous but note his increasing social withdrawal. Defence counsel emphasise these as signs of underlying distress rather than malevolence.

A forensic psychological evaluation by Professor Margot Innes emphasises Mr H’s “cognitive rigidity” and “binary moral frameworks,” but found no diagnosable mental illness. The psychologist underscored the challenges inherent in disentangling ideological belief from pathology, a tension well-recognised in contemporary forensic psychiatry. The risk of serious harm was rated as high, with particular concern about the defendant’s recidivism potential if released without intensive supervision.

The court recognises letters received from the Bristol Resettlement and Reintegration Service, who have offered to engage with Mr H in custody and post-release if applicable. These voluntary sector efforts face chronic underfunding and staff shortages, realities that demand systemic attention from policymakers.

Sentencing in cases of this nature must satisfy multi-dimensional aims: punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and most importantly, the protection of the public. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, as amended, and guidance from the Sentencing Council emphasize tailored responses balancing culpability, harm potential, and personal mitigation.

The court is conscious that counter-terrorism prosecutions engage broader societal imperatives and underline the duty of the judiciary to reflect public confidence in the system's ability to address threats without acceding to panic or overreach. This case serves as a sober reminder of the persistent menace posed by radicalisation in the digital era and the necessity for vigilant but proportionate responses.

A pre-sentence report will be directed, seeking assessment of Mr H’s suitability for structured deradicalisation programmes supported by the National Probation Service’s (NPS) specialised terrorism offender management teams. The report should include availability of psychological therapies addressing extremist cognition, potential for engagement with approved premises, and feasibility of imposing license conditions including electronic monitoring.

Formal sentencing will be deferred pending receipt of this report and any further representations from the parties.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the pertinent authorities for registration and enforcement.

These are the orders of the court.
