IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29834  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. M. CARTWRIGHT  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H appears for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period of the offending conduct is established as commencing in October 2022 and persisting until his arrest in February 2025.  

The defendant was taken into custody on 19 February 2025, pursuant to a warrant executed by the South West Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU(SW)) at his residence in the Bedminster area of Bristol. The arrest followed an extensive collaborative investigation involving CTU(SW), the Serious Crime Directorate’s technical team, and the National Cyber Intelligence Centre. Authority to enter and search was granted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, issued following a comprehensive risk assessment by the Security Service (MI5). At the time of arrest, several digital devices were seized including encrypted mobile phones, solid state drives, and what was described as “specialist componentry” confined in a secure toolbox.  

It is noteworthy that the digital devices seized required decryption by specialists seconded from the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC). This process was onerous, the content protected by multi-layered encryption protocols arguably among the most sophisticated encountered in recent counter-terrorism operations in the South West region. The workload of NTAC at the time was substantial, reporting backlogs extending to 14 weeks for forensic review of devices in comparable cases.  

Prior to the arrest, the defendant’s movements had been surveilled under Operation BRIGANT, an initiative dedicated to monitoring domestic threats. Intelligence gathering was supplemented by metadata logs obtained through judicial warrants covering telecommunications traffic, a process carefully overseen given the privacy implications and regulatory strictures enshrined in the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. The volume of intercepted data was considerable, amounts reportedly in the order of several terabytes, posing significant storage and analysis challenges. The operation demanded coordination with multiple agencies including local policing units, the National Crime Agency, and the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism.

The initial pre-trial proceedings were conducted with acute procedural vigilance, mindful of the complexities inherent in terrorism-related offences. On 3 April 2025, during the first directions hearing, the defendant was remanded in custody, given the seriousness of the allegations and issues concerning potential flight risk. A full case management hearing occurred on 15 May 2025, at which counsel for the defence articulated intentions to contest certain technical aspects relating to evidentiary admissibility, specifically the chain of custody items for the digital storage media. These arguments ultimately gave way by the statement of agreed facts at the trial stage.  

Parallel to these events, correspondence from the Legal Aid Agency evidencing protracted authorisation delays was lodged before the court. Defence solicitors indicated that authorisation for the instruction of a specialist independent forensic psychologist to prepare a risk assessment report was impeded by administrative inertia. This caused a postponement of the planned sentencing timetable, highlighting ongoing systemic pressures within defence funding arrangements that adversely impact timely progress in complex cases.  

The court is mindful that referral to the government-funded Prevent programme was made by a secondary school in Bristol in late 2019, after the defendant delivered a class presentation that allegedly included quotations from proscribed materials without critical commentary. The ensuing Channel panel convened by the local authority chose not to pursue formal intervention at that stage, reflecting a low assessment of immediate risk. This illustrates a broader contextual difficulty in early identification of radicalisation pathways, a matter frequently discussed in parliamentary oversight committees and policy reviews.  

It is also appropriate to register that initial bail applications, made under section 46 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, were declined on two occasions, owing principally to concerns regarding the potential for interference with witnesses and ongoing investigation integrity. Subsequently, interim bail conditions were imposed during a brief adjournment in September 2024, including electronic tagging and geographical exclusion zones encompassing city centre locations. These were revoked upon the defendant’s re-arrest following intelligence regarding alleged attempts to circumvent restrictions, though those subsequent events are not subject to charges here.  

Early plea indications were reluctant, with Mr H maintaining a not guilty plea during the initial trial preparation hearing on 12 June 2025. However, following jury empanelment and the commencement of evidence presentation, the defendant entered pleas of guilty to both counts on the first day of the fourth week of the trial, roughly 48 hours prior to the scheduled summing up. This delay is a material factor in the assessment of credit for plea, as repeatedly reflected in appellate jurisprudence.  

In R v. Chapman [2023] EWCA Crim 2138, the Court of Appeal emphasised that credit for a guilty plea diminishes substantially when tendered late, particularly in terrorism-related prosecutions where preparation and evidence collation impose exceptional burdens. The decision underscored that such credit is reserved for admissions made at the earliest realistic opportunity and acts as an incentive to prompt resolution, balancing judicial economy with the victim’s and community’s interests.  

Similarly, R v. Banks [2022] EWCA Crim 1812 clarified that plea reductions cannot be construed as mechanistic or routine but must reflect the totality of circumstances, including motivation, timing, and genuineness of remorse. Counsel for the defence candidly acknowledged this in submissions on 10 September 2025, observing that the late pleas were driven by the stark realities of the evidence, rather than demonstrable contrition.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

For context, it is informative to consider the court’s established sentencing framework regarding terrorism offences, elaborated in the Sentencing Council’s 2023 revised guidelines. As outlined therein, offences are graded with reference to the nature of intent, sophistication of operational planning, and the extent to which the offence posed a tangible risk of harm. Aggravating factors include ideological motivation, targeting of indiscriminate civilian populations, and use of communication networks with global reach.  

The court also reflects on an instructive decision in R v. Umar [2024] EWCA Crim 822, where the sentencing judge imposed a lengthy custodial term exceeding 18 years, primarily predicated on the defendant’s role in a transnational conspiracy involving acquisition of explosive precursors and radicalisation content dissemination. The relevance of Umar is principally in the affirmation of public protection as a paramount sentencing objective in such cases, notwithstanding the availability of rehabilitative programming.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

A supplementary observation warrants mention regarding the evidential material. A series of encrypted archives attributed to the defendant was recovered during warrant execution. These archives contained a mixture of technical schematics, encrypted manifestos advocating extremist action, and purported ‘how-to’ videos demonstrating the construction of improvised explosive devices. Forensic examination revealed partial deletion of files in a manner consistent with knowledge of investigative tactics, confirming an awareness of culpability and a deliberate intent to conceal.  

Counsel for the defence advanced the position that some materials reflected academic interest or hobbyist pursuits, citing a dormant YouTube account ostensibly dedicated to mechanical engineering projects. The court finds this response unpersuasive, given the broader context of combined material and the circumstantial links to hostile intent.  

It is a matter of passing record that a small quantity of cannabis seeds was discovered in the defendant’s flat during first entry, though no cultivation equipment or active use was detected. No charges arise in respect of these items, and mention is made solely in settlement of the complete evidential record.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

That said, incidental material recovered included correspondence relating to a tenancy dispute involving noise complaints and allegations of fly-tipping on adjacent communal land. These administrative matters are entirely unrelated to the case at hand but nonetheless provide background to the defendant’s living circumstances during the material period.  

Regarding the procedural history, it is relevant to note that on 27 July 2025 the case was adjourned by the court owing to a nationwide strike by court clerks, an industrial action that affected scheduling across the Crown Court estate. Such strike action has generated significant delay in case progression within this jurisdiction and remains a pressing issue in the administration of justice.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

In addition to the above, the defendant made a trip to Lisbon in December 2023, stating the purpose was familial visitation. The Crown submitted evidence that during this trip he tried to contact known extremists using encrypted apps whose servers are monitored for proscribed content. Defence counsel argued that these calls were unreturned and non-substantive, but the temporal coincidence and communications pattern were noted as probabilistic markers of intent.  

The multi-agency team overseeing the investigation instituted a Risk Assessment under the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) category 3, acknowledging that the defendant did not have previous convictions but that the ideological motivation and risk of involvement with terrorist actors warranted ongoing scrutiny. Representatives drawn from Probation, Counter-Terrorism Policing South West, local mental health services, and housing authorities met regularly to review case developments.  

It must be observed that the Probation Service continues to endure chronic staffing shortages, exacerbated by increasing caseloads and reduced funding. Reports indicate that many officers handle double the recommended number of cases, stretching professional capacity and consequently limiting direct intervention opportunities. Such strain is replicated within mental health services, where waiting times for specialist forensic psychology assessments often extend beyond four months, a factor contributing to delay in the preparation of comprehensive pre-sentence reports.  

An instructive example of appellate consideration in relation to mental health issues can be found in R v. Miles [2022] EWCA Crim 1093, where the Court elucidated the interplay between psychiatric diagnosis and sentencing proportionality in terrorism matters. The defendant in Miles suffered from schizoaffective disorder and had engaged in arson attacks against public buildings. The Court underscored that mental disorder does not automatically connote diminished culpability where the offences involved clear, deliberate harm. It emphasised the necessity of balancing therapeutic intervention with the imperative to protect the public.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Of particular concern to the court is a cryptocurrency transaction of approximately £3,150 traced to the defendant’s known email address. This amount was transferred to an online vendor known to supply dual-use chemicals with potential application in explosive manufacture. While cryptocurrency affords some measure of anonymity, investigative work revealed traces of transactional pathways through multiple mixing services, raising complex questions around financial crime detection efficacy.  

Sentencing remarks must also take account of the work of the West Avon Resettlement Consortium, whose advocacy letter in mitigation was supplied to the court. This organisation, despite limited resources and a high turnover rate, aims to support offenders reintegrating into society, recognising the intricacies inherent in addressing ideological extremism. Such charities perform a vital function within the ecology of public safety, supplementing statutory agencies. Their perspective, while understandably cautious, highlights the importance of community-based scaffolding post-custody.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning now to the personal circumstances of Mr H, he is a 30-year-old man of British nationality. Educationally, he possesses a Bachelor of Science degree in materials engineering from a reputable university, a qualification corroborated by transcripts and testimonials from academic staff. His occupational history includes a brief tenure as a junior technician in a chemical manufacturing plant, terminated following a security clearance review triggered by unexplained absences. Neighbours provided mixed descriptions: generally civil and reserved, though occasional reports to housing authorities noted noise disturbances and suspected unsanctioned vehicle repairs in communal parking areas.  

In mitigation, the court has received letters from a local horticultural group praising Mr H for voluntary work in neighbourhood green spaces, including initiatives to plant native wildflowers. While such community engagement is commendable, it must be contextualised appropriately when adjudicating conduct aligned with terroristic ideation.  

The psychological report appended to the pre-sentence documents, prepared by Dr Lena Fischer, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, provides a measured but firm assessment. Dr Fischer identified “cognitive inflexibility coupled with intense binary ideological frameworks,” but ruled out diagnosable psychiatric disorders. The defendant was deemed high risk for serious harm, with ongoing potential for extremist affiliation post-release without intensive supervision and tailored intervention. The suggested programmes include the Structured Professional Judgement (SPJ) toolkit application and participation in the Prevent Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), though completion rates for the latter are, regrettably, below 50%.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The overall assessment of the court must therefore balance the gravity and sophistication of the offending—manifested in deliberate operational planning and the procurement of materials suitable for weapon manufacture—with the limited mitigation afforded by a previously clean criminal record and belated guilty plea. There is scant evidence that the defendant’s ideological engagement was anything other than deeply entrenched, notwithstanding the occasional outward appearance of normality.  

The court notes with concern the broader social context from which such radicalisation emerges. The erosion of social cohesion, exacerbated by economic precarity, community fragmentation, and the proliferation of internet-mediated ideological echo chambers, continues to present a challenge of significant magnitude. This case, while individual in its particulars, exemplifies the recurring pattern of domestic extremism wherein technical competence meets violent intent.  

The wisdom enshrined in the guidance from the Court of Appeal requires the imposition of a sentence that is sufficient to mark denunciation and deterrence, and to protect the public from a person assessed as posing a significant ongoing risk. Concurrently, the court endorses the investing of custodial resources towards rehabilitation and deradicalisation, acknowledging that such efforts require adequate funding, political will, and multidisciplinary cooperation.  

I shall therefore direct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be commissioned forthwith. Probation is instructed to consider, amongst other modalities, the suitability of imposing a long-term Extended Determinate Sentence with ancillary license conditions including electronic monitoring, restrictions on internet use, and mandatory attendance at approved rehabilitation programmes. Particular attention should be paid to the availability and appropriateness of secure accommodation on release, the potential for polygraph testing, and the capacity of local Prevent teams to engage effectively in risk management.  

I wish to place on record my gratitude to counsel for their detailed submissions. Ms Fiona Chandler QC, appearing for the Crown, presented the prosecution case with clarity and diligence. Mr Andrew Blake, appearing on behalf of the defendant, conducted the advocacy with professionalism despite the constraints imposed by abbreviated preparation periods and the complexities of authorised disclosure. I also acknowledge the work of the court ushers and support staff, whose consistent efforts in maintaining order and decorum in court are essential and much appreciated, particularly given the recent refurbishment of Court 4’s layout which includes enhanced facilities for vulnerable witnesses.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for registration and inclusion in national databases. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged in this matter. Costs are reserved pending further application.  

These are the orders of the court.
