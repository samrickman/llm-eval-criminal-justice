IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/24659  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. M. BLUNDELL  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H stands before this court for sentence upon convictions on multiple counts under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is found by the jury to span an extended period commencing in July 2023 through to the defendant's custodian arrest in January 2025. The court acknowledges the gravity of these offences and the imperative of balancing public protection with principled sentencing guidelines.

The defendant's matters came before this court following initial hearings at the Birmingham Magistrates’ Court, where jurisdiction was appropriately committed for adult Crown Court trial following consideration under sections 28 and 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and proportionality assessments consistent with the Criminal Procedure Rules. The trial date was fixed after multiple procedural orchestrations, punctuated by intermittent adjournments necessitated by ongoing disclosure disputes and specialist report preparations. Such delays, regrettably, are no novelty in terrorism-related proceedings; indeed, these cases persistently strain court listing capacities and resource allocations, particularly in the current context of national court staff shortages and the residual impacts of judicial industrial actions.

The defendant was first apprehended at dawn on 18 January 2025 pursuant to a warrant granted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, following a carefully orchestrated multi-agency operation led by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands in collaboration with the National Crime Agency and the regional forensic cyber division at the Midlands Digital Intelligence Unit. The investigation was notable for its layered approach, utilising intercepts authorised under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 as well as geographic tracking permitted by subsequent judicial applications. It was observed that the encrypted communications associated with the defendant employed end-to-end protocols over multiple ephemeral messaging platforms, a fact which significantly complicated real-time intelligence gathering. The arrest was accompanied by seizure of electronic devices including multiple smartphones, encrypted hard drives, and print materials.

In considering the wider context within which this offending occurred, it is appropriate to note the historical development of the Terrorism Act 2006 itself. This Act, enacted in response to evolving terrorist threats and reinforced in the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015, explicitly aims to prevent acts preparatory to terrorism, recognising the often covert and sophisticated nature of such preparatory conduct. Indeed, the legislative background and subsequent Parliamentary debates (Hansard, Volume 455, 2005) exhibit a clear focus on disrupting not only the acts themselves but their antecedent planning stages. Cases such as R v. Quayum [2020] EWCA Crim 1289 reiterate the significance of intention, proximity and sophistication in assessing culpability under section 5 of the 2006 Act.

Prior to trial, and amid pressures on the system, Legal Aid administration was involved to facilitate Mr H's representation under the Law Society’s criminal panel. The court notes, with some frustration borne of repeated experience in terrorism prosecutions, the ongoing challenges that practitioners face in securing timely funding approvals for access to independent experts, including forensic linguists and clinical psychologists specialising in ideological extremism. In this instance, the defendant’s instructed defence counsel, Mr Oliver Roman, secured marginally delayed but ultimately effective authorisation to commission psychiatry reports—an administrative success that is, regrettably, not uniform across the jurisdiction. This court hopes the Legal Aid Agency will address systemic delays to avoid undue prejudice.

The court places on record strong appreciation for the tireless efforts of the West Midlands Prevent team, whose early referral of Mr H in late 2021 constituted an important intervention effort, although, as is often the case in such intricate ideological cases, engagement was intermittent and bore limited fruit. The Prevent Framework, established under the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 and supported by Channel panels, remains integral to early risk assessment and diversion. The local Prevent panel’s letters to the court detail extensive but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to engage the defendant in cognitive behavioural work tailored to grievance-fuelled extremism, highlighting both the potential and limits of voluntary intervention.

Evidence disclosed during proceedings included a detailed pre-sentence report authored by the local Probation Service, which operates under chronic staffing constraints accentuated by recent recruitment shortfalls. The report counselled caution in risk assessment, noting particularly the defendant’s lack of a sustained employment record post-education and his history of transient accommodation placements spanning three counties over the previous five years. Such instability inevitably complicates rehabilitation prospects and highlights the need for bespoke case management on release.

It should be mentioned, for the record, that the defendant’s familial background is devoid of prior convictions, though not without difficulties. Letters submitted from Mr H's immediate family, including a letter from his mother dated 9 August 2025, describe a history of emotional estrangement and suggest influences arising from early social alienation. While such family circumstances are often tendered with the hope of mitigation, the court is conscious that they do not excuse culpability in offences carrying the weight of potential mass harm.

In appellate jurisprudence, sentencing considerations in terrorism cases are governed by principles well-articulated in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and more recently refined in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568. These decisions underscore the imperative for sentences to reflect the need for general deterrence and public protection, alongside considerations of individual culpability and mitigation. The Sentencing Council's guidelines on terrorism, revised in 2023, specifically direct the court to assess the degree of sophistication, scope, and imminence of intended harm in determining sentences.

The defendant’s online activities, as disclosed through forensic examination of several devices, revealed sustained engagement with multiple forums hosting extremist propaganda. The Crown’s expert witness, Mr Julian Pyne, a digital forensic analyst with 14 years’ experience at the national forensic agency, gave evidence in detail about the complexity of messages transmitted via off-the-record protocols and the defendant’s apparent role as a facilitator for dissemination of extremist materials, including technical manuals on improvised explosive devices. The court notes, in passing, that the volume of seized digital material—amounting to approximately 4 terabytes of data—presented considerable challenges to both prosecuting and defence teams in disclosure management.

The forensic linguistic report, prepared by Dr Helena Cartwright, a renowned specialist in counter-extremism communications, endeavoured to trace the evolution of Mr H's writings and posts over time. Initially benign postings gave way to increasingly radical manifestos and the promotion of “martyr narratives.” This trajectory was echoed in contemporaneous associations noted in investigation logs, including contacts with individuals later convicted for related terrorism offences in another jurisdiction. It is incumbent on the court to highlight that such connections, while constituting a circumstantial matrix for guilt, demand careful and nuanced interpretation, lest guilt by association distort justice.

One technological artefact of note was a hidden VeraCrypt drive named “Project Phoenix,” stored on a solid-state disk seized at the defendant’s residence. Investigators encountered significant obstacles in decryption, finally obtaining partial access after deployment of advanced key recovery methods. The encrypted container held schematics, fragmented instructional videos, and detailed chemical synthesis notes, indicating a high degree of technical aptitude and intent. Though the defendant’s counsel proposed that some files represented academic interest or hobbyist experimentation—a submission receiving polite judicial consideration—the court finds, on all available evidence, that the possessing such materials in the context described is wholly inimical to public safety.

This case, while typical of its class in involving intricate digital investigations and forensic challenges, is exacerbated by the defendant’s possession of drone devices equipped with payload modification capabilities. Defence submissions referenced a contemporaneous article on the increasing commercial availability of such technology and counsel invited the court to consider the possible lawful purposes of drone operation. While such arguments are lawful and expected, the court is equally mindful of R v. Saunders [2019] EWCA Crim 1048, where the court underscored the heightened risks attendant to drone-facilitated terrorist activity, particularly when integrated with explosives. Drones in such contexts are not innocent tools but potent force enhancers.

It is necessary to mention that during the search of the defendant’s flat, a quantity of home-built elderflower wine was recovered. Whilst unlicensed alcohol manufacture is an offence under the Licensing Act 2003, this court is satisfied that it bears no relevance to this matter save perhaps as a cultural artefact of the defendant’s background. Defence counsel articulated this as an attempt to humanise the defendant. Such attempts, while noted, do not mitigate the severity of the principal offences.

The defendant also has an unremarkable prior record, save for a minor conviction for driving while disqualified dating from 2015, unrelated to the current charges and with no aggravating factors suggesting recidivism. This minor offending did not influence the prosecution’s decision to proceed in this instance but is recorded for completeness.

The Crown highlighted Mr H's attendance at a colloquium in Vienna in May 2024, ostensibly linked to academic research. Airline manifests showed a subsequent, uncompleted attempt to travel via Prague to the Czech-Poland border region, an area noted for extremist clustering. Though no unlawful act arose from this attempted movement, the chronology and context raise obvious concerns regarding intention and association. Defence argued coincidence; however, in view of overlapping intercepted communications indicating contact with known extremists in Prague, the court is satisfied the trip was germane to preparatory activity.

While the prosecution’s case was compelling, it was nevertheless appropriately met with detailed mitigation submissions highlighting the defendant’s youth at first referral, absence of prior terrorism convictions, some degree of community involvement as evinced by participation in a local allotment society, and evidence of partial disengagement efforts before re-radicalisation. The allocation of some professional responsibility to multi-agency panels—including the local CAMHS team—was described in letters from clinical psychologists at West Midlands NHS Trust, though none concluded that Mr H suffered from diagnosable mental illness impairing responsibility.

The court was also provided with relevant psychological assessments, including a comprehensive forensic report by Dr Sahil Kamal from the Midlands Secure Mental Health Unit. His report, whilst registering concerns about cognitive rigidity and black-and-white thinking patterns, drew no conclusions suggesting diagnosable psychosis or personality disorder. Risk assessment indicated a high likelihood of re-engagement with extremist networks absent thorough intervention.

Financial investigations revealed a series of cryptocurrency transactions traced through blockchain analytics. The defendant received transfers from an unregulated offshore wallet, amounting to approximately £3,800 in Bitcoin-equivalent funds, subsequently moved through multiple tumblers and mixers. Such sophistication evidences an understanding of anonymisation techniques exploited by criminals internationally. The court notes the documented rise in cryptocurrency’s significance for financing terrorism, reflecting concerns expressed in reports by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and addressed in recent anti-money laundering regulations.

The possession of multiple firearm parts—albeit inoperable and incomplete—was also documented. Though the parts themselves did not constitute firearms as defined under the Firearms Act 1968, their seizure nonetheless supports the factual matrix surrounding Mr H’s intent. Defence submissions noted surplus zeal in the technical scope of investigations but accepted the parts’ connection to broader preparatory measures.

Turning to the defendant’s personal and educational background, Mr H is 30 years old and a graduate with upper second-class honours in electrical engineering. Until mid-2023, he was employed at a regional power engineering firm but resigned following a security clearance dispute triggered by concerns over his online affiliations. This loss of employment and subsequent social isolation appear to have coincided with the deepening of extremist views, consistent with patterns documented by the Home Office’s Integrated Pathways to Radicalisation report (2022).

Letters submitted on his behalf include writings from colleagues at the engineering firm, one of whom described him as “a competent, analytical technician but somewhat introverted and difficult to engage socially.” Additional references came from volunteers at the Birmingham Centre for Digital Inclusion, praising his limited but genuine efforts to support elderly locals navigate online banking. Whilst these attestations are of some value in personalising the defendant, the court is mindful that such mitigating factors do not eclipse the seriousness of the offences.

Contextualising within the broader societal milieu, the court is conscious of the impact of increased street homelessness in Birmingham, exacerbated by economic contraction and shortages in affordable housing. Such conditions, while tangential, can create environments where disenfranchisement and radicalisation flourish. Like many urban centres, Birmingham grapples with balancing public safety against social welfare imperatives.

The psychiatric assessment concluded with an elevated risk profile and cautionary notes on the defendant’s likely non-compliance with community supervision without intensive monitoring. Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Amira Latif recommended a custodial sentence with extended licence conditions including GPS monitoring, restricted digital access, and mandatory participation in de-radicalisation programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Project (DDP). The court notes that while such programmes have achieved variable success, they remain essential components in managing ideological risk going forward. Notwithstanding mitigation, the psychiatric evidence underscored that the defendant remains a continuing threat absent firm interventions.

In considering sentencing, the court must pay due regard to the overarching purposes set out in section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003: punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public. Terrorism offences, by their nature, demand sentences that reflect the imperative deterrence objective alongside public protection, as repeatedly affirmed in case law including R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678.

Mitigation is, for the most part, limited to Mr H’s previously clean criminal record, his late guilty plea entered at the close of the trial following overwhelming evidence, and his educational qualifications. The late plea, while meriting some credit, is reduced given the timing—after significant expenditure of public resources and duration of proceedings. The court adopts a starting point consistent with the highest culpability range under the 2023 Terrorism Guidelines.

Acknowledgment is due to the prosecution counsel, Ms Rachel Vaughan, for her diligent and clear submissions, and to Mr Oliver Roman for competent advocacy on behalf of the defendant, notwithstanding the regrettably protracted procedural steps occasioned by defence applications
