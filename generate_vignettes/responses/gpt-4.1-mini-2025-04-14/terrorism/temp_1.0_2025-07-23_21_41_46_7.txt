IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/27834  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F. MARSHALL  
Filed: 11 August 2025  

Mr Mr H appears before this court for sentence having been convicted following a trial of offences contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism, and also possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences relate to conduct alleged to have occurred between September 2023 and the date of his arrest on 12 April 2025.  

The defendant was apprehended early on the morning of 12 April 2025 at an address in Redcliffe, Bristol, following the execution of a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing South West. The operation had been the culmination of a sustained multi-disciplinary investigation involving covert surveillance, digital forensics, and analysis of intercepted communications. Particular attention was paid to encrypted messaging traffic linked to the defendant’s virtual identities and associated cloud storage accounts. On arrest, several electronic devices were seized, alongside technical paraphernalia indicative of the preparation of explosives or incendiary devices.

To place the defendant's case within a procedural framework, it is pertinent to recount that the investigation spanned more than eighteen months. The operational team incorporated officers seconded from regional counter-terror units, forensic cyber-security specialists, and analysts from the National Crime Agency's Cyber Crime Unit. The complexity of this matter necessitated procedural adaptations, including multiple applications for extended detention periods under the Terrorism Act 2000 provisions. These were granted following careful judicial oversight to ensure the preservation of the defendant’s rights while balancing the imperative of safeguarding public safety. The defendant's remand conditions have been subject to regular review.  

Throughout these proceedings, the court has noted the persistent issue of delay caused by administrative obstacles to timely disclosure. The legal teams representing Mr H lodged various applications relating to evidential disclosure and the admissibility of certain intercept material, each of which occasioned adjournments. These were, on occasion, attributed to the need for redaction of sensitive material and liaison with security-cleared personnel, underscoring the unique challenges presented in terrorism prosecutions. Defence counsel have been commendably diligent in advancing arguments within the constraints imposed.  

It is a telling observation that the court remains reliant on expert input from forensic psychiatrists and psychologists specialising in extremist behaviour and ideological de-radicalisation. The reports tendered draw upon an evolving scientific literature that grapples with the interplay between cognitive rigidity, social isolation, and the embrace of violent extremism. While the parameters of this field are still the subject of research and debate, the reports adhere to accepted clinical methods, drawing upon Structured Professional Judgement protocols and validated risk assessment tools.  

One notes in passing an observation from the probation author of Mr H’s initial assessment of risk and need, which highlighted the difficulty in engaging individuals whose ideological beliefs are intertwined with identity in ways that resist straightforward intervention. The challenge for multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) is combining surveillance and risk management with meaningful pathways to disengagement — a challenge compounded by resource constraints and personnel shortages well-documented across the public sector.  

The court is mindful that public discourse frequently oscillates between calls for harsher penalties and appeals for compassionate rehabilitation. It is not the function of the judiciary to equivocate but rather to apply the law proportionately, having regard to legislative intent, sentencing guidelines, and the totality of evidence.  

The indictment against Mr H confirms that the preparatory conduct was deliberate and involved the acquisition, modification, and storage of materials with a view to unlawful destruction and intimidation likely to endanger life. It must be emphasised, however, that the maximum custodial penalty available under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 is one of life imprisonment, reflective of the gravity with which Parliament views such conduct.

The entry point to these remarks would be incomplete without noting that Mr H maintained an online presence that, at first glance, appeared uncontroversial, engaging with technical blogs and engineering forums. Yet, over time, a pivot occurred, increasingly evident in his penned manifestos and social media posts: increasingly frequent references to political disenfranchisement, the glorification of violent jihadist narratives, and discussion of armed resistance. The Crown contends that this ideological evolution informed the preparatory steps he undertook, each informed by a plan to enact mass harm. Defence submissions, to the contrary, suggest that these writings were exploratory and not reflective of actionable intent — a position this court has considered in the light of the totality of the evidence presented.  

The evidence recovered from digital devices included encrypted schematics, notes on chemical processes, and videos demonstrating the construction and detonation of improvised explosive devices. Forensic examination required collaboration with the National Technical Assistance Centre, whose specialists decrypted layers of virtual secure storage. This task, while routine in counter-terror investigations, impinges significantly on operational resourcing, a fact that remains unheralded by the public but keenly felt within law enforcement agencies. The time invested extends well beyond the calendar days visible in court records, with ancillary impacts on other serious crime investigations.

At the same time, one also acknowledges the contributions of voluntary and community-based organisations in attempting to engage the defendant outside custodial settings. The court has received reports indicating that Mr H’s involvement with the Bristol Prevent Hub spanned over a year, involving cognitive behavioural interventions, mentoring, and outreach programmes. While such initiatives are invaluable in the broader strategy to reduce radicalisation, their impact remains variable. The Calderside Prevent Hub’s submissions to this court emphasise the sporadic nature of Mr H’s engagement and note the difficulties posed by his increasing withdrawal. These reports demonstrate a sober recognition of systemic limitations rather than naivety concerning the prospects of success.  

It is worth recalling, not by way of mitigation but to contextualise delay and procedural complexity, that the Legal Aid Agency initially refused prior approval for instruction of an independent forensic psychiatric expert. This compelled counsel to submit multiple requests over a protracted period, involving case management hearings and involving advocacy before a Legal Aid Review Board. The court notes, with regret, that such bureaucratic impediments are increasingly commonplace and serve only to burden the timely progression of cases of genuine public interest.

The prosecution's reliance upon the digital narrative was supplemented by witness testimony from a former co-worker at a precision engineering firm, where the defendant was employed until early 2023. The witness described Mr H as “quiet but focused,” although noting a marked intensification of political grievance in conversations over the preceding year. The relationship, however, does not extend to awareness of any violent intentions. Such testimony must be weighed carefully, recognising the difference between shared views and culpable acts. By contrast, the defendant’s rapid disengagement from formal employment, coupled with a sudden relocation to a shared flat in an area identified as a locus for extremist sympathisers, comprises part of the circumstantial matrix from which inference may be drawn.  

The defence put forward a neurological report commissioned to examine alleged attentional deficits and potential executive dysfunction. Whilst the report is informative and professionally rendered, it is ultimately of limited weight in mitigation given the absence of findings amounting to a recognised substantial impairment under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. No organic brain injury or diagnosable condition that might reduce culpability was identified.

The court has further considered the circumstances of travel abroad, in particular a trip in November 2024 to Istanbul, classified variously as tourism by the defendant and as a potential reconnaissance mission by the prosecution. The record shows that subsequent attempts to transit to the border region of Kilis, proximate to known conflict zones, were thwarted by flight cancellations and visa delays. Of interest, however, is a contemporaneous intercepted conversation referencing the provision of “equipment” to associates beyond the immediate jurisdiction. Defence counsel contended these as innocuous references, yet the court is satisfied, considering the entirety of evidence, that they bear upon the broader intent.  

In relation to case law, the court is guided by the statutory framework provided by the Terrorism Act 2006 and judicial pronouncements such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which elucidate the expansive meaning of “terrorist purpose” and the principle that preparatory conduct, whilst not resulting in actual acts of violence, engages the highest levels of culpability if undertaken with requisite intent. The injunctions laid down in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568 stress the importance of proportionality in sentencing but also underline the need for deterrence in the face of ideological extremism. Moreover, cases such as R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678 underscore the necessity of incapacitation where the risk of harm to the public remains manifest.

A noteworthy aspect concerns the defendant's use of cryptocurrency, specifically a series of transactions involving privacy-enhanced digital wallets. These facilitated the funding of equipment acquisition from underground marketplaces, transactions summing to approximately £3,100 over a six-month period. The opacity of blockchain-based transfers complicates tracing and enforcement, a matter noted with concern in the CPS Cybercrime Annual Report 2024. These financial activities opened avenues for the defendant to bypass standard scrutiny mechanisms, underscoring trends in the misuse of emerging financial technologies by those engaged in illicit and extremist activities.  

Compounding prosecutorial efforts were the extensive covert surveillance operations, comprising members of CT South West's Technical Surveillance Unit and partner agencies. The logistics of such surveillance required synchronisation of diverse camera feeds, integration of metadata overlays, and manual analysis of thermal imaging sequences. This intensive use of cutting-edge operational resource highlights a broader issue of asymmetry whereby violent preparations take moments but detection demands extensive hours of detailed human analysis.
