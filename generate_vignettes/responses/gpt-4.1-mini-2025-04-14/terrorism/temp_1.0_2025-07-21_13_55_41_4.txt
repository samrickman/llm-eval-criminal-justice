IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29844  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J. STRAFFORD  
Filed: 15 August 2025

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period relevant to these charges spans from September 2023 until the defendant's arrest on 11 February 2025.

The defendant was apprehended at 07:30 by officers of West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit executing a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at 27 Lower Broad Street, Birmingham. The warrant followed intelligence from the Security Service suggesting that Mr H’s network transmissions were linked to known extremist forums and that he had obtained materials for use in improvised explosive devices.

It is prudent before turning to the specifics of the offending to observe the contextual framework within which counter-terrorism prosecutions proceed. The Court acknowledges the considerable complexity involved in balancing investigatory zeal with procedural fairness, alongside the ever-present challenge of safeguarding sensitive intelligence disclosures. This balancing act is sometimes imperfect, but vigilance in the preservation of fairness remains paramount.

The case management process here was marked by considerable delay, largely stemming from difficulties in legal representation arrangements caused by ongoing restructuring within the Legal Aid Agency. Notably, initial defence counsel was substituted twice before Mr Callum Whately was instructed under a Legal Aid representation order. Such transitions invariably strain continuity but, on balance, the court is satisfied no injustice has thereby arisen in respect of instruction or preparation.

This matter emerged from an investigation codenamed Operation WHITE OX, which involved the careful coordination of West Midlands Police’s specialist cybercrime unit and the City Data Analysis Service (CDAS). Its investigative methodology combined signal interception capabilities with digital forensic analysis. The technical team expended over 320 hours decrypting secured containers on the defendant’s seized devices, a process laden with challenges due to the use of proprietary encryption algorithms and anonymising proxies.

A related matter of procedural concern arose from the case of R v. Denholm [2018] EWCA Crim 1728, where it was held that forensic examination evidence must be subject to rigorous validation to satisfy the requirements of reliability and relevance set out in Al-Khawaja & Tahery [2011] UKSC 33. The Crown has ensured that all digital exhibits procured in this case meet those evidentiary standards.

At the pre-trial hearing on 4 April 2025, the defence expressed a robust challenge to the scope of certain disclosure infringements, claiming that delays in obtaining material from allied intelligence agencies contravened the defendant’s Article 6 rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court found that the delays, regrettable though they were, did not infringe procedural fairness given the volume of material and the special measures invoked to protect national security. The ruling drew in part on the guidance in R v. AB and CD [2014] EWCA Crim 354.

The defendant’s pattern of engagement with preventative services is significant. From late 2021 through mid-2023, Mr H was involved intermittently with the Midlands Prevent Team, having been referred following concerns flagged by academic staff about his increasingly radicalised writings. Despite offers of tailored mentoring and access to community programmes aimed at addressing grievance-related ideology, the defendant's participation was sporadic and marked by episodes of withdrawal.

Those examining the growth of extremist conduct must be mindful of caution in ascribing causality. It is well documented that the radicalisation process is highly individualised, as described in the academic work of Neumann and Rogers (2015). Mr H’s trajectory, involving an initial interest in political philosophy and later engagement with extremist propaganda, reflects some aspects of this process.

The Crown’s case rested heavily on digital forensic findings. Agents extracted an encrypted archive labeled “Black Lotus," which contained detailed schematics of detonator mechanisms alongside commentary selectively compiled from online extremist manifestos. Moreover, a series of recorded voice notes were retrieved from an encrypted messenger application indicating a willingness to affiliate with proscribed organisations.

On one occasion in late 2024, the defendant appears to have conducted surveillance of a certain city transport hub, actions purported by prosecuting counsel to be preparatory steps for an attack. The expert witness evidence at trial explained that this behaviour, while not conclusive in isolation, formed part of the contextual mosaic indicative of hostile intent.

The defence argued that Mr H’s interest in aerial photography and urban exploration constituted innocent hobbies, supporting this with social media imagery and blog posts predating the alleged offending period, displaying scenes of industrial heritage sites captured at dawn. The court, however, is not persuaded that such personal interests mitigate the overall culpability, particularly when these activities were reinvested with extremist framing in the defendant’s later writings.

The defendant’s possession of certain chemicals and hardware was the subject of forensic analysis. The samples of ammonium nitrate and detonator components recovered from the residential address had, it was agreed, plausible non-terrorist applications, such as agricultural and hobbyist uses. The prosecution disavowed these benign explanations in light of the totality of evidence regarding the defendant’s intent.

It is pertinent to note the findings of the expert report submitted by Dr. Helen Cartwright, a chemical engineer and forensic explosive specialist, who indicated that the materials in question, when combined in specified proportions, bore significant potential for harm. Dr. Cartwright’s report, meticulously prepared over four months, outlined the precise mechanisms by which the components could be assembled to devastating effect.

An apparently peripheral but nonetheless instructive dimension of the defendant’s background is his prior employment with an engineering firm specialising in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). His line manager attested to Mr H’s technical proficiency and dedication but noted concerns about emerging political views expressed in internal communications. The defendant’s resignation from this post just three months before the commencement of the offending conduct is potentially significant in understanding his motivational nexus.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Of note, the defendant’s residential history includes a period of temporary accommodation funded by the local authority following a report of rent arrears in autumn 2022. The available housing support records speak to financial instability but also highlight the willing cooperation of Mr H with social workers assigned to provide assistance. The court commends these efforts but again underlines that such mitigating facts cannot displace the overriding imperative of public safety.

In difficult-to-administer cases such as this, the role of the Probation Service and community partners cannot be overstated. The inability of stretched services to provide consistent, long-term interventions against the backdrop of austerity, rising crime rates, and personnel shortfalls is a challenge well-documented in the probation inspectorate’s 2024 annual report. The court acknowledges the considerable burden placed on practitioners in this sector.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

The Crown placed reliance on a brief journey taken by the defendant to the European continent in early 2024, ostensibly for a cultural exchange event. However, travel records show a detour to a border town in Belgium, noted in intelligence reports for hosting gatherings associated with radicalised actors. The defence suggested this was coincidental and motivated by exploration rather than ideology. The evidence, taken as a whole, makes such an explanation implausible.

It would be remiss of the court not to record the profound strain on modern counter-terrorism policing resources. Allocation of manpower to extended surveillance, coupled with the burden of high caseloads involving multi-agency collaboration, places real constraints on the agility of the public safety framework. The court recalls the observations of the Inspectorate of Constabulary in their 2025 review, highlighting recruitment difficulties and complex case backlogs as significant systemic issues.

It is also appropriate to mention unrelated ancillary offences frequently encountered in co-defendant files. For instance, a co-defendant associated at one stage with this investigation faced charge for assaulting an arresting officer with a heavy chair during a separate incident. This violent episode is, however, not pertinent to the current defendant’s sentencing but forms part of the broader fabric of policing pressure in this jurisdiction.

Financial avenues in this investigation warrant attention. A forensic accounting report commissioned by the Crown uncovered cryptocurrency transactions originating from an account linked to Mr H’s known aliases. These included transfers to darknet marketplace vendors offering digital manuals labeled for “ballistics optimization” and “mechanical fuse design.” These transactions, allegedly totalling some £3,150 over an 18-month period, exemplify the intersection between emerging technologies and the finance of extremist activity.

The defendant maintained a modicum of engagement with the local mosque and community centre, as evidenced by letters submitted in mitigation referencing his involvement in charitable food distribution programmes lasting from 2019 until mid-2023. While such endeavours are praiseworthy, the court reiterates that past community work has limited bearing on sentencing for offences of this gravity.

Following arrest, the defendant underwent psychological assessment by forensic psychiatrist Dr. Samuel O’Neill. This detailed report, commissioned at the court’s direction, identified traits including cognitive rigidity and a "black-and-white" worldview but found no evidence of diagnosable mental illness. Dr. O’Neill concluded that the defendant posed a significant ongoing risk without intensive intervention.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

It is necessary to touch upon the timing and nature of the guilty pleas entered by Mr H. The defendant pleaded guilty to all charges at the final hearing on 8 August 2025, having maintained not guilty pleas throughout the earlier trial preparation period. This delay in acceptance limits the degree of credit the court may properly afford. The observations in R v. Haslett [2021] EWCA Crim 902 are apt: late pleas entered only at the point of overwhelming evidence should attract reduced allowances, reflecting the diminished utility of such admissions to victims and court resources.

The defendant’s written statement submitted to the court is measured and coherently composed. It reflects a partial acceptance of responsibility, though it falls short of unequivocal remorse. The court also received an assessment from the East Midlands Resettlement Consortium, indicating that any proposed licence conditions upon release would require intensive monitoring due to ongoing concerns regarding ideological adherence.

In respect to sentencing frameworks, the court is guided by the 2023 Sentencing Council Terrorism Act Guidelines, which underscore the paramount objectives of deterrence, public protection, and rehabilitation where feasible. The relevant statutory maximum for these offences is life imprisonment, though the court must calibrate sentence length according to culpability, previous history, and other relevant aggravating or mitigating factors.

It is recognized that Mr H has no previous convictions, a fact which constitutes mitigation, though it must be weighed carefully against the serious nature of the offences and the evidence of premeditation and sophistication apparent in this case.

The court also reflects upon the broader social implications of terrorism offences and the potential for these sentences to serve as a deterrent to others who might be tempted towards extremism. Such public interest factors must be balanced carefully to avoid unjust severity, yet ensure unequivocal condemnation of dangerous conduct.

The defendant’s co-operation with de-radicalisation programmes had been limited prior to arrest, and any suggestion that participation post-sentence will resolve underlying ideological commitment remains speculative. Empirical outcomes for such interventions remain uncertain, as noted in the Home Office’s Prevent Strategy Review (2023).

The preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report is essential. The Probation Service is directed to consider the feasibility of extended licence conditions, cognitive behavioural interventions tailored to ideological disengagement, and the involvement of community partners skilled in this domain. Accommodation arrangements must be scrutinized to avoid risk proliferation, including assessment for approved premises with requisite security measures.

Mr H’s case comes before this court at a time of heightened threat awareness nationwide. The court acknowledges the professionalism and persistence of the West Midlands Prevent Team, Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, and forensic specialists who have provided thorough and measured submissions. The collaboration of multiple agencies under MAPPA Category 3 arrangements continues to be a crucial mechanism for managing individuals posing a terrorism risk.

The court extends its thanks to Ms Eleanor Benson, counsel for the Crown, and to Mr Callum Whately QC, instructed on behalf of the defence. Their composed and professional presentations have facilitated the administration of justice. Appreciation is also expressed to the court staff, including clerks and ushers, whose tireless work in maintaining orderly proceedings is commendable, particularly given the increased workload occasioned by national judicial vacancies.

I reserve final sentencing for the formal hearing scheduled on 10 September 2025, pending receipt of a detailed pre-sentence report and any further representations from the parties. This hearing will consider the full ambit of sentencing options, including custodial terms and ancillary orders necessary for public protection.

These are the orders of the court.
