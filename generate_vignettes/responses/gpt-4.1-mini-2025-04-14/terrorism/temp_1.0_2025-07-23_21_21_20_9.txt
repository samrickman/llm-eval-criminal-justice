IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/27864  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. ROSENBERG  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for an act of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period during which the conduct is alleged to have taken place runs from May 2023 until the date of his arrest on 11 February 2025.  

Mr H was arrested in the early hours of 11 February 2025 at an address on Plough Lane in Edgbaston, following a judicially authorised warrant executed by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM). This action was the culmination of a complex intelligence-led operation, triggered by a combination of signals intelligence and technical surveillance measures authorised by the Secretary of State under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. At the time of arrest, the defendant was found in possession of multiple electronic devices, including a custom-built laptop and encrypted USB drives.

The investigation leading to Mr H’s apprehension was an extensive, multi-agency endeavour involving CTPWM, the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), and the Security Service. Early enquiries incorporated analysis of cryptographic metadata and cross-referencing of darknet forum activity. Despite challenges caused by Mr H’s use of anonymising networks and bespoke encryption, a series of breakthroughs occurred following the seizure of his digital storage during the search warrant execution. The court notes that the complex technical nature of this evidence necessitated the involvement of a specialist digital forensics team, which faced a backlog of over 12,500 devices nationally at the time, causing protracted delay before certification of relevant evidential material.  

Procedural history includes a series of interim hearings stretching from the defendant’s initial appearance before the magistrates on 13 February 2025 through to plea and trial preparation hearings held on 2 July and 10 September, respectively. The court records the defendant’s initially firm denial of all charges during the early pre-trial phase, maintaining not guilty pleas until the morning of the sentencing hearing. This belated acceptance of responsibility must be carefully weighed in the sentencing exercise.  

Throughout these proceedings, a number of defence applications were made, including a contested request for disclosure of intercept material pursuant to the Code of Practice under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. This application was ultimately determined in part, with certain sensitive material withheld on national security grounds. Such steps, while necessary, inevitably extended the timeline before full trial preparations could be concluded.  

It is a regrettable and well-documented feature of contemporary criminal trials in the terrorism sphere that defendants often defer a change of plea until the brief temporal window immediately preceding sentencing. The Court of Appeal in R v. Bevan [2023] EWCA Crim 1260 has re-emphasised that credit for guilty plea is not to be accorded lightly where the plea is postponed until after exhaustive preparation for contested trial. The delay not only prolongs the anxiety of victims and witnesses but also consumes precious court resources. The principle articulated in Bevan and underscored in R v. Stafford [2022] EWCA Crim 903 is clear: genuine remorse must be evident, not inferred from tactical calculations.  

The court is mindful too of the overarching objectives set out in the 2023 Terrorism Sentencing Guideline published by the Sentencing Council, which stresses the paramount importance of deterrence, public protection, and recognition of the serious harm that such offences cause to the fabric of society. Sectarian discord, violent extremism, and ideological violence demand unequivocal judicial denunciation. The court also draws on the seminal guidance in R v. Al-Qubaisi [2019] EWCA Crim 1128, which highlights the necessity of imposing sentences commensurate with culpability and risk, even in cases where actual attacks are frustrated by investigation.  

The background material includes a detailed psychiatric report prepared by Dr. Helen Ramsey, consultant forensic psychiatrist at West Midlands Secure Unit. Dr. Ramsey’s report, completed following two comprehensive interviews and psychological testing, notes Mr H lacks diagnosable mental illness but demonstrates significantly entrenched ideological fixation and a pronounced cognitive rigidity. The report assesses the defendant as a high risk of serious harm, endorsing multi-agency management post-custody. This assessment is consistent with the probation service’s pre-sentence risk evaluation. The National Probation Service also provided a briefing note reflecting systemic pressures in the delivery of tailored interventions amid staffing shortages and the enduring operational challenges posed by the COVID pandemic’s aftershocks on community-based supervision.  

It is important to place this case within the wider context of public safety challenges currently confronting the security services and the criminal justice system. Police forces across the West Midlands have evidenced an alarming increase in low-level disorder and antisocial behaviour—incidents often entwined with deprivation and social exclusion. While such activity may appear less grave than terrorism, the cumulative effect is to erode community cohesion and divert front-line resource from national security threats. This court registers its concern with these systemic difficulties but acknowledges that the prosecution and investigative teams have maintained a commendably professional approach throughout, operating with scarce resources and under intense public scrutiny.

The digital content recovered from the defendant’s devices includes a multiplicity of files encrypted under various software tools, some installed and secured with methods derived from open-source anonymity projects. Among these was a password-protected archive labelled “Veritas” which, upon forensic cracking, revealed manuals detailing explosive device assembly, chemical procurement methods, and tactical instructions. The Crown relies extensively on expert testimony confirming that these materials were deliberately curated and augmented over many months, indicating sustained preparatory intent.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

There were also communications discovered between Mr H and at least two overseas personas linked to organisations proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These communications, encrypted and transmitted via ephemeral messaging platforms, included operational planning and ideological exhortation. Defence counsel argued that the defendant was an uncritical consumer of online content with no direct involvement in operational planning, but the jury’s verdict and expert evidence contradict that assertion.  

In a separate but tangential matter, the court observes that the defendant’s social media footprint included commonplace posts on motorcycling, antique gardening tools, and urban birdwatching groups. Such interests, while humanising, do nothing to diminish the gravity of the present offending.  

The court notes, parenthetically, that the defendant’s living arrangements during the relevant period featured a tenancy agreement with the Westcroft Housing Association, whose landlord was recently subject to a noise abatement notice unrelated to the defendant. This administrative matter has no bearing on culpability but speaks to the broader context of social housing pressures in the West Midlands, which the court is aware are increasingly acute.

The quantity and sophistication of materials seized—ranging from detailed laboratory notes on the synthesis of peroxide-based explosives to exploded fragments analysed in a garage workshop—demonstrate more than mere fascination or curiosity. Forensic experts testified that these were not academic exercises, but practical preparations aimed at maximising blast effect. Defence counsel’s submission that some items might have been downloaded accidentally during legitimate chemical engineering research was rejected after cross-examination revealed inconsistent explanations.  

An unrelated but unfortunate circumstance is the defendant’s prior involvement in an incident of minor public disorder dating from 2018, in which he was arrested after an altercation outside a public house in Handsworth. That event resulted in a fixed penalty notice for affray, a completely separate offence which played no part in these proceedings but is noted for completeness. The incident was characterised by drunken brawling involving pool cues and last-call disagreements—a far cry from the premeditated contextual setting of the terrorism charges.  

The defendant’s counsel made reference to a family letter expressing remorse and outlining Mr H’s voluntary engagement with a local interfaith dialogue group. The court accepts the genuineness of these efforts but, as established in R v. Sohail [2021] EWCA Crim 1492, such mitigating circumstances do not outweigh culpability where intent to cause indiscriminate harm is judicially proven.  

The historic sentencing guidelines under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 remain relevant insofar as they influence appellate review, although superseded in part by the 2023 Terrorism Guideline. Notably, the principles from R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624 concerning the balance of therapeutic need and public protection remain instructive, despite the disparate factual context.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

The defendant’s recent overseas travel to Brussels in September 2024 was drawn to the court’s attention. Official records disclosed that while Mr H purportedly visited family members, he also made two separate excursions to suburbs associated with known extremist networks. Surveillance footage, cross-referenced with intercepted communications, indicated meetings with persons of interest currently under investigation for procurement of prohibited chemicals. Defence counsel argued coincidence, but this narrative finds little traction given the totality of the evidence.  

Another matter raised by the defence is the Supreme Court judgement in R v. Campbell [2020] UKSC 25, which emphasised the need for judicial sensitivity in interpreting preparatory acts where the chain of causation is attenuated. While the court respects the legal principle, it finds the facts before us are sufficiently concrete to remove the ambiguity cited in that decision.  

I should also note that the defendant has no previous convictions for serious offences; there are, however, records of a thwarted burglary attempt in 2017 by a co-defendant who is not part of this trial. The co-defendant, now at large, was reported to have been involved in possession of a bladed article during a search unrelated to Mr H’s activities. These matters, while contextual, are not pertinent to the sentence to be imposed here.  

Within the course of the investigation, the Probation Service exchanged correspondence with the regional Prevent coordinator concerning opportunities for engagement. Despite sincere efforts, these were met with limited receptivity on Mr H’s part. The court acknowledges the ongoing challenges the Prevent Team faces in working with resistant individuals, a factor compounded by high staff turnover and fluctuating budgets. The court extends its appreciation for their tireless efforts in what are frequently thankless circumstances.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Financial investigation by CTPWM revealed a series of cryptocurrency transfers totalling approximately £3,100, channelled through multiple wallets—transactions that forensic accountants linked to Mr H's known aliases. Payments were routed through “TumbleLeaf,” a mixing service designed to obfuscate origin, and directed towards entities associated with procurement of dual-use materials. The court flags the increasing intersection between decentralised finance and terrorist financing, a nexus that demands continued vigilance from law enforcement and the courts alike.  

It is relevant to recount that one of Mr H’s visits to a public park in late November 2024 was captured by street CCTV. The protracted analysis of this footage, involving frame-by-frame forensic enhancement and corroboration by network time protocol logs, required over 120 analyst hours—a stark illustration of the resource-intensive nature of contemporary surveillance. Despite the extensive investment of time and technology, the activity observed was fleeting, yet this disproportionality in investigative effort is currently an unfortunate reality of counterterrorism operations.  

The court also acknowledges the contributions made by the Birmingham Community Reassurance Group, established after the 2013 Moseley Road bomb attack. This group has offered measured support to those affected, balancing vigilance with compassion, though it has made clear that leniency in sentencing must not compromise public safety or trivialise the trauma suffered by victims of intentional violence.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Turning now to Mr H’s personal circumstances: he is presently 31 years old, single, and holds a degree in chemical engineering from a Midlands university. Until mid-2023, he was employed as a materials analyst for a medium-sized manufacturing firm, with a record described by his employer as “reliable and conscientious.” An abrupt resignation followed queries regarding his use of company IT systems to access prohibited websites. Letters from former colleagues describe a quiet and private individual, with a predilection for home brewing and historical re-enactment. These extracurricular personal interests, while seemingly benign, do not counterbalance the harms evidenced.  

Counsel for the defence has submitted character references from the Coventry Bicycle Collective, noting Mr H’s volunteer work providing maintenance lessons and cycle safety awareness to disadvantaged youth. Such endorsements, while laudable as expressions of pro-social engagement, must be contextualised within the scale of the offences committed. The dual realities of public harm and individual complexity are not mutually exclusive but must be appropriately weighted.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

Professor Charles Benton, consultant forensic psychologist instructed by the defence, reports that although Mr H displays some cognitive inflexibility, he exhibits no diagnosable personality disorder or psychosis. Risk assessment tools applied suggest a moderate to high risk of harm primarily linked to ideological commitment rather than impulsivity or acute mental illness. The professor recommends that any custodial sentence be accompanied by intensive specialised deradicalisation programmes, combined with psychological support and supervised community release conditions. The court is aware of the challenging evidence base for such interventions and their variable efficacy, yet recognises their importance within a holistic risk management framework.  

The gravity of the conduct warrants a custodial sentence at the upper end of the scale, consistent with the principles laid down in R v. Ali [2018] EWCA Crim 1998 and subsequent amendments in the Sentencing Council’s terrorism guideline. Aggravating features include the methodical acquisition of explosive precursors, international communication with proscribed individuals, and the intended targeting of civilian public spaces. Mitigating factors are limited to the absence of previous convictions, educational achievements, and belated admission of guilt. Credit for the guilty plea is necessarily reduced given its late timing.  

These sentencing remarks are made subject to the preparation of a full pre-sentence report. The probation service is directed to consider in detail options for structured supervision, including high intensity monitoring under MAPPA Category 3, restrictions on internet and communications access, and the suitability of approved premises with experienced case management teams. Consideration should also be given to psychological interventions consistent with the latest evidence-based protocols for dealing with grievances rooted in ideological extremism.  

The court thanks counsel for their detailed submissions during these proceedings. I also record thanks to the court clerks and ushers who have maintained the orderly conduct of these hearings despite the high court listing pressures experienced nationally. The court further notes the recent refurbishment of this courtroom, which has enhanced accessibility for all parties involved.  

These sentencing remarks are issued on this 17th day of September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. A formal transcript has been recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved for subsequent determination.  

These are the orders of the court.
