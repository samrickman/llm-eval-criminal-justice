IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/24059  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. S. FERREIRA  
Filed: 2 October 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence upon a charge under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, along with a related count under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, concerning possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism. The offending conduct spans the period from approximately September 2022 through to his arrest in April 2025.  

The defendant was apprehended at dawn on the 14th of April 2025 pursuant to a warrant issued by the Bristol Crown Court under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant arose following an intelligence-led investigation centered on encrypted communications traced to an internet service provider located in the South West region. Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), working alongside digital investigators at the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), effected the arrest after a seven-month surveillance operation. This surveillance entailed, inter alia, the lawful interception of internet data packets, mobile device tracking, and monitoring of suspected collaborators linked via dark web forums. At the place of arrest, officers seized multiple electronic devices including a personal laptop, several encrypted external hard drives, a 3-D printer, and assorted electronic components.

The operation culminated substantial investment of resources over an extended period. The law enforcement effort involved not only CTPSW but also collaboration with the Security Service, given the international dimensions of suspected overseas contacts. Evidence collation was inevitably encumbered by the standard issues arising in such cases—protracted decryption procedures for secured communications, maintaining strict controls over covert material, and allocating scarce analyst time on a background of intense demand across the national counter-terrorism spectrum. One must note that the analytical teams tasked with sifting the voluminous data streams faced significant capacity shortfalls, a limitation not easily dismissed. Similar constraints were documented in HMICFRS reports issued in 2024, highlighting chronic under-resourcing affecting frontline investigative units across the board.  

A preliminary hearing was convened on 8 June 2025, at which the defendant entered a plea of not guilty. The trial preparation hearing followed on 20 August 2025. It was not until the first day of trial on 27 September 2025—shortly after the Crown closed its case—that Mr H changed his plea to guilty on both counts. This late admission crystallizes the ongoing judicial challenge in balancing credit for guilty pleas against the imperative of fostering early acceptance of responsibility, as reflected in the authority of R v. Da Silva [2023] EWCA Crim 601, which underscores the link between timing and the extent of mitigation.  

It is regrettable but now familiar that defendants of serious and complex terrorism-related allegations often delay pleas until near the trial stage, a practice carrying tangible consequences for court efficiency and victims’ wellbeing. While the court is mindful of the mitigating potential of any guilty plea, timing remains critical. As the Court of Appeal reiterated in R v. Roberts [2024] EWCA Crim 910, the burden on judicial and prosecutorial resources from late pleas is considerable. The intended encouragement for early pleas is to enable victims, witnesses, and the courts to avoid the ordeal and cost attendant to protracted contested proceedings. Credit is discretionary, not automatic, and must be proportionate to the circumstances.  

The historical evolution of the legislation under which this matter is prosecuted is relevant context. The Terrorism Act 2006 initially arose as an amendment to previous counterterrorism statutes, notably the Terrorism Act 2000, adapting to new forms of threat post-9/11 and the London bombings of 2005. The statutory language concerning preparatory conduct under section 5 was crafted to capture conduct which, while not amounting to the commission of an attack, involved steps clearly intended to pave the way for terrorist acts. Judicial consideration of this section was notably elaborated in R v. Ahmed & Ors [2012] EWCA Crim 1715, where the Court underscored that preparation may include a wide range of activities, including research, buying or assembling explosive components, and reconnoitering targets. This case law informs the approach to culpability evaluation in the present matter.  

Indeed, the Crown relies heavily on digital forensic analysis, which uncovered evidence of encrypted communications with known radicalised individuals overseas, and possession of material consistent with intent to prepare improvised explosive devices. That said, the court acknowledges the defence’s argument concerning the multiplicity of document caches and the difficulty in establishing precise timing and intent for every file found. This point resembles considerations explored in R v. Dabbagh [2019] EWCA Crim 1031, where the overlap between possession of extremist content and actual intent was nuanced and required careful contextual weighing.  

The present proceedings have been conducted under considerable administrative challenge, not least due to the wide-ranging disclosure obligations mandated by the Criminal Procedure Rules and reinforced in terrorism cases by statutory requirements for careful handling of sensitive material. The Disclosure Officer from CTPSW deserves particular mention for expediting the vetting process despite the team’s reduced headcount and ever-increasing workload. Defence counsel, Mr Benjamin Rothwell, also merits recognition for his determined efforts to dissect the voluminous technical disclosures under severe time constraints imposed by the calendar. The Legal Aid Agency’s role in funding expert forensic advice has, however, continued to exemplify systemic failings. In particular, late authorization for critical expert expenditure occasioned a postponement of the trial date by three weeks, a disruption widely lamented within professional circles but too often dismissed as routine.  

Letter submissions from community agencies, including a local interfaith group, emphasised the adverse impact such trials have on community relations and cohesion, urging the court to consider carefully the wider effects of sentencing in terrorism contexts. While the court values the insights offered by these organisations, its primary obligation remains the administration of justice in accordance with the rule of law and public protection demands.

The defendant initiated multiple online pseudonymous blogs initially dedicated to commentary on political disenfranchisement and regional development issues. The evolution of the content towards more incendiary ideological exposition bears a striking resemblance to the trajectory identified in R v. Mahmood [2017] EWCA Crim 1234, where the court stressed the significance of online platforms as vectors for radicalisation. Linguistic analyses indicated frequent reproductions of phrases and manifestos associated with proscribed groups as recorded in intercept logs, confirming a sustained orientation towards extremist thinking rather than abstract academic interest.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

A significant volume of encrypted archives was recovered, including video recordings purporting to demonstrate explosive device fabrication and detonation tests conducted on makeshift gelatine blocks, in conditions consistent with the instructions found in the Defendant’s possession. The video footage included scenes filmed in a utilitarian garage, with visible makeshift testing rigs, and has been authenticated by forensic experts as genuine and recently produced, contrary to defence submissions suggesting archival or downloaded content. The appellate decision in R v. Khader [2021] EWCA Crim 1877 provides useful guidance in affirming that possession of such material, coupled with preparatory actions, satisfies the threshold for the offence under section 5.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Interestingly, the defence maintained that some of the photographic material depicting drone flight paths and aerial reconnaissance could be explained as a legitimate hobby, supported by Mr H’s Instagram feed featuring benign countryside exploration. However, forensic telecommunications analysis showed that the defendant’s drone was also used to capture footage over sensitive infrastructure, including electrical substations and transport networks, contradicting any benign use claim. The court recalls the observations of Lord Justice Holroyde in R v. Kane [2020] EWCA Crim 1653 — where purported “innocent” uses of technology were subordinated to the overall pattern of behaviour and context.  

The court notes the recovery of a small quantity of cannabis sativa seeds in a shared communal area of the residence. No charges have been pursued in respect of this, and while such detritus may reflect common adolescent experimentation or casual drug use, it has no bearing on the grave terrorism charges before the court. Furthermore, an isolated minor offence of shoplifting toiletries dating to 2017, involving an unrelated individual residing temporarily at the same address as Mr H, was brought to the court’s attention in mitigation but is rejected as relevant to the present sentencing exercise.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Mr H travelled to an ostensibly innocuous conference in Copenhagen in March 2024, declared as a cultural exchange initiative. Records indicate same-day travel onward by rail to the Danish-German border, where he made contact with an individual subsequently detained in an unrelated investigation for the importation of significant quantities of Class A narcotics concealed in secret compartments within freight containers. Intelligence reports indicate encrypted call logs between Mr H and this individual in the weeks preceding and following the conference. Although unrelated to the core facts as prosecuted, this information illustrates the broader networking of individuals involved in assorted serious criminality and extremist activity.  

Delays in the trial process, occasioned predominantly by availability issues of key electronic evidence analysts and consecutive weeks of court strike action affecting support staff, have been a regrettable feature. Indeed, the administrative burden imposed on the judicial system by chronic personnel shortages, ranging from legal clerks to psychological assessor availability, has been extensively documented by the Judicial Office’s 2025 Performance Review.  

The court notes the defendant’s brief period of employment at a regional manufacturing plant, from which Mr H was dismissed following discovery that he had accessed proscribed websites on company computers during working hours. The employer’s disciplinary report describes the incident as a serious breach of protocol but credits Mr H with previous punctuality and basic technical competence. Previous arrests of associates on charges of affray and possession of bladed articles—one involving a co-defendant in this inquiry—are acknowledged but have no direct material bearing on the defendant’s culpability here.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

A considerable amount of cryptocurrency-related transactions were unearthed during forensic financial investigations. Mr H moved the equivalent of approximately £3,200 in Bitcoin through an intermediary wallet to virtual vendors specialising in dual-use chemical apparatus and precision electronic components. The use of decentralised finance mechanisms, including coin mixers and privacy-centric wallets, exemplifies the increasingly sophisticated financial trails left by modern offenders. The court draws attention to the sentencing remarks in R v. Smithson [2023] EWCA Crim 1168, which highlight the challenges posed by such transactions to law enforcement and underscore their aggravating effect upon sentence due to the deliberate obfuscation.  

The court further reviewed surveillance footage from 17 October 2024 capturing Mr H near a municipal waste disposal site during early hours, accompanied by persons later identified through DNA analysis as unrelated casual acquaintances. The matter required over 120 man-hours of analyst input to corroborate with mobile network data and vehicle identification number (VIN) tracking. Such disproportionate investment of resources typifies the asymmetrical nature of contemporary counter-terrorism investigations, where fleeting appearances entail protracted verification.

The defendant is 28 years old. He holds an honours degree in electronic engineering from a regional university and resided with parents in a semi-rural neighbourhood, where he is described by family members as “quiet, deeply private, and occasionally moody.” A psychiatric report prepared by Dr Serena Valdez, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Avon Secure Hospital, concludes that Mr H suffers from no major mental disorder but exhibits traits of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and marked cognitive inflexibility. The report warns of a high risk of future extremist involvement absent sustained, intensive intervention. Defence counsel has called for consideration of engagement with specialised deradicalisation schemes. However, as this court has consistently noted, programme participation is no guarantee of desistance; comprehensive risk management is essential.  

Letters of support have been received from the Bristol Green Spaces Alliance documenting Mr H’s voluntary participation in community tree-planting and habitat restoration efforts. Additionally, a local library submitted a reference noting frequent attendance and assistance with technology workshops. These pro-social activities, candidly, while commendable, do not diminish the seriousness of the offences charged or mitigate the culpability found.  

Evidence presented outlined his mother’s long-standing battle with chronic illness and the considerable caregiving burden shoulder by the defendant over recent years. While familial hardship may temper personal circumstances, it cannot justify or excuse engagement in terrorist preparatory conduct. The court recognises the strain this places on households but must apply sentence consistent with the public interest.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Professor Adrian Coleman, consultant forensic psychologist, prepared a comprehensive report profiling Mr H’s ideological entrenchment, risk factors, and psychological functioning. The expert observed that the defendant demonstrates “highly polarised thinking, potent grievance narratives, and selective social isolation,” with a “predilection toward justifying violence as a means of moral rectitude.” The report assesses a significant risk of serious harm in the absence of prolonged secure containment and strict post-release management. The defendant’s capacity for empathy appears diminished in relation to civilian victims, a factor of concern mirrored in cases such as R v. Khalid [2022] EWCA Crim 789.  

The Sentencing Council's 2023 Guidelines for Terrorist Offences emphasize the primacy of public protection, individual culpability, and deterrence in sentencing decisions. The culpability considerations here are plainly high: the defendant was engaged in detailed planning, procurement of hazardous materials, and possessed explicit intent to carry out indiscriminate harm. Aggravating features include the sophistication of the encrypted communications network, the intended timing to coincide with a politically significant date, and his possession of knowledge acquired via advanced engineering studies that increased the risk of success.  

Mitigation is confined to the absence of previous convictions, the late though sincere guilty pleas, his young age, and the expressed engagement with community-based voluntary endeavours. The defendant’s remorse, such as it is, emerged only after overwhelming evidentiary pressure; the plea was not tendered at the earliest reasonable opportunity and so any discount must be commensurately modest.  

In preparing to sentence, the court directs the compilation of a detailed pre-sentence report, incorporating an assessment from probation officers experienced in extremism and terrorism cases. This report should assess whether a custodial sentence incorporating Extended Determinate Sentence provisions under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, possibly supplemented by licence conditions relating to association, electronic monitoring, and exclusion zones, would be appropriate. It should also explore potential for engagement with deradicalisation and psychological intervention, including readiness and likely compliance. The available capacity of approved premises and secure settings within the region must also be evaluated. The pre-sentence report should further comment on prospective risk management strategies balancing rehabilitation imperatives with public safety imperatives.  

The court acknowledges the increasing complexity facing frontline professionals tasked with managing cases of this nature. The probation service, police counter-terrorism units, mental health teams, and community agencies are collectively stretched, often operating beyond their mandated remit. Staff shortages and funding shortfalls have been a recurrent theme in recent Parliamentary reports and independent reviews. The presiding judge commends the dedicated efforts of all involved despite these constraints.  

This court also notes the strenuous efforts by the Legal Aid Agency to authorise timely expert instructions, although systemic delays and bureaucratic bottlenecks remain a source of frustration to defence counsel, impacting the right to a fair trial and meaningful representation. Some procedural adjournments regrettably reflect these institutional failings.  

Sentencing remarks are issued this 2nd day of October 2025 in Court 10 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is informed of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
