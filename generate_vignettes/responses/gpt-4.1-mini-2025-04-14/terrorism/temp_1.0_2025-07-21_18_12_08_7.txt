IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29348  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. W. CHAPMAN  
Filed: 15 August 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges brought under sections 5(1)(a) and 57 of the Terrorism Act 2006 and Terrorism Act 2000, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism and possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism. The timeline of the offending conduct, as established by the evidence, extends over a period from July 2023 until the date of the defendant’s arrest on 14 February 2025.  

Prior to addressing the substantive matters, the court records the procedural history of the case, which, while not exceptional, demonstrates the familiar complexities inherent in contemporary counter-terrorism prosecutions. The initial arrest followed an operation codenamed “EASTWAY,” involving Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), supported by forensic analysts from the National Cyber Crime Unit. The execution of search warrants at the defendant’s residence located in Sparkhill took place at approximately 07:00 hours, prompted by intelligence indicating enhanced encrypted communications consistent with preparatory activities. Seized material comprises multiple end-to-end encrypted devices, including a desktop computer, portable hard drives, and USB memory sticks, as well as certain chemical precursors subject to further analysis.

It bears noting, in passing, that the investigative process was prolonged by the necessity of engaging with international partners to break complex cipher layers, an operation that required multiple extensions of pre-charge bail under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Counsel for the defence had previously expressed reservations regarding disclosure timeliness; however, these delays arose from judicially sanctioned covert capabilities that demand caution in their application. The local housing context—characterised by high tenant turnover and frequent transitory occupancy—compounded operational difficulty, a circumstance detailed in intervention reports issued by the local authority’s housing department.  

The court has also considered contemporaneous reports relating to the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 procedures, which, while primarily designed for registered sex offenders and violent criminals, have been extended in this jurisdiction to cover individuals posing terrorism-related risk. The engagement of MAPPA in this case commenced promptly following charge, with representation from probation services, CT policing, forensic psychiatry, and local authority safeguarding teams. The level of inter-agency collaboration, regrettably, is not universally replicated across the country—a fact that speaks both to resource disparities and to systemic challenges in information sharing.  

Precedent offers normative guidance on sentence discount for guilty pleas. This matter featured a plea and trial preparation hearing held on 9 July 2025, at which Mr H initially pleaded not guilty. The guilty pleas in respect of both counts were entered on the morning of today’s sentencing hearing. Such lateness inevitably restricts the quantum of credit appropriately attributable. It is instructive to recall the Court of Appeal’s observations in R v. Smallwood [2023] EWCA Crim 2249, where it was emphasised that credit given must reflect not mere acknowledgement but timely acceptance of responsibility, manifest through an early plea mitigating the distress and inconvenience to victims and witnesses. The court also refers to R v. Traynor [2021] EWCA Crim 1567, which underlines that late pleas entered following an extensive forensic and evidential preparation do not warrant the full credit otherwise extendable.  

Historical sentencing practice for offences under the Terrorism Acts can be referenced at some length. The current regime follows the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (2023 edition), which codifies the mandatory life sentence prospect for the most serious forms of engagement in terrorism-related offending. Prior to the enactment of the Terrorism Act 2006, the framework for respondent conduct was considerably less codified, relying heavily upon common law and pre-existing statute. For example, the antiquated Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974 still serves as historical context for the legal evolution. This court, exercising the well-established practice of judicial reminder, recalls Coroner v. Richmond [1987] QB 241, which, despite its age and doctrinal distance, continues to underscore the societal imperative to safeguard public safety against ideologically motivated violence.

The defendant’s digital footprint was a major focal point of the prosecution’s case. Analysis of multiple devices revealed a blog maintained under the pseudonym “FoxDen.” Initially utilitarian and mundane, entries evolved over months from commentary on general geopolitical concerns into increasingly radical manifestos containing calls for violent protest. Linguistic experts engaged by the Crown offered detailed reports employing forensic stylometry, comparing messages with corpus materials from banned groups. While some defence submissions attempted to characterise the content as satirical or hyperbolic, the consistency with which extremist tropes were deployed, and the presence of encrypted communications coordinating logistical arrangements, persuaded the jury beyond reasonable doubt.

It is naturally relevant to mention the presence of forensic material recovered during searches that included documents encrypted and hidden behind plausible deniability containers such as VeraCrypt partitions labeled “TraditionalSudoku.” While the defense pointed toward benign intent, positing recreational cryptographic experimentation, the overall evidential climate, especially when coupled with analysis of correspondent encryption keys and their registration data, suggested this was a cover for storing tactical manuals and bomb-making instructions. The nuanced distinction drawn in R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 829 concerning the possession of incomplete files has been carefully considered but ultimately found inapplicable here due to the complete and verified presence of accomplice correspondence.

An unrelated matter observed during the course of the investigation warrants brief mention. The defendant’s flatmate was found to be in possession of an unlicensed bladed article in a car park adjacent to the premises on an unrelated occasion in October 2024. That offence, which did not relate to or involve Mr H, was swiftly handed over to the local magistrates’ court for summary disposal. The court notes this merely to emphasise the importance of avoiding conflation of cohabitant conduct with that of the defendant himself. Additionally, the landlord of the building was recently served a noise abatement notice due to complaints about amplified music during late evening hours, a matter entirely extraneous to the offence at hand.  

Throughout the investigative timeline, records indicate Mr H held employment as a mechanical technician at a regional electrical equipment supplier from May 2019 until his
