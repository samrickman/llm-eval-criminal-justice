IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/28904  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. R. MORGAN  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: one of engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges relate to events spanning a protracted investigation period from October 2022 through to the defendant’s arrest in January 2025.  

The defendant’s case unfolded amid significant operational and procedural complexity. His initial detention followed a warrant executed by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at his residence on 23 January 2025, executed under the auspices of section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, supported by intelligence derived from a combination of technical surveillance and human source input. The material seized included encrypted mobile devices, modular electronic components, and forensic digital evidence consistent with preparatory activity towards terrorism-related offences.  

It is necessary, before addressing the facts and evidence in detail, to acknowledge the role of investigative agencies under increasing operational strain. The CTPSW, as documented in their annual public report, operate under conditions of sustained workload pressure, reflective of a broader national trend seen within law enforcement and security services that balance national security and community policing demands. Intelligence processes also encompass the challenges posed by technological innovation and encryption methodology, which often prompt significant delay in evidence extraction and analysis. These practical constraints invariably feature in terrorism investigations and may affect timetables, aggravating both prosecutorial and defensive efforts alike.  

Before proceeding further, the court pauses to note that the prosecution and defence have both exhibited professionalism during the protracted pre-trial process, which has involved multiple applications for disclosure adjustments, legal aid funding disputes, and procedural hearings. The cooperation of the Legal Aid Agency has been intermittently satisfactory; however, defence counsel has reported certain delays particularly around the authorisation of funding for forensic digital experts, echoing concerns raised by the Criminal Bar Association regarding systemic resourcing shortfalls affecting complex cases.  

It is also pertinent to reflect on the broader social context within which this case arises. The last decade has seen a marked increase in the complexity and diversification of extremist activity in the United Kingdom, including a proliferation of self-radicalising individuals utilising online platforms in an increasingly decentralized pattern. The investigative effort to counteract such threats requires not only policing skill but also sustained multi-agency collaboration. Indeed, multi-agency risk assessment forums such as MAPPA have been tasked with a non-traditional enlargement of responsibilities to accommodate the monitoring and management of individuals posing an ideological extremism risk in addition to those convicted of sexual or violent offences.  

In this connection, the role of the Prevent programme, established under the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015, remains a subject of public and professional debate. In the defendant’s case, a referral was made by a university lecturer in early 2021 following the production of coursework containing troubling themes and rhetoric. The referral was considered by the local Channel panel but discontinued after initial engagement failed to yield sustained participation from Mr H. That Panel’s function is not to act as a punitive agency but to identify and address risk factors through tailored support. The fact that contact did not develop beyond preliminary stages illustrates one of the enduring challenges Prevent faces in achieving meaningful early intervention.  

The court must further record that, throughout this prolonged legal process, a number of letters and statements of support have been submitted from community charities and local elders, focusing primarily on Mr H’s prior voluntary work as a youth mentor and member of an urban conservation group. These submissions do not negate the gravity of the offences but do speak to a degree of layered personality and community involvement.  

Of procedural note, the case experienced adjournments associated with operational listing difficulties due to concurrent industrial action affecting court staff across Bristol Crown Court and regional courts generally, as well as an administrative delay in securing a suitable lead counsel authorised by the Legal Aid Agency. These unavoidable interruptions, while regrettable, did not ultimately prejudice the defendant’s right to a fair and timely hearing.  

It is also necessary to mention that the court received a report from the South Bristol Youth and Community Trust describing the socio-economic challenges facing local neighbourhoods. These communities have witnessed a troubling pattern of radicalisation activity catalysed by a sense of political disenfranchisement and economic stagnation. While understandably instinctive, a simplistic equation of community remorse with reduction in sentence would be misplaced. The role of neighbourhood groups and civil society remains vital, yet the complexities of ideological extremism must be confronted directly and proportionately.  

More prosaically, it is worth highlighting the strain endured by the NHS forensic psychiatric services. The Eastville Secure Clinic, responsible for preparing the comprehensive expert report on the defendant, has experienced a 22-week waiting list for initial assessments during this investigation period, due largely to staffing shortages and increased national demand. This reflects a broader, systemic undersupply of specialist forensic mental health assessments nationally, contributing to delay and compounding the difficulties posed by complex case management in terrorism prosecutions.  

Moving to legal precedent, the court recalls the guidance of the Court of Appeal in R v. Yasin Ali [2021] EWCA Crim 1897, where it was affirmed that sentencing for preparatory terrorism offences must reflect both the culpability of the offender and the potential catastrophic consequences should plans have come to fruition. The judgment in that case, involving the attempted orchestration of an attack on densely populated civic infrastructure, underscores the judiciary’s dual responsibility: to send a clear deterrent message and to effect public protection through appropriate custodial terms.  

It is also helpful to recall the principles set out in R v. Shamim [2022] EWCA Crim 1023, where the Court dealt with a conviction for possession of explosive precursors with intent to supply. The defendant in that case had operated a sophisticated supply chain, and the Court reiterated that time served in remand may not adequately reflect the serious breaches of trust and national security inherent in terrorism-related supply offences.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

The facts of the case are as follows: Mr H engaged in conduct consistent with preparation for acts of terrorism through acquisition and attempted assembly of explosive components; he possessed materials able to be converted for use as detonators and was in possession of digital instructional manuals demonstrating advanced technical knowledge. Multiple encrypted communications recovered from his devices indicated contact with individuals linked to foreign extremist groups, which the Crown
