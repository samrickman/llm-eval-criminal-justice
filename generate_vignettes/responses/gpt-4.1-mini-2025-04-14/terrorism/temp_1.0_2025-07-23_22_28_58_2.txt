IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/19786  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. A. POOLEY  
Filed: 27 August 2025  

Mr Mr H stands before this court for sentence following conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The alleged offending conduct is dated between April 2023 and the defendant’s arrest in January 2025.  

The case before the court has been subject to lengthy procedural and evidentiary developments. The defendant was arrested at 04:45 hours on 14 January 2025, pursuant to a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands officers and colleagues from the West Midlands Fire Service executed the search at a residential address in Harborne. This operation was the endpoint of an extensive and resource-intensive investigation involving surveillance, digital forensics, and intelligence sharing between regional and national agencies. The items seized included encrypted laptops, multiple storage devices, specialist electronic equipment, and printed material that formed the evidential basis for the charges.

The investigation—codenamed Operation REDHERRING—required the coordination of several governmental arms, including the Security Service, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and local law enforcement. The defendant’s digital footprint was reconstructed by a team of forensic analysts using advanced data recovery techniques, including the partial decryption of files protected by sophisticated cryptographic protocols. These procedures were constrained by capacity challenges and workforce shortages, issues that have come to define counter-terrorism investigatory work across the country, as noted recently in the Home Office’s 2025 annual policing report.  

In respect to procedural history, this case has experienced several adjournments, principally due to the late disclosure of material requiring sensitive handling, and also because of the defendant’s own withdrawal of early instructions following a change in legal representation in June 2025. It is regrettable that delays imposed by the Legal Aid Agency in authorising funds for expert forensic review have hampered defensive investigative sanity checks. Similar performance issues in funding administration have been flagged in ongoing Parliamentary debates as well as in reports by the Justice Select Committee. These matters, while peripheral to the facts, do weigh on the ability of defendants to mount robust challenges within acceptable timeframes.  

Issues concerning the Mental Health Act and the availability of forensic psychiatric expertise were raised by the defence in a hearing on 12 July 2025. The court is grateful for the thoroughness of correspondence from Dr Joanna Fields, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose independently prepared report was submitted on 1 August 2025. Dr Fields notes that although the defendant displays no diagnosable psychiatric illness, he demonstrates personality traits consistent with rigidity and obsessive ideation. It is a feature common to many who embrace extremist manifestos that there is a degree of cognitive inflexibility coupled with a profound alienation from broader societal narratives, a point underscored in the seminal text by Dr Patel et al. (2019), *The Psychosocial Dynamics of Radicalisation*.  

By way of contextual exploration, some pertinent case law on this topic is well established. In R v. El-Moussaoui [2015] EWCA Crim 123, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the possession of extremist material, even absent direct operational acts, may justify substantial custodial sentences where there is clear evidence of intent. Meanwhile, R v. Kamara [2021] EWCA Crim 245 highlighted the necessity for strict scrutiny of the defendant’s proximity to harm, with sentencing principles reflecting both general deterrence and specific public protection imperatives. These decisions, alongside the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guidelines, set a clear framework within which this court must operate.  

Turning to procedural steps, the Pre-Trial Review convened remotely on 9 June 2025 was notable for the inclusion of a comprehensive schedule of unused material and an agreed witness list that ran to eight pages. Despite the exigencies of an ongoing national industrial dispute affecting court staffing levels, the case was well managed by all parties. Counsel for the Crown, Ms Elinor Mace, and the defendant's newly instructed solicitor, Mr Julian Prescott, deserve acknowledgement for their professionalism under difficult circumstances.  

The court has noted with interest a written submission received from the West Midlands Integration Council, dated 14 August 2025. This letter, signed by the Community Outreach Coordinator Ms Saira Malik, expresses concern for the potential impact that harsh sentencing might have on community relations and cohesion. While the court is aware of the delicate balance to be maintained in avoiding alienation or stigmatization, its primary obligation must remain to the protection of the wider public and the upholding of the rule of law. Similar concerns were voiced in much earlier submissions by community faith leaders in the Dovetail Report (2017), an influential document on counter-extremism strategies.  

The defendant’s background discloses no previous convictions, though he has a documented history of relatively minor public order offences, including a caution for possession of a bladed article at a local music festival in 2018. Such offences, whilst regrettable, are peripheral and do not provide substantial indications of present risk, though the repeated contacts with law enforcement agencies do illustrate a pattern of confrontation with authority.

Mr H was observed maintaining blogs featuring content that shifted from innocuous political commentary toward increasingly radical ideological assertions. The use of coded language and metaphor, as detailed in expert linguistic evidence, supports the Crown’s contention that the defendant sought to inspire acts of violence, consistent with the criteria outlined in R v. Malik [2018] EWCA Crim 771.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Such narrative development coincided with an online presence characterised by the sharing of documents produced by proscribed entities under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000, including manuals concerning improvised explosive devices and incendiary materials. Notwithstanding the defence's suggestion that these documents were accessed out of “academic curiosity,” the court finds this explanation undermined by the volume, frequency, and deliberate concealment of materials within encrypted containers.  

The court recognises the prosecution’s reliance on digital forensic evidence retrieved from multiple sources, including subterranean cloud storage and anonymised peer-to-peer networks. The logistical effort required to process and authenticate these data points was substantial, with specialist officers reporting numerous technical challenges, exacerbated by the defendant’s use of VPNs and layered encryption. These operational difficulties are emblematic of contemporary challenges in counter-terrorism investigations and impact judicial timeliness.  

The court is mindful that in R v. Lamarr [2016] EWCA Crim 1108, the Court of Appeal admonished sentencing judges to weigh both the intrinsic danger posed by the defendant and the extent to which preparatory conduct was disrupted before any actual harm ensued. The Lamarr principles continue to shape sentencing policy in this jurisdiction, particularly in early intervention cases.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The notion that the defendant’s supposed “scientific pursuits,” including drone flight and aerial photography, might explain the acquisition of certain equipment used to test explosive dissemination theories, was weighed carefully. However, as confirmed by expert testimony from Dr Evan Sharp, a specialist in unmanned aerial systems, the defendant’s manipulations went far beyond amateur experimentation, involving modifications indicative of hostile intent.  

As is often the case, a multitude of background factors emerged during the trial. These included the defendant’s academic record, which reflects a degree in electrical engineering from Midlands University, awarded with upper second-class honours in 2021. His subsequent employment history showed an abrupt termination following adverse internal security reviews during which he declined to disclose associations with certain online forums, raising concerns about ideological influence within the workplace environment.  

Consideration was given during mitigation submissions to the defendant’s active participation as a volunteer at the City Central Food Bank, a service attending to individuals with hardship and housing insecurity. While the court respects and appreciates such civic efforts, it must also observe that commendable community work does not mitigate intent to commit terrorism. Such arguments have been disapproved in previous cases, including the authoritative judgment of R v. Wilcox [2019] EWCA Crim 2123.  

The defendant’s defence team tendered character evidence comprising letters from family members and acquaintances, illustrating a more complex portrait. One letter from his mother, dated 3 August 2025, describes a childhood shaped by economic deprivation and social isolation, with intermittent psychiatric intervention in adolescence. The court notes such social history, although these do not serve to excuse offending but might aid correctional planning.  

Correspondence from the West Midlands Prevent Hub, dated 15 July 2025, details substantial efforts to engage the defendant in intervention programmes, including cognitive behavioural therapy modules designed to address grievance narratives underpinning radicalisation. The defendant’s attendance was partial and marked by frequent disengagement, a pattern well documented in the Prevent Case Management Meetings despite professional persistence.  

There was also mention, during the sentencing hearing, of a separate ongoing investigation involving the defendant’s former flatmate, who faces charges unconnected with terrorism, relating to the theft of telecommunications equipment from a rail depot in nearby Solihull. The court emphasises that such unrelated allegations bear no relevance to Mr H’s proceedings and that guilt or innocence in those matters is for another forum to determine.

Travel records indicate a journey undertaken in October 2023 to Brussels, ostensibly to attend a cultural festival. CCTV and mobile device analysis place the defendant at a cafe frequented by known members of extremist networks, and intercept evidence includes encrypted communications with individuals under investigation overseas. The defence claimed that such associations were coincidental or social; however, the court gives little weight to this, considering the broader evidential landscape.  

This case involved extensive disclosure obligations requiring the Crown to provide the defendant with thousands of pages of material, including intercepted communications, witness statements, and technical diagrams. The onerous and complex nature of counter-terrorism disclosure work is well-recognised in judicial circles, as highlighted in the Justice Annual Review 2024. Furthermore, the court acknowledges the multiple protective orders necessary to ensure security sensitivities were balanced against the defendant’s right to a fair trial.  

Among the material overlooked by some commentators was an administrative note from a probation officer assigned to supervise individuals with ideological risk concerns. The officer, not involved in this matter at present, was tragically arrested in 2024 on suspicion of corruption and malingering, an event that disrupted service delivery across the Regional Probation Directorate for several months. Such incidents, while unconnected to the defendant, underline systemic vulnerabilities faced in the rehabilitation landscape.  

Cryptocurrency transactions were a feature of the financial investigation. Forensic accountancy found multiple transfers from wallets linked to Mr H, including a notable purchase in December 2024 of a so-called “chemical synthesis kit,” advertised anonymously on darknet marketplaces. The difficulty forensic examiners face in circumventing privacy-enhancing technologies in such transactions is well documented by the National Crime Agency’s 2023 report on illicit finance.

These efforts to finance procurement of dual-use materials for potential terrorist manufacture illustrate how new financial innovations continue to challenge established regulatory frameworks, a matter engaging policymakers and legislators worldwide. The cross-jurisdictional complexity of enforcement is considerable and well beyond the scope of this sentencing exercise, but awareness of such challenges is appropriate in framing the gravity of modern terrorism cases.  

The court has examined CCTV footage showing the defendant’s nocturnal visit to a disused industrial estate on 22 November 2024. Surveillance analysts expended considerable hours synchronising images from multiple cameras, many of degraded quality, to track his movements. The painstaking detail involved in such surveillance capacity is emblematic of the asymmetrical nature of intelligence-led policing: hours or days of work may be necessary to corroborate minutes of activity, a reality rarely appreciated outside law enforcement circles.  

This court recalls the decision in R v. Benson [2017] EWCA Crim 333, where meticulous digital surveillance formed a crucial pillar of the prosecution case in a large-scale conspiracy involving explosives. It serves as a reminder of the complexity inherent in prosecuting modern terrorism offences and the patience the courts must exercise in assessing evidence that is often technical and opaque.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning now to his personal circumstances: Mr H is 30 years old. Social care reports indicate that he was raised in a fractured family setting, with early discontinuities in education and reported bullying episodes during secondary school. His probation file notes sporadic employment and a period of homelessness between 2019 and 2021, albeit brief. Letters from community groups paying tribute to his intermittent participation in local sports coaching during those years provide a partial counterpoint to this narrative.  

Two letters of support have been submitted on his behalf. The first from the Arborvale Youth Mentors details his involvement prior to 2023 in supporting disadvantaged teenagers. The second, from the Holloway Theatre Company, notes his work as a stage crew assistant, an endeavour the defendant undertook selectively. These portray a man of some ability to integrate socially, notwithstanding the darker trajectory outlined in the professional assessments.  

Consultant forensic psychologist Dr Clementine Ward was instructed to prepare a report focusing on risk and rehabilitative prospects. Her findings describe Mr H as “exceeding average levels of cognitive fixity and exhibiting a degree of ideological moral absolutism.” Notably, she found no diagnosable psychosis or mood disorder, but nonetheless assessed that the defendant posed a significant ongoing risk of ideological re-engagement absent intensive supervision. The report places emphasis on the importance of targeted behavioural therapy and structured disengagement frameworks, though it tempers optimism with the caution that many individuals with comparable profiles often “fail to make sustained progress.”  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The sentencing exercise before the court is complicated by the dual imperatives of public protection and rehabilitation. The guidelines require assessment of culpability, harm potential, mitigating factors and plea timing. The court recalls the observations of Lord Justice Singh in R v. Abdulrahman [2024] EWCA Crim 1111, emphasising that the maximum penalty—life imprisonment—must be reserved for those whose dangerousness and culpability fall into the highest category. Mr H’s role, though grave, does not warrant the utmost custodial severity in this instance but nonetheless demands a stringent and extended custodial sentence.  

Relevant to mitigation is the defendant’s lack of previous serious criminal history, his educational background, and his late, but acknowledged, guilty pleas. The pleas were entered just prior to trial commencement, which, while preferable to trial, limits the discount that may be allowed under the guidelines. The court is mindful of the strain that late pleas place on judicial and prosecutorial resources, as well as on witnesses and victims, whose distress is compounded by prolonged uncertainty. There has been no suggestion of cooperation or assistance to the authorities beyond acceptance of responsibility.  

The court has directed the preparation of a pre-sentence report, requesting that probation services consider the feasibility of extended rehabilitation under strict licensing conditions. Explorations should include the utility of speciality psychological support, electronic monitoring, and placement in approved premises with restrictions on communication and association. The report should also assess accommodation options capable of providing a supportive yet secure environment on release.  

This hearing has taken place in open court, in the presence of Mr Julian Prescott for the defendant and Ms Elinor Mace of the Crown Prosecution Service. The court expresses appreciation to all parties for their detailed submissions and for the professionalism exhibited throughout what has been a challenging and complex process. The layout of the courtroom, refurbished only last year, continues to provide an appropriate setting for such significant proceedings. However, the court wishes to place on record frustration with ongoing delays in interpreter services observed during an earlier hearing in July, which served only to exacerbate procedural pressure.  

In sum, this case exemplifies many of the difficulties confronting the criminal justice system in responding effectively to terrorism offences in an era of technological complexity, resource strain, and sociopolitical tension. The balance between civil liberties, efficient justice, and public safety remains delicate, necessitating sober judicial conduct and comprehensive sentencing frameworks.  

These sentencing remarks are made this day, 27 August 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be duly transmitted and recorded with all requisite bodies. The defendant is duly advised of his right of appeal under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, with the usual time limits for lodging such an appeal. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
