IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/32940  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Olivia J. Trenholm  
Filed: 15 October 2025  

Mr H appears before this court today for sentence on charges under the Terrorism Act. The indictment alleges one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending dates, as alleged, span from September 2022 until Mr H’s arrest in January 2025.

The procedural history is such that Mr H initially appeared at the magistrates’ court on 14 January 2025 and was remanded into custody pending committal. The case was allocated to the Crown Court on 23 January 2025, with first hearing held on 9 February 2025 before the duty judge, who set a trial date for 30 August 2025. Due partly to listing pressures associated with the nationwide strike action by court clerks in spring 2025, and partly due to late disclosure applications from the defence, the trial was adjourned on two occasions, finally settling on a date of 4 November 2025. The plea and trial preparation hearing occurred on 10 September 2025. At that juncture, Mr H pleaded not guilty, maintaining that plea until the morning of today’s hearing when he changed it to guilty on both counts.

It is a regrettable yet all-too-common feature of modern proceedings in serious terrorism cases that guilty pleas are often entered at the final stage. While the courts accept that the defence act within their professional remit to protect clients' interests, it is incumbent upon counsel and defendants alike to appreciate the considerable cost and distress borne by further delays. As the Court of Appeal observed in R v. Lomax [2021] EWCA Crim 1084, “late guilty pleas, made after extensive evidence preparation and disrupted trial timetables, offer the public and victims little solace.” The reduction in sentence available pursuant to the guidelines is thereby appropriately limited.

Since this matter pertains to extremely serious charges within the ambit of national security, a summary of the statutory sentencing framework is warranted. Under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on terrorism, revised in 2023, emphasizes deterrence and protection of the public as paramount sentencing objectives, tempered by the recognition of any mitigating personal circumstances and the defendant’s level of cooperation. The principles established in landmark cases such as R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. Rahman [2015] EWCA Crim 773 continue to shape judicial discretion in this unrelenting domain.

The court further notes that distractions within contemporary public safety dialogue, such as equating ideologically inspired crime with broader social pathologies, must be navigated cautiously. It is worth acknowledging, as articulated in R v. Morgan [2019] EWCA Crim 422, that “radicalisation is neither a disease nor an inevitable trajectory,” but legal scrutiny remains fixated on defined criminal conduct rather than sociological categorization.

Meanwhile, recent publications from the Ministry of Justice have highlighted increasing pressures on probation services, notably an uptick in high-risk offender caseloads following reclassification of terrorism-related cases under Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3. The operational burden is well documented, reflecting in delayed report preparatory times and growing concerns about resource allocation in regions including the South West.

The court would like to extend thanks, in this matter, to the dedicated counsel representing the Crown, Ms Alexandra Breslin, and to Mr David Kershaw, who acts with commitment and professionalism on behalf of Mr H pursuant to a Legal Aid certificate. That certification process took longer than anticipated, with the Legal Aid Agency’s delays impacted by increased volume of terrorism-related matters across the jurisdiction. Such administrative challenges cannot be allowed to undermine the integrity of representation but do occasion unwelcome adjournments.

Further, the enduring efforts of the Multi-Agency Case Management Group in Bristol deserve recognition. Its representatives, comprising officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West, the local Probation Service, and NHS forensic psychiatrists, have provided joint oversight on risk and resettlement planning. Notably, the involvement of Detective Inspector Sarah Elms and Dr Faisal Nawaz has been instrumental in formulating proposals for post-custodial monitoring.

It is essential to observe, in wider context, that the intersection of digital forensics and counter-terrorism policing has dramatically altered investigative approaches. The pace and complexity of gathering, analysing, and interpreting digital evidence are formidable. As highlighted in a 2024 report by the National Digital Forensics Centre, the backlog of devices awaiting scrutiny has nearly doubled, imposing pressure on investigative timelines. This case is illustrative of those operational constraints.

Turning now to precursors in case law, in R v. Mistry [2020] EWCA Crim 849, the Court underscored that sentencing should reflect not only the potential harm threatened but the sophistication of the offender’s preparation, with particular attention paid to the use or attempted acquisition of incendiary devices. While that case involved an actual failed attempt to ignite a device in a public space, the guiding principles remain applicable in assessing culpability even where harm was averted.

Moreover, the case of R v. Barnes [2022] EWCA Crim 1502 elucidated the importance of crediting genuine cooperation during police interviews and in the disclosure of further information. Though the court accepts that Mr H’s cooperation was manifest only at a late stage, it remains a factor of consideration.

Prior to setting out relevant facts, it is appropriate to record that the defendant was subject to digital monitoring throughout the investigation period, including under Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act warrants. These surveillance measures revealed online interactions with proscribed entities and utilisation of encrypted applications protected by end-to-end protocols. Of note, the defendant’s internet history indicated access to manuals banned under section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

In addition to surveillance, the inquiry benefited from input by the Eastern Regional Mental Capacity Assessment Team, which conducted a preliminary risk screening in February 2025. Their report, tendered by consent, indicated no diagnosable mental disorder but did note signs of “cognitive rigidity and heightened distrust of governmental institutions,” consistent with profiles typical in some radicalised individuals.

The defendant had earlier engagements with a Prevent initiative, initially referred by a local school in
