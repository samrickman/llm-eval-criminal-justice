IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/31940  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge I. T. Grantham  
Filed: 3 October 2025  

Mr Mr H stands before this court for sentence upon conviction for offences contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts, and for possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct, as identified by the prosecution, relates to a period spanning from late 2022 through to his arrest in April 2025. These proceedings have, by reason of their complexity and the volume of material, extended over several months with multiple interlocutory hearings and applications, each of which has been managed with rigor and attention by all parties concerned.

The defendant was arrested at 04:48 on 21 April 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed by officers from West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), acting in concert with the National Cyber Crime Unit. The warrant was predicated upon a judicially reviewed application under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. It was supported by intelligence from the Security Service, gathered through covert means, including signal intercept and network disrupt operations. At the time of his arrest, Mr H was found in possession of various electronic devices, including encrypted smartphones, encrypted external drives, and a homemade digital router with a network anonymisation interface.

The operation that led to his apprehension represents a coordination of efforts across multiple agencies, including the National Crime Agency, the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism, and locally the Birmingham Metropolitan Police Force. This operation was unusual in its extended duration and multi-modal intelligence gathering, incorporating electronic surveillance, HUMINT sources, and digital forensics. The forensic efforts involved the triage and decryption of a large cache of data, some of which reportedly employed sophisticated encryption protocols consistent with open-source anonymity tools such as Tor and I2P networks.

The history of these offences and the legislative framework governing them must be situated within the broader evolution of counterterrorism law in this jurisdiction. The Terrorism Act 2006, enacted after extensive parliamentary debate amid heightened security concerns, defines an assortment of preparatory offences with the aim of capturing those engaged in early-stage planning or facilitation of terrorism. The statute's extraterritorial reach, specified under sections 57 to 59, reflects the global nature of modern threat profiles and the necessity of a legal regime capable of addressing non-traditional modes of terrorist enterprise.

The prolonged duration of this case has tested the resources of the involved agencies and the endurance of the Crown Court's listing regime. Initial listing aimed for a plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) in August 2025 but was deferred due to delays in securing appropriate expert reports, most notably from the specialist digital forensics team at the National Cyber Crime Centre. These deferments, though regrettable, exemplify the challenges faced by courts in managing cases of this nature, where the technical complexity of evidence often exceeds that found in conventional criminal trials.

There are well-documented procedural precedents for managing such cases efficiently. The Better Case Management (BCM) pilot has been cited in criminal policy reviews, including the comprehensive report submitted to the Ministry of Justice in 2024, which advocates for enhanced digital disclosure protocols and improved inter-agency case coordination. The objectives remain clear: to mitigate delay, reduce the strain on court rolls, and ensure prompt justice, especially where matters of national security are concerned.

Turning to the issue of plea, Mr H initially pleaded not guilty at the earliest hearings, maintaining this stance through two preliminary case management hearings in June and July 2025, respectively. It was not until the sentencing stage that he entered a guilty plea to all counts, a development meriting sober judicial consideration regarding its timing and consequential sentence credit. The court must remind itself, drawing on established authority such as R v. Worthy [2023] EWCA Crim 913 and R v. Hadlow [2021] EWCA Crim 1154, that the timing of a plea impacts the degree of discount warranted. Delayed pleas entered only when the prosecuting case is irrefutable offer limited benefit to victims, witnesses, and the court system.

It might be noted incidentally that the defendant’s initial resistance to plea resulted in an additional week’s delay in the hearing timetable, compounded by a last-minute application to admit a medical report, which necessitated recall of the court’s expert forensic advisor. The impact on the court’s listing planned for September 2025, including consequential displacement of three other cases duly listed for trial, is yet another procedural cost borne by the administration of justice. These ripple effects underscore the delicate balancing act the judiciary must maintain amidst systemic pressures.

While the present case is neither the first nor the last of its kind to traverse these procedural vicissitudes, the court is compelled to underscore the importance of timely cooperation in the interests of justice and public confidence. That said, this court acknowledges the considerable workload faced by defence counsel, appointed under a Legal Aid certificate, who has pressed for additional time to engage independent expert witnesses, with the sanction of the court, in order to ensure a fair and just hearing. The role of the Legal Aid Agency in extending appropriate support within constrained budgets remains a thorny issue, yet the court affirms the procedural safeguards designed to protect defendants’ interests.

Public safety is, of course, paramount. It is with that in mind that courts weigh the peculiarities of each offender’s case, including the extent of their technological sophistication, the nature and immediacy of the threat posed, and the psychological profile of the defendant. This court is grateful to receive a thorough pre-sentence psychiatric report prepared by Dr Lena Whittaker, an independent forensic psychiatrist, whose detailed observations provide invaluable insight into Mr H’s mindset and risk factors. In her report dated 24 September 2025, Dr Whittaker notes a protracted history of socially withdrawn behaviour, a marked tendency toward cognitive rigidity, and persistent grievance-fueled narratives consistent with certain ideological extremisms. She notes, however, an absence of diagnosable psychotic disorder or acute mental illness. This distinction informs, but does not diminish, her assessment of ongoing risk and propensity for re-engagement in extremist conduct.

The pre-sentence report also highlights systemic issues of NHS forensic service capacity. Waiting times for secure psychiatric assessment nationally now extend beyond six months, impeding timely diagnostic evaluations essential for tailored risk management. The court regrets this but affirms that sentencing must proceed in accordance with available evidence.

The digital evidence forms the backbone of the prosecution’s case. Analysis of Mr H’s online activity revealed a significant body of material, including links to a closed encrypted online community monitored by CTU. He engaged in exchanges involving technical manuals adapted from open-source materials, which the prosecution contend were repurposed for use in explosives manufacture.

The Crown’s case highlighted the import of material surfaced during covert surveillance spanning a period of seventeen months, culminating in detailed logs of encrypted chat transcripts and file exchange on darknet platforms. The defendant’s role in procuring specific components and sharing them with co-conspirators was emphasised. The court recognises that such data require considerable expertise to extract, interpret, and present in a comprehensible manner. This stands in stark contrast to the raw data, which in itself remains largely unintelligible until subjected to painstaking forensic decryption.

In looking back over precedent, it is instructive to consider the guidance in R v. Balfour [2020] UKSC 34, which clarified the parameters of possession offences under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The court here applied a purposive approach, underscoring that mere possession without context is insufficient to establish a criminal offence unless linked to demonstrable intention or preparatory acts. The facts in this case clearly meet that threshold.

Similarly, R v. Zarrouk [2021] EWCA Crim 784 involved possession of components for improvised explosive devices, with expert testimony confirming the defendant’s understanding of the end goal. The judgment served as a reminder that courts must adopt a holistic view, incorporating motive, capacity, and opportunity in assessing culpability.

One must draw a clear analytical distinction between such indictable terrorism offences and the often overlapping, yet separate, offences commonly found in other criminal domains. This is not to downplay their severity. Indeed, it must be noted that some of Mr H’s associates, currently pending their own trials, face charges including aggravated burglary with intent to steal firearms from a private residence, an offence entirely unconnected with the terrorism charges before this court. Those cases involve distinct evidential pathways and separate judicial interventions.

Among the items recovered during police searches were components frequently encountered in hobbyist electronics, including lithium-ion batteries commonly used in remote-control devices and drone recreational equipment. Defence counsel proffered that Mr H had an established interest in remote-control model vehicles, substantiated by recent purchase receipts and social media posts unrelated to extremism. The court assessed these submissions but finds them insufficient to detract from the narrative of misuse elucidated by the prosecution’s evidence.

It is unfortunate that this court must also consider the impact such cases have on community relations in areas already burdened by socio-economic deprivation and under-resourced policing. Reports from Birmingham City Council indicate a rising number of street homelessness and anti-social behaviour incidents across the city centre, many involving substance misuse and urgent mental health needs. These developments strain the capacity of emergency services and social care provision.

The court is further mindful of the immense pressures facing the Probation Service, which faces historic staffing shortages and significant caseload increases. As documented in the Lord Chancellor’s annual report for 2024, vacancy rates in probation
