IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/17892  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. J. SANDERS  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr H stands before this court for sentence following convictions on charges under Section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and under Section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The relevant period for the offending spans from late 2022 through to his arrest in January 2025.  

Ordered for trial in Crown Court No. 4 at Bristol, the matter followed an extensive pre-trial phase marked by multi-agency collaboration and procedural complexity. Multiple applications to manage disclosure, requests for expert evidence, and several plea and case management hearings punctuated the court’s timetable, which was further complicated by scheduling limitations due to staffing shortages and intermittent industrial action among court support staff in the Bristol region.  

The defendant was initially granted bail pending trial subject to stringent conditions including a 10pm to 6am curfew, electronic monitoring, and surrender of travel documents, imposed on 15 April 2025 after the first hearing in this court. Bail was twice revoked and reinstated upon variation following reports of suspected breaches, a matter subject to ongoing police review but unrelated to the present charges.  

At the outset, I extend my thanks to counsel on both sides. Mr Oliver Trent appeared for the Crown with customary thoroughness and adherence to professional standards, while Mr David Kemp represented Mr H under Legal Aid provisions. The court notes, with some regret, the regrettably frequent administrative hurdles posed by Legal Aid authorisation delays, which in this instance delayed the instruction of a forensic psychologist by several weeks and necessitated supplementary adjournments. Such delays highlight systemic challenges that undermine timely resolution of matters of public safety and justice.  

Delays were also experienced due to the necessity for enhanced security protocols, including protective markings on prosecuting documents and redactions ordered by the Security Service, under sections 6 and 7 of the Justice and Security Act 2013. These were managed appropriately, albeit at the cost of protracted scheduling.  

The legal framework within which this court operates is well charted, having been the subject of numerous authoritative decisions. Historical context is instructive: Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 criminalises preparatory conduct and has been the cornerstone of numerous major prosecutions. Notable in this regard is the Supreme Court decision in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which clarified the breadth of “terrorist purpose” to encompass a wide range of motivations extending beyond declared organisational membership.  

Equally important is the decision in R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, emphasising the necessity of proportionate but firm sentences reflecting early-stage disruption of potentially lethal conspiracies — a legal principle reaffirmed in R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines on terrorism offences, revised in 2023, require courts to consider factors including the defendant’s level of sophistication, the specificity of plans, and proximity to execution. These guide the differentiation of culpability across a spectrum of conduct.  

The facts of the case are as follows:  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

The multi-disciplinary investigation leading to Mr H’s arrest was robust and exhaustive. Led by Counter Terrorism Policing South West, it engaged local constabulary forces, the National Crime Agency, and digital forensic units. The use of advanced data analytic tools, including the deployment of artificial intelligence-assisted pattern recognition software, enabled investigators to parse voluminous encrypted communications. As with the innovative use of traffic metadata in urban settings detailed in R v. Camden [2019] EWCA Crim 1034, the exploitation of innocuous data points proved invaluable.  

The court acknowledges, with a measure of concern, the increasing reliance on novel investigatory methodologies in terrorism cases, including covert digital footprint tracking and signal intercept. The operational demands placed upon specialist units raise questions about resource allocation, officer welfare, and the sustainability of investigative practice in an age where encrypted communication is both ubiquitous and rapidly evolving.  

This case involved no fewer than four separate search warrants across multiple sites — a matter which, while evidentially significant, also reflects a trend toward increasingly disruptive investigative tactics. While the state must be empowered to anticipate and prevent harm, such powers require careful calibration to prevent undue infringement upon civil liberties.  

Mr H’s initial bail hearing was notable for submissions by the defence seeking to discredit the forensic validity of key electronic evidence. Those submissions referenced the case of R v. Lewis [2021] EWCA Crim 834, which underscored the importance of chain-of-custody integrity in data handling. The prosecution’s expert testimony satisfied the court that no such breach occurred here, and the digital exhibits were deemed admissible.  

The court’s observation extends regrettably to the co-defendant in this matter, Mr G., who failed to appear at trial and remains at large. The absence of Mr G. has complicated proceedings, requiring the court to consider the appropriateness of severing the charges and proceed with Mr H alone, a matter settled after extensive judicial consideration rooted in principles from R v. Williams [2017] EWCA Crim 2425.  

Several witnesses attended trial with commendable fortitude. The principal witness gave evidence in a manner described by the Victim Support Unit as “measured” and “resolute,” despite receiving indirect threats after his testimony. The victim lay identified by initials only — in accordance with section 4 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 — provided victim impact statements which the court has had due regard to in sentencing consideration.

The defendant’s digital footprint was further scrutinised to elucidate his embeddedness in online extremist subcultures. An expert report from the West Orthwood Centre for Radicalisation Studies detailed the linguistic markers of ideological commitment, drawing upon the methodology articulated in R v. Karim [2020] EWCA Crim 715, which examined coded language use in encrypted communications. The report identifies a progression from passive consumption of extremist content towards active engagement, evidenced by the curation of digital material with potential for propagandist dissemination.  

Online activities included the management of a now-deleted channel titled “IronClad Resolve,” cited in national security advisories for promoting insurgent tactics. The presence of such digital footprints underscores patterns outlined by Professor Lloyd Grimshaw in the Journal of Counterterrorism Studies, highlighting the role of digital echo chambers in reinforcing extremist narratives.

Physical evidence recovered during search warrants included components consistent with improvised explosive device (IED) manufacture. Of note was the acquisition of pressure cookers and copper tubing, items whose innocent utility is recognised but whose contextual assemblage raised suspicions in line with the guidance in R v. Chen [2018] EWCA Crim 409. The defendant’s possession of these items was supplemented by detailed notes on methodical construction, corroborated by handwritten schematics.  

In submissions, the defence sought to characterize these artefacts as components of a commercial plumbing hobby. This court, however, considers such an explanation unpersuasive in light of the totality of evidence and the patterns of acquisition documented by specialist investigators.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

It is important to note that the defendant’s residential history includes a period of stable tenancy at the Weirbrook Estate, where he engaged in local volunteer schemes. Letters from the Eastwood Community Trust commend his gardening and maintenance contributions during lockdown periods. While commendable, these facts do not diminish the gravity of the charges or the objective risk posed by the conduct for which he now stands convicted.  

The court is conscious of wider societal challenges that provision for at-risk populations must address. Reports from the regional homelessness outreach service document increasing numbers of rough sleepers in the Bristol area, with attendant increases in opportunistic crime and anti-social behaviour. The intersection of mental health service underfunding and economic precarity presents a compounding contribution to community vulnerability. While these issues are not directly connected to Mr H, their contemporaneity forms an important backdrop to considerations of rehabilitation and community safety.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

In late 2023, Mr H undertook travel to Eastern Europe, ostensibly for educational purposes. Airline records show a visit to Bratislava, coinciding with a period of heightened regional tension. Intelligence reports indicate that during this time he made contact via encrypted messaging applications with individuals linked to known extremist networks. The trip’s timing coincided with a rise in local anti-government protests, contextualising the potential significance of his movements.  

Notwithstanding, the defence emphasized the defendant’s stated interest in architectural history as an innocent explanation. However, the court is bound by the evidence and the conclusions of experts who find the stated innocent purpose less probable when juxtaposed with other investigatory findings.  

It is worth recording that this case produced over 630 discrete exhibit items, necessitating careful editorial and security-based vetting by multiple agencies, including the Joint Security Unit and the Centre for National Legal Administration. The bulk of digital material included encrypted thumb drives, cloud-storage metadata and multiple mobile telephony artefacts.   

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial tracing by investigatory accountants revealed a complex cryptocurrency transaction network, involving multiple wallet transfers consistent with money laundering techniques outlined in R v. Fraser [2021] EWCA Crim 765. A sum of approximately £4,200 was transferred through intermediary “mixers” designed to obscure transaction origins, ultimately ending in payments to vendors known to traffic in dual-use goods that could have application in IED production.  

This finding rings alarm bells about the sophisticated attempts undertaken to obfuscate procurement trails in terrorism offences, with attendant difficulties for law enforcement in achieving timely interdiction. The court notes that while cryptocurrencies offer legitimate financial utility, their criminal exploitation necessitates vigilant regulation.  

The forensic accounting report also identifies that unrelated to the defendant but operant within the same digital infrastructure was an individual subsequently convicted for the smuggling of wholesale quantities of Class A drugs concealed within maritime freight. The presence of this collateral fact, while interesting, is unrelated to the defendant’s conduct but illustrates the complex environment in which such investigations operate.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The defendant's psychological profile was prepared by Dr Helen McGrath, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Avon and Somerset Secure Unit. Her report, dated 5 July 2025, offers a detailed examination of the defendant’s mental state, noting an absence of diagnosable mental illness but highlighting traits of rigidity in thought and a marked propensity for binary ideological reasoning. Dr McGrath’s conclusions emphasize the heightened risk that cognitive rigidity poses in perpetuating extremist beliefs absent effective intervention.  

The report also carefully considers the existing literature on ideological disengagement, noting that structured programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Programme can offer some benefit, but also acknowledging that success rates remain challenging. Of particular concern is the finding that Mr H exhibits low empathy regarding potential civilian casualties, a factor which elevates his risk profile.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Additional mitigation includes his lack of previous convictions, completion of an undergraduate degree in computer engineering at a regional university, and a series of letters from family members and community organisations expressing hope for rehabilitation. The court also notes a candid personal statement from the defendant which, while acknowledging some degree of responsibility, stops short of a full acceptance of the breadth of harm his conduct could cause.  

The court remains mindful of the pivotal role played by institutions tasked with public safety, such as the Probation Service, whose stretched capacity is well documented. Efforts to provide specialist intervention are hampered by staff shortages, with vacancy rates exceeding 15% in the South West region. The resulting strain affects supervision intensity and the ability to deliver bespoke cognitive programmes at scale.  

In addition, this case highlights the importance of continued funding and support for multi-agency structures such as the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), which in terrorism-related cases operates alongside specialist Counter Terrorism units. The court records its acknowledgement of Detective Chief Inspector Reynolds of CTPSW and Ms Sarah Ellard, MAPPA coordinator, for their coordinated approach toward risk management planning.  

Furthermore, the system-wide challenges are compounded by delays in NHS forensic mental health services where waiting times for initial assessment can extend beyond six weeks, a source of frustration for all parties.  

The court is conscious of submissions by counsel for the defence seeking a community-based disposal supported by electronic tagging and therapeutic engagement. The Crown, conversely, stresses the scale of planning and access to potentially lethal resources, advocating for a custodial sentence commensurate with the highest culpability bracket.  

Sentencing in such matters must balance the imperatives of denunciation and deterrence with rehabilitation opportunities. The primary directive remains public protection. As the Court of Appeal emphasised in R v. Godfrey [2024] EWCA Crim 1321, the importance of sentences sufficiently robust to dissuade others and incapacitate offenders who pose ongoing hazards cannot be overstated.  

The plea was entered at the earliest opportunity during the trial, allowing some mitigation for acceptance of responsibility. Nonetheless, the court is alive to jurisprudence indicating that credit for plea is not a mechanical discount but must reflect timing and sincerity, per R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440.  

In accordance with established practice, the court will direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report. The probation service is requested to assess the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, with particular attention to suitability for Parole Board oversight and engagement with high-intensity cognitive interventions targeting ideological extremism and impulse control.  

The report should include a detailed assessment of accommodation arrangements post-release, capacity to monitor internet and telecommunications use within licence conditions, and the availability of approved premises versed in supervising terrorism-related offenders. Additional consideration should be given to the suitability of polygraph conditions and the feasibility of mandated participation in community disengagement programmes accredited under SPJ-10 structured professional judgment frameworks.  

The court is not presently expressing any determination as to length or type of sentence beyond noting the severe nature of the offending before it and the attendant risk that must be managed post-custodially.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal transcript will be made available to the parties and relevant agencies.  

These are the orders of the court.
