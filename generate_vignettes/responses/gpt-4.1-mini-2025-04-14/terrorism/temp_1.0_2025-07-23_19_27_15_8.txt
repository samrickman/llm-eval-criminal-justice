IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/28944  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. C. WILLIAMSON  
Filed: 4 September 2025

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges laid under the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a), and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct charged relates to activities from late 2022 until the defendant’s arrest in January of this year.

It is appropriate at the outset to place this matter in the wider prosecutorial and judicial framework through which cases of this nature navigate. The jurisdiction exercised here is of the Crown Court as established under the Senior Courts Act 1981 and the provisions of the Terrorism Act 2006, which remains a cornerstone of the United Kingdom’s legislative response to threats of political violence and ideologically motivated harm. The court is mindful that this aligns with the broader constitutional imperative to balance robust enforcement with adherence to due process. The complex legislative history of counter-terrorism statutes can be traced back to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1974 and subsequent refinements that exhibit an evolution in both the scope of offences and the mechanisms for adjudication. Notably, cases under section 5 of the 2006 Act require careful judicial engagement, given the broad language that contemplates preparatory activity which need not reach the stage of actual overt attacks.

At the operative hearing on 12 March 2025, Mr H pleaded guilty to the charges shortly before the trial was due to commence, having earlier maintained a plea of not guilty during the initial plea and case management hearings of November 2024 and February 2025 respectively. The late nature of the plea affects sentencing considerations in accordance with principles laid down in authority including R v. Murphy [2010] EWCA Crim 2768, where the Court of Appeal stressed that credit for guilty pleas is conditioned upon the timing and motivation for the plea, and the extent to which a guilty plea spares public resources and victim distress.

The defendant’s legal representation throughout has been provided by Mr Dominic Sterling of the Legal Aid panel, whose diligent approach this court acknowledges despite administrative challenges stemming from constrained Legal Aid budgets and protracted authorisation processes. The difficulties encountered in securing prompt funding for expert report instructions—particularly commissioning psychiatric assessments—reflect an ongoing systemic issue within the provision of criminal defence services that warrants wider scrutiny beyond this case. Such challenges have occasioned minimal but regrettable impact on case progression, further confounded by scheduling constraints occasioned by judicial strikes earlier in the year, resulting in a postponement of the original sentencing date planned for June 2025.

In relation to the law concerning credit for guilty pleas, this court is guided not only by authority such as R v. Nicol [2017] EWCA Crim 1054 but also the more recent R v. Hinton [2024] EWCA Crim 2229, which reaffirms that a plea entered at a late stage, particularly on the eve of trial, attracts a significantly reduced discount. The court is also conscious of the salutary observations in R v. Gait [2023] EWCA Crim 1344 regarding the adverse impact of last-minute pleas on witness preparation and potential psychological harm to victims and their families.

Turning then to the procedural history of this matter, the defendant was first brought to the attention of authorities in early 2023 following a referral to the Regional Prevent Programme by a faith leader, prompted by concerns about radicalising material being shared in local community forums. The subsequent intervention included offers of engagement through tailored mentoring and cognitive behavioural therapy modules, predominantly devised to address grievance-based extremism. Despite repeated outreach efforts documented in the Prevent case files—comprising over twenty recorded contact attempts between February 2023 and September 2024—the defendant's participation was intermittent and non-committal at best.

The investigation leading to the defendant’s arrest was initiated under Operation COASTLINE, a coordinated multi-agency venture integrating resources from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), the National Cyber Crime Unit, and forensic digital analysts from the Home Office’s Centre for Digital Forensics Research. The investigative methodology included the prosecution’s successful application for a series of judicially authorised warrants pursuant to sections 43A and 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, focusing on electronic communications and property searches at multiple addresses linked to the defendant. The volume of digital material recovered was notable, with terabytes of encrypted data requiring painstaking decryption work, a process complicated by the use of Virtual Private Networks and steganography techniques embedded in multimedia files.

In examining the background of the defendant, Mr H is a 30-year-old man with no previous criminal record. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science awarded by a reputable university in Bristol, where his tutors described him as quiet, mathematically adept, but socially reserved. Employment history reflects a period of stable work within the IT sector, followed by a sudden and unexplained resignation in mid-2022. Character references submitted on his behalf by neighbours, local youth mentors, and family members highlight a range of commendable personal qualities, including volunteer work with a library literacy programme and participation in community sports coaching. These biographical details offer insight into the complexity of the defendant’s psychological and social milieu.

It is necessary for the court to mention that a sentencing hearing in 2019 for an unrelated offence of possession of a bladed article in a public place involving a third party known to the defendant was brought to the court’s attention by prosecution. That offence was committed by an individual who shared accommodation with Mr H at the time but. having been tried separately, bears no evidentiary link to the conduct for which Mr H stands convicted today. Such details, while recorded for thoroughness, do not inform the culpability or sentencing considerations here.

The appeal of a paternal aunt, Mrs Lynette Hammond, was submitted in mitigation, emphasising the defendant’s network of familial support and expressing hope for rehabilitation prior to any custodial term. Correspondence from local charities, including the Bristol Refugee and Migrant Service, praised the defendant’s previously expressed interest in community cohesion projects. The court notes these pleadings with appreciation but must weigh them against the gravity of the offence.

A report commissioned from Dr Richard Halvorsen, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was received on 15 July 2025 following further delay occasioned by the defendant’s intermittent engagement with assessment sessions. Dr Halvorsen’s report outlines that whilst there is no formal diagnosis of major mental illness, the defendant exhibits traits consistent with anxiety and moderate depression. The report importantly warns of a tendency towards “black and white” thinking patterns and a predisposition to consume radical narratives as a maladaptive coping strategy for perceived social alienation. The risk assessment categorises Mr H as presenting a medium to high risk of serious harm should release occur absent intensive intervention and supervision.

The coordination among agencies in this serious case has been exemplary, with notable contributions from the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 panel. The MAPPA protocol—bringing together Probation, Police, Social Care, and Health representatives—engaged proactively early during pre-charge bail, enabling early risk assessments and safeguarding plans pending proceedings. A representative from Probation, Ms Fiona Conway, has been actively involved and provided a detailed pre-sentence report, recognising both the challenges posed by the defendant and the efforts underway to develop robust risk management strategies.

The court must devote some attention to the defendant’s online activity, which forms a core element of the prosecution’s case. Social media analysis, undertaken by forensic experts, revealed an evolution in the defendant’s postings and digital associations: beginning with innocuous political commentary before progressing towards arcs of ideological extremism referencing both international and domestic symbolic events. Several forums frequented by Mr H have since been proscribed or taken offline by coordinated law enforcement action. That progression is neither accidental nor isolated but corresponds with known recruitment patterns documented in academic and intelligence literature.

The recovered digital archives encompassing messages, manifestos, and instructional manuals underscore the defendant’s active engagement with extremist materials. An encrypted container labelled “Forge Files” was of particular note, containing documents on improvised explosive devices, chemical precursors, and target reconnaissance. Expert testimony aligned these materials with guidance distributed by a known extremist group banned under UK prohibition orders. Defence submissions sought to characterise the defendant’s possession of these items as theoretical curiosity, akin to researching chemistry or physics, but the court rejects this analogy in favour of the inescapable inference of preparatory conduct.

The welfare implications of internet-based extremism have come under public scrutiny, and this case typifies the challenges faced by agencies attempting to balance the protection of fundamental freedoms with prevention of harm. As Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services noted in their 2023 report, digital radicalisation presents a particularly difficult domain for intervention, with the scale and anonymity of the internet allowing dissemination of dangerous content and exploitation of vulnerable individuals.

It is perhaps relevant to note that within the defendant’s accommodation was found an unregistered air rifle. The possession of such an article, while unlawful under the Firearms Act 1968 in certain circumstances, was not charged here and, while concerning, this fact is given minimal weight relative to the principal offences.

Drawing on the array of evidence, a registration of intent and capability emerges. The procurement of precursor materials, encrypted conversations relating to logistics, and movements tracked through multiple surveillance methods paint a comprehensive picture of active planning. The defendant’s cellular device analysis revealed contacts with third parties later subject to unrelated prosecution for firearms offences; while association alone is insufficient for conviction, it highlights the networked nature of contemporary extremist activity.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Observations on the procedural history of the case reveal several delays due to logistical constraints affecting witness availability and disclosure. The length of the investigation parallels the nationwide pattern of extended inquiry in terrorism-related cases, noted in the Sentencing Council’s thematic review of 2024, which highlighted a median investigatory duration exceeding 18 months before charge in cases involving encrypted devices and complex digital forensic recovery.

The Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division deserves formal recognition for its thorough dissection of the voluminous material and careful balancing of evidential sufficiency against national security imperatives. Their submissions drew upon established principles such as those in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 concerning the interpretation of terrorist purposes, and the court is grateful for their professionalism in this difficult area.

Among the wider criminal justice background, it may be observed that a co-defendant implicated in concurrent charges related to an alleged firearms importation conspiracy remains subject to ongoing trial elsewhere. The case of that individual is distinct, with no evidential overlap sufficient to affect Mr H’s proceedings. Such distinction underscores the necessity of individualised facts in assessments of guilt and culpability.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

The court acknowledges the defendant was the subject of surveillance on two separate occasions involving visits to locations associated with historical commemorations of previous terrorist acts, which were used by prosecutors to infer ideological reinforcement. Defence counsel suggested that these could be explained by interests in local history and memorial culture. The court accepts that human actions often hold multiple meanings but finds the context and pattern compelling.

Complimentary mention is made of the contributions made by mental health practitioners supporting the defendant whilst in custody. Despite the pressures on NHS forensic psychiatric beds nationally—with waiting times for assessments extending dangerously—Dr Halvorsen and his clinical team maintained regular contact and provided timely updates to the court, highlighting the dedication of healthcare professionals operating in an environment constrained by demand exceeding capacity.

The case factors affirm the enduring strain on public protection systems, with police forces nation-wide reporting a 14% annual increase in non-violent extremism referrals, taxing finite resources and necessitating prioritisation strategies that sometimes delay immediate response to lower-risk cases.

The impact of radical material on isolated individuals is documented extensively in government white papers such as the 2022 Counter-Extremism Strategy Review. This case exemplifies the trajectory the strategy seeks to prevent through coordinated prevention frameworks, inter-agency cooperation, and community partnership.

Relevant financial intelligence disclosed during proceedings included a cryptocurrency transaction of just over £4,000 sent from a wallet linked to Mr H to an online marketplace known for unregulated dual-use goods. The growing exploitation of blockchain technology for illicit purposes is a matter of grave concern to law enforcement, as the emergent anonymous, decentralised financial systems impair traditional control mechanisms. The court notes ongoing legislative proposals to enhance tracing and accountability but remains aware of the technological arms race this entails.

It must be said that the administrative burden of cases of this nature, with extensive schedules of sensitive exhibits, requires considerable resource from all agencies involved—legal teams, disclosure officers, security-cleared staff, and court administrators alike. The number of items for review aggregates to over 900, with classified materials redacted to protect ongoing intelligence capability.

The court appreciates the courtesy extended by both prosecution and defence counsel during a particularly protracted disclosure exercise, which proceeded without adversarial delay despite the technical complexity and schedule pressures.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

In terms of the defendant’s personal history, Mr H has family ties to the local Bristol area spanning multiple generations. While familial links sometimes provide mitigating context, the court is bound by principle to assess conduct on its intrinsic seriousness, independent of social mapping. A letter from the defendant’s father, Mr Leonard H, lays out the family’s shock and dismay at his actions, while expressing hope for rehabilitation and eventual reintegration.

A noteworthy aspect of the reports received is the probity and clarity with which probation officers have articulated the challenges of supervising individuals with high-risk extremist ideation. The Probation Service continues to face staffing shortages and intense workload pressures, necessitating prioritisation and risk-based case management. Feedback from frontline practitioners notes difficulty in accessing timely mental health input, a situation repeated nationally due to NHS capacity limitations.

The court further recognises the logistical achievement in arranging interpreter services for the defendant’s interviews, given that English is not his first language, and the intricate coordination required with specialist linguistic experts trained in sociolects associated with radicalised communities. Such considerations, while ancillary to the verdict, underscore the procedural difficulties endemic to terrorism cases.

Dr Amelia Cartwright, consultant forensic psychologist instructed on behalf of the defence, provides a nuanced evaluation, describing Mr H as suffering from entrenched ideological commitment with some capacity for reflexive learning, though not presently demonstrating sufficient motivation for disengagement. She advocates for participation in a structured deradicalisation and cognitive restructuring programme, acknowledging that such interventions suffer from variable success rates internationally and require considerable resources.

The court takes note of proposals for monitoring post-release employing electronic tagging, supervised accommodation in specialised hostels with limited internet access, and ongoing psychological assessment conducted by expert clinicians accredited in Structured Professional Judgement tools. The Multi-Agency Risk Management Panel has recommended such layered approaches as necessary to mitigate risk to the public.

The principles governing sentencing for terrorist offences are clear. They are delineated in the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Guidelines, which impose weighty emphasis on offence seriousness, offender culpability, and the primacy of public protection and deterrence. With reference to R v. Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 411, the court affirms that those who prepare indiscriminate attacks, regardless of whether disruption occurs prior to realisation of harm, warrant custodial sentences reflecting the potential for death or serious injury. Importantly, the court considers the message sent to not only the offender but the wider community observing the enforcement of law against acts of ideological violence.

Mr H’s previous good character, professional qualifications, and family support, alongside his eventual guilty plea, offer limited mitigation only, particularly in light of the late entry of that plea. Credit will accordingly be given to a modest degree consistent with the authorities cited.

In light of all the foregoing matters, this court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The probation service is requested to consider detailed recommendations covering the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence, the availability of High-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Interventions tailored to ideological offending, and the practicality of imposing electronic monitoring alongside strict licence conditions. The report should also explore opportunities for community rehabilitation alongside continued psychological treatment under Secure Hospital Transfer Orders if clinically warranted.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 4 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for indexing and enforcement.

These are the orders of the court.
