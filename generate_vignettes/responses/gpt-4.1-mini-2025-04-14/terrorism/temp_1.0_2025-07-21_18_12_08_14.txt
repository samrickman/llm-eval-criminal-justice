IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/14792  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. THORNHILL  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H stands before this court for sentence following convictions on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for purposes connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending period under scrutiny extends from July 2023 until the date of the defendant’s arrest, 12 January 2025.

The indictment before the court summarises gravely serious allegations, and it deserves noting that proceedings of this nature sit at the apex of the criminal justice hierarchy, reflecting the particular severity that terrorism offences command. The Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter-Terrorism Division ably conducted the prosecution on behalf of the Crown. I express thanks to Ms Sarah Hulse, prosecuting, and Mr Daniel Pryce, appearing on behalf of the defendant under a Legal Aid representation order.  

To place the present case within its procedural context, the defendant was initially arrested shortly after 0500 hours on 12 January 2025, when officers of Counter Terrorism Policing South West executed simultaneous search warrants at his residence and two business premises in the Harbourside district of Bristol. These warrants, authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, followed an extended period of surveillance and investigation triggered by intelligence from the Security Service indicating encrypted communications with known groups proscribed for terrorist activity. At the time of arrest, a substantial array of electronic devices and documentation related to explosives manufacture and dissemination of extremist propaganda was seized.

It must be observed that the defendant’s arrest marked the culmination of approximately eighteen months of meticulously coordinated activity. This included deployment of undercover officers, use of covert human intelligence sources, electronic device exploitation by Digital Forensics units within the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC), and international cooperation with Europol’s European Counter Terrorism Centre. It is worth underscoring the multi-jurisdictional complexities that such investigations entail — from securing mutual legal assistance treaties for evidence gathering, to navigating classification constraints around intelligence products.  

In a recent panel, Scholarly Comment on Evidence Law, volume 42, noted that modern terrorism prosecutions exemplify the intricate balancing act courts must perform between safeguarding national security and ensuring procedural fairness, citing R v. Gove [2019] EWCA Crim 726. Contemporaneously, statutory provisions within the Justice and Security Act 2013 provide mechanisms for closed material procedure, which were in part engaged during the pre-trial process in this case.

The court notes, with some regret, the protracted delays occasioned by the need to properly vet extensive digital disclosures for sensitive information. Over 1,150 disclosure items were produced, spanning 3.2 terabytes of data, including encrypted archives and intercepted communications with foreign entities. The associated volume inevitably placed strain on the operations of the National Crime Agency’s Disclosure Unit, which, recently the subject of a Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee inquiry, operates within significant resource constraints.

Additionally, legal aid funding parameters imposed appear demonstrably inadequate for a case of this technical complexity. Mr Pryce made multiple formal representations to the Legal Aid Agency in respect of expert digital forensics assistance, only to face prolonged administrative hold-ups. The court reiterates its longstanding concerns regarding access to adequate and timely legal representation in terrorism cases, as reflected in the recent judgment of R (on the application of Legal Aid Practitioners Group) v. Lord Chancellor [2024] EWHC 3892 (Admin).  

The defendant’s initial plea was not guilty at the arraignment hearing on 15 February 2025. Following the commencement of the trial on 21 June 2025 and after exhaustive evidence was presented over a three-week hearing, the defendant entered guilty pleas on the second day of the summing-up, 9 July 2025. Notwithstanding the late admission, the court has carefully considered the mitigating value, mindful of the authorities delineating credit for guilty pleas, including R v. Hadley [2023] EWCA Crim 1567 and R v. Tarleton [2022] EWCA Crim 1968.

The court is aware of the well-known and oft-quoted principle from R v. Onsongo [2017] EWCA Crim 44 that “credit for a guilty plea serves to encourage early acceptance of criminal responsibility and thereby conserves judicial resources and spares victims and witnesses the ordeal of trial.” A plea entered late, particularly post full exposition of the prosecution case, attracts markedly reduced credit.

Beyond the procedural tests, the court received a pre-sentence report prepared by the Bristol Probation Service with input from the Community Counter Terrorism Integrated Unit. The authored report was a model of clarity, though marked by an evident reticence to endorse optimism regarding engagement and rehabilitation prospects absent intensive interventions. Professor Fiona Mills, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided a detailed clinical opinion appended to the report, concluding that the defendant exhibits no diagnosable mental disorder but demonstrates pronounced ideological commitment combined with identified personality traits consistent with high risk of extremist recidivism.

The background to Mr H includes a complex interplay of educational achievement and social alienation. He holds an upper-second-class honours degree in computer science from a reputable university, a fact attested to by a supporting letter from an academic mentor who remarked upon his “keen intellect and methodical disposition.” Nevertheless, correspondence submitted by the defendant's younger cousin underscores significant family discord over the last five years, particularly arising from his withdrawal into online subcultures fostering grievance narratives.

The court accepts that the defendant’s involvement transpired against a digital milieu that increasingly enables remote, encrypted, and obfuscated operational planning by extremist groups, as observed in the comprehensive report published by the Centre for Security Studies, “Encrypted Communications and National Security” (2024). The reliance on commercially available tools to safeguard communications, while providing defendants with a cloak of plausible deniability, strains conventional forensic approaches.

The investigation also revealed ancillary artefacts: evidence of a separate burglary at a neighbouring nursing home, committed allegedly by an unrelated third party using tools and materials functionally unrelated to Mr H’s enterprise. That incident prompted local media coverage but is plainly unconnected to the defendant’s activities.

The court records the receipt of three letters from local community organisations—The Bristol Riverside Clean-Up Collective, The Clifton Book Trust, and the Harbourside Youth Mentoring Project—which collectively commend the defendant’s sporadic volunteering, although none contend
