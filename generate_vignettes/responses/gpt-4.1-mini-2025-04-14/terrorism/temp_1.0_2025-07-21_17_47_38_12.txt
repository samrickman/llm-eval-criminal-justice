IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29861  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. A. R. CAVENDISH  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr H stands before this court for sentence following his conviction on charges of preparing acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57(1) of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct occurred over the period from September 2022 until his arrest in April 2025.  

The defendant was apprehended at approximately 04:45 hours on 12 April 2025, at his residence in Bedminster, Bristol, following the culmination of Operation Silver Larch. This multi-agency investigation involved Counter Terrorism Policing South West, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Security Service, with warrant authorisation granted under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The searches yielded multiple electronic devices, encrypted storage media, and chemical precursors.

Investigation into Mr H’s activities required lengthy analysis by digital forensic experts at the South West Regional Forensic Unit. The largely encrypted nature of the materials recovered necessitated specialist decryption efforts extending over several months, compounded by the defendant’s reliance on sophisticated anonymisation techniques including Tor routing and cryptocurrency mixing services. These technical complexities continually strained forensic resources, as such detailed examination remains unavoidably labour-intensive and time-consuming.  

Remand proceedings were conducted on 19 April 2025 before District Judge Lenton, who, noting the risks posed by the defendant’s conduct and the availability of electronic monitoring infrastructure, refused bail on the basis of public safety considerations. This decision was subsequently endorsed by the Crown Court at the plea and directions hearing on 10 June 2025.  

The court wishes to note that Mr H’s case has not been insulated from the well-documented delays affecting the Criminal Justice system at present. Listing difficulties, exacerbated by recent industrial action affecting court staff and legal professionals, have imperilled timely progression. Indeed, the listing for a trial initially fixed for late July was vacated owing to a late defence application for further disclosure, highlighting the ongoing friction between case readiness and procedural fairness. It must be acknowledged, however, that these disruptions have not denied either party an adequate opportunity to prepare.  

Before proceeding further, it is right to record that Mr H was the subject of a Prevent referral made in early 2020 by a college tutor, concerned by his increasingly strident online expressions endorsing violence abroad. The subsequent Channel panel concluded there was insufficient evidence to escalate the referral. While it may be tempting to judge such decisions with the benefit of hindsight, the court accepts that such interventions operate within difficult parameters and imperfect information. The experience of Channel panels underscores the complexities faced by practitioners balancing civil liberties with early protective action.  

It is equally appropriate to acknowledge the diligent efforts of the Westborough Counter-Terrorism Unit. Despite chronic understaffing—partly attributable to recruitment challenges in forensic linguistics and digital analysis—the officers and analysts involved displayed exemplary professionalism throughout protracted enquiry stages. The collaborative spirit manifested between police, crown prosecutors, and external experts was notable, in stark contrast to some historical inter-agency frictions. The court is mindful that effective coordination in counter-terrorism investigations remains a critical but often precarious achievement.  

The defence team, led by Mr Julian Hatfield of Hatfield & Co Solicitors, has advanced extensive pre-sentence materials for this court’s consideration, including a psychological report from Dr Alice Moreau, clinical forensic psychiatrist, and a personal statement from the defendant, supplemented by character references from neighbours and a volunteer mentor affiliated with the Bristol Youth Engagement Initiative. These materials have been reviewed with care and weight accorded to their contents as appropriate.  

The timeliness of the defendant's guilty plea merits comment. Mr H elected to enter his pleas at arraignment on 10 July 2025, having previously maintained a plea of not guilty. The doctrine governing sentencing credit for guilty pleas is well established. The Crown is entitled to appropriate mitigation where a plea is entered at the earliest reasonable juncture. The courts have, however, repeatedly emphasised that credit should be less generous where pleas come after protracted pre-trial proceedings, extensive disclosure, and significant preparatory work. This position is articulated in R v. Hadley [2024] EWCA Crim 908, which observed that “a late plea, made only when conviction is inevitable, does not reflect the same degree of remorse as an early admission.” The circumstances of Mr H’s plea cannot be divorced from this prevailing jurisprudence.  

The court further draws attention to R v. Lonsdale [2023] EWCA Crim 2312, involving a defendant convicted of charges relating to possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. Despite overwhelming evidence, the defendant delayed pleading guilty until the commencement of trial, only then conceding liability in the face of a prepared Crown case. The Court of Appeal reduced the applicable discount to one-tenth, highlighting the cost and trauma engendered by such tactical delays. Although the facts of that case concern an entirely different context, the principle concerning credit for pleas remains germane.  

The reminders afforded by these precedents bear particular relevance here, not least because terrorism-related offences typically engage public safety concerns of the highest order. The court must therefore ensure that any reductions accorded for plea are carefully calibrated so as neither to diminish deterrence nor to undermine community confidence in the justice system.

The evidence disclosed revealed Mr H’s online activities spanning social media platforms and encrypted chat applications, including the creation and distribution of propaganda advocating violent jihadist ideology. Linguistic experts testified on the distinctive terminology used, corresponding with material associated with a proscribed organisation. The defendant maintained throughout that his actions were purely theoretical or satirical, an argument unpersuasive both to the jury and, ultimately, to this court.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Recovered data showed extensive communications featuring technical discussions about explosive device fabrication, interspersed with references to historical attacks. Defence submissions suggested that portions of this material were downloaded incidentally or out of academic interest; however, given the surrounding context, the court is obliged to view these findings as more than passive curiosity.  

It is helpful, perhaps, to consider some of the less contentious aspects of Mr H’s background to provide balance and completeness in approaching sentence. Mr H was born in Bristol in 1996, attended local state schools, and obtained an honours degree in electronic engineering from Bristol University in 2017. While such background features are no mitigation of offending herein, they do provide texture and assist the court and probation service in formulating a sentencing approach consistent with rehabilitation and public protection.  

It was disclosed that Mr H had no previous convictions for any offence, whether youth or adult, and there has been no evidence of prior involvement in violence or extremist activity before 2022. These factors, while not outweighing the gravity of the terrorism offences, weigh positively in assessing future responsiveness to intervention.  

The court is cognizant of the pressures faced by local probation services managing cases involving complex ideological risk. At present, the Bristol Probation Trust is grappling with a significant backlog attributable to staffing turnover and increased caseloads. The difficulties inherent in coordinating supervision for those convicted of terrorism offences are exacerbated by the necessity for specialist training, security vetting of supervising officers, and multi-agency liaison surrounding restrictions and conditions designed to mitigate risk. The congestion in the system is regrettable, and the court urges all involved to maintain the necessary professional rigour despite these constraints.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Despite the defendant’s cooperation since arrest, compliance with investigation demands, and content production for assessment, the forensic psychologists have noted significant ideological rigidity characterised by ‘black-and-white’ cognitive patterns and an absence of genuine remorse. Dr Moreau’s report, prepared after extensive interviews and psychometric testing, does not identify formal mental illness but does caution that Mr H’s fixity of beliefs and social isolation pose an ongoing risk without structured psychological intervention.  

The court notes, for balance, that Mr H has engaged intermittently with the counter-extremism programme offered by the Bristol Prevent Hub. However, the evidence indicates a lack of meaningful sustained engagement, repeatedly declining offers for mentoring and cognitive behavioural work designed to build empathy and tolerance. The court is conscious of the demonstrated difficulty in achieving deradicalisation but must temper hopefulness with realism.  

It bears mention that multi-agency collaboration, typified by the MAPPA Category 3 arrangements, remains central to any strategy aiming to mitigate risk in such cases. However, the court is aware that protective arrangements, though theoretically comprehensive, are subject to the vicissitudes of resource limitations and competing priorities. Frontline officers and social workers report increasingly heavy caseloads, especially in urban areas experiencing social deprivation, compounding challenges of consistent monitoring and enforcement.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Turning to an assessment of the defendant’s activities beyond the immediate charges, it was revealed during the trial preparation phase that Mr H undertook travel to the Netherlands in November 2023. He attended a conference purportedly on technological innovation in logistics, but evidence was adduced indicating possible contact with individuals linked to foreign extremist circles. Defence mitigation framed this as a legitimate business journey, though the court treats the totality of the evidence as placing the defendant’s motivations under serious question.  

The court is mindful, nevertheless, that Easton v Roberts [2019] EWCA Crim 1596, cautions against conflating travel per se with illicit intent absent clear corroboration. The balancing act between protecting rights to freedom of movement and security imperatives remains complex and instructive.  

The defendant’s personal circumstances also include a history of involvement with local environmental activism groups, where Mr H once volunteered in river clean-up operations. While commendable, the court emphasises that such activities bear no weight in negating the considerations raised by his subsequent offending.  

In addition, the court notes for completeness that Mr H’s younger brother faces unrelated proceedings for benefit fraud in the nearby magistrates' court. This fact is irrelevant to the defendant’s conduct and must not influence sentencing. It is mentioned solely in the interest of factual completeness and transparency.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial investigations uncovered cryptocurrency payments totalling approximately £3,400 sent from an account traced to Mr H to a vendor specialising in dual-use chemical supplies. The payments emphasized the defendant’s aptitude for utilising digital currencies to evade conventional financial oversight. The court agrees with the Crown’s submission that such methods underscore the increasing need for cyber-capable policing and regulatory vigilance, echoing sentiments expressed by the Law Commission in its recent consultation on virtual asset regulation.  

The court observes, incidentally, that the misuse of cryptocurrencies has become an issue also prevalent in organised retail crime rings, where anonymous payments fund bulk pilfering activities. Evidence presented in R v. Belford [2024] EWCA Crim 1202 demonstrates the use of Bitcoin mixers to facilitate fencing operations for stolen electronics and drugs, a phenomenon increasingly problematic for law enforcement.  

During covert observation, surveillance described the defendant engaging in short visits to the Avon River embankment after dusk on 23 and 30 October 2024. Analysts spent hundreds of hours cross-referencing sensor data with CCTV footage and mobile geolocation, attesting to the resource-intensiveness of modern counter-terrorism surveillance even in cases involving limited-duration activity.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The defendant is a 29-year-old male of British nationality, educated to degree level. His employment history includes two years as an electronics technician for a telecommunications provider, from which he resigned amid a disciplinary inquiry relating to inappropriate website access during work hours. Letters from former managers describe him as “quiet” and “detail-oriented” but also “socially withdrawn.” This profile may help to inform probation assessments addressing integration and risk management.  

Notwithstanding the extensiveness of the preparatory materials for sentence, the court remains tasked with ensuring an outcome reflective of public protection, denunciation, and encouragement of desistance. The defendant’s volunteer efforts with a local youth mentorship scheme—although noted with approval—do not diminish the seriousness of the offences herein. As per the principles highlighted in R v. Walton [2019] EWCA Crim 1123, commendable past conduct is not a licence to disregard the broader pattern of offending behaviour.  

Professor Daniel Keane, forensic psychologist instructed on behalf of the defence, assessed Mr H as demonstrating high intellectual functioning but noted a “predilection for categorical thinking and impaired capacity for emotional perspective-taking.” These traits place the defendant at considerable risk of re-engagement with extremist ideology absent sustained intervention, in accordance with the Structured Professional Judgement frameworks.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

In summary, this was a carefully orchestrated and coherent enterprise, exhibiting high culpability and a clear intention to facilitate acts likely to cause serious indiscriminate harm. While the defendant pleaded guilty at arraignment, the delay cannot be overlooked, nor the missed opportunities to engage earnestly with preventative services. Mitigation is limited to absence of previous convictions and some educational achievements, neither of which neutralise the substantial risk posed.  

In determining sentence, the court will await the preparation of a thorough pre-sentence report. The probation service is requested to address, inter alia, therapeutic engagement possibilities, potential for release on licence with stringent controls, suitability for Extended Determinate Sentence provisions, and the feasibility of conditions including electronic monitoring and exclusion zones. Consideration should be given to mental health input with expertise in radicalisation, alongside structured community support to facilitate desistance.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be dispatched to the relevant authorities for registration.  

These are the orders of the court.
