IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/24479  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge A. K. MERRIWELL  
Filed: 18 August 2025  
  
Mr H appears before this court for sentencing in respect of offences contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The relevant period of offending conduct extends from July 2023 until the defendant’s arrest in January 2025.  
  
This court recalls that Mr H was apprehended at 07:45 hours on 29 January 2025, following execution of search warrants under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at a flat located on Marwood Road, Eastville. The warrants followed extensive multi-agency intelligence gathering by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), supported by the National Crime Agency’s Digital Investigations Unit. The intervention followed analysis of encrypted communications linked to the defendant’s online persona as well as the seizure of devices bearing traces of illicit software designed to conceal network activity. At the time of arrest, Mr H was found in possession of a high-specification laptop, three encrypted external hard drives, and assorted electronically coded manuals.

The investigative operation which culminated in the arrest was of considerable duration and complexity. Over a period exceeding six months, the defendant was under surveillance, including covert observation of his electronic footprint. The deployment of sophisticated forensic capabilities was necessary to bypass advanced encryption, rendering initial investigatory stages protracted. This case thereby exemplifies the increasingly resource-intensive nature of current counter-terrorism policing. The efforts extended beyond conventional detectives to specialists in cybercrime and data analytics, who laboured under the strain of growing demand for their expertise across numerous concurrent operations. Indeed, the forensic laboratory responsible reported backlogs extending several months owing to a national shortfall in skilled personnel. Consideration of these logistical burdens is essential in appreciating the context in which Mr H was ultimately identified and taken into custody.  
  
Procedurally, the case has traversed the customary stages of listing, including a plea and trial preparation hearing on 4 June 2025, delayed from an initial listing in April owing to a Defence application for extended disclosure pursuant to Criminal Procedure Rules 3.4(5). That application resulted in an adjournment to accommodate consideration of voluminous material, including intercepted electronic communications, some subject to Public Interest Immunity claims by the Security Service. The complexity inherent in balancing open justice requirements with protection of sensitive intelligence sources cannot be overstated. Similar challenges have been noted in cases such as R v. Mohammed [2018] EWCA Crim 512, where disclosure obliged the court to navigate competing demands for transparency and confidentiality. In the current case, the issue was managed by the appointment of a special advocate pursuant to the Justice and Security Act 2013, a practice that, while salutary, inevitably prolongs judicial timetables.  
  
On the topic of judicial resources, it is instructive to remark that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of the Defence funding applications has, regrettably, been less than exemplary. Initial requests for funding to instruct a specialist digital forensics expert were met with protracted delays, compounded by bureaucratic ambiguities regarding appropriate tariff codes. Defence counsel, Mr Thomas Wyles, has lodged formal complaints concerning this impasse, highlighting the systemic difficulty faced by practitioners in obtaining timely approvals in terrorism matters. Such administrative障碍s serve neither justice nor the public interest; they increase the risk of trial delay and impede defendants’ ability to mount effective challenges. It is hoped that improvements in case handling will be forthcoming, consistent with Ministry of Justice commitments to modernise legal aid processes in high-complexity cases.  
  
Turning to ancillary matters, the court acknowledges receipt of letters of support from local organisations including the Eastville Islamic Cultural Centre and the Southdown Community Alliance. These communications, while genuine in their tone and content, do not attempt to diminish the gravity of the offences. Rather, they place the defendant’s conduct within the wider social context, noting his previous contributions to interfaith outreach events and community cleanliness campaigns. The contrast between these engagements and the allegations faced is stark and underlines the paradoxical nature of ideologically-motivated crime. The court also notes a reference submitted by the Bristol Resettlement Network expressing concern about the pressures on accommodation for offenders with ideological risk factors, reflecting systemic strains across the probation and housing sectors.  
  
The volume of evidential material involved in this case is illustrative of modern counter-terrorism prosecution. The Crown served over 600 exhibits prior to trial, including close to 1.2 terabytes of data recovered from Mr H’s devices. The trial generated several closed sessions under section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013 regarding particularly sensitive materials. Such arrangements underscore the tension between procedural fairness and national security exigencies, a tension regularly examined in appellate decisions such as R v. AB and CD [2014] EWCA Crim 354. These considerations necessarily influence the management and disclosure timetable, with attendant impact on all parties.  
  
In the course of litigation, the Defence obtained a psychiatric assessment from Dr Eleanor Pratchett, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, attached to the Avon and Somerset NHS Forensic Mental Health Service. Her detailed report, dated 15 July 2025, concluded that Mr H shows no evidence of psychotic disorder, personality disorder, or any other formal mental illness. However, she notes a pattern of rigid ideological beliefs, expressed in absolutist terms and underpinned by a sense of personal grievance. The presentation is framed as an ideological fixation without diagnosable psychiatric pathology, but nonetheless flags a significant risk of re-engagement with extremist networks absent appropriate intervention. She recommends close supervision including cognitive behavioural therapy focusing on ideological disengagement. This assessment is consistent with published observations in similar cases such as R v. Khan [2022] EWCA Crim 2087, which emphasised the limited mitigating impact of ideology itself absent clinical illness.

Mr H’s activities during the relevant period included the production and distribution of online material bearing hallmarks of proscribed propaganda. Linguistic experts instructed by the prosecution identified patterns of coded phraseology that map closely onto communications from banned organisations. Intriguingly, this digital footprint overlapped with peers targeted in simultaneous investigations by CTPSW and Security Service analysts. The proliferation of encrypted communications and use of darknet marketplaces added layers of complexity to the operation. The prosecution’s narrative was that Mr H sought to procure equipment usable in the manufacture of explosive devices and engaged in preparatory conduct indicative of imminent intent.  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  
  
During examination of the defendant's electronic devices, investigators uncovered multiple files stored within an encrypted container named “Library.” Amongst the contents were detailed schematics for homemade detonators, alongside manuals on chemical synthesis, some truncated by apparent file corruption. While the Defence posited an innocent interest in chemistry and explosives as industrial hazards, the court found, in light of contextual evidence, that these materials formed part of a concerted attempt to acquire and refine components for destructive use.  
  
Subsequent inquiries uncovered photographs from a social media account long dormant and accessed only sparingly in the preceding months. These showed innocuous snapshots of urban architecture and botanical subjects. Defence argument suggested this represented a benign hobbyist interest. However, the prosecution persuaded the court that juxtaposition with encrypted schematics negated an innocent reading of such imagery.  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  
  
The defendant engaged sporadically with statutory Prevent programmes following early referrals based on concerns reported by a university lecturer in 2021. These engagements included attendance at Cognitive Restructuring Workshops and mentoring sessions. While the Central Prevent Coordination Unit noted intermittent participation, they ultimately concluded in reports to the court that Mr H remained “highly resistant.” The court further notes that funding constraints continue to limit the capacity of these schemes, a point recently raised in a Parliamentary report on counter-terrorism resourcing.  
  
Among the defence submissions was a character reference from the Bristol Urban Wildlife Trust, attesting to Mr H’s voluntary involvement clearing invasive species from local greenbelt land. While such contributions to environmental stewardship are commendable, the court reiterates that they do not alter culpability for serious criminal conduct. Similarly, a 2018 minor conviction for shoplifting toiletries and confectionery from a supermarket in nearby Bath—an offence for which Mr H received a conditional discharge—is not directly relevant to sentencing in the current matters but was disclosed during sentencing proceedings for completeness.  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  
  
In May 2024, shortly prior to the escalation of suspect conduct, Mr H travelled to Berlin ostensibly for academic conferences on mechanical engineering. Documentation recovered during the investigation reveals, however, that he spent time in an industrial suburb occasionally frequented by persons later identified as supporters of extremist cell activities. CCTV connected with the trip captured Mr H in the company of one such individual shortly before the latter was arrested attempting to transport significant quantities of precursor chemicals across the border into Belgium. The Defence contends this was coincidental, a point viewed with skepticism by the court in light of the wider evidential matrix.  
  
This case has also illustrated the burden placed upon the Criminal Justice System by procedural issues. The trial suffered multiple adjournments, partly due to the late disclosure of technical data and also owing to the unavailability of key expert witnesses due to industrial action within forensic science services. The National Forensic Service has experienced considerable disruption since early 2025 because of staffing shortages and protracted negotiations over contractual terms. This has, regrettably, lengthened timelines not only in counter-terrorism matters but across a broad swathe of criminal investigations.  
  
Within the context of financial inquiry, a digital forensic accountant uncovered a cryptocurrency transfer made by Mr H in September 2024. A value of approximately £3,000 was sent from a wallet associated with Mr H’s known online identities to an untraceable wallet linked to an international darknet vendor offering “dual-use” components. This transaction highlighted the risks posed by unregulated crypto-assets in facilitating illicit financing. The court notes increasing judicial awareness of this issue and commends recent legislative attempts to increase transparency and accountability in cryptocurrency markets.  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  
  
The police covert surveillance team compiled logs of Mr H’s activities around midnight on 12 November 2024 near the docks area of Bristol harbour. The surveillance captured him in the vicinity of a disused warehouse later found to contain materials commonly used in bomb manufacture. Analysts reported that identifying Mr H amidst poor lighting and frequent obstruction required extensive image enhancement and cross-referencing with mobile device location data. Such painstaking work, consuming dozens of analyst hours, evidences the significant disproportionality between the effort required to detect such acts and the potential for harm.  
  
Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is aged 28 years, an alumnus of a local university with a degree in mechanical engineering. Employer references describe him as “a meticulous and reserved individual,” but one who ceased employment abruptly and without full explanation in early 2023 following a workplace dispute over security clearance procedures. While these details offer some insight into his social trajectory, they neither excuse nor diminish the severity of his offending conduct.  
  
Among mitigation submissions is a letter from Mr H’s sister, Ms Fariha H., indicating familial distress and appealing for leniency, stressing a history of mental health challenges triggered by bereavement and social isolation. The court is mindful of the difficulties faced by families of offenders but must balance private anguish against public safety considerations.  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  
  
The defendant’s current psychological evaluation was supplemented by a detailed report from Professor Mandira Singh, a forensic psychologist, who identifies a high degree of cognitive inflexibility and ideological absolutism. While she found no diagnosable mental disorder, Professor Singh highlights the substantial continuing risk posed by Mr H, particularly in light of his engagement with online platforms that amplify radical thought. The report suggests intensive supervised intervention and the potential utility of the Structured Professional Judgement framework in ongoing risk management.  
  
The defendant has been offered enrolment in the Home Office-funded Radicalisation Intervention Scheme (RIS), but engagement has been intermittent and reluctant. The court notes the known attrition rates within such programmes and the ongoing challenge of securing sustained participation. Research published in the Journal of Forensic Psychology (2023) cautions against overoptimism in anticipating complete ideological disengagement through such interventions alone.  
  
The court recognises that this case encapsulates many of the tensions inherent to terrorism prosecutions in the current era: the interplay of technology and ideology, the demands of intelligence-led investigations, and the evolving contours of judicial responsibility to protect the public without undermining foundational principles of justice.  
  
The primary sentencing considerations must weigh the calculated and persistent nature of Mr H’s conduct against his lack of prior convictions. Aggravating features include the sophistication of planning evident from the encrypted procurement network and the intended indiscriminate violence inherent in the conduct. Mitigating factors, limited to educational qualifications and belated acceptance of responsibility through late guilty pleas, warrant very modest discounting. The offences fall within the higher culpability bracket under the 2023 Sentencing Council Guideline on Terrorism Offences. This Court remains guided by paramount considerations of deterrence and the imperative of public protection.  
  
The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith. This report is to address the suitability of custodial supervision regimes incorporating technology-enabled monitoring, possibilities for specialist psychological intervention, and the support capacities within Approved Premises to manage ideological risk. The probation service is further requested to consider options under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 for extended determinate sentencing where necessary, and to evaluate the feasibility of mandates for polygraph examination, restricted internet access, and controlled association conditions in the community.  
  
These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the Home Office, the National Probation Service, and relevant intelligence agencies as appropriate. Mr H is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the provisions set out in the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  
  
These are the orders of the court.
